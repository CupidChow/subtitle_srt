The designer toy master training course

10
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,550
held by the top designer toy company in the UK.

11
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,950
I heard that this company

12
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,200
will select six renowned design masters

13
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,400
from around the world

14
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,160
as instructors.

00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,890
My goodness.

16
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,080
Our company even has a place

17
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,410
in the training course.

18
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,340
This opportunity to learn from and exchange ideas with international masters

19
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,420
is very precious.

20
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,760
Our company will internally select

21
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,020
an excellent designer

22
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,180
to represent our company

23
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,910
for the three-month training.

24
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,730
Why is there an age limit?

25
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,070
Within 30 years old.

26
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,070
What?

27
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,900
I'm only 31 years old, and I'm an old man already?

28
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,960
Have experience in independent planning of designer toys

29
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,020
and can provide a design draft for the internal review.

30
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,570
Isn't this place just for me?

31
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,220
Not necessarily.

32
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,010
I'm also very qualified for the selection.

33
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,030
You only have three days.

34
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,380
You can go out and collect inspiration.

35
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,440
But within three days,

36
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,100
you must complete your own ideas independently.

37
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,230
Everyone, go for it!

38
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,100
Mr. Liu, don't worry.

39
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,520
I still have Big Data 3.0.

40
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,870
Assistant Tang.

41
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,780
Pack your things.

42
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:08,320
Leave for Africa tomorrow.

43
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,410
Mr. Liu, calm down.

44
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,120
We can't rush the results.

45
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,570
We should pay attention to the details.

46
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,160
No rush.

47
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,940
I trusted your Big Data,

48
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,420
but Tian pushed me farther and farther away.

49
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,220
She even called me a weirdo.

50
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:28,800
Mr. Liu.

51
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,600
The response of Assistant Tian when she saw you on a blind date.

52
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Did she pretend not to care at first?

53
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,340
Later,

54
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,740
in order to hide her loss and sadness inside,

55
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,070
did she get angry when you confronted her?

56
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,700
With my future career in Africa,

57
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:44,460
I can guarantee that

58
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,290
Assistant Tian was jealous.

59
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,620
Really?

60
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,770
Of course.

61
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,180
You don't have to trust me,

62
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,770
but you must trust Big Data.

63
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,520
How dare you mention that thing to me again?

64
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,760
Big data, my ass.

65
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,740
Why would I take advice

66
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,890
from a straight nerd

67
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,950
who has never been in a relationship?

68
00:03:59,170 --> 00:03:59,630
Mr. Liu.

69
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,360
I just got the news.

70
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,870
Assistant Tian is going out for field work.

71
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,570
Is she...

72
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,060
Is she avoiding me?

73
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,820
According to the "golden twenty-four hours" principle

74
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,350
of crisis communications,

75
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,910
I think you should solve the misunderstanding as soon as possible.

76
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,300
Assistant Tang,

77
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,750
check Tian's schedule immediately.

78
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:22,800
Roger.

81
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,210
Isn't this park

82
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,150
nearby?

83
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,900
How do you know I'm here?

84
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,530
Maybe we are connected.

85
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:45,690
Mr. Liu.

86
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,560
Workers need to earn money to support their families,

87
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,010
and we also need to save money for our retirement.

88
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,050
I don't have the energy to play with you.

89
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,480
If you think you're too free,

90
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,880
you can ask Assistant Tang.

91
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,960
He must have a way

92
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,210
to make you feel fulfilled.

93
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,210
I've made Assistant Tang's schedule very full today.

94
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,700
That's why I have time to accompany you.

95
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:07,990
Just now,

96
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,660
I saw you shoot the marshmallow for a long time.

97
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,990
I think you must like it.

98
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,200
This is for you.

99
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,770
I was actually shooting

100
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,810
the mythical beast behind the cotton candy stall.

101
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,100
I seem to have misunderstood you

102
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,640
and made a mistake again.

103
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,760
It's quite sweet.

104
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,090
This is my apology gift.

105
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,659
Since you've eaten it,

106
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,740
does that mean

107
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,200
our earlier misunderstanding

108
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,840
is over?

109
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,580
You want me to let it go with only one cotton candy?

110
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,780
How is that possible?

111
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:53,520
Tian.

112
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,520
One day,

113
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:58,940
M and N had a fight.

114
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,110
But M apologized.

115
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,420
Do you know why?

116
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,830
Because I'm sorry.

117
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,110
Not fun.

118
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,190
Once upon a time,

119
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,370
there was a duck.

120
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,020
He was queuing up.

121
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,610
He wanted to align with the duck in front of him so bad.

122
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,670
But no matter what,

123
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,510
he couldn't.

124
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,830
So he kept mumbling,

125
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,510
"I'm sorry."

126
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,620
"I'm sorry."

127
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,860
"I'm sorry."

128
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:33,800
Tian.

129
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:35,900
I know

130
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,960
I shouldn't goad you with that blind date.

131
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:39,640
But

132
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,510
I can promise

133
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,130
that my feelings for you are real.

134
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:44,820
I'm

135
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,700
just inexperienced.

136
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,520
And my strategy was wrong.

137
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,220
Do you want to believe me?

138
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,080
I'm here for a field trip.

139
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,290
I don't want to talk about this.

140
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,810
Then let's not talk about it today.

141
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,330
Tian, are you hungry?

142
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,930
Let me take you to eat something good.

143
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,450
You are full.

144
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,340
But I'm still hungry.

145
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:16,810
Miss Shan.

146
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,900
What a coincidence.

147
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,830
Why are you here?

148
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,080
I just went to the supermarket.

149
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,680
So I was passing by.

150
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,550
Do you want it?

151
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,260
Thank you.

152
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:29,980
But no.

153
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:31,980
Miss Shan.

154
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:32,950
Look at you.

155
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,490
You already don't have porcelain skin.

156
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,559
Look at your dark circles.

157
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,039
The foundation can't even cover them.

158
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,380
If you skip your meals

159
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,289
and get bitten by mosquitoes everywhere,

160
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,960
you will be dull and listless.

161
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,380
Won't that affect your on-camera interview?

162
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,420
What did you...

163
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,860
Insect repellent.

164
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:49,980
Take these

165
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,970
as my apology

166
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,240
for our not-so-happy first meeting.

167
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,370
You go ahead.

168
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,420
I'm leaving.

169
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,540
Good luck!

170
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,690
You!

171
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,810
You're dull and listless!

172
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,100
You are the one who can't afford your meals!

173
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,500
There is no way I'll eat the food you give me.

174
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,830
No!

175
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,220
Why shouldn't I?

176
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,920
The food is innocent.

177
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,540
I'm so angry that I can eat a cow.

178
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,770
No dieting today!

179
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,470
Miss Shan doesn't have a good first impression of me,

180
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,010
but after this time,

181
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,110
her impression of me will definitely change.

182
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,710
She has dark circles under her eyes.

183
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,470
I should send her some health care tips later.

184
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,680
What are you doing?

185
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,690
I haven't finished my painting yet.

186
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,370
We agreed

187
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,140
that I would accompany you to draw for an hour.

188
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,280
Now, an hour is up.

189
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:11,810
Fine.

190
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,350
I'm hungry.

191
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,660
Let's ask Xilai to come and join us for lunch.

192
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,320
Why do we have to eat with him?

193
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:23,830
Besides,

194
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,550
he is so busy.

195
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,010
You call him, and he will come?

196
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,500
Don't you think

197
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,290
Xilai cares about you a lot?

198
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,960
He never says no to anything you ask.

199
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,040
He has a brother complex for you.

200
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:39,880
Brainless.

201
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,990
You don't have to say this

202
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,320
just for a meal.

203
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,950
You even said that.

204
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,790
Trust me.

205
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,010
Call him if you don't believe me.

206
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:48,920
I can guarantee that

207
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,750
I'm right.

208
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:58,680
Brother.

209
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,590
What are you doing?

210
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,790
Let's have lunch together.

211
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,080
He has a brother complex?

212
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,560
No, that's impossible.

213
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,760
How come I see her every time?

214
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,500
Brother.

215
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,780
Why didn't you tell me Assistant Tian was here too?

216
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,060
Isn't it normal for her to be here?

217
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,320
You didn't say Xian was coming with you either.

218
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,310
You must be hungry.

219
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,710
Order whatever you want.

220
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,460
Assistant Tian.

221
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,560
Is this matsutake with eggplant?

222
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,510
Are you eating roasted eggplant with matsutake?

223
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,390
Yes. What?

224
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
You want some too?

225
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,470
High-end ingredients

226
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,730
must be cooked in the highest-grade way.

227
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,910
For example,

228
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,880
wild salmon in Alaska.

229
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,530
The best choice is to make sushi with them,

230
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,850
not grill them.

231
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,730
Actually,

232
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,160
people are the same.

233
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,940
People from the same world

234
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,600
can get along with each other.

235
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,770
If one

236
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,950
with different backgrounds

237
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,420
and different living habits

238
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,190
wants to fit in by force,

239
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,430
she will only look out of place.

240
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,360
Miss Wen.

241
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,600
It's not up to you to say

242
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,100
whether they fit or not.

243
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,460
You have to ask

244
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,150
whether the eggplant and matsutake want to be together.

245
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,000
Delicious.

246
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,500
They fit deciliously together.

247
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,130
The combination is so fresh

248
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:53,860
and unique.

249
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,340
I like it.

250
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,530
I think they are good together.

251
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,210
It's normal

252
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,980
that different people

253
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,900
have different tastes.

254
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,260
Xian.

255
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,260
Your birthday is coming.

256
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,210
What do you want to eat? My treat.

257
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,730
Brother Xilai.

258
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,290
In the past, on my birthday,

259
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,470
you have always sent your gifts over.

260
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,620
I am back this year.

261
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,480
So you must give it to me in person.

262
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,060
No problem. I can do that.

263
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,030
Thank you, Xilai.

264
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:39,810
Mr. Liu.

265
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:40,830
I'm home.

266
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,630
Thank you for helping me out today.

267
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,790
I'm just telling the truth.

268
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,110
Different unique combinations

269
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,410
are good together, too.

270
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:51,850
Right?

271
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,090
See you tomorrow, Mr. Liu.

272
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:07,780
Tian.

273
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,070
You haven't answered the question

274
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,410
I asked you before.

275
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,760
Do you believe that I'm sincere?

276
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,830
I do.

277
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,350
But

278
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,860
I always feel that

279
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,620
our thinking system and behavior

280
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,860
are parallel.

281
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,160
In other words,

282
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,490
it's hard for us to cross paths.

283
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,550
Do you understand?

284
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,010
You mean

285
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,700
we are not

286
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,420
on the same page.

287
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,500
I remember

288
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,660
last time you said there was a food chain

289
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,620
between us.

290
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,890
But this time,

291
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,910
you just said we are not on the same page.

292
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,970
Does that mean

293
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,070
we're closer?

294
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,720
Before I met you,

295
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,570
I thought I had a language talent.

296
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,350
But with you...

297
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,430
There are always communication barriers.

298
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,340
I'm a little confused now.

299
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,730
Give me some time

300
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,620
to think about it.

301
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,250
Think about it?

302
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,890
That means our relationship

303
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,900
is about to go through probation.

304
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,540
Tian.

305
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,310
From tomorrow on,

306
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,540
I'm going to date you in a new way.

307
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,860
I'll be on the same page with you.

308
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,370
♫It took a long time to see you again♫

309
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,540
And you promised
♫It took a long time to see you again♫

310
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:45,580
♫It took a long time to see you again♫

311
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,200
to buy a birthday gift for Xian with me.
♫It took a long time to see you again♫

312
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,660
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

313
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:54,460
♫Memories have come out of my head♫

314
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:01,810
♫A wonderful face emerges in my mind♫

315
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:08,920
♫I wish to hold you like that♫

316

♫I'll always believe that you only belong to me♫

317
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,000
Baby, don't stick your head out of the window.
♫I'll always believe that you only belong to me♫

318
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,680
♫I'll always believe that you only belong to me♫

319
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:16,670

♫We will always♫

00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,590
♫We will always♫

324
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,840
This stupid boss

325
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,950
has a cute side.

326
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:33,250
Mr. Liu.

327
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,800
It's not hard to be on the same page with Assistant Tian.

328
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,350
After all, girls in love

329
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,620
are all the same.

330
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,290
But you

331
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,990
need to change a little.

332
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,210
How?

333
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,090
Haven't you been inspired

334
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,490
by all the romantic fiction you've read?

335
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,400
I think

336
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,770
I'm more manly

337
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,520
than those male leads in books.

338
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,180
That's true.

339
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,330
But did you notice

340
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:04,260
that those meticulous and considerate men in the books

341
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,740
are more favored by women?

342
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,740
But aren't they

343
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,220
all domineering bosses?

344
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,349
The boss has to come to the ground

345
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,780
and become a man with only his wife in his eyes,

346
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,510
so they can have a happy ending.

347
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,930
Today is your first day of trail probation.

348
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,140
Maybe you can try

349
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:20,569
to change your style.

350
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:22,710
Such as?

351
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:23,650
Such as,

352
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:26,660
take care of her the same way I do for you every day.

353
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,980
You can also be the big brother next door

354
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,540
and shower her with your spring-like warmth.

355
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,330
Spring-like warmth.

356
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,000
Don't move.

357
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:54,490
I'll do it.

358
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,060
Don't move.

359
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,670
I'll do it.

360
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,160
Tian.

361
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:38,700
I'm sorry that you have to go to the mall with me early in the morning.

362
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,950
So I specially prepared soy milk for you.

363
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,060
Freshly squeezed.

364
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,120
Mr. Liu, are you okay?

365
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,070
I'm fine.

366
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,920
I think today is especially beautiful.

367
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,950
Do you feel

368
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,060
I'm approaching your page?

369
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,150
I feel uncomfortable all over.

370
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,900
Don't you feel uncomfortable?

371
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,690
I think

372
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,210
we're very awkward.

373
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,630
So, Mr. Liu,

374
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,020
just be yourself.

375
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:11,900
You don't have to change your personality

376
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,430
for us to be on the same page.

377
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,390
It's meaningless

378
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,520
and makes me very uncomfortable.

379
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
That makes sense.

380
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,890
The image of the boy next door

381
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,620
doesn't suit me at all.

382
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,570
Let's go.

383
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,120
Take this one out for me.

384
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,560
Okay.

385
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,290
This one is good.

386
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,400
It's heavy and big.

387
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,410
All girls would

388
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,170
like these kinds of flowers.

389
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,410
Mr. Liu.

390
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,060
To send a gift to a girl,

391
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,660
you have to choose what she likes,

392
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,780
not what you like.

393
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,320
There are people who don't like gold?

394
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,320
Fine, I'll listen to you.

395
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,240
This set of jewelry is lively and elegant.

396
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,310
It suits Miss Wen's "Snow Queen" style.

397
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,110
Besides,

398
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,450
there are also shining diamonds

399
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,720
that girls like.

400
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,500
These small diamonds are ordinary.

401
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,560
I have to buy something that is valuable and beautiful.

402
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,780
This one is good. The imperial jade.

403
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,390
It's very magnificent.

404
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,660
Also green enough.

405
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,030
Are you sure this color

406
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,690
fits Miss Wen's temperament?

407
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,260
This is not only valuable

408
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,660
but also unique.

409
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,320
You really have the taste

410
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,280
of a straight man.

411
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,530
No way.

412
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,390
My taste

413
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,170
is questioned?

414
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,700
The snowflake is the focus.

415
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,460
Stars surround the snowflake.

416
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
The whole design.

417
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,340
I hope we can use the story of The Little Prince.

418
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:00,940
Sir.

419
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,660
It must be very happy to be your girlfriend.

420
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,050
Girlfriend?

421
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,170
How about that golden brooch?

422
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,540
Mr. Liu,

423
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,430
you really have a bad taste.

424
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,030
Sir, you have such good taste.

425
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,900
It's our honor

426
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,810
to serve you.

427
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,370
Thank you.

428
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,070
Time is tight.

429
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,280
Please.

430
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:25,550
Don't worry.

431
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,340
We will finish it on time.

432
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,370
I'll call you then.

433
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:30,850
Thank you.

434
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:31,250
Liu...

435
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:48,040
Why does he look more and more handsome?

436
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,180
Her face is so small and delicate.

437
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,500
This was an accident.

438
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:58,820
Accident.

439
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,880
Tian, I have a great idea.

440
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,310
Come with me.

441
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,460
Happy birthday, my princess.

442
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,060
-Happy birthday. -Happy birthday.

443
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:14,660
Thank you.

444
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,500
Where is my birthday gift,

445
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,990
my dragon slayers?

446
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:32,610
Xian.

447
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,850
I designed it for you myself.

448
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,320
Exclusive custom-made.

449
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,720
The only one in the world.

450
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,500
For the one and only you.

451
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
I hope you can shine

452
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,890
like this beautiful snowflake.

453
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,630
Thank you. I like it so much.

454
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,170
It's my turn.

455
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,180
Xilai.

456
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,420
Why is your box

457
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,860
the same as Zhao's?

458
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,140
Xian, this is a surprise for you.

459
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:10,950
How come?

460
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:11,860
Zhao.

461
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,140
This is also a surprise for you.

462
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,980
It used to be one of a kind.

463
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,300
Now, it's one of a pair.

464
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,210
And look carefully.

465
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,480
There are slight differences between yours and mine.

466
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,560
There are you, me,

467
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,110
and Xian.

468
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,310
Three letters

469
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:28,950
mean our friendship

470
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,880
will be like the Golden Trinity,

471
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,440
always and forever.

472
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,670
So.

473
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,950
Don't you think my gift is more advanced?

474
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,060
Why do you have the bracelet I designed?

475
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,630
Surprise

476
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,640
needs some clever tricks.

477
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:45,010
Hello.

478
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,800
I'm the elder brother of that gentleman.

479
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,650
Our sister's birthday is coming.

480
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:50,590
I want to design

481
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,450
a surprise gift for both of them.

482
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,460
How could he do that?

483
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,750
This freak.

484
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,610
Zhao, go get the cake.

485
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,760
I want to make a wish.

486
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,500
Make a wish, my princess.

487
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,320
Xian.

488
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,160
Tell me your wish.

489
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,580
I'll grant it for you.

490
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:19,960
Xilai.

491
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,750
Any wish?

492
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,470
As long as I can.

493
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,710
I wish

494
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,480
I could be Xilai's girlfriend.

495
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,540
Are you kidding me?

496
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:39,330
Xian.

497
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,160
I always think of you as my sister.

498
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,450
Surprise!

499
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,760
I tricked you.

500
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:48,250
What do you think? I'm good at acting, right?

501
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,550
You scared me.

502
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,540
Don't joke like this again.

503
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,190
It's rude.

504
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,760
Okay, I got it, Xilai.

505
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,940
Today, it's my birthday. I'm very happy.

506
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,870
Let's get drunk.

507
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,710
Have some food before drinking.

508
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,880
It's my birthday. Leave me alone.

509
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:09,950
Xian.

510
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,890
Don't drink too much. You'll get drunk.

511
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,380
I'll drink with you.

512
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,080
Thank you for understanding me.

513
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:46,820
Xian.

514
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:48,540
Are you okay?

515
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,020
I'm fine, Xilai.

516
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,770
I'm happy today. So I want to drink more.

517
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,680
If you have work to do,

518
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,630
you can leave now.

519
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,160
Zhao can send me home later.

520
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,200
Zhao.

521
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,750
I still have something to do at the company. I have to go back first.

522
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,750
Take care of Xian.

523
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,060
Remember to send her home safely.

524
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,340
I don't need you to tell me that.

525
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:38,790
I remember

526
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,490
that Tian didn't like to be disturbed

527
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:41,990
when she was focused on work.

Since you were little,

574
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,140
you have only had eyes for him.

575
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,240
All these years,

576
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,990
I've been the one who has always been by your side.

I am the one who likes you silently.

581
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,630
Do you really like him,

582
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,640
or is it just admiration from childhood?

583
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,590
Big news!

584
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:04,850

00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,150
Big news?

586
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,200
Just now, the company intranet

587
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,380
has announced the results of the master training course competition.

588
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,190
So soon?

What's the result? Tell me.

00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,250
Let me have some water.

591

Aren't you afraid of choking

592
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:16,800
when you drink at this moment?

593
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,680
Who wins! Tell me.

Congratulations, Tian Tian.

595
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,760
You're one step closer to the master of designer toys.

00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,520
Excellent.

600
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,700
Mr. Liu, this means

601
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,790
Assistant Tian will leave you for three months.

602
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:35,140
You just entered the phase of being her probationary boyfriend.

603
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,200
Aren't you worried

604
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,470
that you two have to separate for so long?

605
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,810
I promised Tian

606
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,490
to be on the same page with her.

607
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,740
No matter how far the distance is,

608
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,800
our hearts will always be connected.

609
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,370
Mr. Liu, you've changed a lot lately.

610
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,090
You're getting more considerate.

611
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,640
I used to

612
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,410
follow my own ideas

613
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,210
and rhythm.

614
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,250
But recently I realized

615
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,780
that giving up control sometimes

616
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,080
and staying by her side

617
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,410
in a comfortable way that she feels good about

618
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:01,140
is also fine.

619
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,260
After all,

620
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,650
emotions cause you to lose control,

621
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,650
whereas love is about to withhold.

622
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:15,860
Dear Tian.

623
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,740
Do you have time for dinner tonight

624
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,860

00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,200

(Bonus Scenes)

661
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,610
And I didn't know what to do.

And you have to meet him all the time.
(Bonus Scenes)

00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:18,650
It won't be easy to deal with your relationship in the future.
(Bonus Scenes)

671
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,150
I don't know.

(Bonus Scenes)

673
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,200
I came to Qiansheng Group
(Bonus Scenes)

674
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,490
to work and study.
(Bonus Scenes)

(Bonus Scenes)

678
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,300
My dream

679
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,610
is to become a top toy designer.

680
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,860
I'm not going to let these nonsense things

681
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,970
bother me.

682
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,450
Dating is nothing compared to my career.

683
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,280
You're right.

684
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,910
Men are all idiots.

685
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,860
Only career and friendship are the most important.

686
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,320
Cheers!

687
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:42,840
Cheers!
