1
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,890
(Love Me Like I Do)

2
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,570
(The big boss is pursuing me too.)
(Episode 3)

3
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,710
Well...

4
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,580
Mr. Liu,

5
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,310
if you're ill, you should get treated.

6
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,310
Miss Tian,

7
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,100
I just have hypoglycemia.

8
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,600
Hypoglycemia?

9
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,800
You're just as fragile as a little girl.

10
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,930
The brittlest big boss I've ever seen.

11
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,470
OK.

12
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,020
Thank you for sending me back.

13
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:09,780
Actually,

14
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,160
we can continue to work together.

15
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,140
How?

16
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,200
I want to officially hire you

17
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,600
to be a senior employee of Qiansheng Group.

18
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,670
This is the contract

19
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,010
I asked Assistant Tang to draft.

20
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,930
(Qinsheng Group)

21
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,100
Read it after we leave.

22
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,820
Don't be too surprised.

23
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,900
-Personal assistant? -Personal assistant?

24
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,760
Liu Xilai,

25
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,000
how dare you fool me?

26
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,000
Calm down.

27
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,530
In a way,

28
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,740
you've entered Qiansheng Group as you wished.

29
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,710
What position you got doesn't matter that much.

30
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,240
You're right,

31
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,460
but this position is humiliating!

32
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,950
I'll go ask him for an explanation tomorrow.

33
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,180
No, no, no.

34
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,020
He's the boss.

35
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,780
Has he taken me as a soft touch

36
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,460
because I was too easy on him?

37
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,460
Assistant Tang,

38
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,230
is her desk ready?

39
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,480
Yes.

40
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,710
Miss Tian can start working anytime.

41
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,820
I'm ready too.

42
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,370
A new chapter of my life will soon begin.

43
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,380
Mr. Liu,

44
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,880
I interviewed

45
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,430
for the job of toy designer.

46
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,370
Can you explain

47
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,690
why you offered me to be your personal assistant?

48
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,490
Is there any misunderstanding?

49
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,620
No, Miss Tian.

50
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,430
I promised to hire you as a senior employee of Qiansheng Group.

51
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,760
The personal assistant

52
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,230
of the president of Qiansheng Group

53
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,430
is a senior employee.

54
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:07,700
You...

55
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,960
You did it on purpose.

56
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,050
Sorry.

57
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,080
I'm afraid I'm not capable enough

58
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,700
to be your personal assistant.

59
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,230
Goodbye.

60
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,740
Miss Tian,

61
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,160
have you not read the last page?

62
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:23,630
Read it now.

63
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,180
I'm sure you can then feel my sincerity.

64
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,540
Do you think

65
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,390
I refused you because I'm not satisfied with the salary?

66
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,409
I think in this world,

67
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:42,670
everyone loves money.

68
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,420
But not everyone uses money

69
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,380
to solve every problem like you.

70
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,159
Miss Tian,

71
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,450
in my opinion,

72
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,130
in this world,

73
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,110
money

74
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,490
can solve 99% of problems.

75
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,040
As for the last 1%,

76
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,380
luck is needed.

77
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,320
And it's undeniable

78
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,310
that money is a very efficient way

79
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,600
to solve problems.

80
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,090
Mr. Liu,

81
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,200
I've been trying to be nice to you.

82
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,530
You always act as if you were a gang leader.

83
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,960
Do you know that looking at others

84
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,020
with sunglasses on is very impolite?

85
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,380
You insisted on holding either my hand or arm

86
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,110
and called that social graces.

87
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,920
Do you know that's very lousy?

88
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,410
A weirdo like you,

89
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,250
a fragile man like you,

90
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,770
actually believed you could use money

91
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,240
to make me your personal assistant!

92
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,720
Stop daydreaming!

93
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,250
I told you to think twice.

94
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,560
Impolite.

95
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,290
Lousy.

96
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:50,640
Weirdo. Fragile.

97
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:52,140
Was she talking about me?

98
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,390
People usually don't mean

99
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,280
what they say when they are angry.

100
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,580
You have a point.

101
00:05:59,150 --> 00:05:59,730
So,

102
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,110
she was angry

103
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,030
because she thought the high salary I offered

104
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,130
debased her?

105
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,910
Miss Tian looks cute but has a fierce temper.

106
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,090
I'm not sure she's suitable for the position of your personal assistant.

107
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:10,820
Don't worry.

108
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,860
After Miss Tian

109
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,180
agrees to be my personal assistant,

110
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,480
sooner or later,

111
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,130
she will be captivated

112
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,530
by my leadership.

113
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,250
What should we do next?

114
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,990
We failed the first time,

115
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,460
but we can keep trying.

116
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,900
As long as I have money,

117
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,570
no one can resist me.

118
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,120
(Round 1)

119
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,990
Miss Tian.

120
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,120
You seem to be in a good mood.

121
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,200
If you take a look at the contract again,

122
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,860
your mood will be even better.

123
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,070
Mr. Liu,

124
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,659
I made it very clear to you the other day.

125
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,490
Are you too dull-witted to understand me?

126
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,290
No, Miss Tian.

127
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,670
This is a beautiful world.

128
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,150
Don't be so irritable.

129
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,560
It's not good.

130
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,770
Nothing is impossible.

131
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,390
If

132
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,860
you're not satisfied with the salary,

133
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,030
you can make it higher.

134
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,160
If you feel unhappy,

135
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,510
fill in a number that makes you happy.

136
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,900
A number that makes me happy?

137
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,700
Mr. Liu, check it after you go back.

138
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:36,860
Goodbye.

139
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,960
We just tried one more time and made it.

140
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,909
I'm sometimes amazed

141
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,380
by my efficiency.

142
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,870
Assistant Tang,

143
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,230
let's check on

144
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,140
the contract signed by my new assistant.

145
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:00,620
Okay.

146
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,190
Mr. Liu, the signature

147
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,670
is an amphibian, right?

148
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,680
(Round 2)

149
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,720
Miss Tian.

150
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,140
Are you mad?

151
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:33,789
It's so late now.

152
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,390
You scared the crap out of me.

153
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:36,870
Miss Tian,

154
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,460
you were stalked once.

155
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:42,350
It shows that this neighborhood is not very safe.

156
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,610
If you agree to be my personal assistant,

157
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,440
I can

158
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,590
send bodyguards to protect you.

159
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,710
I don't need protection.

160
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,460
As long as you stay away from me,

161
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,610
I'm safe.

162
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,550
Miss Tian,

163
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,510
I'm very sincere.

164
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,130
I can not only send bodyguards to protect you,

165
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,080
but also hire you with a special assistant's salary.

166
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,210
Why don't you give it a second thought?

167
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,060
It's true, Miss Tian.

168
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,310
Assistant Tian,

169
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,210
your salary is almost higher than mine.

170
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,700
So what on earth do you want from me?

171
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,580
I'm a wunderkind who is worth over 100 million yuan.

172
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,910
What can I want from you?

173
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,130
Besides, you're too strong for a girl

174
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,710
and bad-tempered.

175
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,580
I just simply want you

176
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,180
to be my personal assistant.

177
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:41,960
That's all.

178
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,870
Gosh, Tian Tian.

179
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,660
Is your boyfriend from the mafia?

180
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,290
He wears sunglasses for night jogging.

181
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,820
Tsk, look at his cocky face.

182
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,350
No.

183
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,130
That's not the case.

184
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,170
He's not my boyfriend.

185
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:11,900
Assistant Tang,

186
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,990
is my sincerity not obvious to you?

187
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,260
Mr. Liu,

188
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,570
it's very obvious.

189
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,840
So there's something wrong

190
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,300
with my strategy?

191
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,650
Miss Tian is usually in plain clothes

192
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,930
and lives in a small house.

193
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,570
I bet she likes to keep a low profile.

194
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:32,600
Maybe

195
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,980
you're being too high-profile.

196
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,660
Got it.

197
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,050
Low profile.

198
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,850
(Round 3)

199
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,130
Fancy foods with chopsticks.

200
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,090
Champagne with plastic cups.

201
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,620
Come on. Drink.

202
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,650
Good! Great!

203
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,480
Handsome!

204
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,260
Miss Tian,

205
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,000
I hope you can think more clearly

206
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,240
in a place you like and are familiar with.

207
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,660
As expected, the weirdo president

208
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,660
does everything in an abnormal way.

209
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:21,980
Mr. Liu,

210
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:23,980
let's talk.

211
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,550
Why do you insist

212
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,510
that I be your personal assistant?

213
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,940
I'm not

214
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,220
irreplaceable.

215
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:33,860
But to me,

216
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,850
you are irreplaceable.

217
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,140
You...

218
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,260
That's nonsense.

219
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:40,750
It's not.

220
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,710
I'm here with complete sincerity.

221
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,700
Miss Tian,

222
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,300
I really need you.

223
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,800
Mr. Liu,

224
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,770
that's enough.

225
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,020
Don't try to sweet talk me.

226
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,240
I don't buy it.

227
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,650
We failed again.

228
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,440
Again.

229
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:08,790
Again.

230
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,880
He came to harass you again?

231
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,590
No one would believe

232
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,020
that he wants nothing from you.

233
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,590
If I hadn't left in time,

234
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,220
the hackneyed drama you mentioned

235
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,040
that a bossy rich man fell in love with a normal girl

236
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,430
would have happened.

237
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,450
So scary.

238
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,070
Don't be afraid.

239
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,810
As a journalist, I've already made a plan

240
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,140
to unveil his secrets.

241
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,550
Just wait and see his true colors.

242
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,320
Ms. Chen,

243
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,320
is the lunch ready?

244
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,060
Yes, Miss Wen.

245
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,660
My dear daughter has finally grown up

246
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,120
and starts caring for Dad?

247
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:50,860
Dad.

248
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,510
This lunch box

249
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,700
is for Xilai.

250
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,150
If you want one too,

251
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,280
I can ask Ms. Chen to prepare one for you.

252
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,120
Look at you.

253
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,990
You just came home from broad but keep going out.

254
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,490
Xilai is working so hard running the company.

255
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,010
I should visit him.

256
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,470
Go ahead.

257
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,920
I'm leaving. Bye.

258
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,000
Xilai.

259
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:22,780
Xian.

260
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,850
What brings you here?

261
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,850
Xilai,

262
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,470
I intend to stay in the country in the future,

263
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,570
so I came to pay you a visit.

264
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,570
I may need your help in the future.

265
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,720
I made this myself.

266
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:37,930
Try it.

267
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,600
Thank you, Xian.

268
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
I'll eat it later.

269
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,710
I'll keep it for Mr. Liu.

270
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,450
Xian, I'm busy today.

271
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,340
I have to attend

272
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,430
the wedding of an executive later.

273
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,940
Why don't you leave now?

274
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,390
Miss Wen.

275
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:58,640
Please.

276
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,310
Mr. Liu.

277
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,130
I'm really sorry.

278
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,440
I forgot that you didn't like traditional Chinese weddings.

279
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,300
Otherwise,

280
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,180
I would've held a western-style wedding on a lawn.

281
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:21,780
It's okay.

282
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,410
Go back to the venue.

283
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,130
I just came to say congratulations.

284
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,300
Assistant Tang will give you my wedding gift.

285
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,340
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Liu.

286
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,670
You're so considerate.

287
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,360
Congratulations.

288
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:35,960
Thank you.

289
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,640
Everyone on high alert! Someone is snapping pictures.

290
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,270
Stop!

291
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,420
Protect Mr. Liu. Go catch her!

292
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,330
Stop!

293
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,070
You've chased me past three blocks.

294
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,800
Can we take a ten-minute break?

295
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,660
Unless you give me the video you took.

296
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:02,810
Otherwise...

297
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:04,380
Gosh.

298
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,100
Okay.

299
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,140
I'll attend the interview on time tomorrow.

300
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:25,930
Thank you.

301
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,100
Rose,

302
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,210
are you a paparazzi now?

303
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,090
Let me show you some nice stuff.

304
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:42,740
(Annual Entrepreneur Award Ceremony)

305
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,020
I think

306
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,960
I deserve this award.

307
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,140
But I strongly suggest

308
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,420
that there should only be one winner.

309
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,960
How did he make it?

310
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,720
He's so ordinary

311
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,750
yet so confident.

312
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,590
No, Tian.

313
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,760
You're wrong.

314
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,740
I've investigated his past three generations

315
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,640
and even the cleaning lady

316
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,650
in his house,

317
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,520
and found that this Mr. Liu is everything but ordinary.

318
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,950
He went abroad to study after ten years old

319
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,320
and graduated from an Ivy League school.

320
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,210
He returned two years ago and started working for his family.

321
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,220
Within merely two years,

322
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,180
he developed Qiansheng Group

323
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,830
into the leader of the toy industry.

324
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:13,780
He's worth over 100 million yuan.

325
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,380
He's handsome.

326
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,710
He speaks with zingers.

327
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,350
He's funny, capable, and rich.

328
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,860
He's only funny to me.

329
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:22,910
Capable?

330
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,360
I don't think he is.

331
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,360
He grew up abroad

332
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,670
and has a super high IQ.

333
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,820
Maybe his brains work in a way that's different from ours.

334
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,080
Let me show you something more exciting.

335
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,930
He actually covered the auspicious word

336
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,390
in a wedding with a poster?

337
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,940
Did he do it to get attention?

338
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,090
He used someone else's wedding

339
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,710
for product promotion?

340
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,740
I have to say he impressed me.

341
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,440
Good for him.

342
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,240
Rose,

343
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,440
I think

344
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,100
you should stop investigating him.

345
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,930
He's such a weirdo.

346
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,150
You'd better stay away from him.

347
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,560
You need to watch out too.

348
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,680
Besides Mr. Liu,

349
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,900
you also have to be careful of the stalker.

350
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,380
Wait.

351
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,250
Take this pepper spray.

352
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,619
What about you?

353
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,980
I haven't worn makeup these days.

354
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,380
They can't recognize me.

355
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,369
Hey, Xilai.

356
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:23,050
There's a very popular new restaurant.

357
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,960
When are you free recently?

358
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,589
we can go eat there together.

359
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,119
Sorry, Xian.

360
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,140
I'm busy lately.

361
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,050
Xilai,

362
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,620
are you that busy?

363
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,550
You can't even make time for a meal?

364
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,460
After I came back,

365
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,390
you haven't even had a meal with me.

366
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,110
Okay.

367
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,630
I'll make time for you.

368
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,780
We'll go to the restaurant I choose.

369
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,660
Okay.

370
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,780
I'm not picky.

371
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,730
You make the decision.

372
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,650
See you then.

373
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,310
Bye.

374
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,090
Perfect.

375
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,030
Sorry.

376
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,540
We prefer

377
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,200
more experienced designers.

378
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,840
I'm sorry.

379
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,240
You're not suitable for our company.

380
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,730
You don't fit this position.

381
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,510
Maybe an illustrator suits you better.

382
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,890
Xilai booked the whole restaurant.

383
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,270
I can see

384
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,110
that he actually cares about me.

385
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,190
Mr. Liu,

386
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,530
you asked me to pay attention to Miss Tian's interview results.

387
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,270
I heard

388
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,040
that none of her interviews went well.

389
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,740
With her qualifications,

390
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,690
it's indeed difficult for her

391
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,120
to become a toy designer in a big company.

392
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,800
But it shouldn't be hard for her

393
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,260
to get a job in a small company.

394
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,190
How come none of the companies accepted her?

395
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:05,330
Maybe someone doesn't want her to find a job.

396
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,620
Are you talking about me?

397
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,930
Am I someone who would do anything

398
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:10,930
to get what I want?

399
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,500
Of course not.

400
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,620
It's unfortunate that she keeps being rejected,

401
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,350
but it's an opportunity for me.

402
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,470
Continue to follow up.

403
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,200
Okay.

404
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,350
Xilai arrives.

405
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,460
Isn't that girl Xilai's date

406
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,330
at the banquet that night?

407
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,660
That's my opportunity coming toward me.

408
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,200
People can easily be taken advantage of when they're weak.

409
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,660
Mr. Liu,

410
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,430
you must not mention money now.

411
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,320
Just show your concern for her.

412
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,900
Are you questioning my negotiation ability?

413
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,640
Tell Xian

414
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,730
that I'll meet her another time.

415
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:08,170
Okay.

416
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,550
What's their relationship?

417
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,780
Miss Wen, sorry.

418
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,000
Mr. Liu can't dine with you today.

419
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,740
Something urgent at work came up.

420
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,470
At work?

421
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,490
What's so urgent?

422
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,510
I'm not sure.

423
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,040
Mr. Liu didn't tell us.

424
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,180
He must have stood me up because of that girl.

425
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,190
I need some help.

426
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:41,490
Hello?

427
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,030
Hey, when will you come back?

428
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,730
I haven't decided yet.

429
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,060
Maybe in a while.

430
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,690
What's wrong?

431
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,350
Come back soon.

432
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,900
We Golden Trinity haven't gathered in years.

433
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,290
You are just idling around abroad.

434
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,040
Just come back as soon as possible.

435
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,550
Okay.

436
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,270
I'll try my best.

437
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,170
It's a deal.

438
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,810
I'll go welcome you then.

439
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,920
Am I really that bad?

440
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,700
All those big toy companies refused me.

441
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,960
You stalked me again.

442
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,150
You really misunderstood me this time.

443
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,550
It's just a coincidence.

444
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,940
I don't have time to talk to you now.

445
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,860
Stop following me, or it won't end well for you.

446
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,460
Miss Tian,

447
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,010
if you are upset

448
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,220
because of being rejected in interviews,

449
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,180
you can reconsider

450
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,840
being my personal assistant.

451
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,910
How did you know that?

452
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,350
It's really you!

453
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,390
No wonder

454
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,880
all those toy companies refused me.

455
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,380
I failed to become a toy designer.

456
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,380
Are you happy now?

457
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,390
Miss Tian,

458
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,730
life is not just about chasing your dream.

459
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,370
You also need to feed yourself.

460
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,600
What you need now is a job.

461
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,100
Then you can think about your dream.

462
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,900
I don't understand why you have to

463
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,650
stick to a road that leads to a dead end.

464
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,420
Mind your own business.

465
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,070
I know what I want.

466
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:27,880
Yes.

467
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,260
In my world,

468
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,740
there is no such thing as a dead end.

469
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,450
Whatever gets in my way, I'll overcome it.

470
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,200
-I'm just caring about you. -Shut up.

471
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,730
People like you

472
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,910
who were born with a silver spoon in your mouth

473
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:42,040
can't understand

474
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,000
how exhausting it is for normal people

475
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,460
to simply scrape a living.

476
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,230
You were born with everything.

477
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,690
You don't have the right to tell me what to do.

478
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,140
Don't think you know people like me.

479
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,500
I also need to work hard to get what I want.

480
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,790
Fulfilling your dream is hard,

481
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,680
but on my shoulders is the well-being

482
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,210
of hundreds of employees of Qiansheng Group.

483
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,980
My position is always coveted.

484
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,440
Countless people are waiting for me to collapse.

485
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,590
But I have to hold on.

486
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:07,950
Let go!

487
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,720
You're ridiculous.

488
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,160
Wearing sunglasses on a rainy day.

489
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,620
Just looking at you annoys me!

490
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,100
Let go!

491
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,140
Let go!

492
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,630
I'm warning you.

493
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,620
Don't ever show up in front of me again.

494
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:12,720
Mr. Liu.

495
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:14,960
Mr. Liu.

496
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,180
Mr. Liu, wake up.

497
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,860
Is Mr. Liu in poor health?

498
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,010
Why does he faint so often?

499
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,680
Mr. Liu has low blood sugar.

500
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,390
Again?

501
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,250
It's good that he's not ill.

502
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,910
Tell him this when he wakes up.

503
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,860
I won't blame him for what he did

504
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:46,130
as long as he leaves me alone in the future.

505
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:46,730
Miss Tian,

506
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,970
you misunderstood Mr. Liu.

507
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,530
I just received the investigation result.

508
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,080
The one

509
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,920
who tampered with your interviews is Kevin.

510
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:57,740
Kevin?

511
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,050
He's just a designer. How is he capable of that?

512
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,040
He's a designer

513
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:05,090
who has been working in this industry for years.

514
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,020
He has resources and connections.

515
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,520
It's not difficult for him

516
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,430
to land a newbie in hot water.

517
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,740
Mr. Liu, how do you feel now?

518
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:14,950
I'm fine.

519
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:16,930
Miss Tian,

520
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,800
do you trust me now?

521
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,570
It really wasn't you?

522
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,540
Of course not.

523
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,070
I have high moral standards, okay?

524
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,980
You should've explained yourself earlier.

525
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,840
Did you give me a chance to do that?

526
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,220
You could barely

527
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:31,950
suppress the urge

528
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,280
to beat me up, could you?

529
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,280
I'm sorry.

530
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,380
I was in a bad mood. I was impulsive.

531
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:39,890
It's okay.

532
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,590
Although I wasn't behind it,

533
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,160
in the end,

534
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,720
I'm at fault in using the wrong guy.

535
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,640
I apologize for it.

536
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,460
Assistant Tang,

537
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,960
I don't want to see Kevin

538
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,700
in the circle of designer toys again.

539
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,430
Understand?

540
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,170
Yes, I'll do it right away.

541
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,240
How do you like

542
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:04,230
the way I handle this matter, Miss Tian?

543
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,400
Well,

544
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,500
I should apologize to you too.

545
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:15,900
I shouldn't have lashed out at you without listening to your explanation.

546
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,230
I hope you get well soon.

547
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,200
I should go.

548
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,980
Some advice for you before I leave.

549
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,080
A runt like you

550
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,330
is too weak

551
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,700
to blackmail anyone.

552
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:50,900
Runt?

553
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,310
Me?

554
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,290
I have abs, okay?

555
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,230
Okay, I got it.

556
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,470
No red

557
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,100
in Room 301.

558
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,830
We don't need any blood tests for now either.

559
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,220
He didn't forget to put on airs even in the hospital.

560
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,680
Does the patient faint at the sight of blood?

561
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,070
It's privacy. I can't answer.

562
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,130
Faint at the sight of blood?

563
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,070
Miss Tian,

564
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,380
I hope you can

565
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,730
stay by my side tonight.

566
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,760
Hold my arm

567
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,450
and stay close to me all the time.

568
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:36,310
You're a big boss after all.

569
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,680
Why are you acting like you've never been to occasions like this before?

570
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,840
You don't know

571
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,650
how good it feels to have a game cheat.

572
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,510
Game cheat?

573
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,900
Is he...

574
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,640
Why did you come back?

575
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,630
Sure enough, you faint at the sight of red.

576
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,460
Besides,

577
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,960
I can ease your dizziness.

584
