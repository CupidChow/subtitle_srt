00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,850
(Love Me Like I Do)

2
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,680
(Fall in Love Together)
(Episode 18)

3
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,900
The stock price of the group has dropped for the second day in a row.

4
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,870
Mr. Liu, do you have any solution?

5
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,150
I was caught unawares too.

6
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,590
The Sales Department has immediately

7
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,710
withdrawn the problematic toys from the market.

8
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,970
What's the use of that?

9
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,729
Because of this batch of toys,

10
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,000
the Qiansheng Group

11
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,480
is questioned by the public.

12
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,570
To be fair,

13
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,670
President Liu was in charge of

14
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,500
the production of the trending toys

15
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,930
and the vice president has just taken it over.

16
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,500
Within such a short time,

17
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,380
he managed to control the situation.

18
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,720
It's very impressive.

19
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,500
If we replace the leader who should be blamed for the mistake

20
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,760
and elect someone new,

21
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,500
we may be able to regain the trust of the public.

22
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,600
What do you think?

23
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,240
When the president is absent

24
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,490
and the crisis is yet to be solved,

25
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,940
Mr. Wen eagerly proposes to elect a new leader.

26
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,400
Don't you think you're rushing things a bit?

27
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,380
Mr. Liu,

28
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,890
aren't you supposed to rest at home?

29
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,390
What brings you here?

30
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,480
The group's crisis

31
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,100
is far more important than my personal affair.

32
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,160
At a time like this,

33
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,850
we should join hands

34
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:50,910
to overcome hardships.

35
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,700
I will find out the truth

36
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,010
and punish those

37
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,410
who put the group's reputation at risk

38
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,810
for personal interests.

39
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,810
Xian is just Xian.

40
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,470
Mr. Wen is just Mr. Wen.

41
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,400
Don't confuse

42
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,380
relationships and work.

43
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:12,790
Brother,

44
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,220
you've interfered with my work.

45
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,900
Can you not meddle in my relationship as well?

46
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,160
I just hope

47
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,720
you can analyze things

48
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,620
calmly and objectively as you used to do.

49
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,320
So,

50
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,780
you just want me to be an inept vice president

51
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,890
under your wings.

52
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,060
Helping me to get experience

53
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,860
was just a hypocritical excuse.

54
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,620
Think it over.

55
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,710
Don't let Xian and me down.

56
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,300
We are both your backup.

57
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,740
I know, Uncle Wen.

58
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,010
Make a new suit.

59
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,920
Get prepared to become the CEO

60
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:01,870
in three days.

61
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,140
Mr. Liu.

62
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:07,510
(CEO Office)
Mr. Liu.

63
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:07,850
(CEO Office)

64
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,490
Although the first batch of the toys
(CEO Office)

65
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,760
were all sold in this city,
(CEO Office)

66
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,000
many customers

67
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,100
didn't leave any information

68
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,950
and it's difficult to withdraw all the sold toys

69
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,740
in a short time.

70
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,140
That means this incident

71
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:18,610
may continue to escalate.

72
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,790
Withdrawal is not enough now.

73
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,510
How to compensate the customers

74
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,030
and restore the reputation of the Qiansheng Group

75
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,160
is our top priority.

76
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,110
Vice President Liu has visited some customers

77
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,010
and provided them with reasonable compensation and medical aid.

78
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,930
Zhao did a good job,

79
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,960
but it's not enough.

80
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,750
Let me think about it.

81
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:37,470
Okay.

82
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,150
Sorry.

83
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,200
I've been too busy today

84
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,920
to spend any time with you.

85
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,800
I'm not a kid.

86
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,900
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

87
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:29,700
Xilai,

88
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,150
you've got a plan, haven't you?

89
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,320
I haven't figured out a way

90
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:38,620
to quickly retrieve the problematic products

91
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,260
and regain the customers' trust.

92
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:40,860
Yeah.

93
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,780
Once the trust is lost,

94
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,460
it's not easy to get it back.

95
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,680
I don't think a regular method will work.

96
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,690
I have to come up with something new.

97
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:55,730
All right.

98
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,990
Let's go. I'll help you get relaxed

99
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,490
and relieve the pressure.

100
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,100
Now?

101
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,390
This is your way to relieve stress?

102
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:05,960
Yes.

103
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,580
What do you think?

104
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,810
Don't underestimate these games.

105
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,530
They are the best antidotes

106
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,480
for stress.

107
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,120
Do you want to compete with me?

108
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,410
Sure.

109
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,560
I'm a super VIP

110
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,450
of a shooting club.

111
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,770
Choose whatever you want.

112
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,680
I want this bear.

113
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,650
No problem.

114
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,190
Xilai,

115
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,460
be gentle.

116
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,810
Don't smash the screen.

117
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,460
Tian,

118
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,400
repeat what you just said.

119
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,130
I said be gentle.

120
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,490
Don't smash the screen.

121
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,950
I got it.

122
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,920
I know how to solve the problem!

123
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,570
You are really my Sweetie Tian.

124
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,310
The first step.

125
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,240
Withdraw the problematic toys.

126
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,170
Assistant Tang,

127
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,780
tell the Business Development Department

128
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,550
to contact all the companies

129
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,240
that wanted to cooperate with us.

130
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,850
They'll provide the raffle prizes with us.

131
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,460
I will make it a trending topic.

132
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,270
Then we can

133
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,160
promote the event together.

134
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,190
Also, it's time for your database

135
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,200
to come into use.

136
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,220
Check the information left by the customers

137
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,100
and find out what gifts they prefer.

138
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,220
The raffle gifts should be customized.

139
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,670
I'm good at analyzing data.

140
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,570
But how are we going to collaborate with other companies

141
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,770
to promote the event?

142
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:36,750
Smash

143
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,060
golden

144
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,030
eggs.

145
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,530
Hello, everyone.

146
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,880
I'm Liu Xilai, the CEO of Qiansheng Group.

147
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,700
Your boyfriend is on TV again.

148
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,100
We decided to use

149
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,700
a special raffle game

150
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,820
to recall the problematic products.

151
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,680
Every customer

152
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,190
who bought the problematic toys

153
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,390
can take it to our office

154
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,200
and smash golden eggs to get gifts.

155
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,890
I, Liu Xilai, hereby promise

156
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,990
that all the problematic toys

157
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,520
recalled by the raffle game

158
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,940
will be destroyed during a livestream.

159
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,590
Come and smash golden eggs.

160
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,450
The prizes will surprise you.

161
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,580
The Qiansheng Group

162
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,310
is a responsible

163
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,210
and trustworthy company.

164
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,730
Behind me, the Qiansheng Group

165
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,350
is withdrawing its problematic toys.

166
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,690
Judging from the crowds here,

167
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:22,610
we can feel

168
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,590
Qiansheng's determination to retrieve all the problematic toys.

169
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,630
This is the hidden toy of the Cute Pets series.

170
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,060
I've been wanting to buy one but it's too rare.

171
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,610
What a responsible

172
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,690
and trustworthy company.

173
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,720
They didn't cover up or ignore their mistake.

174
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,929
They take the blame for it.

175
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:37,460
Let's go have a closer look.

176
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:40,409
Everyone,

177
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,559
you know

178
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,770
what this means, don't you?

179
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,580
Through livestreaming,

180
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,370
I withdrew the problematic toys

181
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,830
without wasting one penny

182
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,180
and restored the reputation of the group.

183
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,910
This event also saved us the high promotion fee for the new product.

184
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,400
Do the math, gentlemen.

185
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,860
I doubt that the negative news' boosting effects

186
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,240
on sales can last long.

187
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,730
If the solid data

188
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,550
isn't enough to relieve you,

189
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,520
why don't you pray to God

190
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,020
and ask him whether the Qiansheng Group

191
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,880
will last long?

192
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,790
Mr. Liu, how could you say that?

193
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,880
The crisis has already happened.

194
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,530
Instead of working together to overcome the difficulty,

195
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,730
you just keep pointing fingers

196
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,660
and put your own interests before everything else.

197
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,590
How many big enterprises

198
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,060
have gone under because of infighting?

199
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:36,910
Let me ask you.

200
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,310
Who turned the tide

201
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,000
during the crisis

202
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,640
and turned the loss into profit?

203
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,110
Is it you guys?

204
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,270
No matter how eloquent you are,

205
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,040
and how well you play your cards,

206
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,440
you're just making up for your own mistake.

207
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,630
No matter what,

208
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,680
the reputation of Qiansheng

209
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,500
has been damaged due to your poor leadership.

210
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,500
That's the truth.

211
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,640
How about this?

212
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,260
Let's vote

213
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,120
to decide whether you will leave or stay.

214
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,530
Sure.

215
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,300
That's what I'm thinking.

216
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,290
Liu Xilai.

217
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,440
Liu Xizhao.

218
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:19,830
Liu Xizhao.

219
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,230
Liu Xilai.

220
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:24,660
Liu Xilai.

221
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,820
Liu Xizhao.

222
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,920
Liu Xilai.

223
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,560
Four votes.

224
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,400
Liu Xizhao.

225
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,440
Four votes.

226
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,250
Liu Xilai, five votes.

227
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,910
The voting is over.

228
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,500
Liu Xilai will continue

229
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,330
to be the CEO of Qiansheng Group.

230
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,040
So you two have conspired against me.

231
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,110
Xizhao,

232
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,210
I'm trying to help you,

233
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,060
but you have to seize the chance.

234
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,660
Only after you become the CEO

235
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,740
can I entrust my daughter to you.

236
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,350
I just want to be with Xian.

237
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,480
He made it look like I want to make use of her.

238
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,140
Brother,

239
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,950
Mr. Wen brainwashed me every day,

240
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,940
saying only after I become the CEO

241
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,050
can I marry Xian.

242
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:40,550
I don't want to…

243
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,280
Don't worry.

244
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,620
I have an idea.

245
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,160
Do as I say.

246
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,820
Sorry, Uncle Wen.

247
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,540
Xian is your daughter,

248
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,690
not your bargaining chip.

249
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,070
I don't think he's more capable than me,

250
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,130
but it doesn't mean

251
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,340
I can step on him to get a promotion.

252
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:58,890
Mr. Wen,

253
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,030
after I took office,

254
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,870
you never stopped playing tricks.

255
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,980
Whether it's the release of the Cute Pets series

256
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,680
or the pre-sale of Classic of Mountains and Rivers,

257
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,690
even the attack at the resort.

258
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,380
What are you trying to say?

259
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,540
What I want to say is

260
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,570
that I've never

261
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,470
mentioned these things explicitly,

262
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,020
because I respect you as a senior in the company.

263
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,070
You're Xian's father

264
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,000
and Zhao's future father-in-law.

265
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:24,720
So,

266
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:26,730
think carefully.

267
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,790
Are you going to keep going against me,

268
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,320
put the company in danger,

269
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,270
and let our opponents take advantage of it,

270
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,270
or take a step back

271
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,700
and enjoy a peaceful retirement?

272
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,100
You...

273
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,270
Zhao.

274
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,190
You've grown up.

275
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,090
You can take care of yourself now.

276
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,690
Uncle doesn't have to worry about you anymore.

277
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,400
My dad worries about me?

278
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,100
He only knows to scold me.

279
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,060
Your parents love you,

280
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,550
so they plan ahead for you.

281
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,120
Stop. Stop lecturing me.

282
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:21,660
But Brother,

283
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,390
being the CEO is so exhausting.

284
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,440
I got up so early and went to bed so late.

285
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,710
I prefer to be a normal employee.

286
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,330
Can you put it another way?

287
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,560
OK.

288
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,220
You're so hard-working.

289
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,920
Please continue to work hard

290
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,240
as the CEO.

291
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,590
In this way,

292
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,050
I can

293
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,990
be the golden turtle in the Wishing Pool again.

294
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:45,760
I have to say,

295
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,210
golden turtle,

296
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,510
thank you

297
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,170
for trusting me

298
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,060
and asking me for help.

299
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,020
I did all this

300
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,180
for Xian.

301
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,330
After we got together,

302
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,400
I've realized

303
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,000
what responsibility means for a man.

304
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,070
It means not to make my girl sad.

305
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:11,950
I don't want

306
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,350
to make things hard for her in the future.

307
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,860
And I don't want

308
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,570
to see her cry

309
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,900
when the conflict is beyond repair.

310
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,860
I think

311
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,070
the current result is the best for her.

312
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,060
Congratulations.

313
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,710
You've grown into a man.

314
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,030
Congratulations to me.

315
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,580
I can live a carefree life again.

316
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,770
Uncle Liu, have a nice talk with my dad.

317
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,030
I'll make you some tea.

318
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:47,590
What?

319
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,760
Are you here to laugh at me?

320
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,960
I'm here to visit you,

321
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,760
and laugh at you.

322
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:54,540
You...

323
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:56,770
Fine.

324
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,540
I'm a total loser now.

325
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,630
Can't the Liu family just leave me alone?

326
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,670
Knock it off.

327
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,930
You know what you've done.

328
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,430
You're not wronged.

329
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,060
Xilai didn't expose what you did

330
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,170
in the board meeting

331
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,230
because he wanted to give you a chance

332
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,160
to retire with dignity.

333
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,160
I...

334
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,540
He just wants me to retire?

335
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:18,900
Yeah.

336
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,340
My point

337
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,210
is that we're too old

338
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,540
to fight in the business world.

339
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,840
It's time to rest.

340
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,430
Leave the stage to the youngsters.

341
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,210
You have two able sons.

342
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,850
It's easy for you to say that.

343
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,880
Daughters are sweet and considerate.

344
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,540
By the way,

345
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,030
your daughter

346
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,340
will be my daughter soon.

347
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,110
Nonsense.

348
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,260
She'll always be my daughter.

349
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,420
Look at him.

350
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,140
-Dad. -He's an old man now,

351
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,480
but his temper is still so bad.

352
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,120
Uncle Liu.

353
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,240
Nice tea.

354
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,560
Not bad, right?

355
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,110
Fill my cup again.

356
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,140
Although I knew your whole plan,

357
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,570
watching you carry it out

358
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,240
step by step so confidently

359
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,630
made me admire you more.

360
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,030
My boyfriend is awesome.

361
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,130
Tian,

362
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,060
you inspired me.

363
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,260
Without you, I wouldn't have thought of smashing golden eggs.

364
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,130
You should take the credit.

365
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,040
You came up with such a creative idea

366
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,930
and made a great success of it.

367
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,900
Then do you still think it's bad

368
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,500
that my brains work differently from others'?

369
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,410
I'm used to it now.

370
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,380
I used to think that meeting you

371
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,210
is a trial given by God.

372
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,160
How about now?

373
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,800
Now I think

374
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,230
meeting you

375
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,150
is a gift given by God.

376
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,550
One bite of the sweet and sour pork

377
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,720
means one more hour on the treadmill.

378
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,040
Don't worry.

379
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,109
From now on,

380
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,740
I'll take care of

381
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,220
your healthy eating plan

382
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,880
and work-out plan.

383
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,349
I mean it.

384
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,620
You have my word.

385
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,590
Are you still the

386
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,550
timid and mean

387
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,980
Jack Li who hurt others without knowing it?

388
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,630
Was I

389
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,480
that bad back then?

390
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,030
But Strong Shan was horrible too back then.

391
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,500
I was sensitive and insecure.

392
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,620
That's why I cared about what others thought.

393
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,390
How about this?

394
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,000
Let's

395
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,440
get to know each other again.

396
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,660
Hello, I'm Li Huai.

397
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,060
I've been trying to change the way I talk

398
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,430
so I won't hurt the girl I like.

399
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,220
And I intend to protect her

400
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,910
with a healthy diet.

401
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,220
This is me, sweet and straightforward.

402
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,000
Hello, I'm Shan Rose,

403
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,090
a pretty girl who won't change herself

404
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,170
just because of others' opinions

405
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,970
and who only makes changes

406
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,200
to please herself.

407
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,040
Miss Shan.

408
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:07,760
Mr. Li.

409
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,860
It's good to get to know you again.

410
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,860
-Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you.

411
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:13,810
Sourpuss,

412
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,270
how could you?

413
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,950
How could you keep it from me?

414
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,740
I was afraid that you might spill the beans,

415
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,340
so I kept it a secret from you.

416
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,880
Sorry for making you unhappy these days.

417
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,270
My brainless princess.

418
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,650
Originally,

419
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,710
I wouldn't forgive you unless you buy me a diamond necklace,

420
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,890
but I know

421
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,640
you did everything for me.

422
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,030
You are the one who suffered the most.

423
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:39,890
Zhao.

424
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,190
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

425
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,410
Thank you for making me feel

426
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,870
that I chose the right man.

427
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,730
I've always loved you,

428
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,700
but I love you even more now.

429
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:51,800
What should I do?

430
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,740
Why are you sighing?

431
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,380
You can't get rid of me.

432
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,690
Before I met you...

433
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,390
Wait.

434
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,510
I think the way you give her the ring

435
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,210
is too common.

436
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,060
A big boss like you shouldn't go the common way.

437
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,580
Rose, what do you think?

438
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,120
Mr. Liu,

439
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,750
do you remember

440
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,690
how you met Tian?

441
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,220
We can recreate that scene.

442
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,960
We first met after a car crash.

443
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,960
I mean after you grew up.

444
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,460
But as the CEO,

445
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,940
you ignored your employee's plagiarism.

446
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,340
Your company will go under sooner or later.

447
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,630
The first time we met after we grew up

448
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,550
was not so pleasant either.

449
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,460
Mr. Liu,

450
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,690
when did you

451
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,310
kiss Tian for the first time?

452
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,430
If you mean a real kiss,

453
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,060
it should be…

454
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,460
My condition is quite bad this time.

455
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,660
Kissing my forehead

456
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:29,890
is not enough.

457
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,160
What do you mean?

458
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,190
That kiss

459
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,880
was quite sweet.

460
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,000
But I tricked her

461
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,420
into that kiss.

462
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,190
Mr. Liu,

463
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,680
can't you recall some romantic moments

464
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,770
between you and Tian?

465
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,710
Rose.

466
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,860
It's so hot. Why do you bring me here?

467
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,710
What's the surprise?

468
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,280
Tian,

469
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,870
no matter where your home is in the future,

470
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,670
my home will always be your home.

471
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,380
Tian Tian,

472
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,840
I'll trust the man I once had a big crush on to you.

473
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,840
Be happy with him.

474
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,270
Miss Tian.

475
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,250
My man is the most handsome.

476
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,790
Jack's dance is the most attractive.

477
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,100
My left hand is a perfect match with my right hand.

478
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,280
Tian.

479
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,090
After we met,

480
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,800
you broke the barrier between me and the color red.

481
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,130
You let me face the world without any fear.

482
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,070
Because of you,

483
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,110
I learned

484
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,110
that love

485
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,210
means to support each other's dreams

486
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,470
and give each other strength.

487
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,140
Will you marry your weird boyfriend

488
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,720
and make him a miracle in your life?

489
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,600
Xilai,

490
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,660
you're already my miracle.

491
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,190
You made parallel lines converge

492
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,080
and came to me

493
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,110
from a completely different world.

494
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:39,450
You showed me

495
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,950
that as long as we love each other,

496
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:45,180
even if there's the whole universe between us,

497
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,340
we can still be together in the end.

498
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,490
I'm willing to walk into your weird world

499
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,570
and become a weirdo in love like you.

500
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:28,000
Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.

501
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:31,140
My big boss has never been so approachable before.

502
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,650
Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.

503
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,410
Music!

504
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:45,090
♫It took a long time to see you again♫

505
