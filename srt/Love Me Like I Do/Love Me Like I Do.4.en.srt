(Love Me Like I Do)

00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,720
(The Delicate CEO and His Grumpy Assistant)
(Episode 4)

3
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:51,890
Miss Tian,

4
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,479
since you've already known it,

5
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,570
let's have a talk.

6
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,360
But before that,

7
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,190
there's one thing to do.

8
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,380
What is it?

9
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,460
My sunglasses

10
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,190
can filter the color red,

11
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,740
but they are not rose-colored glasses.

12
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,229
I don't want to be scared again

13
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,780
by Miss Tian's appearance.

14
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,060
Mr. Liu is trying to use the handsome trick?

15
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,550
No wonder he is the boss.

16
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,750
Respect him for doing things by hook or by crook.

17
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,480
If I had physical contact with you,

18
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,250
you wouldn't suffer from

19
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,290
that disease...?

20
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,980
Hemophobia.

21
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,020
I'm just an extreme case.

22
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,720
Every time I see the color red,

23
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,050
it will cause temporary

24
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,100
neurophysiological dysfunction.

25
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,550
That's why I feel dizzy.

26
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,579
When it's serious,

27
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,750
I will even lose my consciousness.

28
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,380
Why me?

29
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,120
I don't know.

30
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,000
But my personal doctor

31
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,410
is helping me with my desensitization.

32
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,160
It's a bit mysterious.

33
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,880
Why didn't you tell me directly?

34
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,680
Why did you beat around the bush?

35
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,570
Tell you the truth

36
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:21,260
so that you can do whatever you want with my weakness?

37
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,090
I am not as bad as you think.

38
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,550
You have too much prejudice against me.

39
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,290
Humanity is too complicated

40
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,020
and uncontrollable.

41
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,350
I like to solve problems

42
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,510
in a simple and controllable way.

43
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,700
It is your arrogance

44
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,230
that makes me have prejudice against you.

45
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,290
Miss Tian,

46
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,480
I have a suggestion.

47
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,910
Why don't we meet each other halfway?

48
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,890
I hire you to be my personal assistant

49
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,360
and a toy designer.

50
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,780
What do you think?

51
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,160
No.

52
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,790
My bottom line is

53
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,010
a toy designer

54
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,800
and your personal assistant.

55
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,810
Is there any difference?

56
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,740
Of course, it's totally different.

57
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,670
The order decides the proportion.

58
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,350
This woman

59
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,510
is stubborn,

60
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,680
but smarter than I thought.

61
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:04,980
All right.

62
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:06,630
No problem.

63
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,380
OK.

64
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,180
Let's talk about other conditions.

65
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,380
From now on,

66
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,130
this is where my dream starts.

67
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,170
Isn't this the strong woman

68
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,500
who knocked Mr. Liu out during her legal rights protection?

69
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,409
Miss Tian.

70
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,070
Welcome to Qiansheng Group.

71
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,400
I'll take you to Mr. Liu.

72
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:54,080
You need to get familiar with Mr. Liu's work environment

73
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,940
and his habits.

74
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,870
Okay.

75
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,180
Thank you for your invitation.

76
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,560
I will attend this charity event

77
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,430
on time.

78
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,290
Okay, bye.

79
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,530
Mr. Liu.

80
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,310
This is my first day here.

81
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,320
Is there any task

82
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,180
assigned to me?

83
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,170
I hope you can get used to

84
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,610
the role of a special assistant as soon as possible.

85
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,470
Be my guard against the color red.

86
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,360
Okay, Mr. Liu.

87
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,350
As a designer and assistant,

88
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,190
I'll fulfill all my responsibilities.

89
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,450
I'm going back to work.

90
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,880
Wait, Assistant Tian.

91
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,980
I have to remind you

92
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,610
that as a designer, you may not pay attention to details.

93
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,320
But as my assistant,

94
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,340
you have to be exquisite to the utmost.

95
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,790
I saw nothing.

96
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,190
I... I know nothing.

97
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,530
Assistant Tang.

98
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,780
You came at the right time.

99
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,910
Take her to the Toy Design Department.

100
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,360
You must complete the task this time.

101
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,090
Understood?

102
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,870
Yes.

103
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,290
Director Zheng.

104
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,730
Let me introduce.

105
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:18,970
This is

106
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,130
our chief designer, Zheng Qian.

107
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,950
She is the pillar of the Design Department.

108
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,880
She is the acting design director.

109
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,940
Hello, Director.

110
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,470
This is our designer, Doggie.

111
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,620
Our sketch master.

112
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,800
Hello, Doggie.

113
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,790
I'm flattered.

114
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,730
This is Jiang, the designer.

115
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,130
Our model master.

116
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,900
You are really good at praising each other.

117
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,440
These are our designers,

118
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,020
Wang, Gu and Wen.

119
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,250
Hello, I'm Tian Tian.

120
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,909
Director Zheng,

121
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,290
I'll leave her to you.

122
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,290
It's an honor to learn from you.

123
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,520
I look forward to working with you.

124
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,920
No need to be this polite.

125
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:58,409
That's your desk.

126
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,850
If you want to get your work started as soon as possible,

127
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,400
you need to figure out the design concept

128
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,780
and product style of the company in the past three years.

129
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,310
Go ahead.

130
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,630
Ms. Qian seems to be distant, but she is warm-hearted.

131
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,580
Don't feel pressured.

132
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,110
Ask me if you need anything.

133
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,310
Okay.

134
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,090
Thank you so much.

135
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,660
Mr. Liu.

136
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,140
During the Blue Sky Dream

137
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,090
this afternoon,

138
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,320
there will be an auction

139
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,420
of drawings by children in the orphanage.

140
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,820
So there must be red elements.

141
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,080
Assistant Tian will accompany you to attend it, won't she?

142
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,700
How is she doing in the Design Department?

143
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,430
I've talked to Director Zheng.

144
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,780
She won't be assigned

145
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,640
any detailed task for the time being,

146
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,040
so that she may answer your call at any time.

147
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,090
Go get Assistant Tian.

148
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:43,540
OK.

149
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:44,630
Wait.

150
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,990
I can help you if it is necessary.

151
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,340
But don't disturb my work

152
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,640
unless you really need me.

153
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,250
Okay.

154
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:55,659
Besides,

155
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,780
I want to keep my identity as your personal assistant

156
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,240
as a secret in the company.

157
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,960
I want to keep a low profile

158
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,180
to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings.

159
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,990
I hope you can

160
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,030
understand what I said and respect me.

161
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,440
Isn't it just keeping a low profile and showing respect?

162
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,340
I'll go in person.

163
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,130
Mr. Liu.

164
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,159
Mr. Liu is just passing by.

165
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,039
Just continue with your work.

166
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,740
See you at the parking lot

167
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,670
in five minutes.

168
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,810
Doggie, what's going on?

169
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,880
Don't underestimate her.

170
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,500
Tian Tian...

171
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,440
I thought she was a newbie.

172
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,530
I didn't expect her to be a veteran.

173
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,810
Don't underestimate her.

174
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:56,270
Is she a little princess gaining some work experience

175
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,160
or a secret lover of the boss?

176
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,490
Mr. Liu.

177
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,880
There's no red color here.

178
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,860
How long will you keep this posture?

179
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,570
And this activity has long been over.

180
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,190
In the name of work,

181
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,510
I take you out for some fresh air.

182
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,990
Isn't that good?

183
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,930
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

184
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,740
But could you please not ask me

185
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,510
to do such trivial matters?

186
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,310
I just joined the company.

187
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,910
I want to do a good job in the Design Department.

188
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,190
This charity event

189
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,440
has limited up the stock price of Qiansheng Group today.

190
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,100
How can it be a trivial matter?

191
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,220
I just want to know

192
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,240
when I can go back.

193
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:56,990
Now.

194
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,730
I'll ask Assistant Tang to pick me up now.

195
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,060
Sorry, Miss, you can't go in.

196
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,100
I need to talk to your boss.

197
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,460
I really need to talk to your boss.

198
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,860
Let me interview her.

199
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,110
Look at you.

200
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:12,820
My boss doesn't accept interviews.

201
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,420
-Excuse me, Miss. Please go over there. -Rose.

202
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,650
Why are you here?

203
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,940
I edited a video

204
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,940
of an dedicate boss vs. a brave girl who boycotted plagiarism.

205
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,480
I didn't expect that the views would exceed 100 million.

206
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,910
Our Editor-in-Chief transferred me to the remix team

207
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,620
and increased my salary by 500 yuan.

208
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,880
That's the happiness.

209
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,430
What about sorrow?

210
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,770
Shan.

211
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,100
Why is the click rate still so low

212
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,340
after you are here?

213
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:41,940
So low.

214
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,900
You should deserve

215
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,810
the increased 500 yuan in your salary.

216
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:44,540
Your salary.

217
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,760
Did you hear what she said?

218
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,360
She asked me to interview

219
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,570
another weird boss in a week

220
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,900
and make it the next hit.

221
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,420
So,

222
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,200
you're here to interview the owner of the dessert shop?

223
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,750
Yes.

224
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,210
The owner of the dessert shop

225
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,320
printed her ex's profile photo

226
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,650
on the cover of the milk tea.

227
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,050
So her ex was poked by straws every day.

228
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,290
I just want to ask her

229
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,540
how she came up with such an unusual idea.

230
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,800
But I didn't expect...

231
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:07,800
Rose.

232
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,070
I think

233
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,700
the boss is merciful enough

234
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,180
to kick you out.

235
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,130
What can I do?

236
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,800
Life is so hard.

237
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,670
A weird CEO.

238
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,150
My boss

239
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,940
is the weirdest in the world.

240
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,800
Can you help me ask Liu Xilai for an interview?

241
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,400
Sure, leave it to me.

242
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,590
My position is irreplaceable.

243
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,110
Tian Tian, you're so nice.

244
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,100
Sorry, let me pick it up for you.

245
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,300
It's okay.

246
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,030
Dear all!

247
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,620
Here is the biggest secret.

248
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,800
It's about Mr. Liu.

249
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,100
We have been used to

250
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,650
Mr. Liu's weird behaviors.

251
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,500
We're not interested at all.

252
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,820
Fine.

253
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,750
I thought you would be curious

254
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,080
about the gossip of Mr. Liu and Miss Tian.

255
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:16,620
What gossip?

256
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,670
Tell me.

257
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,330
Mr. Liu.

258
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,630
I have made an appointment for you

259
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,960
with Dr. Li for a review.

260
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,160
Go inform Assistant Tian.

261
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:31,920
OK.

262
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,010
By the way,

263
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,370
I heard a rumor

264
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,000
from the Design Department.

265
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,900
It's about you.

266
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,770
Assistant Tang.

267
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,340
Where there is me,

268
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,620
there will be gossip every day.

269
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,200
You need to get used to this.

270
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,420
Don't report to me

271
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,770
such trivialities.

272
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,650
But

273
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,140
the other one involved in this gossip

274
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,700
is Assistant Tian.

275
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,270
Oh?

276
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,310
Tell me then.

277
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,060
I heard

278
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,340
that Assistant Tian is writing you a love letter.

279
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,870
She wants to confess to you.

280
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,940
Confess to me?

281
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,560
Tian, how's it going?

282
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,600
Did Mr. Liu agree?

283
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,240
I can't hold on any longer.

284
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,160
Don't worry.

285
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,590
No matter what,

286
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,430
I will make it.

287
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,540
We are as close as sisters.

288
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,110
Mr. Liu, are you free now?

289
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,330
I want to see you.

290
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,990
She took the love letter.

291
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,640
She's taking actions.

292
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,060
It's thrilling. I want to be on the spot.

293
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,210
Confession is always in vain.

294
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,980
I feel a little nervous for Tian.

295
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,770
Assistant Tian

296
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,350
really fell in love with me.

297
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,140
I have nowhere to hide

298
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,660
my charm.

299
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,950
Maybe there's misunderstanding.

300
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,440
No.

301
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,770
She fell in love with me.

302
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:29,960
She always

303
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,220
wanted to keep a distance from me.

304
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,220
But this time,

305
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,540
she changed her attitude and tried to approach me.

306
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,390
This is definitely not misunderstanding.

307
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,760
Mr. Liu.

308
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,220
I don't think Assistant Tian...

309
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,220
I am the dream of millions of girls.

310
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,880
You don't understand.

311
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,110
You haven't experienced it.

312
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,350
Well,

313
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,380
Miss Tian is supposed to

314
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,910
accompany you to Dr. Li's

315
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:02,890
for review.

316
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,740
Forget it.

317
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,150
I'll go by myself.

318
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,270
I should keep a distance

319
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:10,950
from Miss Tian now.

320
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:12,830
Okay.

321
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,700
My darn charm.

322
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,630
I'm busy.

323
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,260
No time to meet you.

324
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,520
Why do I feel

325
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,710
he is so indifferent?

326
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,440
What's going on?

327
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,850
Mr. Liu, wait.

328
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,230
Why is it so weird?

329
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,200
Mr. Liu,

330
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,540
why is Assistant Tian so obsessed

331
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:06,900
with you all of a sudden?

332
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:07,650
Maybe

333
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,310
she misunderstood

334
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,349
my nice attitude of inviting her.

335
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,520
She fell in love with me.

336
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,119
After all,

337
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,040
an excellent person like me

338
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,380
is destined to bear love debts.

339
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,450
Sounds reasonable.

340
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:22,750
But Mr. Liu,

341
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:23,869
I think

342
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,030
it's better to explain it sooner.

343
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,990
How can I bear to do that?

344
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,910
Assistant Tang,

345
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,260
avoid her.

346
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,850
Let her enjoy the sweetness for a few more days.

347
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,590
I have nowhere to hide my charm.

348
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:42,240
♫The sea of bitterness reveals love and hatred♫

349
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:48,090
♫No one can escape from destiny♫

350
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,670
♫We are close, but cannot be together♫

351
00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:00,050
♫I spend my whole life believing this is fate♫

352
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:21,690
Mr. Liu.

353
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,560
That must be the love letter.

354
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,600
It's my fault.

355
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,640
But it is Assistant Tian who has to take the burden.

356
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,340
Assistant Tian,

357
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,230
you are a very nice girl.

358
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:40,890
You're pretty

359
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:41,880
and capable.

360
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,910
You're really excellent.

361
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,800
What happened?

362
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,020
Why is he praising me like that?

363
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,560
Is he going to play the act of

364
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,160
a domineering CEO falling in love with me?

365
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,810
No way.

366
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,670
She must have noticed that I'm rejecting her,

367
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,930
so she wants to escape.

368
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,100
Forget it. It's better to cut the knot.

369
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,460
Assistant Tian.

370
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,210
I think

371
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,460
you're perfect to be my personal assistant.

372
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,200
You are unique to me.

373
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,990
I don't want to lose you.

374
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,040
Mr. Liu.

375
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,320
Although I'm very important to you,

376
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,430
you should keep a distance

377
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,870
from me.

378
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,370
She's a little cute when she pretends to be fine.

379
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,620
I wonder

380
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,710
if she can handle my rejection.

381
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,020
Assistent Tian,

382
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,360
don't force a smile.

383
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,310
I admire your taste.

384
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,380
But

385
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,120
it's impossible for us.

386
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,750
Mr. Liu, what are you talking about?

387
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,140
What is impossible?

388
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,360
I know

389
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,440
your thoughts.

390
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,410
You know everything?

391
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
Then do you agree?

392
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,750
I'm sorry.

393
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,590
I choose to stay single.

394
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:02,910
Mr. Liu.

395
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,220
Mr. Liu.

396
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,950
I'll make it clear then.

397
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,470
I know you're holding a love letter.

398
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,780
You want to confess to me.

399
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,770
I didn't meet you,

400
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,430
because I didn't want to refuse you face to face.

401
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,320
Mr. Liu.

402
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,830
Please take a closer look with your eyes.

403
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,420
Is this a love letter?

404
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,640
Mr. Liu, I've admired you for a long time.

405
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,510
You have led Qiansheng Group in the business sector

406
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,370
with great momentum.

407
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,430
You are a famous young entrepreneur.

408
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,860
I wonder if you may accept an exclusive interview with me?

409
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,300
Inviter, Shan Rose.

410
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,000
Invitation for the interview.

411
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,400
Have you seen it clearly?

412
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,770
This is a wonderful misunderstanding.

413
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,000
I confess to you?

414
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,450
There's a whole biochain

415
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,040
between us, OK?

416
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,240
Assistant Tian means

417
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,640
that you two belong to different circles.

418
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,990
Come on. It's different species.

419
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:22,760
Good.

420
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,390
I am very satisfied

421
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,480
that you don't have such unrealistic thoughts.

422
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,280
Don't worry.

423
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,700
I do not

424
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:31,800
and will not.

425
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,830
You are not my type.

426
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,480
Very good.

427
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,100
I won't

428
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,660
accept any interview from a nobody.

429
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,060
After all, we belong to different species.

430
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,300
Miss Tian.

431
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,200
Please get off.

432
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,810
Tian Tian. Tian Tian.

433
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,350
Watch your mouth.

434
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,350
I'm sorry.

435
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:10,550
I didn't expect

436
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,460
he would reject me so firmly.

437
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,810
It's okay.

438
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,190
He is famous for being difficult to cope in our media circle.

439
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,960
Even if he agreed to the interview,

440
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,800
maybe

441
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,630
something else would happen later.

442
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:20,910
Yes.

443
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,920
The interview must be a failure.

444
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,000
He doesn't look like a CEO.

445
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,390
He's an alien freak.

446
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,690
Someone like Luo Ci

447
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,480
is a real man.

448
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,690
He is talented and handsome.

449
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:36,280
That's the role model of the industry.

450
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,400
Luo Ci.

451
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,520
You've only seen him once

452
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,690
for such a long time.

453
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,000
You still love him.

454
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,820
Oh.

455
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,760
That's not love,

456
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,720
but admiration.

457
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,960
Luo Ci is my prince charming.

458
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,890
Prince charming.

459
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,460
Your prince charming.

460
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,680
Let me tell you.

461
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,080
He's more handsome in person than in the photo.

462
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,880
This is my idol.

463
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,460
He's indeed a guru.

464
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,050
He doesn't show up that often,

465
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,180
but there are still stories about him.

466
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,150
You get to know him because of his handsome face.

467
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,340
Then you are obsessed with him for his talent.

468
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,140
And finally you admire him for his character.

469
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,260
Luo Ci

470
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,600
is the top one in the design circle.

471
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,510
It's just a magazine cover.

472
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,870
Let me show you

473
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,370
what is called a "nonsuch".

474
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,660
Luo Ci even outshined

475
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,510
Mr. Liu.

476
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,140
Assistant Tang.

477
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,010
Please arrange the interview with Reporter Shan.

478
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:34,460
Now.

479
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,340
Mr. Liu, you...

480
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,980
I've thought about it.

481
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,750
I can't refuse

482
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,670
Designer Tian's request.

483
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,080
He said no yesterday,

484
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,730
but accepts it passionately today.

485
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,990
What's wrong with him?

486
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:54,080
Did Tian Tian succeed in confessing her feelings?

487
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,770
She's becoming the CEO's secret lover.

488
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,080
Yes, Mr. Liu.

489
00:23:59,210 --> 00:23:59,940
A little more to this side.

490
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,010
Yes, that's it.

491
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,920
So handsome, Mr. Liu.

492
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,140
Amazing, Mr. Liu.

493
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,850
The most handsome man in the world.

494
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,350
Assistant Tian.

495
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,630
What do you think?

496
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,570
It is well-known

497
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,760
that I am excellent.

498
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:29,460
Mr. Liu.

499
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,930
Why did you suddenly change your mind

500
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,390
and accept our interview?

501
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:35,380
Because I want to be on the magazine cover.

502
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:36,430
Mr. Liu.

503
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,980
Your answer is always unexpected.

504
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,160
Sorry for that.

505
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,090
Genius are always unique.

506
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,330
Mr. Liu has always been the GOAT in the netizens' eyes.

507
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,930
And he's always mysterious.

508
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,030
He's always surrounded by security personnel.

509
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,760
Many netizens asked me where they could meet you.

510
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,370
In their dreams.

511
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:57,430
Xilai.

512
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,190
Our business runs well, doesn't it?

513
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,300
Don't take this kind of interview anymore.

514
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,510
It's not serious at all.

515
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,190
Uncle.

516
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,950
Young people nowadays like it.

517
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,720
Zhao's Moments

518
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,390
are filled with this.

519
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,740
You are comparing yourself with him?

520
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,650
You're the CEO of Qiansheng Group.

521
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,620
You make a good fortune,

522
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,470
and you have a good look.

523
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,960
Why are you still single?

524
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,380
Uncle,

525
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,550
how about

526
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,960
taking more care of Zhao?

527
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,430
After he returns from abroad,

528
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,570
he can manage the company with me.

529
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,700
I don't know if he has made full use his studying time abroad.

530
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,900
But he said he would come back tomorrow.

531
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,390
If you have time,

532
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,130
let's have dinner together.

533
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,840
I'll arrange it in advance,

534
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,830
and give him a surprise.

535
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,830
Today is the party of the Design Department.

536
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,990
Tian Tian, as a newcomer,

537
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,250
you need to drink more.

538
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:53,550
No problem.

539
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,860
I need to thank everyone for taking care of me.

540
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,790
You're welcome.

541
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,450
Having a meal together can bring us closer.

542
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,960
You need to adjust to such a warm atmosphere,

543
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,780
and see

544
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,170
how good I am at socializing with others.

545
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,840
Let's go.

546
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,810
My car is parked across the street.

547
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,050
I'll wait for you in the underground garage.

548
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,620
Here's an assignment for you, Assistant Tian.

549
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,210
Sorry.

550
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,420
I have a date

551
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,150
tonight.

552
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,680
I can't attend the party today.

553
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,480
I'll treat you next time.

554
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,830
Go. It's okay. Bye.

555
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:25,590
Why not?

556
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,820
It's barbecue.

557
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:43,290
Get in.

558
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,300
Mr. Liu.

559
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,430
Why don't we have a secret code?

560
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,080
Otherwise,

561
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,740
I feel like I'll get caught sooner or later.

562
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:06,190
Don't you think this is exciting?

563
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,480
Men are indeed immature forever.

564
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,400
Childish.

565
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,870
Are you still going to see Dr. Li today?

566
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,040
Dr. Li is on a business trip.

567
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,380
He'll be back in a few days.

568
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,540
My cousin is coming back from abroad.

569
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,500
I need to buy something

570
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,360
to welcome him.

571
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,670
Your cousin?

572
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,420
Dad, I'm back.

573
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,610
What the hell?

574
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,100
Surprise!

575
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,020
Zhao.

576
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,020
Welcome home.

577
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,480
Don't be so childish.

578
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:07,850
Zhao.

579
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,940
No way. And you?

580
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,760
You brat.

581
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,460
You're finally back.

582
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:15,510
Come in.

583
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:23,980
Zhao.

584
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,550
Your cousin prepared these for you.

585
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,230
What do you think? Isn't it a surprise?

586
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:29,770
Obviously it is Liu Xilai's taste. Just for his self-amusement.

587
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,440
(Welcome back from abroad)
Obviously it is Liu Xilai's taste. Just for his self-amusement.

588
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:31,920
(Welcome back from abroad)

589
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,200
What a surprise.

590
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,020
I knew you'd like it.

591
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,140
Let me introduce.

592
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,410
My special assistant, Tian Tian.

593
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,410
She came to decorate it with me.

594
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,280
Hello, welcome back.

595
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,190
You're Liu Xilai's assistant.

596
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,360
You don't look like you're a fool.

597
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:56,240
Brat.

598
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,060
Go change your clothes.

599
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,390
Let's have a meal later.

600
00:28:59,480 --> 00:28:59,900
Okay.

601
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,090
Zhao.

602
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,290
Go to your room.

603
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,810
I prepared another surprise for you.

604
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:07,990
Another surprise?

605
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,390
Surprise?

606
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,230
Gosh.

607
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,530
This red color.

608
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,530
I thought it was a wedding photo.

609
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:24,620
(Bonus Scenes)

610
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,550
Assistant Tian.

611
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,090
(Bonus Scenes)

612
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,220
I keep a low profile.
(Bonus Scenes)

613
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,120
(Bonus Scenes)

614
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,710
Do you feel my respect?
(Bonus Scenes)

615
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,610
(Bonus Scenes)

616
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,250
Can you keep a lower profile?
(Bonus Scenes)

617
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:32,750
(Bonus Scenes)

618
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,410
It's hard.
(Bonus Scenes)

619
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,270
(Bonus Scenes)

620
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:38,400
Assistant Tang, it's too hard for you.
(Bonus Scenes)

621
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:38,660
(Bonus Scenes)

622
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,590
Assistant Tang.

(Bonus Scenes)

624
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,950
Are you not satisfied with your salary?
(Bonus Scenes)

625
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,400
Yes.
(Bonus Scenes)

626
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:43,850
(Bonus Scenes)

627
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:44,780
Very satisfied.
(Bonus Scenes)

628
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,610
Assistant Tian.

629
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,540
As you can see,

630
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,990
I've never wronged my employees.

631
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:54,550
How much energy does it take

632
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,100
to grow into such a weirdo?

633
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:58,690
Mr. Liu,

634
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,050
I hope you can keep your promise.

635
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,060
Don't show up around me

636
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,100
as a CEO.

637
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,370
It will bring me a lot of troubles.

638
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,120
OK?

639
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,390
Strong people

640
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:12,180
will never fear the rumors.
