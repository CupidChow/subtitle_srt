(Team-building Activity with Gossip and Spoilers)
(Episode 15)

3
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,580
Why didn't Tian answer my phone?

4
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,620
I come to you today

5
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,430
because I didn't

6
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,320
see your name

7
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,210
on the final training list.

8
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,500
It was because I couln't make it to this training.

9
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,250
May I ask

10
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,790
whether it is because of your company

11
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,160
or your personal issue?

12
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,350
It's a misunderstanding.

13
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:11,990
I know

14
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,980
you value this training very much.

15
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,790
As a specially invited instructor,

16
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,579
I can bring a teaching assistant with me.

17
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:20,260
You can come with me as my assistant

18
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,140
if you want.

19
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,630
Thank you, senior.

20
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:26,970
But

21
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,850
if I attend it as your teaching assistant,

22
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,230
do I need to give up my current job?

23
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,820
It's just a job.

24
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,000
Junior,

25
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,130
if you want to focus on designing trending toys,

26
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,260
the door of my studio

27
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,120
will always be open for you.

28
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,600
Thank you, senior.

29
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,910
You have done so much for me.

30
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,570
But I don't know

31
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,970
what I can do for you.

32
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,940
You don't have to thank me.

33
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,630
I did it willingly.

34
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,100
Because,

35
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,560
I like you.

36
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:14,890
Senior.

37
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,270
I've always admired you

38
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,340
and look upon you as my idol.

39
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,430
But...

40
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,380
But that doesn't stop me from appreciating and having feelings for you.

41
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,380
I know your dream.

42
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,800
I can also be there for you.

43
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,190
We have the same interests.

44
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,540
We can go for it hand in hand.

45
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:34,079
Senior.

46
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,079
I used to think the same way.

47
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,220
Only two people who are similar

48
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,650
can be together.

49
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,700
But recently I found that

50
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,740
even if one comes from Mars

51
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,560
and the other one comes from Venus,

52
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,030
they can be deeply attracted to each other.

53
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,310
You mean

54
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,280
Liu Xilai?

55
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:06,770
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:07,700
I...

57
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,640
You don't have to reject me now.

58
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,920
I'll give you enough time to think about it.

59
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,980
After all, the crush won't last long.

60
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,760
If two people want to be together in the long run,

61
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,260
they need a tacit understanding.

62
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,519
My flight is on Friday.

63
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,990
Whether to come with me or stay,

64
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:22,830
it's up to you.

65
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,650
I'll think about it

66
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,840
and give you an answer.

67
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,290
Tian.

68
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,680
What answer do you need to give him?

69
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,460
It's none of your business.

70
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,850
I'm here to apologize.

71
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,470
I'll do my best to make it up to you.

72
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,330
If

73
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,620
you want to join the training,

74
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,350
I'll add another quota for you.

75
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,320
I don't need you to make it up.

76
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,390
It seems like she doesn't want to be disturbed by you.

77
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,920
This is between me and Tian.

78
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,470
It's none of your business.

79
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,120
And you!

80
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,170
What are you doing here?

81
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,270
Nothing.

82
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,740
I'll help her realize the dream

83
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,380
you took away from her.

84
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,230
I won't give you that chance.

85
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,150
Let's wait and see.

86
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,240
Don't run too fast.

87
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,780
It's bad for your knees.

88
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,450
Drink more water

89
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,980
and stay hydrated.

90
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,140
Why is my mind filled with him?

91
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,060
Honey,

92
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,690
I don't feel comfortable

93
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,950
without you by my side.

94
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,290
I don't feel comfortable

95
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,620
without you by my side?

96
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,540
It seems whether I'm happy or unhappy,

97
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,230
he's always by my side.

98
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,910
Me.

99
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,390
Handling a ten thousand million-dollar business

100
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,990
is just a piece of cake for me.

101
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,600
To bring a bankrupt company back to life

102
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,460
is a breeze for me.

103
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,210
Why am I completely defeated

104
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,410
when it comes to love?

105
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,520
Given the current situation,

106
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,200
I'll give you three words.

107
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,280
You deserve it.

108
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,240
You...

109
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,990
Are you still my brother?

110
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,260
Not only did you not comfort me,

111
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,659
but you are kicking me while I'm down.

112
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:38,030
I've already told you that pretending to be sick

113
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:38,870
is not a good idea.

114
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,100
Did you take my advice? No, you didn't.

115
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,659
Now,

116
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,920
your retribution is here.

117
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,720
I didn't expect the consequences to be so serious.

118
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,400
She's totally ignoring me now.

119
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,260
Assistant Tang.

120
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:55,720
Mr. Liu.

121
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,980
The company's annual team-building activities are coming.

122
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,030
Will you join us?

123
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,690
Team building?

124
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,970
Go ahead. Leave me alone.

125
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,540
Won't the Design Department

126
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,010
participate in this team-building activity?

127
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,580
All departments will do it in batches.

128
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,380
What's wrong?

129
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,430
It's an unofficial occasion.

130
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,880
Everyone will be relaxed there.

131
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,810
It is easier for everyone to get closer to each other.

132
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,120
Shouldn't you seize the chance

133
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,500
to apologize to Miss Tian,

134
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,210
ask her for forgiveness,

135
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,740
and then get back together?

136
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,740
You are right.

137
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,550
Why didn't I think of it?

138
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,360
Li Huai.

139
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,960
Counsellor Li.

140
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,550
Help me.

141
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,080
Mr. Liu, look at this plan.

142
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,800
Food, karaoke, and mahjong.

143
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,050
One-stop service.

144
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,560
It's very down to earth.

145
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,450
So tacky.

146
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,960
Then look at this plan.

147
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,280
Real-life CS, script murder,

148
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,410
and the escape room.

149
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,510
Nerve-stimulating and thrilling.

150
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,020
-Childish. -Okay.

151
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,940
Take a look at the third plan.

152
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,020
The beach resort.

153
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,810
Sunshine and beaches.

154
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,080
A sky full of stars.

155
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,540
So romantic.

156
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:20,860
That's it.

157
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,950
The beach resort.

158
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,850
Relaxing and romantic.

159
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,270
Mr. Liu, what are your instructions

160
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,020
about participants and the process for this team-building activity?

161
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,150
Each department will do it in batches.

162
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,539
To reward the Design Department

163
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,750
for their contribution towards the Cute Pet series,

164
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,870
they are allowed to bring their friends along.

165
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,539
Tell Zhao

166
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,960
to bring Xian along.

167
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,830
I have two specially invited friends.

168
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,850
You mean

169
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,510
you only participate in the team-building activity of the Design Department?

170
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,070
Do you think I have time to attend all of them?

171
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,380
I understand. I will arrange the event flow for the Design Department carefully.

172
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:57,980
Remember,

173
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,240
one principle.

174
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,430
Liven up the atmosphere, make everyone relax, and get closer.

175
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,240
Don't worry, Mr. Liu.

176
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,930
I promise after this activity,

177
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,590
everyone will be as close as if they were family.

178
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:10,990
It better be.

179
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,390
So comfortable.

180
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,090
It's so beautiful.

181
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,140
Rose.

182
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,030
-Let me take a photo for you. -Okay.

183
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,840
Tian, it's too sunny.

184
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,230
Take the umbrella.

185
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:43,840
No need.

186
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,560
I have a feeling

187
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,700
that the plot in the soap opera that Boss is trying to win her girlfriend back

188
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,580
is going to...

189
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,480
Mr. Liu, it is a great idea for you

190
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,970
to choose this place for team-building.

191
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,340
It's so classy.

192
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,600
There is a statue of Avalokitesvara. Let's go take a look.

193
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,460
Let's go.

194
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:03,740
Mr. Liu.

195
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,970
I finally understand

196
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,160
why you want to join the team-building activity of the Design Department.

197
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,220
Don't worry. I'll definitely help you.

198
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,010
Forget it.

199
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,130
Trust me.

200
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,500
In such a relaxe and romantic atmosphere,

201
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,160
you will definitely succeed.

202
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,340
To win my girlfriend back, I'll count on you.

203
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,200
Counsellor Li.

204
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,690
Counsellor Li?

205
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,900
Am I laid off?

206
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,150
The Qiansheng Group really lives up to its name.

207
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,410
What a massive team-building activity!

208
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,590
I have to say

209
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,060
that your Mr. Liu has a good taste in aesthetics.

210
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,970
Miss Rose,

211
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,070
please be careful where you stand.

212
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,310
Whose Mr. Liu?

213
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:44,840
I know.

214
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,740
I'm not here

215
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,870
for fun today,

216
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:47,950
but with a mission.

217
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,050
Mission?

218
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:50,870
What mission?

219
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,290
Anyway, it's good for you.

220
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:57,720
Hello?

221
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,020
I'm already here.

222
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,110
Where are you?

223
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,240
Right away.

224
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,570
Who is it? So mysterious.

225
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,080
I won't tell you.

226
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,180
The cabin over there is so beautiful.

227
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,240
I'll go take a look.

228
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:25,460
Zhao.

229
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,840
The sea water is so cold,

230
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,390
but you've been swimming for so long.

231
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,720
What if you catch a cold?

232
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,210
You need anything?

233
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,680
Did you bring your camera?

234
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,700
I want you to

235
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,850
take some photos for me these few days.

236
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,840
I'm not good at taking photos.

237
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,900
Find someone else.

238
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,750
Sourpuss, stop right there.

239
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,330
Why didn't you answer my call?

240
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,320
Brother Xilai asked you to pick me up the day before yesterday.

241
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,500
But you arrived one day earlier.

242
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,960
Why didn't you wait for me?

243
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,530
I came to arrange the rooms for team building in advance.

244
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,280
Liar.

245
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,750
That's Assistant Tang's job.

246
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,640
Don't try to lie to me.

247
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,170
Also, don't try to avoid me.

248
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,060
Zhao!

249
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,010
Liu Xizhao!

250
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,030
I... I dropped my hat.

251
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,720
Help me pick it up.

252
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,690
Liu Xizhao!

253
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,770
Stop right there!

254
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,300
Stop!

255
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,990
Can't you hear me?

256
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:19,860
Stop right there!

257
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,740
Liu Xizhao!

258
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,500
Stop! Don't run!

259
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,620
Why is there another couple?

260
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,070
I think we're the only ones

261
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,130
who gossip so much.

262
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,130
Initially, I thought

263
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,810
that it was just a normal team-building exercise.

264
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,160
Now, it seems like

265
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,160
the situation is getting complicated.

266
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,560
Let's go somewhere else.

267
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,120
Let's go.

268
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,570
You move first.

269
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:42,610
You first.

270
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,600
You first!

271
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,020
Well,

272
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,190
the thing that I told you about on WeChat,

273
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,500
which is between my brother and your bestie,

274
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
what do you think?

275
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,570
Of course. If not, why would I be here?

276
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,240
For two young people who truly love each other,

277
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,310
we must complete our task to assist them.

278
00:12:59,310 --> 00:12:59,770
I agree.

279
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,170
Assistance never ends as long as we are alive.

280
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,900
-Happy cooperation! -Happy cooperation!

281
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,140
It's too hot.

282
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,090
Yes, it's so hot.

283
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,180
Why did we meet another couple again?

284
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,990
No! No!

285
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,130
We are just friends.

286
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,800
We don't even like each other's posts on Moments.

287
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,440
Miss Shan.

288
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,710
I'll give you likes on your post.

289
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,100
Don't make trouble.

290
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,290
Sorry. Excuse us.

291
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,130
You two go on.

292
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,140
No.

293
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,650
It's really a misunderstanding.

294
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,140
Look at them.

295
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,560
They seem to be fighting,

296
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,830
but in fact, they're flirting with each other.

297
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:33,980
I fell for it.

298
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,570
It's all your fault.

299
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,780
Miss Shan,

300
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,730
you should think like this.

301
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,230
It's better to misunderstand us as lovers

302
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,560
than eavesdrop on our secret plan. Right?

303
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,110
If it weren't for Tian's happiness,

304
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,310
I wouldn't want to have any more dealings with you.

305
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:47,830
Yes.

306
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,990
For the happiness of your brother and my bestie,

307
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,190
this sacrifice is nothing.

308
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,350
Come on. It's your brother, my bestie.

309
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,940
Your brother, my bestie?

310
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,760
I was right.

311
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,430
Your brother, my bestie.

312
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,200
Yes, my brother.

313
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,490
Liu Xizhao.

314
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,150
You cannot treat me like this.

315
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,950
Stop!

316
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,380
Showing off.

317
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,300
Wearing high heels on the beach.

318
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,320
Do you have a fever?

319
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,320
Why are you so hot?

320
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,090
Luckily, I brought some antipyretics.

321
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:19,820
Come with me.

322
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,110
Come!

323
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,400
No tantrums when you're sick!

324
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,360
Wait.

325
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,420
Let me get it. Hurry up.

326
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,750
Hello, Rose.

327
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,620
I'm here.

328
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,460
Where are you?

329
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,430
Rose, how dare you!

330
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,150
When did you become a mole?

331
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,700
Tian! Tian! Tian!

332
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,310
Tina!

333
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:58,860
Mr. Liu.

334
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,220
I'm not in the mood to watch any of your tricks.

335
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:01,730
Tian!

336
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,390
I'm sorry.

337
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,770
I really have no tricks this time.

338
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,040
I really want to make it up for you.

339
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:08,760
I used to

340
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,520
be a little selfish when it came to things.

341
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,740
This is an invitation to the international exchange class

342
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,740
offered by Paris designer Alice, which I fought to get.

343
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,070
I hope you can accept it.

344
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,360
I don't need your compensation.

345
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:20,510
Then,

346
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,140
what can I do to make you forgive me?

347
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,730
I want you to stay away from me.

348
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:28,580
Tian.

349
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,400
I can't.

350
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,520
I made this mistake

351
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,310
because I can't stay away from you.

352
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,860
I've always supported your dream.

353
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,840
But this time,

354
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,850
I'm afraid of losing you.

355
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,020
In my life,

356
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,880
you are my only choice.

357
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,730
But I'm not the only choice in your life.

358
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,990
How do you know

359
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,810
that you aren't?

360
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,170
So,

361
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,390
I'm your only choice too?

362
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,810
Have you forgiven me?

363
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:08,480
No.

364
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,680
You won't even trust me.

365
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,460
That's because you're so wonderful

366
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,190
that I won't even trust myself.

367
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,390
As long as you forgive me,

368
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,140
I can

369
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,550
smash boulders on my chest,

370
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,600
do the ice bucket challenge,

371
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,800
and jump into the sea.

372
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,620
I'll accept any punishment.

373
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,920
My mind is not as weird as yours.

374
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,310
I won't forgive you!

375
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,010
Take the medicine and have a good sleep.

376
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,340
I promise you'll become lively tomorrow.

377
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,990
Why are you laughing?

378
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,740
Back then,

379
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,880
it was always me who took care of you when you had a fever.

380
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,130
Now it's reversed.

381
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,380
Yes.

382
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:12,380
Back then, someone was always around me.

383
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,000
But now,

384
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,290
he has learned to play hard to get with me.

385
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,060
Look at you.

386
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,119
You're not sincere at all.

387
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,069
How did I take care of you

388
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,130
when you were sick?

389
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:22,900
Well,

390
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,710
if I take care of you the way you took care of me,

391
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,829
will you stop being mad at me?

392
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,060
It depends on your performance.

393
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,780
Do you want to choke me to death?

394
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,430
Was I as picky as you

395
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,860
when I was sick?

396
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,860
When you were sick,

397
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,960
no matter what you said,

398
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,010
I always agreed.

399
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,120
When I was sick,

400
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,580
you helped me achieve a higher ranking in my game.

401
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,580
I'll help you too.

402
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,390
Big sister.

403
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,630
Please don't.

404
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,390
Don't you know how bad your gaming skills are?

405
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,560
Big Sister?

406
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,850
Back then, you used to call me princess.

407
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,290
Didn't you say that last time?

408
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,510
You're my big sister, even if you're just one year older.

409
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,250
I won't argue with you since you're sick.

410
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,110
Give me back my phone.

411
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,550
No.

412
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,510
So,

413
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,160
am I still a younger brother

414
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,530
in your heart?

415
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,060
I don't know.

416
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,540
I'll go check if the dinner is ready.

417
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,830
You get some rest.

418
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,350
Smashing boulders on your chest?

419
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,240
How could he think of that?

420
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,590
Moreover, when did that traitor, Rose,

421
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,190
betray me and join the enemy?

422
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,370
Today is Thursday.

423
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,220
Gosh.

424
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,250
Senior is waiting for my reply.

425
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,750
Senior,

426
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,100
thank you for helping me strive for

427
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,290
such a precious opportunity to participate as a teaching assistant.

428
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,950
Furthermore, thank you very much for liking me.

429
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,050
But I'm sorry.

430
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,690
I already have someone in my heart.

431
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,470
I want to stay with him.

432
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:50,990
Actually,

433
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,870
I've already known your answer.

434
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,120
I just hope

435
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,580
you don't let love

436
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,280
interfere with your career and dreams.

437
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,480
Don't worry, senior.

438
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,990
I'll keep working hard.

439
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,780
I won't lose my direction because of love.

440
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,940
Instead, I will be a better person

441
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,980
for him.

442
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,540
I believe one day

443
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,590
we will meet again at the international design exhibition.

444
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,520
I look forward to seeing you again.

445
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,140
(We will meet again in the future.)
(Every encounter is the best arrangement, including your presence and my departure.)

446
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:36,930
Everyone.

447
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,570
First of all,

448
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,070
let Mr. Liu give us a speech.

449
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,470
Assistant Tang,

450
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,740
don't bring your work habits

451
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,650
here.

452
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,250
It's time for entertainment.

453
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,430
Therefore, we should be more comfortable.

454
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,800
Everyone, cheers.

455
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,580
Cheers! Cheers!

456
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,640
Why don't we play a game?

457
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,620
How about Truth or Dare?

458
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,630
Good idea!

459
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,440
Let's group with the one next to us.

460
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,470
Mr. Liu and Tian Tian.

461
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,600
Vice President Liu and Miss Wen.

462
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,040
Mr. Li and Miss Shan.

463
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,360
Doggie and Jiang.

464
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,670
Wang and Wen Wen.

465
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:22,650
Gu and me.

466
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,470
Congratulations on becoming partners.

467
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,220
Wait.

468
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,780
This grouping is so sloppy.

469
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,790
Why are you so insensitive?

470
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,020
This grouping is well thought out.

471
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,630
In this Truth or Dare,

472
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,600
if your answer doesn't match your partner's,

473
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,060
or if one of you doesn't answer,

474
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,020
you lose.

475
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,860
You should drink as a punishment.

476
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,920
Let's get started.

477
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,930
Are the people you like here?

478
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,120
Yes.

479
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,760
He's sick. I'll drink for him.

480
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,330
It's always Xian who drinks,

481
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,000
and Zhao stops her.

482
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,930
Today it's the other way around.

483
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,920
Okay, let's start the second round.

484
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,110
Let me think.

485
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,940
If your idols and lovers fall into the water at the same time,

486
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,710
who will you save first?

487
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,840
-My lover. -My idol.

488
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,110
Why didn't you save me?

489
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,180
Mr. Liu.

490
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,790
Please don't put yourself

491
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,850
in a place that doesn't belong to you.

492
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,700
I'm neither your boyfriend

493
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:52,740
nor your idol.

494
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,060
I guess I'm not your only choice,

495
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,190
but one of the answers to the multiple-choice question.

496
00:22:59,250 --> 00:22:59,980
Mr. Liu,

497
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:01,980
it's just a game.

498
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,140
How about you drink one?

499
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,810
Assistant Tang, go on.

500
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,190
Then I'll ask something exciting.

501
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,980
Who takes the initiative

502
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,500
when you are kissing someone you like for the first time?

503
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,430
I think it's you.

504
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,880
It was an accident.

505
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,190
Moreover, it was on your forehead.

506
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,390
You're the one who kissed me on the lips.

507
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,130
Help!

508
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,590
It's so embarassing.

509
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,040
Let's have another round.

510
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,590
I can still drink.

511
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,420
You can still drink?

512
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,040
I can drink 10 more.

513
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,190
Ten?

514
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,970
Why are you everywhere?

515
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,470
You are in reality

516
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,650
and in my dream.

517
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,320
What a coincidence.

518
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,390
Me too.

519
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,540
Annoying.

520
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,420
It's all because you're so handsome.

521
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,580
So what?

522
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,530
If Luo Ci and I fell into the water,

523
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,790
you still wouldn't save me.

524
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,440
Are you stupid?

525
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,490
He can't swim.

526
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,120
But you can.

527
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,190

528

(Bonus Scene)

582
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:50,000
He said he would be on the same page with me and would think about me.
(Bonus Scene)

583
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,710
(Bonus Scene)

584
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,640
But in the end,
(Bonus Scene)

585
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,400
(Bonus Scene)

586
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,520
he's still the dictator.
(Bonus Scene)

587
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,730
(Bonus Scene)

588
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,440
If he lacks a sense of security,
(Bonus Scene)

589
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,770
he can tell me directly.
(Bonus Scene)

590
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,380
Why did he lie to me in this way?

591
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,790
Let's beat him up.

592
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,580
I'm good at tearing up scumbags.

593
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,140
No.

594
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,940
I don't want to see him now.

595
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,650
I just want to drink.

596
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:10,730
Drink!

597
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,460
Today's article has been delivered.

598
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,740
Which type do you like?

599
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,700
So I can send you more in the future.

600
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,860
Sending. Sending. Sending. That's all you know.

601
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,870
I've had enough of you.

602
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,320
They are either about self-cultivation or staying healthy.

603
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,500
Do you think I'm not cultured,

604
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,030
or do you imply that I'm old?

605
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,330
I am just being kind.

606
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,310
I think you're up to no good.

607
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,300
Your brother bullied my bestie.

608
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,830
How dare you come and disgust me?

609
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,530
If I get angry, I'll tear you up too!

610
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:40,610
Tear you up too!

611
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:41,570
That's right!

612
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,390
Do you have some unresolved misunderstandings

613
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,330
about me?

614
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,060
Anyway,

615
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,280
don't let me see you again,

616
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,410
or I'll beat you up every time I see you.

617
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,500
Rose.

618
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,750
I'm glad that you are by my side now.

619
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,630
I'll always be by your side, no matter when.
