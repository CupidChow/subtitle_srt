1
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,880
(Love Me Like I Do)

2
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,610
(I think I fall in love with her)
(Episode 9)

3
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,750
Liu Xizhao, buck up!

4
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,860
It's time for you to show your capabilities.

5
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,789
Don't mess it up.

6
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,450
You are nervous, aren't you?

7
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,680
What a joke.

8
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,759
When I gave the commencement speech on behalf of the academy,

9
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,220
it was much more than this.

10
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,610
Come on.

11
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,290
I believe you can make it.

12
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,370
Dear media friends.

13
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,370
Hello, everyone.

14
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,670
Welcome to

15
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,440
the launch event of the Cute Pets series

16
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,760
of Qiansheng Group.

17
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,990
Firstly, we will have the offline opening ceremony

18
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,390
of today's launch event.

19
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,630
Assistant Director Liu.

20
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,890
Mr. Liu didn't show up.

21
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,370
Is he trying to stand us up?

22
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,790
How could he stand us up?

23
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,530
Yes.

24
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,620
Today's launch event

25
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,660
includes the online initiation ceremony,

26
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,180
debut of the Cute Pets series,

27
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,640
and the interpretation of design concepts.

28
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,280
finally our CEO's presentation and Q&A session.

29
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,880
Changing the agenda

30
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,750
to win more time for Liu Xilai?

31
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,330
Let's see how long you can delay.

32
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,580
You drive too slowly. Hurry up.

33
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,820
I am driving my own car for you.

34
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,620
You even took off my clothes.

35
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,940
Why do you still have so many requests?

36
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:18,930
Faster.

37
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,570
Safety is the top priority

38
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,420
for driving.

39
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:23,840
See?

40
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,990
This road has speed limit. I can't drive too fast.

41
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,470
Last night, in order to pick you up,

42
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,070
I had a bit of a fender bender.

43
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,329
Doctor Li.

44
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,470
You didn't rest well yesterday.

45
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,800
Why not you let me drive?

46
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,500
Assistant Tian is always reliable. She can do it.

47
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,360
OK.

48
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,980
Well, Assistant Tian.

49
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,780
I don't mean to underestimate female drivers.

50
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,120
But it's really hard for you

51
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,820
to drive my car.

52
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,490
Why don't you take the passenger seat?

53
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,810
I think the back row is safer.

54
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,050
Assistant Tian, be careful.

55
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,620
Assistant Tian.

56
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,590
Turn left.

57
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,420
Okay, Mr. Liu.

58
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,030
(Design Concept Interpretation)

59
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,800
Assistant Director Liu.

60
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,310
The launch event has been held for an hour, right?

61
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,190
If you don't have the authorization,

62
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,390
don't waste our time.

63
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,330
That's right.

64
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,110
Qiansheng Group

65
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,880
has prepared a special section

66
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,080
for you today.

67
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,020
It seems that you are not interested

68
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,210
in this surprise.

69
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,140
What surprise?

70
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,670
Is it another trick to buy time?

71
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,590
We're not in a hurry.

72
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,590
What's the special section?

73
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,800
Yeah, what is the special section?

74
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,240
OK.

75
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:41,540
Next, let's welcome

76
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,850
the famous painter nicknamed Snow Queen,

77
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:45,540
Wen Xian!

78
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,380
Let's applaud to welcome!

79
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,930
Hello, everyone.

80
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,670
I'm very lucky to be here,

81
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,080
at the launch event of the Cute Pets series of Qiansheng Group.

82
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,920
Today,

83
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,200
I will take out a painting of mine

84
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,290
as a gift

85
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,710
and send it to someone here.

86
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,380
As we all know,

87
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,520
I like drawing mountains, snow, and so on.

88
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,460
This is because only these things that stand still

89
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,220
can exist forever.

90
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,270
In this painting, I tried to paint

91
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,980
living things for the first time.

92
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,080
So when did you and Miss Wen

93
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,130
have a plan B?

94
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,080
After you told me that my cousin was out of touch.

95
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,340
...to express my understanding of love.

96
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,430
Looks like he's well-prepared.

97
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,520
Let's congratulate this friend again.

98
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,280
Assistant Director Liu.

99
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,850
Isn't it time for Mr. Liu to explain

100
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,380
the authorization of Xia Feng?

101
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:51,980
Yes.

102
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,740
The launch event has been held for two hours.

103
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,200
Why isn't Mr. Liu here yet?

104
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,480
Is there no authorization at all?

105
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,300
Is everyone waiting for me?

106
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,820
I never thought

107
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,850
his noisy sound can be so beautiful.

108
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,520
I knew

109
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,810
that Brother Xilai wouldn't let me down.

110
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:38,830
Mr. Liu,

111
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,020
how can you prove this authentication certificate

112
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,630
is real?

113
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,940
How can you prove it's not?

114
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,420
Or

115
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,050
you can only ask such a dumb question?

116
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,760
The copyright issue of the Cute Pets series

117
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,380
is definitely not groundless.

118
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,440
You are avoiding answering the question directly.

119
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,810
You must be hiding something.

120
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,610
Mr. Reporter,

121
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,770
you look familiar.

122
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,020
Reporter Liu from Xinyang Daily, right?

123
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,980
You triggered the plagiarism issue with no evidence before.

124
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,300
Xinyang Daily paid a huge compensation because of it.

125
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,770
What are you trying to do this time

126
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,670
to get yourself on the trending topic?

127
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,130
You're changing the topic.

128
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,660
What does this have to do with the question I raised?

129
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,130
I'm afraid you'll repeat the same mistake.

130
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,080
I just want to kindly remind you.

131
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,640
Mr. Liu,

132
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,300
Qiansheng Group has made great progress in these two years.

133
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,740
As a young manager,

134
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,100
you think it is because of luck

135
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:31,940
or strength?

136
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,130
Luck

137
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,530
is also part of our strength.

138
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,669
But Qiansheng Group

139
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,380
can achieve this much

140
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,460
mainly because of

141
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:45,110
our respect for original designs.

142
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,540
We fired Kevin who plagiarized,

143
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,430
and despite difficulties,

144
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,490
got the authorization from Xia Feng.

145
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,430
No matter what the process is,

146
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,580
the launch of the Cute Pets series

147
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,150
shows our determination to protect original designs.

148
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,650
And

149
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,900
we will establish Dafu Public Welfare Fund

150
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,270
with part of the profits

151
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,330
from our Cute Pets series

152
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,120
in the name of Xia Feng.

153
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,810
This is also an important step for Qiansheng Group

154
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,960
to contribute to the society.

155
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,470
He's really ambitious

156
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,240
when talking about business.

157
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:32,920
Xilai.

158
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,380
It is thanks to

159
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,500
Xilai

160
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,760
who got the authentication certificate in time

161
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,300
so that we could pour oil on the troubled waters

162
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,000
and made the launch event a great success.

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,150
Actually, I need to give credit to

164
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,260
both Xian and Zhao.

165
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,860
They managed the situation for me

166
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,170
so that the problems could be solved.

167
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:51,730
Right.

168
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,200
Xian also helped a lot.

169
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,120
Here, have some tea.

170
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,210
Thank you, uncle.

171
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,920
I'm also very happy

172
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,750
to help Brother Xilai and Zhao.

173
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,340
Zhao.

174
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,810
Your performance

175
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,050
really impressed me.

176
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,250
What about me?

177
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,260
You?

178
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,070
You were just making up for your mistake.

179
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,090
You still need to

180
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,860
learn more from your brother.

181
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,350
He's the best.

182
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,350
Everyone else is a fool.

183
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,620
I'm going out for some fresh air.

184
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:36,990
Take your time.

185
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,460
Here, have some tea.

186
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,370
Thanks to

187
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,130
Mr. Liu's friend who arrived in time,

188
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,340
we made it to the launch event.

189
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:50,710
Doctor Li

190
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,870
is really loyal and sensible.

191
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,860
I'm not lucky to have someone like him around me.

192
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,330
Let me tell you.

193
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,520
There was a guy who sped over on the wet road yesterday.

194
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,980
He scratched my rental car

195
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,420
and left without a word.

196
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,030
I was really...

197
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,040
He had no morality,

198
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,370
nor did he know how to treat a woman kindly.

199
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,790
Are you okay?

200
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:10,810
Let's go.

201
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,010
Help me with my luggage.

202
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,820
Then I'll treat you to a big meal.

203
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,910
-Let's talk while eating. -Assistant Tian, this way.

204
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,260
Doctor Li.

205
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,420
Why are you here?

206
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,950
You know each other?

207
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,550
He's the rude guy who scratched my car yesterday.

208
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,680
What a coincidence.

209
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,470
He's Dcotor Li who helped us yesterday.

210
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,720
It's him.

211
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,480
I was really in a hurry yesterday.

212
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,470
Besides,

213
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,080
I gave you my name card.

214
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,120
I didn't mean to shirk my responsibility.

215
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,710
You scratched someone else's car

216
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,580
and left after giving out your name card.

217
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,630
Were you imitating those domineering bosses in TV series?

218
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,790
Tian, didn't you say you'd treat me to a meal?

219
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,320
Let's go.

220
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:57,890
Rose.

221
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:58,830
Rose.

222
00:11:59,300 --> 00:11:59,660
Rose.

223
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,900
I'm free today.

224
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,260
You want to fix the car?

225
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,270
I'll accompany you.

226
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:04,790
No need.

227
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,860
I don't want to see you again.

228
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,160
-Bye. -Let's go.

229
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,530
Ignore him.

230
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,450
Why does she dislike me so much?

231
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,380
Just because I scratched her car,

232
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,380
and didn't compensate for her loss?

233
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,360
Uncle, aren't you too strict

234
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,120
with Zhao?

235
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,180
No steel can become a weapon without being forged.

236
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,180
Forget it.

237
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,450
Xilai.

238
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,350
I have another girl for your blind date.

239
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,150
She'll be back from abroad soon.

240
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,260
You must meet her

241
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,350
this time.

242
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,860
Why don't we talk about Zhao?

243
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,480
He's still young.

244
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,960
But only after

245
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,990
you find someone to marry,

246
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,110
then I can enjoy my own life.

247
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,610
I might have someone I like.

248
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,440
Uncle.

249
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,730
I'll tell you when I'm sure.

250
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,930
I still have work to do in the company.

251
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:02,860
I have to go. Bye.

252
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,100
I found you. Are you unhappy?

253
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,220
Am I awesome?

254
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,680
Since young,

255
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,510
I can always find you right away.

256
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,860
Boring.

257
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,020
What are you doing?

258
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,120
To make you happy.

259
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,730
Since my cousin came to my house,

260
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,780
he has been the only one my dad cares about.

261
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,110
I thought it would be different this time.

262
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,080
Am I a nobody

263
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,220
in your eyes?

264
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,970
Liu Xizhao,

265
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,670
you know

266
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,380
who you really are.

267
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,530
I'm just kidding. Don't be angry.

268
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,950
In my eyes,

269
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,300
you're just not as good as Xilai.

270
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,440
But not that bad.

271
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,150
Brainless.

272
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,880
Are you consoling

273
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,170
or hurting me?

274
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,170
I'm praising you seriously, okay?

275
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,770
Others cannot even be mentioned

276
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,430
in the same breath with Xilai.

277
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,820
From this perspective,

278
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,750
don't you think you are excellent?

279
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,950
What's the logic?

280
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,200
Of course it's my logic.

281
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,100
Look at yourself.

282
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,860
Handsome and charming.

283
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,080
A graduate from a famous overseas university.

284
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,050
Good at sports.

285
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,310
Rich and brilliant.

286
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,150
You are a high-quality bachelor.

287
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,720
In my opinion,

288
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,070
you are among

289
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,550
the top 10% of the society.

290
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,280
Do you really think so?

291
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,320
Of course.

292
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,160
Otherwise, why do I like you?

293
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,500
I'm very picky.

294
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,030
Assistant Tang.

295
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,780
I just

296
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,830
wanted to dodge uncle's question.

297
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,530
But

298
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,140
when I mentioned I liked someone,

299
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,110
a name flashed in my head.

300
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:20,930
That means...

301
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,220
That means you like her?

302
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,760
Assistant Tang,

303
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,410
I think

304
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,550
I like Assistant Tian.

305
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:09,850
Mr. Liu.

306
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,870
Is this a secret that I can know?

307
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,330
Watch where you're going.

308
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:15,690
Of course.

309
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,050
Because I need you

310
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,030
to use your strength

311
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,940
and give me some advice.

312
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,330
My strength?

313
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,460
That's right.

314
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,840
I like being on the spotlight.

315
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,240
I can't cover my charm up.

316
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,300
But Assistant Tian

317
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,920
likes to keep a low profile.

318
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,380
So,

319
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,090
I need you to give me some advice

320
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,860
from an ordinary person's point of view.

321
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,610
Why does it sound weird?

322
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:39,950
No problem.

323
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,650
I will offer you the best plan with big data

324
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,670
according to your request.

325
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,790
Remember

326
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,110
what I need is

327
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,020
to soften her heart silently.

328
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,680
I need to warm her in a low profile.

329
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,850
But at the same time,

330
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,830
I want to show my nobility.

331
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,810
Is it a festival today?

332
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,099
Why did Mr. Liu send so many snacks early in the morning?

333
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:04,900
Good morning.

334
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,240
What a feast.

335
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,819
What the heck?

336
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,710
Is Mr. Liu going to be a star?

337
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,990
Are they Mr. Liu's photos?

338
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,880
Why are they on my desk?

339
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:49,890
Is this

340
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,800
staff benefit?

341
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,260
Staff benefit?

342
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,620
Why does our treatment seem different?

343
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,540
Everyone,

344
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,820
considering your performance in Shan Hai Jing series,

345
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,200
Mr. Liu specially prepared these rewards for you

346
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,010
so that you can feel the warmth of the company

347
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,430
and Mr. Liu's care.

348
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,740
Go on with your work.

349
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,690
Why do we only have snacks,

350
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,120
but no cardboard cut-out and the calendar?

351
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,350
We are not lucky enough.

352
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,890
How can we feel

353
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,910
the all-round

354
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,220
warmth and love from Mr. Liu?

355
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,050
Don't you have work to do early in the morning?

356
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,710
You still have time to gossip?

357
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,180
The Shan Hai Jing series will be launched these days.

358
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,340
We have a lot of work to do

359
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,420
with the Promotion Department.

360
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,080
Do you like working overtime?

361
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,910
The top one method of showing affection:

362
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,060
Exclusive love.

363
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,240
Give her your exclusive care and love

364
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,850
and let her realize, in details,

365
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,260
that you treat her most specially.

366
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,650
Assistant Tian

367
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,780
must be surrounded by my love.

368
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,560
It's really effective.

369
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,270
Assistant Tian.

370
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,270
Good morning.

371
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,140
Did you receive the surprise?

372
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,230
Mr. Liu, this is not a surprise.

373
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,230
This is a shock.

374
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,830
Others may misunderstand me.

375
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,020
I'm embarrassed.

376
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,100
Misunderstanding?

377
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,400
Not at all.

378
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,690
I can arrange anything

379
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,340
whatever Assistant Tian wants.

380
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,480
We agreed to keep a low profile.

381
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,130
Mr. Liu, thank you for your kindness.

382
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,350
I want to focus on work in the office.

383
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,910
I don't want to be bothered.

384
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,010
Well, I promise you.

385
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,140
You also think

386
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,670
Mr. Liu treats Tian Tian differently, right?

387
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,230
So I suspect

388
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,360
they were actually in a sort of honeymoon travel

389
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,100
during the business trip last time.

390
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,960
No need to suspect. It's for sure.

391
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,960
I think I should keep a distance from Mr. Liu.

392
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,840
Otherwise, I'll be surrounded by gossip about myself.

393
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,850
Everybody, attention please.

394
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,790
Our department will cooperate with the Marketing Department

395
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,760
to promote the trending toys of the Shan Hai Jing series.

396
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,960
We need to introduce our selling points

397
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,640
on the promotion site.

398
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,750
So, each of you are involved.

399
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,530
Yes, Director.

400
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,630
The product that I participated in designing is finally going public.

401
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,600
It should be

402
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,810
lunch time now.

403
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,340
(Violent Lolita)

404
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,790
Assistant Tian.

405
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,050
It's lunch time.

406
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,950
I want you to accompany me

407
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,060
to experience the atmosphere

408
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,900
of the company's canteen.

409
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,270
Mr. Liu, I'm not in the office.

410
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,060
You're not in the office?

411
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,940
Weren't you at the company just now?

412
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,670
I'm at the promotion site of the Cute Pets series.

413
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,920
Here's a customer. I'm hanging up.

414
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,400
Mr. Liu.

415
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,760
The launch plan of the new products of Cute Pets series

416
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,890
has been implemented.

417
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,420
You

418
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:33,300
have been working overtime for many days.

419
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,300
You must be tired.

420
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,780
Why don't you take a rest?

421
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,970
Yes, it's a great idea

422
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,130
to have a rest today.

423
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,290
Today?

424
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,740
This afternoon? So sudden?

425
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,030
Assistant Tang.

426
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,610
Is your concern

427
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,960
just a courtesy?

428
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,950
No.

429
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,040
I just don't get used to

430
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,310
your rapid change.

431
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,920
What makes a workaholic

432
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,250
let go of his beloved career?

433
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,960
If this is not love,

434
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,610
what should I feel sad about?

435
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,520
What should I?

436
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,780
It's because of love.

437
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:17,710
Mr. Liu.

438
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,040
Are you ready to carry out the second step?

439
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,980
(Debut of New Products of Cute Pets Series)

440
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,780
Why does this doll look so sturdy?

441
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,590
Where did you find the part-time worker?

442
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,280
This staff doesn't look smart.

443
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,400
Where's my lovely little sweetheart?

444
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:46,600
Who?

445
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:48,740
Who did it?

446
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,130
Mr. Liu, you...

447
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:54,850
I didn't do it.

448
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,140
No, I mean why you are here?

449
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,140
Assistant Tian.

450
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,070
It seems that this costume

451
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,710
is made for you.

452
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:09,990
Mr. Liu.

453
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,670
This is a male size.

454
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,630
It is one size larger than me.

455
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,710
Did you say that I was sturdy?

456
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,420
Of course not.

457
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,780
I'm praising you for being cute.

458
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,990
Assistant Tian, where are you going?

459
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,690
To have a meal.

460
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,800
A meal? Sure.

461
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm hungry too.

462
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,790
Why don't we...

463
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,420
The second step of showing affection:

464
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,420
Close contact.

465
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,730
To make a romantic atmosphere,

466
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,130
close contact is always better

467
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,610
than words.

468
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:46,400
Through physical contact, people feel their heartbeats

469
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,770
and feel each other in a close distance.

470
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,490
Mr. Liu.

471
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,840
Why aren't you eating?

472
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,220
Assistant Tian.

473
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,460
Don't worry about me.

474
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:56,460
You may eat more.

475
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,460
OK.

476
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,470
According to Assistant Tang,

477
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,920
I need to find a chance

478
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,310
to have close contact inadvertently.

479
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,210
Now!

480
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,470
Mr. Liu.

481
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,060
You want this, right?

482
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,560
I'll get you another pair of gloves.

483
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,120
No.

484
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,610
My BMI is too high lately.

485
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,970
I need to control the calorie I consume.

486
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,130
He must be implying me.

487
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,690
It's so hard to make a living.

488
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,130
Mr. Liu.

489
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,540
Coca cola

490
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,820
is high in sugar and calories.

491
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,350
It's not suitable for you who are strictly controling body fat.

492
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,110
I'm not thirsty. It's for you.

493
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,770
It's hard to find a way

494
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,840
to have physical contact.

495
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:34,790
Mr. Liu.

496
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:38,070
You've been staring at my hand for a long time.

497
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,200
Is there a problem?

498
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,000
No.

499
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,570
Recently,

500
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,890
I have been learning to read palms.

501
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:48,230
Mr. Liu, you should not believe in feudal superstition.

502
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,960
You have to believe in science.

503
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,360
I made it so obvious,

504
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,910
but Assistant Tian didn't respond.

505
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,110
It's not reasonable.

506
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:03,820
Assistant Tang.

507
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,580
I wonder

508
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,140
why Assistant Tian does not respond to me

509
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,360
though she likes me?

510
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:10,350
Mr. Liu,

511
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,340
why do you have such an illusion?

512
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,410
According to the results of your attempts,

513
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:18,930
Assistant Tian

514
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,590
doesn't like you.

515
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,170
That's impossible.

516
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,450
Assistant Tang,

517
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,290
you can't

518
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,790
come to the conclusion from the surface.

519
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,650
Think about it.

520
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,180
At the Chinese-Red-themed Gala,

521
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,240
Assistant Tian kept holding on to me.

522
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,060
At that critical moment,

523
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,740
she saved me

524
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,120
like an angel.

525
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:40,420
Isn't that enough to prove that she likes me?

526
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,020
Isn't that the duty

527
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,770
as an employed female partner?

528
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,200
Well, let's talk about what happened recently.

529
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,500
Assistant Tian, travelling a long way with no fear of hardships,

530
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,560
went to Shanshui Village with me to solve the crisis.

531
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,740
Can't it be the proof?

532
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,540
Wasn't that because you chose her, instead of me,

533
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,540
to go with you?

534
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,860
No, no, no.

535
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,050
Either you are too insensitive

536
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:02,800
or

537
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,390
the plans you offered were ineffective.

538
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,310
Which one do you think it is?

539
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,020
Mr. Liu, it is sure that Assistant Tian likes you.

540
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,540
She must be

541
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,010
pretending that she doesn't.

542
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,970
It makes sense.

543
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,140
Looks like

544
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,870
I'll have to use some neat tricks.

545
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:50,420
(Bonus Scenes)

546
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,350
The best coming-of-age ceremony

547
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,610
for my best friend.

548
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,230
Thank you Zhao for accompanying me

549
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,490
during my first Spring Festival abroad.

550
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:27,620
I suddenly realize that all these years,

551
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,050
(Wish you happy forever. Xian)
(Special blessing for you)

552
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,590
(Special blessing for you)
I suddenly realize that all these years,

553
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:27,620
(Special blessing for you)

554
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,470
you're the only one
(Wish you happy forever. Xian)
(Special blessing for you)

555
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:30,670
(Wish you happy forever. Xian)
(Special blessing for you)

556
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,930
that can make me happy.
(Wish you happy forever. Xian)
(Special blessing for you)

557
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,580
It turns out that you are

558
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,370
the most special one for me.
