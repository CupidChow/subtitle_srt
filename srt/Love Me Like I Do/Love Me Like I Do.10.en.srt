the drunk test method.

5
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,860
Wine is the best catalyst that promotes emotional communication

6
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,590
and makes someone drunk and...

7
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,880
reveals his true feelings.

8
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:57,930
Anyway,

9
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,430

usually happen after someone is drunk.

12
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,180
What are you doing?

13
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,900
Mr. Liu, this looks more real.

14
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:16,490
Right?

15
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,370
Let's make a bet.

16
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,350
Do you think Assistant Tian will confess her love to you

17
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,360
when you are drunk?

18
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,690
Assistant Tang.

19
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,100
You can leave now.

20
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,680
Roger.

21
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,730
Hello?

22
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,030
Hello.

23
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,460
Is Miss Tian Tian speaking?

24
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,780
Mr. Liu is drunk here.

25
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,460
Can you come and pick him up?

26
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,320
Yes, but...

27
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,740
Okay, I'll send you the address.

28
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,470
He... Hello?

29
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,420
Hey!

30
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,740
What the heck?

31
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,230
You asked me to pick you up so late.

32
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,000
Is Assistant Tang on strike?

33
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,100
Mr. Liu, you...

34
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:48,990
Mr. Liu.

35
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:49,940
Mr. Liu.

36
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:50,970
You...

37
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,440
Mr. Liu, why are you so drunk?

38
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,480
Mr. Liu.

39
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,220
Assistant Tian.

40
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,820
I don't want to go home.

41
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,010
My house is too empty.

42
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,550
No one accompanies me.

43
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,520
Don't force yourself if you can't drink.

44
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,120
You are so drunk at this time.

45
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,740
Isn't it comfy to stay in?

46
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,480
Slow down.

47
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,250
Hang in there.

48
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,440
You can never wake me up, now that I'm pretending to be drunk.

49
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,100
Gosh, it's lucky that it's me.

50
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,510
If she was someone younger,

51
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,300
she would've dragged you back.

52
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,690
It hurts.

53
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,860
I didn't expect that

54
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,370
Assistant Tian is so enthusiastic.

55
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,930
She even gave me a wall bam.

56
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,530
So,

57
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,050
is she going to confess her love?

58
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,220
His eyebrows are so pretty.

59
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,000
Why is his skin so delicate?

60
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,510
And his lips.

61
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,990
How does his lips look like jelly?

62
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,290
What am I thinking?

63
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,870
It's time to go.

64
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,170
They're almost there.

65
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,720
Did Assistant Tian run away

66
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,860
because she's shy?

67
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,680
Assistant Tian.

68
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,270
Please work harder!

69
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,930
You said I have bad sleeping habits.

70
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,140
I just made a glass of honey water

71
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,940
and you fell asleep on the floor.

72
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,970
Mr. Liu.

73
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,550
Wake up.

74
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,230
You're sleeping on the floor.

75
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:29,900
Mr. Liu.

76
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,860
This is a honey water.

77
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,390
Drink this to sober up.

78
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,159
Assistant Tian.

79
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,900
You seem to have something to tell me.

80
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:49,930
Go ahead.

81
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,190
I'll promise you anything.

82
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,130
Are you serious, Mr. Liu?

83
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,830
Come on, baby.

84
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
Here's the thing.

85
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,690
You've recovered.

86
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,810
I am not an assistant to you anymore,

87
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,030
am I?

88
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,130
Of course.

89
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,830
To me,

90
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,990
you're no longer an assistant.

91
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,570
Then, can you please

92
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,020
not summon me

93
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,650
as your assistant in future?

94
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:27,810
Sure.

95
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,230
Go ahead.

96
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,500
I'll promise you

97
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,930
whatever identity you want to change.

98
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,330
Come on.

99
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,600
That's great.

100
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,159
I hope that

101
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,070
during my free time,

102
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,700
I can have more

103
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,540
freedom.

104
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,930
Sure.

105
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,400
After all, I am a CEO that respects employees

106
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,530
to have their own free time.

107
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,100
Since I took care of you

108
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,420
until midnight,

109
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,130
can I take a half day off tomorrow?

110
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,730
Sure.

111
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,080
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

112
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,660
I'll go back now.

113
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,020
Are you leaving now?

114
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,400
Yes, it's very late now.

115
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,870
Tomorrow is coming.

116
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,680
Can I take leave now?

117
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,550
Bye.

118
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,230
Assistant Tian,

119
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,320
thank you for taking care of me tonight.

120
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,669
No.

121
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,560
I can't call you Assistant Tian anymore.

122
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,360
I should call you Designer Tian.

123
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,680
But it's a bit awkward to call you that.

124
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,730
Since

125
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,740
we used to be close partners,

126
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,690
I can call you Tian

127
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,110
or Sweetie Tian.

128
00:08:59,010 --> 00:08:59,750
Choose one.

129
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,640
Tian.

130
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,120
Sweetie Tian.

131
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,720
Good night, Tian.

132
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,260
What the hell?

133
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,450
Tian.

134
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,990
You didn't sleep well last night, did you?

135
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,060
You even have dark circles under your eyes.

136
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,760
Do you want a piece of facial mask?

137
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,140
Wait.

138
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,730
What did you call me?

139
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,060
Tian.

140
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,100
Huh?

141
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,380
I don't think it's cheesy.

142
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,330
Rose.

143
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,710
Say it again.

144
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,510
You're not yourself today.

145
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,780
What happened? Tell me the truth.

146
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,040
I...

147
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,140
I think

148
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,340
Mr. Liu likes me.

149
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,830
You finally switched to

150
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,380
our romance novel channel.

151
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,800
This must be the story that a weirdo boss

152
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,400
falls in love with me, right?

153
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,380
It's not a plot. It's reality.

154
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,000
Rose, look.

155
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,840
I work outstation.

156
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,120
He followed me there

157
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,600
and had dinner with me.

158
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,310
He was afraid that you would slack off

159
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,930
so he's always watching you.

160
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,060
The brutal chief editor is the same.

161
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,400
He got drunk and called me.

162
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,640
He asked me to pick him up and take care of him.

163
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,520
He's treating you

164
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,680
as a loyal employee.

165
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,070
He always used my position as special assistant as an excuse

166
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,400
to ask me to work with him

167
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,130
so he can get close to me, right?

168
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,270
Are you being mind controlled?

169
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,490
It's obviously exploiting your remaining labor force.

170
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:38,870
Well,

171
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,280
he gave breakfast to all the employees.

172
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,300
But for me,

173
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,560
he gave me human-shaped signboard and photos too.

174
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,090
Sister, he's a weirdo.

175
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,820
Based on my experience,

176
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,290
you'll be boycotted

177
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,050
by your aggrieved colleagues.

178
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,100
Then he called me Tian

179
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,230
just for convenience?

180
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:03,850
Sister,

181
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,170
don't blame me for not reminding you.

182
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,290
There are three delusions in life.

183
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,330
First,

184
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,030
mobile vibration.

185
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,520
Second,

186
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,950
I can fight back.

187
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:14,740
Third,

188
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,370
he likes me.

189
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,750
I must be thinking too much.

190
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,460
Hello, who is this?

191
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:33,010
Junior, it's me.

192
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,060
Senior Luo Ci.

193
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,680
The Stray Animals charity event

194
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,030
organized by Dafu Public Welfare Fund has started.

195
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,430
I need someone to help me.

196
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,190
Would you come over?

197
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,540
Yes, I do. I am willing to work for charity.

198
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:45,870
Okay.

199
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,360
For this charity event,

200
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,630
you agreed without hesitation.

201
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,260
You're the junior that I am looking up to.

202
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:58,890
Senior.

203
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,310
Everyone is responsible for the charity event.

204
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,000
Moreover,

205
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,370
I am happy to work with you

206
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,170
and I learn a lot at the same time.

207
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,750
This time,

208
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,170
besides publishing brochures

209
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,840
for the Shelter of Stray Animals,

210
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,240
I want to design some toys for my the strays.

211
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:13,670
Look.

212
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,680
This is

213
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,390
a blueprint for cat climbing frame.

214
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:21,050
I want to build this climbing frame outside.

215
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,920
If you have any good ideas,

216
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,760
you can add it directly.

217
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,500
Really?

218
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,700
Thank you senior.

219
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,400
I think this

220
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,140
can be changed slightly

221
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,830
by making it more secretive.

222
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,800
Senior.

223
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,780
How about this?

224
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,420
Most stray animals

225
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,730
are insecure.

226
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,240
Therefore, we should change the cat house to a closed one.

227
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,040
It can protect them from the sun and rain

228
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,890
and make them feel safe.

229
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:02,700
Good.

230
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,800
You are very imaginative and sympathetic.

231
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,720
You have a kind heart too.

232
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,730
(Weirdo Boss)

233
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,780
Sorry, senior.

234
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,990
I have to take this.

235
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:22,730
Tian.

236
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,460
Can I invite you

237
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,750
to have dinner together tomorrow night?

238
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,680
Sorry, Mr. Liu.

239
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,510
I have plans tomorrow.

240
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,390
Let's meet another day.

241
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:32,640
Okay.

242
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,000
Assistant Tang,

243
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,890
Didn't you say

244
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,520
from opening to closing my eyes,

245
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,720
I've already,

246
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,270
at 360 degrees without dead angle,

247
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,140
warmed Tian?

248
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,690
Then, why did Tian

249
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,250
refuse me so coldly?

250
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,330
Why didn't you tell her directly that

251
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,720
you booked a restaurant

252
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,760
and prepared candlelight dinner for her?

253
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,090
We should keep our word.

254
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,550
I've agreed

255
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,530
not to occupy her time by force.

256
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,610
How can I kidnap her morally?

257
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,700
Mr. Liu, you're getting more and more considerate.

258
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,750
I have an idea too.

259
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,950
Can you

260
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,340
be nicer to me too?

261
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,830
Assistant Tang,

262
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,740
I've been so nice to you

263
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,720
that you're asking me for this.

264
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:25,480
Just another day of losing to Assistant Tian.

265
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,910
It is weekend tomorrow.

266
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,060
Is there anything

267
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,370
more interesting than being with me?

268
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,050
It must be a natural disaster

269
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,680
which she can't get out of it.

270
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,140
Otherwise, nothing is more interesting

271
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,310
than being with you.

272
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,950
If this word

273
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,880
comes out from Tian's mouth,

274
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,090
I think it'll be more pleasant.

275
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,420
Well, this weekend,

276
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,740
Why don't you stay home and rest?

277
00:14:59,090 --> 00:14:59,430
No.

278
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,280
The whole world is in involution.

279
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,470
How can I slack off?

280
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,140
I'm going to make sure that my weekend schedule is full.

281
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:08,820
Okay.

282
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,870
I guess my weekend is ruined again.

283
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,560
Why do I always get hurt?

284
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,850
Here's the order details.

285
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:21,850
Please sign here.

286
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,020
Boss, I want to check the goods.

287
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,140
Okay, look. These are all good stuff.

288
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,020
Look.

289
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,680
Boss,

290
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,490
we ordered oak.

291
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,880
This box is not oak, right?

292
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,190
No.

293
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,400
Look at this box.

294
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,620
It's so similar.

295
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,250
It's not about whether they look alike or not.

296
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,180
It's about whether they are or not.

297
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:53,740
Miss.

298
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,890
Look at the color and pattern.

299
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,010
They are all good wood.

300
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,210
They are very strong.

301
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,370
Sir.

302
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,680
Oak guards against insects.

303
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,680
This piece of wood

304
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,600
will break easily after being blown by wind and rain.

305
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,150
Miss.

306
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,900
The wood in our factory

307
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,830
is very strong.

308
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,260
People can't even break them,

309
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,390
not to mention cats.

310
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,430
Don't take it too seriously.

311
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,830
They're almost the same.

312
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,580
If you say so,

313
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,930
I'll take it seriously.

314
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,920
Didn't you say that it couldn't be broken?

315
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,170
If you can break them,

316
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,800
I'll change them for you.

317
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,320
Sir, can you fulfill your promise?

318
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,370
Sure, young lady.

319
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,360
I'll change the goods for you

320
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,360
with the new ones.

321
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,830
That's more like it.

322
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,830
Senior, when did you come?

323
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,140
What a coincidence.

324
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,400
I came here just now

325
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,490
when you broke the wood.

326
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,610
No, senior, let me explain.

327
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,780
I am

328
00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:59,860
a little bit rough.

329
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,450
But it was just violence.

330
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:03,880
Just violence?

331
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,829
You can always give me

332
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,470
unexpected surprise.

333
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,119
I'm relieved that you are not scared.

334
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,450
Just violence...

335
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,770
It's quite cute.

336
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,380
Junior.

337
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,520
Watch out!

338
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,340
Tian.

339
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,610
You need to be careful.

340
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,600
Mr. Liu, why are you here?

341
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,860
I was going to ask you too.

342
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,790
Why are you here?

343
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,340
I...

344
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,670
I asked her to come.

345
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,710
Tian didn't respond to me.

346
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,420
Is it because of his intervention?

347
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,280
Mr. Liu, you're here.

348
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,600
Mr. Luo and Miss Tian are here too.

349
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,200
Let me introduce to you.

350
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,580
This is the CEO of Qiansheng Group, Mr. Liu.

351
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,380
He's the sponsor of the Shelther of Stray Animals.

352
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,810
I specially invited Mr. Liu

353
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,930
to attend our launching ceremony today.

354
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:25,730
Mr. Liu, look.

355
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,250
This is the natural game park

356
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,910
designed and built together

357
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,430
by Mr. Luo and Miss Tian

358
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,210
for their beloved cats.

359
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,710
I can feel the overflowing love

360
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,660
of the creator.

361
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,260
Mr. Liu is so enthusiastic about pet welfare.

362
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,460
I think you must like animals very much.

363
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,040
Give it a hug. It's cute.

364
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,090
Assistant Tian.

365
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,400
Assistant Tian.

366
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,330
Curator Fang.

367
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,970
The media should be here in an hour.

368
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,700
What else do we need to prepare?

369
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,650
The boss is afraid of cats?

370
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,590
Why are you laughing?

371
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:38,700
Give it to me.

372
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,090
By the way, Mr. Liu,

373
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,060
there are so many things waiting for your decision

374
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,880
in Qiansheng Group.

375
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,440
Why do you have time

376
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,720
to come for a small public welfare launching ceremony?

377
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,470
There's no difference in public welfare.

378
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,400
Do you think that

379
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,250
I can't participate in public welfare

380
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,270
like Luo Ci?

381
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,330
No.

382
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,130
It's mainly because

383
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,210
this event was initiated by senior.

384
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,820
When we were in Shanshui Village,

385
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,480
I was worried because you two are not getting along.

386
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,280
He started...

387
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,550
I...

388
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,210
develop.

389
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,160
In this public welfare,

390
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:20,980
we

391
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,850
are equally important.

392
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,730
Besides, I play an important role

393
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,020
in the funding of

394
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:28,620
Dafu Fund.

395
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,400
You can't say that.

396
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,170
If senior Luo Ci weren't here,

397
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,240
we would have neither paid attention to stray animals

398
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,410
nor Dafu Fund.

399
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,090
Why do you always speak for him?

400
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,450
I think I heard my name.

401
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,300
Is there anything I can help with?

402
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,300
Senior, are you done with your work?

403
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,300
It's alright.

404
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:48,920
I'll do it.

405
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,850
I cooperated very well with Tian just now.

406
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,420
Fine.

407
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:53,680
You do it.

408
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,410
It doesn't matter.

409
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,370
Assistant Tian.

410
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,180
Assistant Tian.

411
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:18,980
Mr. Liu.

412
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,400
You never hug any animals, do you?

413
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:21,900
I...

414
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,160
don't like the soft touch.

415
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,500
It makes people

416
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:26,950
feel fragile.

417
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,050
It's actually very healing.

418
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,380
Why don't you try touching it?

419
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,100
Just a try.

420
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,230
Just give it a touch.

421
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:42,890
No.

422
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,550
Try it. Try it.

423
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,120
Come on.

424
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:52,970
How is it?

425
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,870
It took the initiative to rub you with its head.

426
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,580
It means that the cat likes you very much.

427
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,070
They feel at ease and happy in your hands.

428
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,090
Mr. Liu.

429
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,470
Why don't you give it a hug?

430
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,100
Give it a hug.

431
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,270
Just one hug.

432
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,840
It is said that this cat

433
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,600
was injured when being saved.

434
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:21,810
Therefore, it felt insecure.

435
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,090
I tried a few times

436
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,670
to win its trust.

437
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,350
I didn't expect you to succeed at the first time.

438
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,130
Then...

439
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,120
this little guy

440
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,890
has quite a good taste.

441
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,020
Is Tian going to take initiative

442
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,740
to have intimate physical contact with me?

443
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,100
♫Warm my night with blooming flowers♫

I'm using the golden ratio

510
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,260
has successfully seized the territory of Cat Planet natives.

511
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,520
The boss of the altar has fallen to compete with cats.

512
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:08,620
How is it, Tian?

513
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,420
Don't you think

514
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,490
this photo is full of love?

515
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:20,900
Assistant Tang.

516
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:22,990
Where's Assistant Tian?

517
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,140
She hasn't come back

518
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,640
after she said that she went to the bathroom.

519
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:40,940
Senior.

520
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,470
Why are you here?

521
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:44,850
The event is over.

522
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:47,590
Sit.

523
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,090
Senior.

524
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,260
You were the one

525
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,620
who led this charity.

526
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,270
Why are you hiding here

527
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:00,790
during the interview?

528
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:01,810
Let me ask you.

529
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
A wandering house

530
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,570
saving the stray babies.

531
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,900
Did we achieve the goal?

532
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,180
Then, to me,

533
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,630
that is enough.

534
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,870
The most important thing

535
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,130
in organizing public welfare

536
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:16,930
is the result.

537
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,090
What I learned from senior

538
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,530
is never just the surface.

539
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,280
Come on, baby.

540
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,320
I saw a pendant

541
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,980
which is very similar to the hidden logo in your illustration.

542
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,420
So,

543
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:39,910
I give it to you.

544
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,270
Thank you

545
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,460
for helping me this time.

546
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,900
Senior, you...

547
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,550
You know the hidden logo in my illustration?

548
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,690
I read your previous works carefully.

549
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,920
It's very amazing

550
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,420
to combine your own name with the logo.

551
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,690
Actually, not many people can see it.

552
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,140
Senior is really amazing.

553
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:29,770
Thank you senior.

554
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:41,580
Tian.

555
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,860
What?

556
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,680
I need to talk to you.

557
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,220
Sorry, senior.

558
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,880
I have to excuse for a while.

559
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,180
What are you doing?

560
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,890
What are you doing, Mr. Liu?

561
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:01,970
You're being weird

562
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,740
and rude!

563
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,750
I'm rude?

564
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:04,830
Luo Ci

565
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:05,800
almost touches your face with his hand.

566
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,510
But he is considered as polite.

567
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,440
It's not what you thought just now.

568
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,260
No.

569
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,760
Then what?

570
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,040
Tian, I…

571
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,280
Mr. Liu, it's late.

572
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,170
I'm tired. I'll go back first.

573
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:40,790
Gosh.

574
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,610
It's the wrong way again.

575
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,590
I'm not finished yet.

576
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,560
Luo Ci's hand almost touched her face.

577
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,820
I just restated the scene of the accident.

578
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,950
Why did she run away?

579
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:57,980
Mr. Liu.

580
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,730
So who touched Assistant Tian's face?

581
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,400
Me, of course.

582
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,710
Then, that's different.

583
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,940
Mr. Liu, you're really flirting without people realizing.

584
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,700
Now I have the reason to believe that

585
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,040
Both of your loves are two-sided

586
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,130
Think about it.

587
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,270
Assistant Tian has such a big reaction

588
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,420
towards your touch.

589
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,700
Doesn't it just prove that

590
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:25,490
you are special in her heart?

591
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,670
But why did she avoid

592
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,100
my flirting affection?

593
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,660
Girls should be reserved, shouldn't they?

594
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:34,120
Maybe she's very excited internally.

595
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,220
You're right.

596
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,910
Tian must be shy.

597
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,630
I knew it.

598
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,340
How could he fall in love with Luo Ci

599
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,580
after meeting someone as excellent as me?

600
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,220
Yes.

601
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,560
Mr. Liu,

602
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,800
I've informed Curator Fang

603
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,980
to give Assistant Tian two movie tickets

604
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,580
to show his gratitude.

605
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,540
It is a love movie.

606
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,880
If everything goes well,

607
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,220
Assistant Tian will ask you out tomorrow.

608
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,090
Well done.

609
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,160
You made up for your mistake.

610
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,050
Time to go home.

611
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,740
Beautiful! A two-sided love!

612
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,470
Unbelievable.
