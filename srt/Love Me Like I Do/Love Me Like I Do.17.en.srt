00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,590
(Buddhist CEO Cultivation)
(Episode 17)

3
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,040
Good morning, Tian.

4
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,530
When did you get up?

5
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,420
Five o'clock.

6
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,580
Five o'clock?

7
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,800
Aren't you sleepy?

8
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,750
In the morning, the sun is rising.

9
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,790
Meditation can eliminate distractions

10
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,480
and help one reach a state of stability.

11
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,020
Speak English please.

12
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,050
I got used to getting up at five in the morning for work.

13
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,160
I couldn't adjust my biological clock.

14
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,760
Five o'clock.

15
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:28,890
I suppose the role of a CEO

16
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,530
really isn't for everyone.

17
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,170
Tian.

18
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,910
Come and meditate with me.

19
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
I'm going to cook.

20
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,880
Or would you rather we both starve instead?

21
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,270
(Open a warm shop and meet warm people)
(Open)

22
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:48,750
Xilai.

23
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,110
Be good.

24
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,750
Enjoy the tea by yourself.

25
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,480
I'll come to you when I'm done.

26
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,380
Life is short.

27
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,280
With more money and treasures, come more worries.

28
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,680
Sir, what's on your mind?

29
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,360
I'm wondering

30
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,000
when I can become a rich person.

31
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,660
Based on my experience as a rich man,

32
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:24,540
I'm telling you,

33
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,650
money is not everything.

34
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,160
Being rich doesn't mean having everything.

35
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,050
I don't believe you. How is that possible?

36
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,030
What do you do?

37
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,300
I...

38
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,000
have no job for now.

39
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,710
But I believe

40
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,930
what matters most is not what you do,

41
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,940
but the opportunities that you receive.

42
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,270
Do you know,

43
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,300
the ugly duckling that had the opportunity to turn into a white swan

44
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,630
had swans for parents?

45
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,070
What's wrong with you?

46
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,079
You have no ambition at all.

47
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,030
What did you talk to the guests about?

48
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,650
Why are they all gone?

49
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,230
I corrected their views

50
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,710
and destroyed those low-quality humans'

51
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,600
unrealistic fantasies about life.

52
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,650
Your boyfriend is so bad at chatting.

53
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:08,830
I don't want to talk either.

54
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,300
Liu Xilai.

55
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,200
Dad.

56
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,240
Xian.

57
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,490
Aren't you going to a movie with Xizhao?

58
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,570
Why are you back so early?

59
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,310
Xilai isn't here.

60
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,100
Zhao just started dealing with the company matters,

61
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,400
and he has to take care of everything.

62
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,700
So I came back first.

63
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,370
So

64
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:40,100
Liu Xilai really let go

65
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,060
and left everything to Xizhao.

66
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,820
I don't know.

67
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,210
Dad, I'll go upstairs if there's nothing else.

68
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:45,640
Xian.

69
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,290
You need to understand and care more about Xizhao.

70
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,290
Get along with Xizhao.

71
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,060
Be good.

72
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,430
I'll make you something delicious after I'm done settling the accounts.

73
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,910
No hurry.

74
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,820
I like

75
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,050
this feeling of wasting time.

76
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:06,860
Strange.

77
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,280
Why is 150 yuan missing?

78
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,170
Did I make a mistake?

79
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,970
The customer that you chased away. Did he pay?

80
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,970
Probably... I guess.

81
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,700
That's not right.

82
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:31,860
Tian.

83
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,010
What?

84
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,470
You're so annoying.

85
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,960
Don't launch a sneak attack like that. I'm settling accounts.

86
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,490
I can't help it.

87
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,090
Why is the money here?

88
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,220
And there's extra too.

89
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:56,690
Well,

90
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,520
people in this town are so generous.

91
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,370
They were so happy to chat with me that

92
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,840
they even gave me tips.

93
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,600
(Assistant Tang)

94
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:11,860
It's Assistant Tang.

95
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,400
Tian, I need to take this.

96
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:22,850
As you expected,

97
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,570
Mr. Wen is contacting all the other shareholders

98
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,300
to get votes for Vice President Liu's

99
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,810
Chief Executive Officer Election in a week.

100
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,990
He wants Vice President Liu to be the CEO

101
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,690
and control Vice President Liu from behind the scenes.

102
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,190
Wen Zhicai has been doing a lot these years.

103
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,409
But this time,

104
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,540
he has crossed my bottom line.

105
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,790
You're retreating to advance and luring the snake out of the hole.

106
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,060
It's really advanced.

107
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,420
Keep an eye on the company for me.

108
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,610
Wait for me.

109
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:51,790
Uncle Wen,

110
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,310
I'm just the acting CEO.

111
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:55,690
In two weeks,

112
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:57,720
the board will elect a new CEO.

113
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:00,940
Xizhao,

114
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,890
why don't you seize the opportunity

115
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,240
and take advantage of the situation?

116
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,630
Uncle Wen, you must be kidding.

117
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,920
I'm too junior

118
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,530
and inexperienced.

119
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,490
I'm afraid it's hard to take the responsibility.

120
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,530
Don't belittle yourself.

121
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:19,810
Back then,

122
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,210
Xilai took over the company at your age.

123
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,140
Besides, you have Uncle Wen to help you.

124
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,280
Be confident.

125
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,580
Uncle Wen, thank you

126
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:29,660
for helping me.

127
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,210
You're welcome.

128
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,630
In business,

129
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,420
you have courage and ideas.

130
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,140
In private,

131
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,800
I trust Xian's taste.

132
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:40,659
Uncle Wen,

133
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:41,880
don't worry.

134
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
Even if it's for Xian,

135
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:44,960
I'll try my best.

136
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:46,730
Okay.

137
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,940
Not bad.

138
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,320
You can even participate in the tea art competition now.

139
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,710
Life is like tea. Be calm.

140
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,200
The level of one's tea art skills

141
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,240
can reveal the state of a person.

142
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,200
During the past few days,

143
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,250
your zen index

144
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:13,980
has increased.

145
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,230
If it keeps reconciling,

146
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,060
will heaven and man become one?

147
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,150
Change it to another book.

148
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,740
I read these novels when I was in high school.

149
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,740
Pick one.

150
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,419
I've read this one.

151
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,549
A Mary Sue novel I read as a girl.

152
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,549
You actually read it?

153
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,850
When we were on different wavelengths,

154
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,060
Assistant Tang bought it for me as a textbook.

155
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,510
But I didn't finish reading it.

156
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:49,740
I'll take this one.

157
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,370
A CEO is reading a Mary Sue novel.

158
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,450
It feels like you broke the dimension wall.

159
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,270
Excuse me.

160
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:22,580
Tian.

161
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,710
You're too fierce.

162
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,710
How am I fierce?

163
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,850
Your love for me is fierce.

164
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,370
Mind your words.

165
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,980
Tian.

166
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,010
Do you know what you did wrong?

167
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,170
What did I do wrong?

168
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,490
You're too beautiful.

169
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,770
I don't know what to do.

170
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,200
Pick-up lines from that era are really cheesy.

171
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,680
Don't read it.

172
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,700
If you keep reading,

173
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,180
you'll be delicate,

174
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,350
overly zen,

175
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,300
and greasy.

176
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,890
Read this instead. It's inspiring.

177
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,690
The Talent Code.

178
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,470
Tian, I'm already a genius.

179
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,780
I still think

180
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,320
Domineering CEO novels are more suitable for me.

181
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,600
Aren't you already an expired CEO?

182
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,240
The board meeting hasn't started yet.

183
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,690
To be precise, I'm not expired yet.

184
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,020
Fine.

185
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,000
Then prove with one sentence

186
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,290
that you're still a domineering CEO.

187
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,250
I don't want what you think.

188
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:40,780
I want what I think.

189
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,130
I'm speechless.

190
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,700
You're sleeping here in broad daylight.

191
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,250
I wonder when Doctor Li will be here.

192
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:14,820
Hello, Doctor Li.

193
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,240
Do you have time this weekend?

194
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,510
Exercise can produce dopamine?

195
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,490
It makes one more excited?

196
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,500
Okay, see you this weekend.

197
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:36,830
Exercise.

198
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:41,990
Xilai.

199
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,510
Xilai, wake up.

200
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,620
I want to

201
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,970
do some vigorous exercise with you.

202
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,050
Now?

203
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,020
I'm looking forward to it.

204
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,260
The vigorous exercise

205
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,140
you told me about

206
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,670
is square dance?

207
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,220
Isn't it exciting?

208
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,160
I feel very excited.

209
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,410
Okay, good boy.

210
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,440
Work out.

211
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,870
I'll pick you up after I finish up at the store.

212
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:21,860
Good luck.

213
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,770
Life is about exercise.

214
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,430
Inhale.

215
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,310
Exhale.

216
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,140
Your body is very light,

217
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,810
like a cloud in the sky.

218
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,990
Inhale.

219
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,640
Exhale.

220
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,680
Wasn't it square dance?

221
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,360
Why did it change to this?

222
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,200
How did you manage to

223
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,780
ruin the vibe of the whole group by yourself?

224
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,980
That's due to my charming personality.

225
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,620
I've successfully joined the aunties' Sunset Dance group

226
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,390
and upgraded their entertainment style.

227
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,810
Inhale.

228
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,410
Exhale.

229
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,730
Tian?

230
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,220
Where are you?

231
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,610
Exhale.

232
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,100
Keep your body balanced.

233
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,970
It's Mr. Liu indeed.

234
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,320
He's always so different no matter where he goes.

235
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,820
What's the matter?

236
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,420
Li Huai said he wanted to visit Mr. Liu in his hometown.

237
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,930
I want to take the ride to see you too.

238
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,290
Are you sure you want to come back to see me?

239
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,380
You're so heartless.

240
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,360
I miss you so much.

241
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,550
How dare you tease me?

242
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,370
Alright, let's talk about it later.

243
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,850
Inhale.

244
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,510
I give up.

245
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,520
Exhale.

246
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,720
Keep your lower body steady.

247
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:09,930
Now,

248
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,120
I'm the temporary CEO of Qiansheng Group.

249
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,460
I'll give you whatever you like.

250
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:17,970
Zhao.

251
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,930
I don't like the Qiansheng Group CEO

252
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,180
Liu Xizhao,

253
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,930
but the one who follows me around every day.

254
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,130
If I'm happy, he's happy with me.

255
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,150
If I'm unhappy, he tries to make me happy.

256
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,010
But wouldn't that Liu Xizhao

257
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,550
be very pathetic?

258
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,110
Of course not.

259
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,370
For a lover like me,

260
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,810
I just hope

261
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,810
we can stay together, in love,

262
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,790
every day.

263
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,530
So, whether you are the CEO or not,

264
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,100
I don't care.

265
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,430
Xian, why are you so nice?

266
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:01,780
I promise you.

267
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,640
After I finish my work,

268
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,640
I'll stay by your side every day from now on.

269
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,330
You can't even get rid of me even with the heaviest wind.

270
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,350
Really?

271
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,530
Pinky swear.

272
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:13,620
Promise.

273
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,260
Let's watch TV together.

274
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:31,640
No.

275
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,390
Let's take a walk together.

276
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,790
It's too late.

277
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,260
I'm not interested.

278
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,030
You must be interested

279
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,140
in this game.

280
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,390
Let's play your favorite Golden Flower.

281
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,160
The one who loses gets flicked.

282
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,030
Playing Golden Flower with me.

283
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,280
Tian.

284
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,530
You're doomed.

285
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,620
Ladies and gentlemen,

286
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,650
a straight flush.

287
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,190
Tian, you lost.

288
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,250
How can I flick my Tian?

289
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,670
Show your cards.

290
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,960
I won this round.

291
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,210
Admit defeat.

292
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:02,570
Okay.

293
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,319
I'll accept my girlfriend's punishment of love.

294
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,869
I won't go easy on you.

295
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,270
I won.

296
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:13,570
Show your cards.

297
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:14,880
Show your cards.

298
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,800
I won again.

299
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,260
Tian!

300
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,700
Show some mercy.

301
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,340
Flick me somewhere else.

302
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,530
♫It took a long time to see you again♫

303
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,010
I'll give you a small punishment.
♫It took a long time to see you again♫

304
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,540
♫Memories have come out of my head♫

305

♫A wonderful face emerges in my mind♫
Tian.

307

♫A wonderful face emerges in my mind♫

308
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,110

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:26,700

322

♫Holding my hand, we'll live in forever♫
do something more exciting.

323

♫Holding my hand, we'll live in forever♫

324
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,180
Put me down!

325
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,070
According to our customer feedback,

326
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,780
many people have allergic symptoms

327
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,840
after exposure to our designer toys.

328
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,700
Isn't the manufacturer the one that

329
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:48,880
we've been working together with for years?

330
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,470
How could this happen?

331
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,310
I've sent someone to investigate

332
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,940
to see if there are any slip-ups.

333
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:55,650
Okay.

334
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,440
My priority

335
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:58,600
is to inform the PR department

336
00:19:58,990 --> 00:19:59,830
to issue an official announcement

337
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,170
to suspend the sample launch

338
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,060
and call back the problematic toys.

339
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,600
We can't let this matter continue.

340
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,040
Vice President Liu,

341
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,350
doing that would be responsible.

342
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,430
But the reputation of the Cute Pet series

343
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,750
will be greatly affected.

344
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,190
You need to be prepared.

345
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,010
I know.

346
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,470
I arranged a position for you.

347
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,340
But you,

348
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,450
you made trouble again.

349
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,020
Mr. Wen,

350
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,970
I just chose

351
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,050
materials with lower cost.

352
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,760
I didn't expect it to be like this.

353
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:29,820
Low cost.

354
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,660
I think you are being greedy for that bit of money, so you're using second-grade materials.

355
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,290
You used cheap materials

356
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,460
to gain benefits, right?

357
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,360
I didn't, Mr. Wen.

358
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,490
I just think

359
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,270
it's Liu Xilai's idea to play with designer toys.

360
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,310
It's his fault if anything happens.

361
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,870
It has nothing to do with you.

362
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,160
You're right.

363
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,800
He chose this supplier.

364
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,490
Even if something goes wrong,

365
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,110
it's Liu Xilai's fault.

366
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,550
Mr. Wen, on this matter...

367
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,550
Keep your mouth shut.

368
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,700
Otherwise, no one can protect you.

369
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,160
OK, Mr. Wen.

370
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,040
Get out.

371
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,090
Sorry.

372
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,480
I'm a little strong.

373
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,460
Sorry.

374
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,590
It's a habitual exercise.

375
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,680
Me too.

376
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,150
Gosh, I can't stand it.

377
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,350
It's hot.

378
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,840
Kill me.

379
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,110
I can't stand it anymore.

380
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,460
We agreed to be single together,

381
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,470
but you have a boyfriend now.

382
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:35,400
Miss Shan.

383
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,620
What's so good about being single?

384
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,830
Waking up together

385
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:41,590
with your lover,

386
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,870
having breakfast together,

387
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:44,970
shopping together,

388
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,100
sunbathing together,

389
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,290
seeing the stars together,

390
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,490
and sleeping together.

391
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,710
Doesn't it sound good?

392
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,110
Waking up together?

393
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,320
Sleeping together?

394
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,400
This progress is too fast.

395
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,610
It seems that you don't need

396
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,620
my psychological treatment.

397
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:04,990
Let's go.

398
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,320
Jack Li.

399
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,330
When will you get Miss Rose?

400
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,780
Then, we can travel together.

401
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,380
Don't talk nonsense.

402
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,010
Why are you blushing?

403
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,930
Who's blushing?

404
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,520
Tian, didn't you say you'd take me to your house?

405
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,520
Let's go.

406
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,110
-What's there to see? -Let's go.

407
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,020
It's not your first time here.

408
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,430
Jack Li.

409
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,620
When are you going to

410
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,030
get together with Miss Shan?

411
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,280
Nothing is happening now, please.

412
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,020
But I have a feeling that...

413
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,620
It feels like Miss Shan and I have met before.

414
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:49,600
Brother.

415
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,510
You have to believe that

416
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,910
all encounters in this world

417
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,190
are reunions after a long time.

418
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,490
No wonder you've developed so fast.

419
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,150
It's such a comfortable place.

420
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,070
I want to date someone here too.

421
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,600
Date?

422
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,170
I think Doctor Li is fine.

423
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,230
He...

424
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,230
Forget about him.

425
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,700
I can't stand his cutting words.

426
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,510
Doctor Li is a bit mean,

427
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,570
but he's quite considerate.

428
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,260
You have no idea, last time, he...

429
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,190
Forget it. I'll cry if I talk too much.

430
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,980
What do you mean, "last time"?

431
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,160
Last time, when we met for the first time.

432
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,560
I'm happy

433
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,550
that my friends are here today.

434
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,170
So Jack Li will cook dinner.

435
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,670
What kind of logic is that?

436
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,380
Don't you want to show off

437
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,540
in front of Miss Shan?

438
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,980
Miss Tian,

439
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,250
you're so lucky.

440
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,240
Miss Shan.

441
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:21,850
What's wrong?

442
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,460
I...

443
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,550
need to control my weight.

444
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,100
Are you inducing vomit to lose weight?

445
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,700
It will cause gastritis

446
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,840
and esophagus mucosal damage.

447
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,560
The day does not understand the darkness of the night.

448
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,160
Skinny people don't know how sad being fat is.

449
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,940
I'm more afraid of getting fat than getting sick.

450
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,340
My old classmate

451
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,740
said the same thing.

452
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,300
But she gets plump easily

453
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,680
and eats a lot.

454
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,330
You're already very skinny.

455
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,680
You don't have to lose weight like this.

456
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,490
What's wrong with being fat?

457
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:54,630
Is it wrong to love food?

458
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,790
It was back in middle school.

459
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,260
Why do you keep mentioning it?

460
00:25:59,420 --> 00:25:59,680
You...

461
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,550
How did you know it was in middle school?

462
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,620
You said it.

463
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,760
I'm sure I never said that.

464
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,830
Her surname is Shan.

465
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,270
You're surnamed Shan too?

466
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,050
Are you...

467
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,150
Are you Strong Shan?

468
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:21,900
It's really you.

469
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,450
I didn't recognize you.

470
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,310
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

471
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,340
Right.

472
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,780
I'm Strong Shan.

473
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,720
The one you called Fatty.

474
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,020
I changed my name.

475
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,450
I just don't want others to know about my past.

476
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,370
But you keep mentioning it.

477
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:46,450
I'm sorry.

478
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,290
I owe you

479
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,370
a very late apology.

480
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,860
No wonder you hated me

481
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,810
since the first time we met.

482
00:26:59,220 --> 00:26:59,720
I promise

483
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:01,940
from now on,

484
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,620
I'll be responsible for

485
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:04,900
your body.

486
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,910
What are you talking about?

487
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:07,780
Who asked you to be responsible?

488
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,180
No, no.

489
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,600
I'm not talking about that body.

490
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,390
Your body…

491
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,170
No, that's not what I meant.

492
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,950
I mean,

493
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,630
don't lose weight like this.

494
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,170
From now on,

495
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,760
I will make you

496
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,020
a healthy diet plan

497
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,860
so that you can enjoy delicious food

498
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,200
and keep fit.

499
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,200
I'll think about it.

500
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:34,980
Great.

501
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,060
Uncle Wen.

502
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:44,850
I have to join

503
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,540
the New Product Proposal Meeting half an hour late.

504
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,710
Something is wrong with the Cute Pets series.

505
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:50,450
I heard.

506
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,320
That's why I'm here.

507
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,700
The board has decided

508
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,240
to hold an emergency meeting tomorrow.

509
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,570
The relevant person-in-charge will be held accountable.

510
00:27:59,190 --> 00:27:59,910
At the board meeting,

511
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,570
I will take responsibility.

512
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,630
But the top priority is to solve the crisis.

513
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,320
Xizhao.

514
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,010
You didn't decide

515
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,060
on the manufacturer.

516
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,390
You don't have to stand up at a time like this.

517
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,930
Just take advantage of the situation.

518
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,200
In the long run,

519
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,270
you having a stable position

520
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,400
is the best choice for Qiansheng.

521
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,440
After this,

522
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,640
I'll hold an engagement banquet for you and Xian.

523
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,800
It's double happiness.

524
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,990
I got it, Uncle Wen.

525
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:31,930
Trust me.

526
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,570
You are my future son-in-law.

527
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,980
Who else can I help?

528
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:38,650
What?

529
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,810
Changing the materials in secret?

530
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,450
Is there conclusive evidence?

531
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,470
Okay, I got it.

532
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:56,770
Tian.

533
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,910
I want to tell you something.

534
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,680
I pretended to resign

535
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,420
to test Wen Zhicai.

536
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,040
Mr. Wen?

537
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,420
Why?

538
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,870
Kevin was the one who hurt me.

539
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,810
Kevin has been in touch with Wen Zhicai.

540
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,390
The design director, Kevin?

541
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,540
I did whatever I did for them

542
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,350
to lower their guard.

543
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,040
And I really want to take a good rest

544
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,160
and accompany you.

545
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,430
You can tell me.

546
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:31,040
I don't want you to worry about these things.

547
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,400
For work, leave everything

548
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,950
to me.

549
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,360
Tian.

550
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,260
Are you mad at me?

551
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,050
No.

552
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,250
But you have to promise me,

553
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,430
no matter what happens in the future,

554
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,140
I have to face it with you.

555
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,660
But now,

556
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,700
it's time for us to go back.

557
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:13,220

558
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,120
Is this how it feels to be in love?

(Bonus Scenes)

560
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,980
When I look at him, my heart pounds.

My heart flutters.

You're awake.

Do you know

(Bonus Scenes)

568
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,170
what's different about you today?

570
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,600
What?
