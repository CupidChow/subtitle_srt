1
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,830
(Love Me Like I Do)

2
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,910
(The Dainty Prince's Metamorphosis)
(Episode 7)

3
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,020
(Kevin, Xia Feng)

4
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,340
As it stands,
(Kevin, Xia Feng)

5
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:44,420
(Kevin, Xia Feng)

6
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,289
this trending toy
(Kevin, Xia Feng)

7
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:46,750
does need authorization.
(Kevin, Xia Feng)

8
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,200
I'm sorry, Mr. Liu.

9
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,330
It's my negligence.

10
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:51,200
But Kevin didn't mention it when he handed over the job

11
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,560
before he left.

12
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,100
Now is not the time to pursue responsibility.

13
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,320
We must get the authorization

14
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,030
before the launch

15
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,500
of the Cute Pets series next Monday.

16
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,500
Our new series is about to launch.

17
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,760
No mistake is allowed.

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,259
Who is this Xia Feng?

19
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,790
He is a low-profile young painter.

20
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,060
His painting

21
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,100
only entered the public eye

22
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,430
because it won an award abroad this month.

23
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,070
Mr. Liu.

24
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,170
I found that Xia Feng is now

25
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,550
in a place called Shanshui Village.

26
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,680
He is now in retreat.

27
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,329
We can't contact him for now.

28
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,370
It's urgent.

29
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,250
We should go to Shanshui Village and talk to him face-to-face.

30
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:33,510
Yes.

31
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,050
Before we get the authorization,

32
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,440
the Design Department should cooperate with the PR Department

33
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,780
to control the materials for the launch.

34
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,579
Assistant Tang.

35
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:41,240
Tell the Legal Department to prepare the authorization contract.

36
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,600
Yes.

37
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,350
As for contacting Xia Feng to authorize...

38
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:06,730
Zhao.

39
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,090
You do it.

40
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,240
Me?

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,460
Mr. Liu.

42
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,020
Are you really going to let Assistant Director Liu

43
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,630
settle the authorization?

44
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,230
My own brother comes to his door personally.

45
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,280
Is it not enough

46
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,400
to show the sincerity of our Qiansheng Group?

47
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,930
Brother!

48
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,040
How can you let me do it?

49
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,940
I'm not familiar with the company's business yet.

50
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,329
You don't need to.

51
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,050
Buying an authorization is not a difficult task,

52
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,900
especially for our Qiansheng Group.

53
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,860
But I don't know anything about drawing!

54
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,540
Drawing! My chance is here.

55
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,220
How can you leave it to me alone?

56
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:40,930
What if...

57
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:41,810
Brother Xilai!

58
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,829
Is something wrong?

59
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,630
I can go with you.

60
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,210
Brother Xilai.

61
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,130
You can rest assured.

62
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,020
I'll supervise Zhao as he completes this task.

63
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,820
You want to go?

64
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,900
Fine.

65
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,660
You're a painter.

66
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,990
You must have something in common with Xia Feng.

67
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,090
It will be easier for us to get the authorization.

68
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,150
Shanshui Village?

69
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,840
It sounds like a beautiful place

70
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,830
with a simple folk style.

71
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,900
You can think of it as a vacation with Zhao.

72
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,240
No problem, Brother Xilai.

73
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,850
Leave it to us!

74
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,329
(Shanshui Village)

75
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,750
Where is the beautiful scenery?

76
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,180
Are you asking me?

77
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,590
I also want to ask your Brother Xilai!

78
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,240
He was obviously screwing me again.

79
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:32,570
Sourpuss!

80
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,659
Don't say that about my Brother Xilai.

81
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:36,770
We're here for business,

82
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,420
not really for a vacation.

83
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,250
Brainless.

84
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,380
You can stop pretending in front of me.

85
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,150
Have you ever done anything

86
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,390
besides painting?

87
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,610
Liu Xizhao!

88
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,250
You ask for it!

89
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,470
Hurry. Get up.

90
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,180
Are you alright?

91
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,110
Did you get hurt?

92
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,170
I'm fine.

93
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,870
This place is not suitable for a long stay.

94
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,460
We should leave this place as soon as we get the authorization.

95
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:09,820
Okay.

96
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,310
Let's go.

97
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,360
I... I don't have money.

98
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,040
I only have my beauty.

99
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,110
-Brothers, calm down! -Brothers, calm down!

100
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,800
(The golden turtle in the Wishing Pool)

101
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,630
Zhao, have you seen Xia Feng?
(The golden turtle in the Wishing Pool)

102
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,440
Zhao, have you seen Xia Feng?

103
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,020
Hello.

104
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,780
Are you the big brother of the owner of this phone?

105
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,190
Who are you?

106
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,050
Why do you have Zhao's phone?

107
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,250
Your brother broke our stuff

108
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,880
and refused to compensate and apologize.

109
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,620
You have to take responsibility for this.

110
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,610
Otherwise, we can't let him go.

111
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,470
What did he say?

112
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,590
Is he an alien?

113
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,540
Mr. Liu. They said

114
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,780
Assistant Director Liu was detained for causing trouble in Shanshui Village.

115
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,980
They want compensation and an apology.

116
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,060
Orthewise, they won't let him go.

117
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,800
You even understand that?

118
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,760
This is my hometown dialect.

119
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:12,870
OK.

120
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,450
Assistant Tian.

121
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,700
Pack your belongings

122
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,440
and go to Shanshui Village with me for a business trip.

123
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,010
Now?

124
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,250
Mr. Liu.

125
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,720
Why don't you take me with you?

126
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,840
Assistant Tang.

127
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,100
You stay in the company

128
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,050
and keep an eye on preparations for the launch of the Cute Pets series.

129
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,070
This is the first time

130
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,050
Mr. Liu went on a business trip without taking me.

131
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,100
Am I out of favor?

132
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,420
You can do nothing

133
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,450
but make trouble.

134
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:45,680
Please.

135
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,380
I didn't do anything.

136
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:48,909
They were gibbering.

137
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,280
I couldn't understand a word they said.

138
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,409
I don't even know who I've messed with.

139
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,940
They were talking to Brother Xilai just now.

140
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,140
Could they be talking about extortion?

141
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,670
I think

142
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,280
your analysis is particularly valid.

143
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,720
Should we call him

144
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,370
and tell him not to come?

145
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,810
And we save ourselves and escape from this place.

146
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,070
That's not necessary.

147
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,050
It's not easy for my Brother Xilai to have a chance

148
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,540
to save me, the beauty.

149
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,870
Here we go again.

150
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,800
I can't waste it.

151
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,110
My jacket is couture.

152
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,050
You can rest on it.

153
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,520
You got hurt?

154
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,300
Why didn't you tell me earlier? Does it hurt?

155
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,300
It's just a minor injury.

156
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,560
It doesn't hurt at all.

157
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,500
Here.

158
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,340
You even brought medicine with you?

159
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,450
It's because you always got hurt

160
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,020
when you were in college playing basketball.

161
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,680
So I have to bring some with me.

162
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,710
After so many years,

163
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,920
she still remembers it.

164
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:34,919
Mr. Liu.

165
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,700
Are you sure

166
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,100
we got off at Shanshui Village?

167
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,419
Yes, this is it.

168
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,350
I saw the GPS.

169
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,430
The scenery of this place

170
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,760
is really simple.

171
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,460
Come on, let's go into the village.

172
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,920
If we find the stone tablet, we'll find Zhao.

173
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,300
No way.

174
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,370
I have to carry both suitcases？

175
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,590
Assistant Tian.

176
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,930
Hurry up and catch up with me.

177
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,490
Mr. Liu. Why don't you try…

178
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,030
I've never carried my own luggage before.

179
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,380
What a prince! Know nothing about treating girls nicely at all!

180
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,170
Mr. Liu.

181
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,220
I used to think

182
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,620
you were handsome, smart, and decisive.

183
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,450
I didn't expect

184
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,380
that you still care so much about your subordinates.

185
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,870
I have always been excellent.

186
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,400
You don't have to be so moved, Assistant Tian.

187
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,740
Mr. Liu.

188
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,530
They just said

189
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,420
Assistant Director Liu destroyed the stone tablet in the village.

190
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,660
We need to repair it and apologize to them

191
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,170
so they'll release them.

192
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,110
We can repair it.

193
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,580
But we have to make it clear in advance.

194
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,710
If Xian and Zhao get hurt because of it,

195
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,390
they will also be responsible for them.

196
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,070
Why are you still so arrogant on their turf?

197
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:37,830
Brother.

198
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,160
My boss, Mr. Liu, sincerely apologized to you

199
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,360
and agreed to rebuild the stone tablet.

200
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,950
Do you think I'm blind?

201
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,850
Look at this guy with his long face.

202
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,630
Is this how he apologizes?

203
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:51,910
Brother.

204
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,640
Mr. Liu is not pulling a long face.

205
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,270
He was just born with a deadpan face.

206
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,580
Mr. Liu.

207
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,940
They said

208
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,570
they'd never seen such a handsome, rich,

209
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,070
and straightforward man.

210
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,140
Brother, look.

211
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,070
My boss is smiling so sincerely.

212
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,810
We promise to repair the stone tablet

213
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,610
and sincerely apologize to you.

214
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,590
Young lady, you know what you're doing.

215
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,490
He'll get beaten if he goes out like this.

216
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,680
What did he say?

217
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,320
They said

218
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,670
they wanted to shake hands and make peace with you

219
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,190
because, at first glance, they thought

220
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,320
you were so determined and dignified.

221
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,050
Village head.

222
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,740
Besides fixing the stone tablet,

223
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,760
he will also build a sign next to the stone

224
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,930
to guide the way for passersby.

225
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,190
We hope we can shake hands and make peace.

226
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,060
Assistant Tian, did you see that?

227
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,050
Even if we don't speak the same language,

228
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,380
they will still be impressed by my charm.

229
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,090
With your attitude,

230
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,510
it's a miracle you've lived this long.

231
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,730
It's been so long.

232
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,680
Why isn't my brother here yet?

233
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,320
She is burning.

234
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,020
Does she have a fever?

235
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,960
Zhao.

236
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,270
My head hurts.

237
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,460
Xian, you're having a fever.

238
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,860
Hang in there.

239
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,420
I'll get you out of here now.

240
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:46,440
Come.

241
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,200
Let's go.

242
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,300
Zhan! Xian!

243
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,070
I'm here.

244
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,790
How are you two doing?

245
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,940
Brother Xilai, be gentle.

246
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,360
Zhao's arm got hurt.

247
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,020
Hurt?

248
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,030
Is it serious? Let me see!

249
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,260
It's just a minor injury. I'm fine.

250
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,320
Xian has a fever.

251
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,800
She must go to the hospital now.

252
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,990
I'm fine, Brother Xilai.

253
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,150
I'll get the authorization for you.

254
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,350
You're already like this. Go see a doctor first.

255
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,320
No. I have to help Brother Xilai.

256
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:16,900
Xian.

257
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,880
Your health is more important.

258
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,740
Since I'm here,

259
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,050
I'll take care of the authorization.

260
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,850
You go to the hospital with Zhao.

261
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,430
Brother Xilai.

262
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:24,990
Let's go.

263
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,410
Zhao, I'm not going!

264
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,770
We finally found a place to stay.

265
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,530
Let's take a night off.

266
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,190
We'll find Xia Feng tomorrow.

267
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,300
Hello, do you have a reservation?

268
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,230
No.

269
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,890
Then there's only one room left with one king-size bed.

270
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,090
Do you want to take it?

271
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,230
-No. -OK.

272
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,670
Assistant Tian.

273
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,620
There's only one bed here,

274
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,790
even without a sofa.

275
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,080
Tell me.

276
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,980
How are we going to sleep?

277
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:05,860
Mr. Liu.

278
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,230
Please make do with it.

279
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,630
I'll hang a curtain here later.

280
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,550
You can sleep on the left side.

281
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,880
I'll sleep on the right.

282
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,380
Mr. Liu, I'm done.

283
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,340
Assistant Tian, you have to dry your hair.

284
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,270
Mr. Liu. I hear you. I can dry myself.

285
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,190
The water from your hair

286
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,650
is dripping on my clothes.

287
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,740
Okay, I'll be more careful.

288
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,390
Assistant Tian.

289
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,250
Why did you get everywhere so wet

290
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,880
after taking a shower?

291
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,970
Of course, there would be water everywhere after a shower.

292
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,260
I won't.

293
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,220
Are you dry cleaning yourself?

294
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:03,070
Assistant Tian's sleeping posture is also too unrestrained.

295
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,720
What have I done?

296
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,270
I'm a CEO,

297
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,010
but I live like a joke.

298
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,330
Mr. Liu.

299
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:50,010
It looks like you didn't sleep well last night.

300
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,230
Assistant Tian.

301
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,420
I woke up on the floor.

302
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,230
Last night, your foot crossed over.

303
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,910
So I can reasonably assume that

304
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,970
it was you who kicked me out of the bed.

305
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:02,910
Mr. Liu.

306
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,710
Maybe you were sleepwalking.

307
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,080
Vervain.

308
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,950
A cynical cat.

309
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,300
With the color of Ziyunmo.

310
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,950
This is Xia Feng's painting.

311
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,720
-Hello. -Hello.

312
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,550
Excuse me.

313
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,290
Do you know who drew this?

314
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,560
A young painter who came a few days ago

315
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,640
drew it.

316
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,760
My boss likes it.

317
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,220
So he asked us to hang it up.

318
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,420
Do you know

319
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,840
where the painter is now?

320
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,780
I'm not really sure

321
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,780
where he is exactly.

322
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,490
But I heard that he often

323
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,460
drew scribbles outside our yard recently.

324
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,260
He's a very interesting person.

325
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:48,330
Thank you.

326
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,320
Hello, are you Mr. Xia Feng?

327
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,530
-Luo Ci? -My senior brother?

328
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,440
Junior sister?

329
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,550
Mr. Liu?

330
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,580
Why are you here?

331
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,770
We're looking for a painter

332
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,750
named Xia Feng.

333
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,550
Senior.

334
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
Did you draw this?

335
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,400
No.

336
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:37,900
Do you know

337
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,130
where the painter is?

338
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,030
I just came here to collect inspiration and take pictures.

339
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,490
I just happened to pass by.

340
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,600
The paint is still wet.

341
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:57,340
It looks like it's just finished.

342
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,820
That painter should be nearby.

343
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,020
Let's go and find him.

344
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,540
It rained so suddenly.

345
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,400
We finally found it.

346
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,580
Villagers say this is where he stays.

347
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,350
Hello, is Mr. Xia Feng here?

348
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,750
Hello, is Mr. Xia Feng...

349
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,910
(Say it)

350
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:40,960
Say it.

351
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,490
Mr. Xia Feng.

352
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,460
I'm Liu Xilai, CEO of the Qiansheng Group.

353
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,270
I came to visit you today

354
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,170
because we want to talk to you

355
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,100
about the authorization of a cute cat

356
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,840
in your work.

357
00:20:59,430 --> 00:20:59,820
(No collaboration)

358
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,880
No collaboration.
(No collaboration)

359
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,670
Mr. Xia Feng,

360
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,290
I came in person,

361
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,740
which means I came with sincerity.

362
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,840
I can guarantee

363
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,380
that no other company in the business

364
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,760
can give you a higher copyright fee

365
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,730
than our group.

366
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,360
I believe you will change your mind

367
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,060
after you read the contract.

368
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:32,870
Mr. Liu.

369
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,590
Have some warm water.

370
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,390
You were wet. Don't catch a cold.

371
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,220
Thank you.

372
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,900
Are all artists so eccentric?

373
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,590
Isn't it the greatest respect for the creator

374
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,520
to pay them enough copyright fees?

375
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,520
He refused

376
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,210
even before hearing my offer.

377
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,780
What does he really want?

378
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,090
In his work,

379
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:57,980
I can feel

380
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,400
that he is a

381
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,900
very childlike and emotional man.

382
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,380
Maybe our way is wrong.

383
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,210
How about we visit him again?

384
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,230
No matter what.

385
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,060
Everything will work out eventually. In the end, things will mend.

386
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,860
It shows sincerity if we don't come empty-handed.

387
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,540
(People from the Qiansheng Group and dogs are not allowed to enter)

388
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,670
Assistant Tian.

389
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:32,730
Don't forget.

390
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,410
You're also a member of our Qiansheng Group.

391
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,870
You should have a sense of collective honor.

392
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,840
Sorry, Mr. Liu.

393
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,810
Is this what you meant

394
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,610
by "don't come empty-handed"?

395
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,050
Senior brother!

396
00:22:58,930 --> 00:22:59,790
Junior sister.

397
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:00,920
Senior.

398
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,330
Are you here for Mr. Xia Feng too?

399
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,880
I'm just passing by.

400
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,170
Here's my advice.

401
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,430
He is very hard

402
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,590
to persuade.

403
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,690
Don't run into a dead end and not turn back.

404
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,900
Maybe someone will choose to turn back

405
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,300
after they reach a dead end.

406
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,450
But my choice

407
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,170
is to break down the dead end.

408
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,080
Then I wish

409
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,080
you could break down the dead end smoothly.

410
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,030
Assistant Tian,

411
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,490
are you really going to camp here?

412
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,460
I'll wait here

413
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,340
until Mr. Xia Feng comes back.

414
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,270
Assistant Tian.

415
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,900
It's useless to only wait for him here.

416
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,360
We should find out

417
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,360
what Xia Feng cares about.

418
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,380
You know what he cares about?

419
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,220
Not yet.

420
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,930
Let's wait for him here, then.

421
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:54,990
Why do I think

422
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,310
Assistant Tian is so adorable

423
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,800
when she is so persistent?

424
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,750
Mr. Liu.

425
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,030
Braised beef noodles and old altar pickled beef noodles.

426
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,940
Which one do you want?

427
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,240
No one.

428
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,050
I never eat fried food.

429
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,290
This is so delicious, Assistant Tian.

430
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,490
I want Assistant Tang

431
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,840
to buy me a whole box and put it in my office.

432
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,630
Tian...Tian...

433
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,920
Assistant Tian.

434
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:57,630
Mr. Liu.

435
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,340
Are you afraid of fireflies?

436
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:01,690
No.

437
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,070
Mr. Liu, look.

438
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,180
Fireflies are not scary.

439
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,350
Mr. Liu, you know what?

440
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,100
I heard a story

441
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,880
when I was little.

442
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,050
Go ahead.

443
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,770
Fireflies

444
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,270
were originally stars in the sky.

445
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,810
The stars secretly helped the angel and led him to the mortal world

446
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,280
to meet the girl he loves.

447
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,510
But he was spotted.

448
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,570
After that angel was grounded,

449
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,070
those kind stars

450
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,520
stayed in the mortal world

451
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,310
and became fireflies.

452
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,540
Every night,

453
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:05,850
they all came out to accompany the girl to look at the stars.

454

♫Warm my night with blooming flowers♫

Mr. Liu.

469
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,700
When you were young,

470
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,380
did you ever catch bugs

471
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,400
and play with mud in the fields?

472
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:27,150
Since I was ten, I've been suffering from blood sickness.

473
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,000
Most of the time,

474
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:34,150
I can only hide behind the sunglasses to look at the world.

475
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,100
Although I can't see it clearly,

476
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,710
wearing sunglasses

477
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,380
makes me feel secure.
