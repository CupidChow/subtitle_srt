00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,940
Actually, I wanted to talk

190
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,900
to both of you about something today.

191
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,420
What is it?

192
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,900
I was thinking

193
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,780
after the upgrade
of the Celestial Progression System

194
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,260
is completed,

195
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,740
I might have to resign.

196
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,780
Resign?

197
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,860
Why do you want to resign
when things are going well?

198
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,300
Is another company trying to recruit you?

199
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,100
No.

200
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,420
I'm thinking of going back to Nanwu

201
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,740
to start my own business.

202
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,460
Nanwu?

203
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,460
For Sang Zhi?

204
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,540
If I'm not mistaken,

205
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,340
isn't she only in her second year of university?

206
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,180
When she graduates in a couple of years,

207
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,260
there's still time

208
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,420
before you can go back with her.

209
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:36,700
Come on.

210
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,980
Our "A Dream of Jianghu" studio

211
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,380
has a very promising future
in planning for these years.

212
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,900
Have you thought it through

213
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,740
before deciding to leave now?

214
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,860
I have carefully considered it

215
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,180
before deciding to tell you now.

216
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,580
Some things have happened recently.

217
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,020
It made me realize

218
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,820
I may have not been good enough

219
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,060
to Sang Zhi.

220
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,020
I haven't done enough for her too.

221
00:14:59,420 --> 00:14:59,780
Wait.

222
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,860
Duan, you overthink.

223
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:01,540
Both Siyun and I think

224
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,180
you treat Sang Zhi really well.

225
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,380
Actually,

226
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,540
her parents

227
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,220
may have some concerns about me.

228
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,820
Sang Zhi

229
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,180
is also upset

230
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,700
because of this.

231
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,100
But she

232
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,260
turned around and comforted me.

233
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,820
She's worried this matter

234
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,220
might hurt my self-esteem.

235
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,340
I actually understand

236
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,340
her parents' concerns.

237
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,540
But I'm older than her.

238
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,660
So I should be the one

239
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,140
solving these concerns.

240
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,460
I just want to go

241
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,060
to Nanwu as soon as possible.

242
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,180
After everything

243
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,420
has settled down,

244
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,660
I'll give myself more time

245
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,380
and a bit more chance to prove myself.

246
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,340
He's all grown up now.

247
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,740
A man should have a sense of responsibility.

248
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,260
Since you've already made up your mind,

249
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,900
Xun and I can't stop you.

250
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,980
Then we wish you all the best.

251
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:10,700
Thank you.

252
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:11,980
But

253
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,020
in today's economy,

254
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,700
it's not easy for young people

255
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,940
to start a business.

256
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,180
With your qualifications,

257
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,780
there aren't many reputable companies in Nanwu

258
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,260
that can hire you.

259
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,100
How about this?

260
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,420
You can apply to headquarters

261
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,660
to start your studio.

262
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,340
They can provide

263
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,380
some technical support

264
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,700
and follow-up expansion,

265
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,700
which would be relatively easier for you.

266
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,460
Look,

267
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,260
Siyun sure has thought it through.

268
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,060
Our company does have this policy.

269
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,980
If you need it,

270
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,220
Siyun and I will discuss this
with the headquarters.

271
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,380
It would be great if it works out like that.

272
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:44,860
Thank you, Xun.

273
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,580
Thank you, Siyun Jie.

274
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,100
You're welcome.

275
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,540
If you create a successful game

276
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,620
in the future,

277
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,220
I'll have something to boast about.

278
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:53,820
I can say

279
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,100
I mentored this guy.

280
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,540
You

281
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,740
were still an intern

282
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,380
when you first came.

283
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,620
Look at you now.

284
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,620
So many years have passed.

285
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,540
Now that you're leaving,

286
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,420
I'm actually quite reluctant.

287
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:10,980
You can do it.

288
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:11,540
Yes, you'll make it.

289
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,620
Xun and I will support you.

290
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:13,540
All the best.

291
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,340
I'll do my best.

292
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:33,940
Hello?

293
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,860
The patient's condition is not optimistic.

294
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:37,900
Cherish the time

295
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,020
and talk to him for a few minutes.

296
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,820
Thank you, doctor.

297
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,620
It's been a long time

298
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,460
since I thought about that incident.

299
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,020
I don't want to

300
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,780
and I dare not think about it.

301
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,180
But I think

302
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,180
today should be the day I face it.

303
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,980
There should be a closure.

304
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,820
It's happened such a long time ago.

305
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,580
When you think about it,

306
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,100
you would have been released by now

307
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,980
if you didn't jump that time.

308
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,260
There are many things

309
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,460
I've never told you.

310
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,020
The compensation you owed

311
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,260
and those debts of yours,

312
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,460
I've paid them all off.

313
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,100
My mom...

314
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,380
She passed away several years ago.

315
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,060
Because of you.

316
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,300
Because we didn't have money.

317
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,100
At that time,

318
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,100
she knew she was sick

319
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,380
from cancer.

320
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,180
She didn't want to spend money.

321
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,140
That's why she didn't go to the hospital.

322
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,180
When she finally went,

323
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,740
the doctor said it was too late to treat her.

324
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,700
I used to hope so much

325
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,980
that you could see it all.

326
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,580
I wished you would wake up.

327
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,820
So you can see

328
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,740
everything that happened to us.

329
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,380
I wanted to see you feel guilty

330
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,380
and pain.

331
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,420
I just wanted you to understand.

332
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,940
If you didn't run away

333
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,620
and chosen to face

334
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,820
the punishment back then,

335
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,580
our lives

336
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,900
would have been so different.

337
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,860
But

338
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,300
I should thank you too.

339
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,860
Because of you,

340
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,460
I never dared to drink.

341
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,860
It's also because of you,

342
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,100
I learned what responsibility is

343
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,500
and what it means to take on something.

344
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,980
Now,

345
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,940
I can say I'm a decent person.

346
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,380
At least I have the ability

347
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,780
to protect the people I love.

348
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,620
I really wish

349
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,580
you could see it.

350
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,420
All right, then.

351
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,060
If you go there

352
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,420
and meet Mom,

353
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,540
apologize to her sincerely.

354
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,380
You can rest now.

355
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:34,740
Dad.

356
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,940
Why are you here?

357
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,380
What's with this expression?

358
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,700
I know

359
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,860
this day will come.

360
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,220
I know.

361
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,500
I know you're sad.

362
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,500
I know that.

363
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,140
Okay. It's all right.

364
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,740
Am I really getting old now?

365
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,060
Why are my parents no longer here?

366
00:25:59,500 --> 00:25:59,940
Mom,

367
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,660
you haven't met her, right?

368
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,200
[In Memory of Beloved Mother Xu Ruoshu]

369
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,060
This is Sang Zhi.

370
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,100
I

371
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,740
told you about her before.

372
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:10,940
Now,

373
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,460
she's my girlfriend.

374
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,300
Mom,

375
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:21,860
I might

376
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,340
settle down in Nanwu.

377
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,300
But don't worry.

378
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,780
I'll come and visit you every year.

379
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:30,780
I came today

380
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,180
mainly to tell you

381
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,580
that Dad has also passed away.

382
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,380
He passed away

383
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,460
quite peacefully.

384
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,700
You don't have to worry.

385
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,420
I fulfilled his wish

386
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,700
and found a clean place

387
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,700
for him.

388
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,940
I wonder

389
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,460
if you two

390
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,460
will meet over there.

391
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,660
But if you do...

392
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,300
Never mind.

393
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,940
As long as both of you are happy

394
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,740
and content.

395
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,620
Aunt, hello.

396
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,460
I'm Sang Zhi.

397
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,380
You don't have to worry.

398
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,500
Duan Jiaxu

399
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,220
is a very kind

400
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,220
and outstanding person.

401
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,740
He treats people well and very sincere.

402
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,380
He excels in his studies

403
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,300
and perform well at work.

404
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,300
To me,

405
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,860
my parents,

406
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,220
and everyone,

407
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,460
he's

408
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,980
a very good person.

409
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,780
Although some bad things

410
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,740
had happened in the past,

411
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,220
he never

412
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,580
gave up on himself.

413
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,460
Instead, he worked hard

414
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,100
and endured everything

415
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,700
with a lot of hardship.

416
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,860
If only you can see

417
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,980
how excellent he is now,

418
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,380
I'm sure you must have some regrets

419
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,100
and worries too, right?

420
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,620
But don't worry.

421
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,460
I'll take good care of him.

422
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,580
I'll make it up for him

423
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,020
and make sure

424
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,740
he's happy every day.

425
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,460
So, I promise you

426
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,460
that as long as I, Sang Zhi, am here,

427
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,660
I won't let anyone

428
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,740
bully Duan Jiaxu again.

429
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,140
He'll have his family in the future.

430
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,460
He has me and many others

431
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,300
who love him.

432
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,140
We all love you.

433
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,660
So,

434
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,780
you'll never

435
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,380
be alone anymore.

436
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:00,860
Okay?

437
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,700
Don't cry.

438
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:07,660
If you cry,

439
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,860
your mom

440
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,300
will think I'm bullying you.

441
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,940
The smoke hurts my eyes.

442
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,100
You promised.

443
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,620
You promised in front of my mom

444
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,580
that you'll protect me.

445
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,660
Yes, I'll protect you.

446
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,460
Come here.

447
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,100
Let me protect you for a while.

448
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,100
Come and get me.

449
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,620
Come after me.

450
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,060
I can even stand as I cycle.

451
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,780
(That girl)

452
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,980
(who used to sit in the back seat)

453
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,700
(suddenly grew up one day.)

454
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,260
(She can always accompany me,)

455
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,660
(walk side by side with me.)

456
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,820
(She accompanied me)

457
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,100
(overcome my longest darkness hour.)

458
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,740
(She even took the lead)

459
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,900
(and waited for me)

460
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,060
(in the sun.)

461
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:36,940
Come on!

462
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,780
Coming!

463
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,670
♪And bring me joy and beauty♪

464
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:44,700
♪The moon in the sky is our secret code♪

465
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,670

00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,670

♪All I want is to hide you secretly♪

471
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,460
I've submitted my resignation to Siyun.

472
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:21,980
Why?

473
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,380
Didn't I tell you before?

474
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,980
You don't necessarily have to go back to Nanwu.

475
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,700
I wanted to go back.

476
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:32,980
I want to go back

477
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:33,900
earlier

478
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,060
to settle everything down.

479
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,420
When you graduate and come back to Nanwu,

480
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,340
you can immediately start a good life.

481
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,820
Besides, your family is there too.

482
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,060
I can start my business

483
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:43,860
anywhere, right?

484
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,260
Anywhere could be my home

485
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,460
as long as you're with me.

486
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,500
Didn't you say

487
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,380
that after all the bad things

488
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,220
are over,

489
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,780
the rest

490
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,180
would be good things.

491
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:00,820
So, the two of us

492
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,020
just need to focus on the future,

493
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,580
our future.

494
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:06,980
Okay?

495
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,700
How long will you be here before leaving?

496
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,940
After finishing the handover procedures,

497
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,820
about a month later.

498
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,220
A month?

499
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,940
So soon.

500
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,300
Are you feeling reluctant?

501
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,420
No.

502
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,060
But I feel reluctant.

503
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,540
Don't worry.

504
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,580
We'll have many opportunities to meet.

505
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,020
I'm making supper for you.

506
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,620
Supper?

507
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,420
Glutinous rice balls.

508
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,100
How about six glutinous rice balls?

509
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:17,460
Is that okay?

510
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,100
Okay, that's enough.

511
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,460
That's too much water.

512
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,740
Is it?

513
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:58,820
Let me do it.

514
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,660
That's about it.

515
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,900
I'm going to miss you after I leave.

516
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,500
What should I do?

517
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:33,980
If you miss me,

518
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,620
you can eat the candy I gave you.

519
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,420
Okay?

520
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,300
Or you can bring the polar bear with you.

521
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,860
What would you do

522
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,580
if you miss me?

523
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,100
I'll leave the polar bear with you.

524
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,700
If you miss me, you can look at it.

525
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,540
Just like I'm right beside you,

526
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:57,860
okay?

527
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,460
It's not done yet.

528
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,220
Do you want...

529
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,700
What are you thinking about?

530
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,460
Why don't you leave and get some rest?

531
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,740
I'll finish up soon.

532
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,100
How about...

All right.

546
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,140
I've called a car for you.

547
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,660
Send me a message

548
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,940
after getting in the car.

549
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,500
The airport is so far.

550
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:36,500
If I knew,

551
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,820
I wouldn't have let you come to see me off.

552
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,020
How could I not come to see you off?

553
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,620
I don't want you to leave.

554
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,580
I know.

555
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,460
Don't worry.

556
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,140
After I go there,

557
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,420
I'll come and visit see you whenever I have time.

558
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,740
I won't make you wait too long.

559
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,820
Listen.

560
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,380
Once you're back in Nanwu,

561
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,620
you need to eat on time.

562
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,580
You

563
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,220
must have three meals a day.

564
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,860
But I'll remind you.

565
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,900
And also,

566
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,180
don't think

567
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,060
about other things.

568
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,220
Don't be concerned about them.

569
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,460
Just focus on your work

570
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,980
and work hard.

571
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,380
You can work hard.

572
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,460
But don't stress yourself too much.

573
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,140
If

574
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,700
the business start-up really fails,

575
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,980
it's okay.

576
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,220
Since...

577
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,860
Since I can...

578
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,620
You can what?

579
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,140
I'll provide for you.

580
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,940
After I graduate, I can provide for you.

581
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,420
You always say you'll provide for me.

582
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,300
Then I'll just wait.

583
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,660
All right, then.

584
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:14,940
I better get going now.

585
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,380
You don't have to send me anymore.

586
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:18,500
Okay?

587
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:22,620
After getting in the car,

588
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,700
you must text me, okay?

589
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,020
I'm going now.

590
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,460

I really have to go now.

Text me when you get in the car.

611
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,540
Remember to text me.

612

What's wrong?

613
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,740
I have a feeling

614
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,220
that you have something to tell me.

615
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,660
After you go to Nanwu,

616
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,140
can we

617
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,780
have video calls every day?

618
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,180
Of course we can.

619
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,060
Then

620
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,060
don't you find it burdensome?

621
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,620
Do you find it burdensome?

622
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,300
No.

623
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,300
Me too.

624
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:08,740
Try this first.

625
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:11,900
Okay.

626
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,140
Also,

627
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,500
we'll be in a long-distance relationship.

628
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:30,820
So

629
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,460
we should still maintain some sense of ceremony.

630
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,300
Like when it's the anniversaries

631
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,100
or celebrating certain holidays,

632
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,900
I can come to Nanwu to see you

633
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,780
and you can come to Yihe to see me.

634
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:41,740
Of course.

635
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,940
Then I should go and visit you.

636
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:45,780
Wait a minute.

637
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,780
What do you mean by that?

638
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,340
Are you saying

639
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,700
that I usually don't have a sense of ceremony?

640
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,260
No, it's not that.

641
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,460
So, you agree with it, right?

642
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:54,540
Of course.

643
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,300
Good.

644
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,460
And also,

645
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,180
if we have an argument...

646
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,620
We won't argue.

647
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,900
But if we do,

648
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,740
we'll make up on the same day.

649
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,180
No silent treatment, no disappearing.

650
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,140
Make up on the same day we quarrel.

651
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,340
Well said.

652
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,020
Trust.

653
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,820
We trust each other.

654
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:30,980
Actually...

655
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,180
If...

656
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:34,940
What are you reading?

657
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:35,780
Wait.

658
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,100
"Guide to maintaining
a long-distance relationship"?

659
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,700
You know

660
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,500
many problems occur

661
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,460
in long-distance relationships.

662
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,460
So

663
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,740
I summarized them in advance

664
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,460
and develop them into a guide.

665
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,380
So you don't trust me

666
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,660
and worried about me.

667
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:57,460
No.

668
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:00,940
I'm pretty worried about you.

669
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,060
I think your guide

670
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,260
is done very well.

671
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:05,940
You should strictly follow it

672
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:06,900
in the future.

673
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:08,620
Me?

674
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,460
Quickly send me a copy.

675
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,340
You can also summarize it for yourself, right?

676
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:17,820
I'm serious.

677
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,620
What you wrote is really good.

678
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:26,860
Wait.

679
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,820
"We can have arguments.

680
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:30,500

682
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:32,620
Oh,

683
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:33,620
because it's a matter

684
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,140
