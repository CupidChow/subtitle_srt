Good morning.

389
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,890
Why did you buy it then?

390

398
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,690
Today, I helped my brother move to his dorm.

399
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,520
My brother has many things.

400
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,060
I really don't know

401
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,690
why a guy like him

402
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,820
will have

403
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,590
so many useless things.

404
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,490
Dot dot dot.

405
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,960
Thankfully, I'm here to help him.

406
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,160
It's really childish.

407
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,160
It's like a primary school child wrote it.

408
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,060
Luckily,

409
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,260
the silver lining is

410
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,490
that I met my brother's housemate

411
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,120
that I've not seen for years.

412
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,110
Although he called me a thief

413
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,360
when we first met,

414
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,120
I know

415
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,690
he was only joking with me.

416
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,160
Where did this thief come from?

417
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,720
Since he

418
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,190
helped me before

419
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,220
and wanted

420
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,220
to help me again,

421
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,960
I won't hold any grudges this time.

422
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,890
I won't

423
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,420
call him old anymore.

424
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,790
I will still do that.

425
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:01,220
Also, the fox doll he gave

426
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,720
is not ugly at all.

427
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,890
Although...

428
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,220
I still

431
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,120
As for my brother,

432
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,990
he can go anywhere he wants.

433
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,120
If you want him,

434
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,760
just take my brother away.

435
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,360
P.S.

436
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,620
The brother told me

437
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,720
he was very happy

438
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,790

You can't drink milk.

449

I'm not drinking it.

450
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,190
Why do you have it then?

451
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:56,820
Well...

452
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,260
I think the bottle looks nice

453
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,790
I want to draw it.

454
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,860
You still can't take the milk.

455
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,060
I'll pour the milk.

456
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,920
I won't drink it.

No.

470
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,560
I'll ask Yan to accompany you then.

No.

472

00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:33,860
-Wake up!
-Duan Jiaxu!

580
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,460
Hurry up! Sang Yan is treating!

581
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,360
Didn't you say ten minutes?

582
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,020
There was congestion.

583
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,000
Didn't you say you were hungry?

584
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:44,790
Hurry up.

585
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,660
What's wrong with you? So sleepy?

586
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,560
He's lying by my side again.

587
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,860
You're so sleepy.

588
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,420
Are you sacrificing your life for money?

589
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:03,920
Hurry up.

590
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,860
I'm starving to death.

591
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,390
(He's working so hard)

592
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,090
(yet I'm still always troubling him.)

593
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,460
(It shouldn't be. I've lost weight.)

594
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,460
Have you ever lost weight?

595
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,160
No. I weigh myself.

596
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,290
I did lose weight.

597
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,420
Why didn't you greet me

598
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,360
when I got in the car.

599
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,620
Hey, you.

600
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,760
You what?

601
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,460
Just you.

602
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
You are handsome.

603
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,560
No, you're not.

604
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:40,820
Am I not?

605
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,060
Then why did you blush

606
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:43,920
when you see me?

607
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,920
You're shameless!

608
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,560
You are always like this.

609
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:48,660
Sang Yan.

610
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,420
Do you remember

611
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,390
the last physical exam

612
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,090
when I ran 1,000 metres?

613
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:51,960
When I completed it,

614
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:52,720
I was out of breath

615
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:53,920
and this guy came over.

616
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,760
He asked me,

617
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,020
"Why are you blushing

618
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,020
when you saw me?"

619
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,090
I almost

620
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,990
fell in love with him.

621
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,520
You are a human.

622
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,520
He even speaks like that to a dog.

623
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:03,990
Zhi.

624
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,660
Ignore him.

625
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,760
He is not a good guy.

626
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,390
He is not a good guy indeed.

627
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,820
Why are you sowing discord?

628
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,390
Did I?

629
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:12,620
Zhi,

630
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,520
Did I sow discord?

631
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,220
I think

632
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,660
he isn't a good person as well.

633
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,920
I'm not a good person?

634
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,290
Fine.

635
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,160
I'm not a good person.

636
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,020
Don't you know that?

637
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,420
Duan still knows

638
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,420
he is bad.

639
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,360
How can you be good when you're so vicious?

640
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:02,720
All right.

641
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,020
Get off here.

642
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:04,960
I'm going to park the car.

643
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:05,520
Sure.

644
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:05,990
I'm starving.

645
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,990
Can I wait for a while?

646
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,860
What for?

647
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:11,560
Just a while.

648
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,260
I want to stay with you.

649
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,160
No. I can't park here.

650
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,960
I want to stay with you.

651
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,020
Are you going to pay the fine?

652
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,790
No. I want to...

653
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,390
Are we going?

654
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,520
Take her.

655
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:20,960
Let's go.

656
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,160
Hurry up. I can't park here.

657
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,460
You are really annoying.

658
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,660
I can't stop here.

659
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:49,520
What's wrong?

660
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:50,460
Are you not feeling well?

661
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,390
A little.

662
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,790
I want to find a toilet.

663
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,620
Is it a stomachache?

664
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:06,960
Qian Fei.

665
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,190
It's almost time.

666
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:08,960
Go ahead.

667
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:09,460
Sure.

668
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,160
Let me find a toilet with you.

669
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:12,790
There's no need.

670
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,160
I can go on my own.

671
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,460
I'll go with you.

672
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,260
Well,

673
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,960
do you have any tissue?

674
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:50,660
It's fine.

675
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,020
Go inside and wait for me.

676
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:52,990
I'll buy it for you.

677
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,460
Go ahead.

678
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,390
(So,)

679
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,460
(he saw it?)

680
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:53,790
Pig's brain.

681
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,790
Did you order that?

682
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,620
Yes. I ticked it.

683
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:56,160
Do you eat it?

684
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,090
I do.

685
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,260
Chen Junwen just won't eat it

686
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:58,990
when he came here.

687
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,190
Hello.

688
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,090
We ordered everything.

689
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,960
Why are you still not here yet?

690
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,020
Your sister...

691
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,620
What's wrong with my sister?

692
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,420
Your sister is not feeling well.

693
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,390
What should I do?

694
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,960
Why are you asking me?

695
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:21,460
Buddy.

696
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,360
Help me out.

697
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,620
Help me buy it.

698
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,360
Buddy.

699
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,220
Is she your sister or mine?

700
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,160
It's not necessary for me

701
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,090
as a brother to care about this.

702
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:29,590
I've never cared

703
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,760
about this in the past few years.

704
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,860
Enough nonsense.

705
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,220
I'm at the supermarket.

706
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,460
Come down immediately.

707
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,660
Fine.

708
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:38,820
Buy it with me.

709
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:44,620
This one...

710
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:48,460
Go.

711
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,190
Nude S,

712
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,220
using it feels like...

713
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,860
Not so loud!

714
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,180
Then...

715
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,090
Buy the night-use one.

716
00:35:59,390 --> 00:35:59,860
Sure.

717
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,820
This is 42.

718
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,090
Are the sizes different?

719
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:07,920
I don't know.

720
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:08,420
42.

721
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:08,860
Is 42

722
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,860
longer than 35?

723
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,660
Just buy the pocket packs.

724
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,360
Let's go.

725
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:17,560
Wait.

726
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:18,990
What's wrong?

727
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,960
Get a skirt.

728
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,660
She got it on her skirt too?

729
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,020
Yes.

730
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,590
This one then.

731
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:28,960
Wait.

732
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,760
She is wearing a dark-coloured skirt.

733
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,160
This is better.

734
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:39,690
Sure.

735
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,090
They are the same. Let's go.

736
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,220
(It's so embarrassing.)

737
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,690
(He saw it.)

738
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:14,990
Hello,

739
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,190
are you Sang Zhi?

740
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:17,190
Yes.

741
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:19,690
Someone outside

742
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,090
asks me to give this to you.

743
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,420
Thank you.

744
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,190
It's fine.

745
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,120
There are times like this

746
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,720
for girls.

747
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:32,690
Change it.

748
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,690
Thank you, Miss.

749
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,860
(How am I going to face him later?)

750
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,020
What's wrong?

751
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,590
It's embarrassing.

752
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,790
Who said so?

753
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:41,820
It's embarrassing.

754
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,060
Let's go.

755
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:45,690
Time to eat.

756
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,120
Let's go.

757
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,660
Why are you angry? You're not a child.

758
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,020
Sang Yan.

759
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,260
Over here.

760
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:00,690
Why are you so late?

761
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:01,720
I dare not eat

762
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:02,660
before all of you are here.

763
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,120
She went to play claw machines

764
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,090
and wouldn't come back.

765
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,420
Did you not get any prize?

766
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:08,990
Yes. She cried as well.

767
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,360
You cried too?

768
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:11,690
I'll help you

769
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:12,420
after this.

770
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:13,690
It's not hard to get a prize.

771
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:14,660
