193
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,660
don't mind how much they spend on products.

194
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,220
Instead, they're concerned about

195
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,940
if they purchase unsafe products.

196
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:25,780
So, we'll put our focus

197
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,820
in this direction.

198
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,500
Dongjie

199
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,340
is already

200
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,180
a well-established brand in the market.

201
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,100
Do you think it's meaningful

202
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,300
when you advertise

203
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,180
its ingredients?

204
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,500
I want bold and creative ideas.

205
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,580
Only by doing so

206
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,500
can we help our clients

207
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,300
to attract

208
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,540
more new customers.

209
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,460
This idea is indeed not persuasive enough.

210
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,340
Let's hear

211
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,420
other thoughts

212
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,300
from Xiaoyu.

213
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,020
Mr. Zhang...

214
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,580
Enough.

215
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,380
You can save it.

216
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:52,940
Everyone,

217
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,380
do you have any new ideas?

218
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,260
You?

219
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,060
And the two of you?

220
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,780
I have an idea.

221
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,420
Go on.

222
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,980
Can we portray the products

223
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,100
through the image

224
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,380
of an animated character?

225
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,740
Previously,

226
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,580
the client mentioned three things.

227
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,500
One, storytelling.

228
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,300
Two, product functionality.

229
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,820
Three, garnering much public attention.

230
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,660
So, can we use an animated character

231
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,980
combined with the product

232
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,140
to create a story

233
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,500
in the ad

234
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,980
to highlight the function of the product?

235
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,940
Also, we can make use

236
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,660
of some current hot topics

237
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,540
to generate more public interest

238
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,540
in the product

239
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,060
and reach out to more audiences.

240
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,020
Are you positive

241
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,620
that using a story plot

242
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,940
can help raise

243
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,180
Dongjie's sales?

244
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,700
Yes, it's because

245
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,780
I have had allergies

246
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,900
since I was little.

247
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,620
So,

248
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,940
this ad might evoke

249
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,460
some childhood memories

250
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,460
if I see it.

251
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,060
Perhaps we can narrow the scope

252
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,660
down to the allergic cluster.

253
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,900
If anyone with allergies

254
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,660
watches this ad,

255
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,940
they may want

256
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,700
to try the product.

257
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,220
Interesting idea.

258
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,100
Be more specific.

259
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:25,980
Specific?

260
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,300
I haven't thought

261
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,020
of anything details yet.

262
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,260
I think

263
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,770
the story of a little girl

264
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,420
doesn't align with the image

265
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,380
of Dongjie's product.

266
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,860
It's kind of childish.

267
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,260
But I think that's pretty good.

268
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,140
It's interesting.

269
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,500
For both of your ideas,

270
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,260
one is about functions,

271
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,860
while the other one is about creativity.

272
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,780
Anyway, the client

273
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,660
has the final say.

274
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:53,940
I suggest

275
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,100
you two

276
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:55,900
come up with your own proposal

277
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,500
and let the client choose.

278
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,980
I agree with Mr. Zhang.

279
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,300
I agree with your agreement.

280
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,100
So, let's proceed this way.

281
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,140
Dongjie

282
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,940
is our biggest client.

283
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,260
To not lose

284
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:07,980
this client,

285
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,180
we must do our very best

286
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,020
to satisfy Dongjie.

287
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,020
Understood?

288
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,020
Understood.

289
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,580
Very good.

290
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,780
Young lady.

291
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:17,820
Your idea

292
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,100
is creative and bold.

293
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,460
Okay,

294
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,340
let's call it a day.

295
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,700
Are you a freshman at Yihe University?

296
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,180
First-year.

297
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,060
Keep up the good work.

298
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,340
Sang Zhi, come here.

299
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,060
I'll send you

300
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,940
the project material.

301
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,140
Go back and study it.

302
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:40,900
Sure.

303
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,660
Xiaoyu.

304
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,500
I need your help

305
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,700
to review a project.

306
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,060
Make this part bigger.

307
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,460
Okay, next page.

308
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:00,860
This part

309
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,220
is quite good.

310
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,100
Xiaoyu.

311
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:07,740
Sang Zhi.

312
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:14,780
Xiaoyu.

313
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,900
I'll submit the proposal to you

314
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,180
after I complete it.

315
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,340
No need.

316
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,220
You're an intern.

317
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,420
Do you not know

318
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:28,940
the company rules?

319
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,980
You're a subordinate

320
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,180
under me.

321
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,260
You should've reported it to me

322
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,980
if you have any ideas or proposals,

323
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,340
instead of bringing them up
during the meeting just now.

324
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,140
Why did you do that just now?

325
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,460
What do you want?

326
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,300
To show off that you're smart?

327
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:46,820
No, I didn't.

328
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,780
I'm sorry, Xiaoyu.

329
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,020
But I can understand why you did that.

330
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,060
Someone who steals

331
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,220
someone else's boyfriend

332
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:57,940
wouldn't care about rules.

333
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,420
It's blazing hot in Yihe.

334
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,500
Have you been waiting long?

335
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,140
Not really.

336
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,380
Where's Duan Jiaxu?

337
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,620
He went to buy beverages for you.

338
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,740
I heard

339
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,740
that you always work extra hours. Is it true?

340
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,780
It happens to all interns.

341
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,820
Well,

342
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,580
take care of yourself

343
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,380
and get enough rest.

344
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,300
I'm flying back tomorrow morning.

345
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:47,860
Also,

346
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,700
I have something to attend to later.

347
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,580
So, I'm leaving now.

348
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,900
Flying back tomorrow morning?

349
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,460
What's wrong with you?

350
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,380
You've only been here a few days,
and you're leaving so soon.

351
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,220
Because I need to go back

352
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,380
to deal with a lot of things.

353
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,340
You should've told me earlier

354
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,180
and

355
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,780
I could've taken a day off yesterday

356
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,260
to show you around Yihe.

357
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,380
It's fine.

358
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,260
I don't think I can go to good places with you,

359
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,420
little demon?

360
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,140
Forget it.

361
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,180
Well...

362
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,420
Can't you stay here

363
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,540
two more days?

364
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,420
I can't.

365
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,380
What?

366
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:26,340
I...

367
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,220
I...

368
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:31,900
Hey.

369
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,700
Don't you feel embarrassed

370
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,500
crying

371
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,660
down at your workplace?

372
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:36,740
Well,

373
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,780
I have nothing to do here,

374
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,500
except for

375
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,900
sitting on the couch at his place every day.

376
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,820
I'm like a watchdog.

377
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:47,820
I mean it.

378
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:49,780
Hey.

379
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,420
Something's wrong with you.

380
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,300
Did something bad happen at work?

381
00:16:59,380 --> 00:16:59,820
I knew it.

382
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,340
Here's the thing.

383
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,180
Listen.

384
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,660
If you're not happy,

385
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,180

00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:55,660
propose

577
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,860
the idea for the ad.

578
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,620
The idea for this ad

579
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,980
is to use

580
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,900
the view of a little girl.

581
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,940
This little girl

582
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,780
has suffered from allergies since infancy,

583
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,620
and she can't eat or drink anything

584
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,180
she wants.

585
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:12,980
She'll be using

586
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,660
our skincare product,

587
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,260
and she's protected

588
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,380
by a little spirit.

589
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,100
So this little spirit

590
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,020
is a symbol of Dongjie Lotion.

591
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,940
The ad

592
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,940
lasts about 30 seconds.

593
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,780
The plot will revolve

594
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,100
around the little girl

595
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,780
and Dongjie Lotion.

596
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,780
We'll build a character image

597
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,140
for the users.

598
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,220
Hence, the image of a little girl

599
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:33,860
can always

600
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,180
remind them of Dongjie.

601
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,620
Apart from that,

602
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,740
we can build

603
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,860
a brand image

604
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,820
to portray the traits of the brand,

605
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,940
which are pure, gorgeous,

606
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,340
and reassuring.

607
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,100
Lastly, we can highlight

608
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,500
that Dongjie is a natural product.

609
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,580
And that's it for the idea.

610
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,660
We'll proceed with the details

611
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,580
afterward.

612
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,940
I like

613
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,660
the story of the allergic girl.

614
00:26:59,180 --> 00:26:59,860
But

615
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,780
I think the production fee

616
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:02,900
might exceed

617
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,940
our budget.

618
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:06,940
We offer you a fair price.

619
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,180
It may be difficult
when it comes to the character design

620
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,900
and the shooting.

621
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,100
Anyway, I believe

622
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,340
the more challenging it is,

623
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,060
the more we have to try it.

624
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,260
Also, I'm confident

625
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,940
to provide you

626
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,580
with a perfect outcome.

627
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,140
All right.

628
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,180
We'll use

629
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,980
the story of the little girl.

630
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,100
Sir, what about the contract?

631
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,740
Make amendments to the contract.

632
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,620
We'll sign it as quickly as possible.

633
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,340
This must be

634
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,620
a perfect collaboration.

635
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,060
Thank you.

636
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,180
Let's go.

637
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,420
Xiaoyu, see them off.

638
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,020
See them off.

639
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:40,940
This way, please.

640
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,660
Sure. Take care.

641
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,060
Sang Zhi.

642
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,180
You're smart.

643
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,780
You have an amazing brain.

644
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:58,860
You could come up

645
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,340
with such a brilliant idea

646
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,860
for us to secure this project.

647
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,340
You know what this is?

648
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,040
You've done an excellent job, rookie.

649
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,460
If you pull your weight

650
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,460
and do well on this proposal,

651
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,220
the entire team will get a bonus.

652
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,500
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

653
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,580
Mr. Zhang, brilliant decision.

654
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,100
I've never seen you all

655
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,300
with such happy faces.

656
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,740
You're so money-obsessed.

657
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,780
Do your work well.

658
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,300
Sure thing.

659
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:23,780
You got this.

660
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:24,460
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

661
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,180
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

662
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,260
Sang Zhi.

663
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,300
Thank you.

664
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,180
It's cool.

665
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,380
Wan.

666
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,820
Your internship is about to be over.

667
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,060
Let's go for a meal this weekend.

668
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:34,860
It's on me.

669
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,620
Sure.

670
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,340
I can't go on weekends.

671
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,420
I have plans.

672
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,660
Do you?

673
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:40,980
A date with someone?

674
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,100
Don't be so nosy.

675
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,300
I'm inside now.

676
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,380
Where are you?

677
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,820
I'm going to...

678
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,300
Have you arrived?

679
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,420
What are you doing there?

680
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,220
Wait for me there.

681
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,060
I'll go downstairs.

682
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,300
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

683
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:30,860
Will it be...

684
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,100
Change your shoes first.

685
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,420
You can look around.

686
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,260
This is the kitchen.

687
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,020
There are two rooms

688
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,060
inside here.

689
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,740
This room has a bigger balcony.

690
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,060
It's your room.

691
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,140
So,

692
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,180
are we living together?

693
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,260
No.

694
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,460
I thought

695
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,220
of giving you

696
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,300
a place to rest

697
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:24,780
when you get tired

698
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,900
from studying.

699
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,300
Let's go grab something to eat.

700
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:35,660
By the way,

701
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,460
you haven't told me

702
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:40,540
how much

703
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,860
the rental is every month.

704
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,020
Is it expensive?

705
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,460
If it's expensive,

706
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,220
you don't have to rent this place.

707
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,660
You're afraid that I can't afford this?

708
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:52,860
No, I didn't mean that.

709
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:54,980
I don't want you

710
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,420
to waste money.

711
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,500
I can afford the rental.

712
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,340
I'm renting this house

713
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,260
because

714
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,180
it's near your campus

715
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,940
and you can have

716
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,740
more rest.

717
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,860
Give me your hand.

718
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,660
Why?

719
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,700
From now on,

720
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,740
this is our home.

721
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,420
Hello, ma'am.

722
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,620
This is Room 202.

723
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,900
I think something's wrong
with the air-conditioner.

724
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,660
What can I do?

725
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,140
It's summer break now

726
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,540
and the technician isn't on duty.

727
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,780
No one can fix it now.

728
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,820
You have to wait until the next semester starts.

729
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,700
Can I get

730
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,220
a technician myself?

731
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,060
I don't think that's a good idea.

732
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,260
If the air-conditioner goes wrong after that,

733
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,340
you have to pay for it.

734
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,060
But the room is stifling.

735
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,340
You might have to figure something out yourself.

736
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,500
All right, bye-bye.

737
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,220
Hello, Jiaxu.

738
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,460
What are you doing, kiddo?

739
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,540
Have you had dinner?

740
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,620
I have.

741
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,340
But the air-conditioner in my dorm
isn't working well.

742
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,500
The room is stifling.

743
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,020
I see.

744
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,460
I'll go and fetch you now.

745
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,260
Fetch me?

746
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,260
To where?

747
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,020
My place.

748
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,460
Wait for me at the campus.

749
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,540
I'll be on my way now.

750
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:46,940
All right.

751
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,340
So cool.

752
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,220
Here.

753
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,740
It must be hot in your room.

754
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,620
Change your shoes.

755
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,420
Take a look.

756
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,220
Anything you want to eat now?

757
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,180
I bought

758
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,140
all your favorite snacks

759
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:21,940
for you.

760
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,700
Today, I'll eat

761
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:29,780
this

762
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:31,860
and...

763
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:35,700
This.

764
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:36,900
How about this?

765
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,380
I'm all good with these.

766
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,220
I'll eat the rest tomorrow.

767
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,420
Okay.

768
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,020
Have a taste.

769
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,460
You go first.

770
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,460
You don't want it?

771
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,860
You take the first bite.

772
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:03,820
Tastes good?

773
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,500
You can eat all these every day

774
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,340
after you move in here.

775
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,580
I'll go and tidy up the place.

776
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,980
Do you want to take a shower?

777
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,900
I've prepared all toiletries for you

778
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,940
in the bathroom.

779
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,780
You were sweating in your dorm, no?

780
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,660
Go ahead and wash up.

781
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,340
All right.

782
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,420
Off I go.

783
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,620
Are you done?

784
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:12,660
(He...)

785
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,780
(He's wearing pajamas.)

786
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,340
Why are you standing there?

787
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,540
I'm working.

788
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:27,900
I'm playing games.

789
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,220
Is it what you played before?

790
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,660
Come and play with me.

791
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,100
Have you tried this before?

792
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,460
Let me show you.

793
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,620
The first skill.

794
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,140
Shoot. Shoot outward.

795
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,780
The second skill is range.

796
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,540
I'm teaching you now.

797
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,220
Give it a try.

798
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,100
Here.

799
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,860
Purchase the equipment.

800
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,780
Attack them with the skills.

801
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,380
Focus.

Run.

807
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,140
Run.

808
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:58,980
It's fine.

809
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,260
You did very well.

810
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,780
I'll go get some snacks.

811
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:06,780
You...

812
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,420
Let me check.

813
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,580
No rush.

814
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,300
I...

815
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,340

work tomorrow, right?

833
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,180
Maybe you should go to bed now.

834
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:22,980
Yes.

835
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,820
I'm sleepy.

836
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,700
I think

837
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,020
I better rest now.

838
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,580
I need to go to work early.

839
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,460
I still have to work on something.

840
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,900
Remember to lock your door.

841
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,300
Morning.

842
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,100
Morning.

843
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,100
I'll make breakfast.

844
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:25,460
Let me help you.

845
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,100
Try it.

846
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:50,900
Oh, right.

847
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,340
Are you getting off work late

848
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,500
today?

849
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,340
Tell me before you leave.

850
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,340
I'll pick you up.

851
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,380
There's no need.

852
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,780
I can head home myself.

853
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,220
Besides, your game

854
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,580
is proceeding into the testing phase soon, no?

855
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,780
My internship is about to end.

856
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:07,700
After that,

857
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,420
we can have more free time

858
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,820
to hang out.

859
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:12,500
All right.

860
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,620
When the testing phase is over,

861
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:16,900
