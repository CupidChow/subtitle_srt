I'll get you a bowl.

187
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,160
Does Jiaxu have a girlfriend now?

188
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,710
I guess so.

189
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,230
I heard it from Qian Fei.

190
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,840
Hey, I got you a bowl.

191
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,330
[Jiaxu, I heard that
you got yourself a girlfriend?]

192
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,510
This must be fake.

193
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,310
I don't think it's real.

194
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,920
It's possible

195
00:19:58,990 --> 00:19:59,990
that he was lying to Yan.

196
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,880
(If so, can you show me)

197
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,070
(her picture when you find one?)

198
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,270
Sure.

199
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,920
I'll show you my girlfriend's picture
when I find one.

200
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:13,790
I'll remember it.

201
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,710
You made me a promise.

202
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,920
(Should I ask him)

203
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,510
(personally?)

204
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,510
Hello?

205
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,680
Hello, Sang Zhi?

206
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,120
Why didn't you head

207
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,030
to your tuition class?

208
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:39,960
Do you know what time it is?

209
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,030
I'm in Yihe.

210
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,160
Where?

211
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,640
Yihe?

212
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,470
Why did you go there?

213
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,470
My online dating partner told me to come.

214
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,400
You...

215
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,600
Which part of Yihe are you in right now?

216
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,440
The airport.

217
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,030
Don't move.

218
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,400
I'll tell Duan Jiaxu to pick you up.

219
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,790
Listen up.

220
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,790
If you go and find your

221
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,070
so-called "online dating partner" right now,

222
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,360
I'll teach you a lesson

223
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,440
when you come back.

224
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,470
Hello, Dad?

225
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,790
Have you found her?

226
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:33,790
Yeah.

227
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,400
Where is she?

228
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,070
Hello?

229
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:47,640
Zhi.

230
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,070
Zhi,

231
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,070
didn't you promise us

232
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,360
that you would stay away from

233
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,510
that online dating partner of yours?

234
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:53,880
Stop it.

235
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,750
Just stop.

236
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,510
Zhi.

237
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,510
Zhi?

238
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,120
Don't run around in the airport.

239
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,640
Safety first, okay?

240
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,160
It's best to stay in areas with airport staff

241
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,440
and cops around.

242
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:05,640
If someone tries

243
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,440
to approach you,

244
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,680
you must find the cops,

245
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,790
understood?

246
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,120
By the way,

247
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,960
Yan will call Duan Jiaxu

248
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,750
to pick you up.

249
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,030

375
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,620
No. It's just a cold.

376
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:52,620
I'm fine.

377
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,290
Are you sure you don't want to eat anything?

378
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,620
It's your gift.

379
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,570
It's mine?

380
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:17,940
Can I unwrap it?

381
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,140
So,

382
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,220
you still remember me, huh?

383
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,530
I love your gift.

384
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,290
Thank you.

385
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,010
Let me answer a call.

386
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,090
I picked her up.

387
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,340
Alright.

388
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:55,460
You must listen

389
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,050
to your parents after returning home.

390
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,010
Don't let this

391
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,130
affect your study,

392
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:01,820
okay?

393
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,130
You don't need to tell me anymore.

394
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:13,740
What?

395
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,820
(You don't need to tell me anymore)

396
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:20,610
(if you get yourself a girlfriend.)

397
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:54,780
Isn't this

398
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,090
the bear plush toy I got for you?

399
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,650
It's for you.

400
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,570
I wish you

401
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:08,740
happiness.

402
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,650
You must stay happy too.

403
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,420
I'll make a move first.

404
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:20,740
Goodbye.

405
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:42,740
Go now.

406
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:44,740
Little demon.

407
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,210
Forget it.

408
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,420
I'll spare you this time.

409
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:07,300
Let's go home.

410
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,690
Mom has already

411
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,170
taken a day off for you for the private lessons.

412
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,340
I won't be able

413
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,340
to help you out

414
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,300
if our parents scold you when we get back.

415
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:25,740
If so...

416
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:29,980
If so...

417
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,300
What about this?

418
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,690
Let's buy some

419
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,570
Deep-Fried Shredded Duck with Mashed Taro.

420
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,380
But...

421
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,380
Alright now.

422
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,420
Alright now.

423
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,740
You just fell out of love.

424
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,460
It's not a big deal.

425
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,210
What about this?

426
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,820
I'll buy you the last several volumes

427
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,900
of the comic you read, okay?

428
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:00,900
What about this?

429
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,900
I'll find someone

430
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,170
to beat him up, okay?

431
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:07,820
That doesn't work either?

432
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:11,650
Good girl. I'm here for you.

433
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,380
I'm here for you.

434
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,420
Don't cry, okay?

435
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:24,940
There, there.

436
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,860
You're back.

437
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,780
What's wrong? Was your clothing too thin?

438
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,610
Go and put on something thicker.

439
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:01,740
Wash your hands and join us for dinner.

440
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,460
Go and get changed first.

441
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:07,980
Everything will be fine.

442
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,650
I know you're heartbroken.

443
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,730
However, I need to remind you of

444
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,900
the severity of the situation.

445
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,500
Did you know

446
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,500
that our parents were worried about you?

447
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,020
Little demon,

448
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:33,650
at your age,

449
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,690
you should study hard.

450
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,530
Never get into puppy love.

451
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,050
Besides,

452
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:40,210
you stole your ID card in order
to purchase a flight ticket.

453
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:40,860
What if

454
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,690
you had encountered a crook?

455
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:47,460
Stop pretending to be dead. Give me a nod.

456
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,130
(There was no online dating partner.)

457
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,500
(I just wanted to ask him)

458
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,650
(whether)

459
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,340
(he still remembered our promise.)

460
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:35,380
♪Love is when butterflies flutter in my heart♪

461
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:39,750
♪And ripples of excitement
sprawling across my vision♪

462
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,180
♪Trying to hide the happiness under a calm face♪

463
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,350
♪But I can't contain my joy♪

464
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,380
♪I have someone I really like♪

465
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:01,920
♪My heart jingles when I think of you♪

466
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,580
♪I wish I could read your mind♪

467
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:12,820
♪To find out if you like me too♪
