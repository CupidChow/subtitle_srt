17
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,660
Bring him here.

18
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,540
He is coming down.

19
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,780
Maybe I should leave you here.

20
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,020
See you.

21
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,660
I thought we were having a BBQ.

22
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,180
You seem to

23
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,140
enjoy standing here.

24
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,460
All right. Go on.

25
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,340
Give me the phone.

26
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:15,860
And the bag.

27
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,660
Can't you be more reserved?

28
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,300
What's wrong now?

29
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,300
I'm here for my boyfriend.

30
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,540
Why should I be reserved?

31
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,700
You're weird.

32
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,620
Are you sure Duan Jiaxu was the one

33
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,540
who wooed you?

34
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,460
What is that supposed to mean?

35
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,740
Just asking.

36
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,980
Don't spin any stories.

37
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,580
Mind your language.

38
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,620
I wasn't saying,

39
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,940
I was asking.

40
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,460
You were implying something.

41
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,300
I was asking...

42
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,780
What are you arguing about?

43
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,460
Get in the car.

44
00:02:59,300 --> 00:02:59,980
Ignore him.

45
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:00,780
Let's go.

46
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,380
Sorry for the long wait.

47
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,180
Are you hungry?

48
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,460
No.

49
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,100
Are you hungry?

50
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,740
Not yet.

51
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,060
What?

52
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,460
Do me a favor.

53
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,180
Please don't do anything

54
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,700
you shouldn't do inside my car.

55
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,540
Thank you.

56
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,700
What shouldn't we do here?

57
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:58,780
Just drive.

58
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,380
What?

59
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:02,940
Do you take me

60
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,060
as your personal driver?

61
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:05,820
Yan.

62
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,180
Be honest with me.

63
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,180
Do you envy us a lot?

64
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,020
Fine, little demon.

65
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:11,660
Duan Jiaxu.

66
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,420
Tell me something.

68
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,180
in college,

69
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:14,860
we moved to another dorm.

70
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,500
My sister...

71
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,660
Shut it.

72
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,140
Let go.

73
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,620
Just drive.

74
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,100
All right.

75
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,100
Welcome to Yan's personal ride.

76
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,900
Please fasten your seat belts.

77
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,620
May I know

78
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,900
if the temperature is alright?

79
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,540
If so,

80
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,100
please give me a five-star rating.

81
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:36,820
Today...

82
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,540
Shut it. Just drive.

83
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,140
Your brother talks a lot.

84
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:50,700
I'm hungry.

85
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,260
You must be starving.

86
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,620
I just ate.

87
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,620
Coming.

88
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,900
Hurry up!

89
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,820
We've been waiting for ages.

90
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,580
What took you...

91
00:04:59,460 --> 00:04:59,940
What's going on?

92
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,620
You don't know?

93
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,180
I don't.

94
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,060
I'm not telling you.

95
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,020
Hello, gentlemen.

96
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:04,540
Hi.

97
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,580
Take your seats.

98
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,100
Hello, Qian Fei.

99
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,700
I forgot to introduce her.

100
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,260
This is my girlfriend.

101
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,220
Hold on.

102
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,780
When we graduated,

103
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,620
we two

104
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,060
were taking photos.

105
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,980
Wang Jun asked

106
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,780
who she was.

107
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,060
You said she was your sister.

108
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,620
Yeah.

109
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,580
Back then,

110
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,700
I had a crush on her.

111
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,140
I was too embarrassed to say it.

112
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:28,660
Sang Yan.

113
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,140
Did you know?

114
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:29,540
Sang Yan.

115
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,660
Are you and Duan

116
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,180
already...

117
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:31,460
Yeah.

118
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,060
Order the food already.

119
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,340
The bill is on me tonight.

120
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,380
I'm starving.

121
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,140
Excuse me!

122
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:36,900
Menu, please.

123
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,700
Do you have pork knuckles?

124
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,380
It's already been three months?

125
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,420
No, wait. Hear me out.

126
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,140
Qian Fei!

127
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,420
We should congratulate him.

128
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,260
Congratulations.

129
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,300
Congratulations.

130
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:46,980
This is too sudden.

131
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,980
Thank you.

132
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,580
Cheers.

133
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,900
I was going to tell you.

134
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:50,620
I'll go first.

135
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,300
Take it easy.

136
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,420
I'll be fine.

137
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,220
So,

138
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,580
have you found the right confinement center?

139
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:58,860
No?

140
00:05:59,220 --> 00:05:59,780
Are you going to

141
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,580
a private hospital?

142
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,180
Hold on.

143
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,940
You should start drawing up a budget,

144
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,420
buddy.

145
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,340
Is it expensive?

146
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,420
If you want

147
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,260
a more premium center,

148
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:08,740
a few hundred thousand.

149
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,220
I've seen some

150
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,300
that charged over a million.

151
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,380
Yan.

152
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,460
How do you know?

153
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,620
She has a point.

154
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,540
I'll have to know eventually.

155
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,940
I did some research.

156
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,460
And why were you researching this?

157
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,300
Something is off.

158
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,580
Forget about me.

159
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,260
Something is off.

160
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,100
Forget it.

161
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,340
Stop drinking.

162
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,100
You've had enough.

163
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,100
What do you mean?

164
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,140
I barely had any.

165
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:35,980
What's wrong?

166
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,580
Can't my girlfriend

167
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,140
have some wine?

168
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:38,860
Yeah, can't I?

169
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,580
Fine, as you wish.

170
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,940
Your old boyfriend can deal with you.

171
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,220
Boyfriend is enough.

172
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,900
Why are you calling me old?

173
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,900
It's hard on the ears.

174
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,300
No, I mean it.

175
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,300
She has to be home by ten.

176
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:51,660
All right.

177
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,700
Why should we listen to him?

178
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,860
Feeling rebellious?

179
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,460
Fine.

180
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,460
The call went through.

181
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,340
Mom?

182
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,620
Sang Zhi called me a midget!

183
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,420
Keep your voice down.

184
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,580
She even called me ugly.

185
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,780
She hit me.

186
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,700
Enough.

187
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,260
Brother,

188
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:12,940
that was embarrassing.

189
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:13,900
You are too old

190
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,700
for this prank.

191
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:15,660
I get it.

192
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,020
She will be home by ten.

193
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:18,980
Qian Fei.

194
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,180
Congratulations.

195
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,100
Drink up.

196
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:23,820
Bring it here.

197
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,580
Congratulations, Qian Fei.

198
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,460
Your turn will come,

199
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:26,900
eventually.

200
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:27,740
Eventually?

201
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,420
Not anytime soon.

202
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,300
It has to wait!

203
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,700
Finish your wine.

204
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,940
Enough with your feudal mindset.

205
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,660
Be nice.

206
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:35,780
Yan.

207
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,020
Ease up on the wine.

208
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,580
How is your wine better?

209
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,900
All right, you've had enough.

210
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,260
Are you eager to go home?

211
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,060
No.

212
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,020
Jiaxu.

213
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,540
Why aren't you driving today?

214
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,060
It's quite a long walk

215
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,300
from here.

216
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,620
You drank too much wine.

217
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,340
You can't go home

218
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,340
reeking of wine.

219
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,300
Why?

220
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,700
Are you really allergic to alcohol?

221
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,540
Should we give it a try?

222
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,060
Let's see...

223
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,780
if I'm allergic to it.

224
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,820
I think the allergy is gone.

225
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,820
I can give you a few more kisses.

226
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,380
Hold on.

227
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,660
This can't go on forever.

228
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,260
I...

229
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,580
I think I have to see you every day.

230
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,540
If I don't see you even for a day,

231
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,060
I'll miss you so badly.

232
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,590
♪Could I look at you one more time?♪

233
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,380
♪Let my heartbeat have one more second♪

234
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,260
I'm heading home.

235
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,700
♪It's so strange that my gaze♪

236
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,700
♪Always follows you around♪

237
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,460
♪Could I think of you one more time?♪

238
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:03,980
Bye.

239
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,750
♪Feeling the unstoppable excitement♪

240
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:12,300
♪Like the first snow waiting for a clear sky♪

241
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,820
♪The joyful smile on my face♪

242
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,180
Where were you?

243
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,100
I took out the trash.

244
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,740
Why did you come home late?

245
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,460
Yan took me out for dinner.

246
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,700
I'm turning in.

247
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,500
What's wrong?

248
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:26,980
Did you have wine?

249
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,860
Just a little bit.

250
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,060
I didn't drink much.

251
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,420
My brother was there anyway.

252
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,300
I'll look past this since your brother

253
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:38,940
was there.

254
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,580
But when you're out there alone,

255
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,580
do not drink.

256
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,580
Are you and Duan Jiaxu

257
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,820
dating?

258
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,740
I saw everything.

259
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,180
How long has it been?

260
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,980
Not that long.

261
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,860
I wanted to tell you.

262
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,460
But...

263
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,700
Is that why you didn't come home
this summer break?

264
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,460
That was part of the reason.

265
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,020
But there was also

266
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,300
the internship

267
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,460
I got.

268
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,740
I wanted to gain some experience

269
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,340
before I graduate.

270
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,220
Did you stay at the dorm or his place

271
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,580
this summer break?

272
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,420
The dorm.

273
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,340
It's true.

274
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,460
Yan came to Yihe.

275
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,460
He knows everything.

276
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,580
Mom.

277
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,620
Don't worry about it.

278
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,620
Jiaxu treats me well.

279
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,460
He is a kind person.

280
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,180
You know him well.

281
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:06,900
I know him.

282
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,180
I know he is a good man.

283
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,660
But do you know about his family?

284
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,460
I don't know how it is now.

285
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,820
Your brother told me

286
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,900
his father was in a vegetative state.

287
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,780
The victim's family

288
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,940
often causes them trouble.

289
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,180
Not really that often.

290
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,620
You ran into them?

291
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,180
Jiaxu told me about it.

292
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,980
You took his word for it.

293
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,060
You've never seen it,

294
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,740
am I right?

295
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:39,860
I get it.

296
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,340
He's been nice to you since you were little.

297
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,460
He was your tutor.

298
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,700
I wonder

299
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,140
if

300
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,620
your admiration for him

301
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,620
was mistaken for love.

302
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,780
You only see him as your brother,

303
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,420
am I right?

304
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,460
But

305
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,100
if you two are in a relationship,

306
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,980
your father and I...

307
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,460
I...

308
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,100
I know what I feel.

309
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,620
I am an adult now.

310
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,580
How can I not tell

311
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,460
admiration apart from love?

312
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,660
I really like him.

313
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,780
Zhi, you are only a young girl.

314
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,860
You're still in college.

315
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,700
But he's different.

316
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,020
He's much older than you.

317
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,460
He has

318
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,460
a lot of experience as an adult.

319
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,340
I know you won't like

320
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,580
what I'm saying.

321
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,260
We will talk about it another time.

322
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,580
Take a shower and go to bed.

323
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:48,420
[Episode 23: Stranded, but love is persistent.]

324
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,500
Who do we have here?

325
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,020
Where were you this morning?

326
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,620
I...

327
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,500
I did something

328
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,740
very important.

329
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,660
Something very important?

330
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,380
What is it?

331
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,980
You'll know soon enough.

332
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,100
I can't tell you just yet.

333
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,500
I've been thinking.

334
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,860
You didn't go home this summer break.

335
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,140
Shouldn't you

336
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,100
spend some time with your parents?

337
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,780
What about you?

338
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,620
I'll be staying.

339
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,140
I thought

340
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,380
I should visit your parents

341
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,500
in person

342
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,740
eventually.

343
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,620
What do you think?

344
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,860
I think it's great.

345
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,860
I'll inform them.

346
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,020
And

347
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,740
we can go out for dinner.

348
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,620
Then, we can ask them.

349
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:11,620
All right.

350
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,660
Let's go.

351
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,340
I'll turn 20 next year.

352
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,980
And I am almost 26.

353
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,620
Time doesn't slow down for anyone.

354
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,260
I'm not calling you old.

355
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,660
I just think

356
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,260
I am too young.

357
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,860
I wish

358
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,980
I weren't 20 years old.

359
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,020
It'd be great if I were 29.

360
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,860
What makes you say that?

361
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:00,900
Because

362
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,860
if I were 29 years old,

363
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,300
I'd be three years older than you.

364
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,300
That way...

365
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,100
That way,

366
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,020
my brother wouldn't have hit you

367
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,900
for dating me.

368
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,300
I can't allow that.

369
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,020
I like dating someone younger than me.

370
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,180
But I'll turn old someday.

371
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,700
But you'll still be younger than me.

372
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,020
What got into you?

373
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,500
Duan Jiaxu.

374
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,700
Are you happy?

375
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,580
Of course I am.

376
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,820
Are you really happy?

377
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,500
I really am.

378
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,660
What's wrong?

379
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,020
It's nothing.

380
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,660
I'm glad to hear that.

381
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,460
I want you to stay happy every day.

382
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,940
I will make sure

383
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,060
you are happy every day of your life.

384
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,580
Okay.

385
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,500
That depends on what you do.

386
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,340
We'll see if you're with me all the time.

387
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,220
Here.

388
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,580
Duan.

389
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,540
Have some tea.

390
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,500
Thanks, sir.

391
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,580
Take a seat.

392
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,500
Don't act like a stranger.

393
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,500
You brought me tea leaves?

394
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,060
You like tea.

395
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,020
I don't know much about it.

396
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,060
So I thought you could appraise them for me.

397
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:00,700
Very well.

398
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:02,900
I asked you

399
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,180
to come here

400
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,300
while Zhi

401
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,500
is away today.

402
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,500
It was too sudden.

403
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,740
I hope you don't mind.

404
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:10,740
I don't.

405
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,340
I was planning

406
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,900
to visit you

407
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,740
in person.

408
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,780
Honestly,

409
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,960
I was a little surprised when I found out

410
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,660
you and Zhi are in a relationship.

411
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,740
I wanted to

412
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,780
inform you personally.

413
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,020
I talked to her

414
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
about some issues.

415
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,580
But she doesn't seem to get it.

416
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,660
Her mother and I have been thinking.

417
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,820
Since you are in Nanwu,

418
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,290
we might as well ask you to come here

419
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,500
so we can discuss it face-to-face.

420
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:41,980
Sir.

421
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,980
Is there anything that concerns you?

422
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,300
Feel free to ask.

423
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,780
That is great.

424
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,420
How long have you and Zhi been seeing each other?

425
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,860
We started dating in May.

426
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,420
It hasn't been a year.

427
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,820
It hasn't been that long.

428
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,180
Yan told me

429
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,740
you'd settled

430
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,220
your family affairs, is that right?

431
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,060
Yeah.

432
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,740
Did that family

433
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,660
cause you any more trouble?

434
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,420
Not recently.

435
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,100
So,

436
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,420
how is your father lately?

437
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:15,900
He is

438
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,700
still the same.

439
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,580
Still bedridden.

440
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,140
I'm sorry.

441
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:23,860
It's okay.

442
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:26,780
Duan.

443
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,940
You've been kind to Zhi.

444
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:29,980
You take care of her.

445
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,020
Her mother and I

446
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,180
are grateful for that.

447
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,980
But if you want to be in a relationship with her,

448
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,340
given the circumstances of your family,

449
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,340
her mother and I

450
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,340
are indeed

451
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,020
a bit concerned.

452
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,780
Zhi is still young.

453
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,740
Maybe she hasn't thought that far ahead

454
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,220
about this relationship.

455
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,700
But

456
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,740
if you two are in a relationship...

457
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,300
After all, we are her parents.

458
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,700
We are worried.

459
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,420
I understand.

460
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,500
I can relate to that.

461
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,060
Sir.

462
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,380
All the concerns you have

463
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,220
should be considered.

464
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,980
But you have my word.

465
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,140
I will

466
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,740
resolve

467
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,500
all of these issues.

468
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,860
I believe you.

469
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,860
I'm only expressing

470
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,660
my concerns.

471
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,820
They might sound hurtful to you.

472
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,140
I hope you understand.

473
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,300
It's okay.

474
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:25,980
After all,

475
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,340
Zhi grew up being spoiled by her parents.

476
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,700
It pains us to see her suffer.

477
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:32,660
Yes.

478
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,020
Zhi isn't even 20 yet.

479
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,660
You are much older than her.

480
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,380
I really hope

481
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,700
that you can take your future with her

482
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,300
seriously.

483
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,020
Is that clear?

484
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,740
Yes, sir.

485
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,900
I'm home.

486
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,180
Welcome home.

487
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,980
How was the gathering?

488
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,980
Not bad.

489
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,940
It felt like

490
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,820
everyone has

491
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,460
changed quite a lot.

492
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:21,980
Is that so?

493
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,260
Let me get it for you.

494
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,980
I can help you slice the fruits.

495
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:34,980
Never mind.

496
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,100
Talk to your father.

497
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,140
I can manage.

498
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,260
What did we do

499
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,500
to deserve such a lovely daughter?

500
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,340
I've been thinking

501
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,220
about the past.

502
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,100
I remember

503
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,500
you were weak as a girl.

504
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,820
You often had a cold or fever.

505
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,340
Your mother and I

506
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,860
went to the hospital every other day.

507
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,980
You started crying

508
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,060
as soon as we stepped into the hospital.

509
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,780
Seeing you in pain

510
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,620
pained us just as much.

511
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,220
But there was no other way.

512
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,780
Your brother

513
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,180
was only a little boy.

514
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,500
He didn't like that you came to this family.

515
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,380
He thought that we ignored him

516
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,740
after you came along.

517
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,380
I remember

518
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,940
what he wrote in his weekly diary.

519
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,500
"I'd rather have a dog

520
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,060
than this useless sister."

521
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,660
But

522
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,980
when you were in the hospital,

523
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,940
he kept following me around

524
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,260
because he couldn't see you,

525
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,300
and asked me where you were.

526
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,300
One day, I told him

527
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,620
we had gotten rid of you.

528
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,020
He was so scared that he cried.

529
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:30,900
That was

530
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,140
an interesting piece of memory.

531
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,420
It felt like

532
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,780
something from yesterday.

533
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,620
And now,

534
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,130
you and your brother are all grown-ups.

535
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,140
You're turning 20 next year.

536
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,060
You started dating.

537
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,780
In a few years,

538
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,940
you'll get married.

539
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,020
Yeah.

540
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,820
Time flies like an arrow.

541
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,140
Zhi.

542
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,740
I am not a snobbish person.

543
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,500
I won't think

544
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,060
we're superior to others

545
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,820
simply because we live an above-average life.

546
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,580
I'm not saying

547
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,580
no one deserves you.

548
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,620
Of course.

549
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,380
If anyone wants to be your boyfriend,

550
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,620
I am certain I can find

551
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,500
all of his flaws.

552
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,340
I'm not saying

553
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,300
you are too fragile to undergo hardships.

554
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,140
But your mother and I

555
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,780
really hate to see you go through that.

556
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,340
We don't want you

557
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,380
to have a bad life.

558
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,740
We will always have that kind of worry.

559
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,020
Don't worry, Dad.

560
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:36,660
I am not

561
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,620
going through anything.

562
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,500
Every day has been happy for me.

563
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,300
I mean it.

564
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,980
I'm glad to hear that.

565
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,580
I think of myself

566
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,900
as a normal parent.

567
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,420
I am the same

568
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,220
as every other father.

569
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:48,740
I only hope

570
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,100
that my daughter

571
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,500
can have a life free from any harm.

572
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,860
I want you to be safe

573
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,020
and happy.

574
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,180
Zhi.

575
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,300
Thanks, Mom.

576
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,220
I wasn't

577
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,980
going to tell you this

578
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,860
because I thought you might

579
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,980
get upset and hold it

580
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:08,900
against us.

581
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,620
Today,

582
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,500
I asked Jiaxu to come here

583
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,580
while you were away.

584
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,500
You mentioned

585
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,100
that you...

586
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,900
That you...

587
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,980
That you talked in person.

588
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,340
Isn't that right?

589
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,940
So, what did you talk about

590
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,900
while I was away?

591
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,180
I told him

592
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,620
the concerns your mother and I

593
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,900
were having.

594
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,900
What I told him

595
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,260
could have

596
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,700
been hurtful to him.

597
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,540
But he said

598
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,780
he'd consider your future together

599
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,820
seriously.

600
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,020
You might think

601
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,180
it's unnecessary

602
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,620
to think that far ahead right now.

603
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,940
But if you two want to be together

604
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,740
in the long run,

605
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,900
I want you to think it through,

606
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,740
given the circumstances of his family.

607
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,100
If you think you're not meant to be,

608
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,740
it's best to break up.

609
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,220
Yes, Zhi.

610
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,100
If you can't bring yourself

611
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,500
to tell Jiaxu,

612
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,180
we can tell him on your behalf.

613
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,780
I know you think I can't handle

614
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,860
the slightest challenge in life.

615
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,060
But he is

616
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,220
not causing me any trouble.

617
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,940
And the thing is,

618
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,060
despite his family's circumstances,

619
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,420
despite his father being bedridden,

620
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,260
I'm willing

621
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,540
to face everything with him together.

622
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,540
I am willing to shoulder it.

623
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,420
The relationship wasn't formed on a whim.

624
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,860
We went through a lot of considerations.

625
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,060
But can you please

626
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,700
not hold a prejudice against him?

627
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,780
What happened to his family

628
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,580
wasn't his choice.

629
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,460
He's suffered a lot of prejudices.

630
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,860
I didn't think

631
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,220
you'd do the same.

632
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,260
Your father and I are...

633
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,700
I'm tired.

634
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,340
I'm going to my room.

635
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,340
(Duan.)

636
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,780
You've been kind to Zhi.

637
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,980
You take care of her.

638
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:25,860
Her mother and I

639
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,980
are grateful for that.

640
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,460
But if you want to be in a relationship with her,

641
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,860
given the circumstances of your family,

642
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,860
her mother and I

643
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:35,980
are indeed

644
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,620
a bit concerned.

645
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,100
(Why would they tell Jiaxu)

646
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,100
(those things?)

647
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,580
(He must feel a lot of pressure.)

648
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,020
(What should I tell him?)

649
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:04,540
Hello?

650
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:14,700
Hello?

651
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,620
Mispressed a button?

652
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:20,780
No.

653
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,620
What's wrong?

654
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,620
Why aren't you saying anything?

655
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,180
Sorry.

656
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,380
Whatever they told you,

657
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,100
don't take it to heart.

658
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,260
So...

659
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,380
don't be upset.

660
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,380
I...

661
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,660
I'm not upset.

662
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,740
Your parents didn't say anything hurtful.

663
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,140
They were nice.

664
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:56,980
But indeed,

665
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,940
they did express

666
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,020
some of their concerns.

667
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,220
What concerns?

668
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,380
They think I am too old

669
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,100
and that it will be embarrassing

670
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,340
when we go out together.

671
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,420
Did you talk about this?

672
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,940
Stop fooling around.

673
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,540
I am serious.

674
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,180
It was nothing.

675
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,660
Your father told me

676
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,420
a lot of things.

677
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,140
I'm not sure which of them

678
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,340
you mean.

679
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,260
Well...

680
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,340
It's the part

681
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,020
where they want you
to reconsider this relationship.

682
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,140
Well...

683
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,140
Don't you have any questions for me?

684
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,220
Or maybe

685
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,780
is there something you'd like to say?

686
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,180
Sang Zhi.

687
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,220
I'm just asking.

688
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,940
It doesn't matter anyway.

689
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,860
I'm calling

690
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,220
because I want you to know

691
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,620
that you are great.

692
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,220
As you know,

693
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,620
they think I am too young.

694
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,060
That's why they are concerned.

695
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,100
But thankfully, it's you.

696
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,380
If it were anyone else,

697
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,660
they'd have a lot more to say.

698
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,100
I know.

699
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,180
By the way,

700
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,180
as I said it,

701
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,780
what happened to your family

702
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,780
has nothing to do with you.

703
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,860
Don't blame yourself.

704
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,140
Besides,

705
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,100
whatever happened to your father,

706
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,820
we can shoulder it together.

707
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,900
We can look after him together.

708
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,780
I know.

709
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,060
Do not tell them

710
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,020
anything rash.

711
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,460
You finally get to take a break.

712
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,100
Spend time with your parents.

713
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,540
Do not

714
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,300
let this matter

715
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,380
affect you.

716
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:16,900
All right.

717
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,260
Stop thinking about it.

718
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:19,860
Go to sleep.

719
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:20,700
Okay?

720
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,260
Okay.

721
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:23,900
By the way,

722
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,940
I'll have to head back to Yihe

723
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,580
tomorrow morning.

724
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,100
Back to

725
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:30,980
Yihe?

726
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,540
I just received a phone call.

727
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,180
I have to meet a client for work

728
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:35,980
tomorrow.

729
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,340
So I'm heading back.

730
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,300
Then...

731
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,700
Let me tag along.

732
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,140
Don't.

733
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,780
The flight is tomorrow morning.

734
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,540
It's too early.

735
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,380
Stay home and sleep tight.

736
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,740
Let me see you off.

737
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,620
You don't have to.

738
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:51,940
I'm a grown-up.

739
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,540
I can go to the airport on my own.

740
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,180
All right.

741
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,300
Stop thinking about it. I mean it.

742
00:33:59,340 --> 00:33:59,980
Go to sleep.

743
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,100
Okay?

744
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,140
Okay.

745
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,060
Good night.

746
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,140
Good night.

747
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,060
(Why is he leaving all of a sudden?)

748
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,660
(Is he avoiding me?)

749
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,820
(Is he really considering)

750
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,260
(breaking up with me?)

751
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,300
(What is on his mind?)

752
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,100
Zhi.

753
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,340
Are you going out?

754
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,500
I'm heading back to Yihe.

755
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,140
Why are you going back all of a sudden?

756
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,420
I'm going to talk to Jiaxu.

757
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,140
I have something to tell him.

758
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,940
I booked the flight ticket.

759
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,020
Don't worry about me.

760
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:23,940
Zhi.

761
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:25,940
Are you upset

762
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,060
because of what your father and I said

763
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,180
last night?

764
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:28,780
Yeah.

765
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,300
It's nothing.

766
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,020
I understand your concerns.

767
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,540
I know you mean well.

768
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,180
But I think...

769
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,220
I'm a grown-up now.

770
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,780
I'm not a kid anymore.

771
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,500
I am sure

772
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,860
of what I want.

773
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,580
Therefore, I want to fight for it.

774
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,020
Zhi.

775
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,420
We are both very fond of

776
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,740
Duan.

777
00:35:59,340 --> 00:35:59,780
But

778
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,140
we have our concerns.

779
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,260
Your father and I have lived a long life.

780
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,020
We can see through

781
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:05,940
a lot of things

782
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,980
and people

783
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,180
in this world.

784
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,220
I know

785
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,580
you don't trust Duan Jiaxu.

786
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,100
But can you

787
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,300
trust me for once?

788
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,060
We'll drive you to the airport.

789
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,180
Hello, Jiaxu?

790
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,060
Zhi?

791
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,220
Your brother told me

792
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,220
you're coming back today.

793
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,300
Yeah.

794
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,340
I'm already at the airport.

795
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,100
Okay.

796
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,020
Wait there for me.

797
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:21,860
Okay.

798
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:37,660
(Sang Zhi.)

799
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,660
He did the right thing.

800
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,980
You are too young.

801
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,740
This isn't right, understood?

802
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,020
But I will grow up someday.

803
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,940
We'll wait until you grow up.

804
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,540
But when I grow up,

805
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,220
he will fall in love with someone else.

806
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,740
(This time,)

807
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,820
(I won't cry.)

808
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,260
Zhi?

809
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:17,580
Why didn't you

810
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,780
tell me you were coming back?

811
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,300
What's wrong?

812
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,620
Do you remember...

813
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,740
I came to Yihe in my second year in high school...

814
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,700
to meet up with my online crush?

815
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,180
Actually,

816
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,940
I wasn't meeting any online crush.

817
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,620
I came to Yihe for you.

818
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,900
My brother told me

819
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,540
you had a girlfriend.

820
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,500
That's why I came to Yihe.

821
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,780
I wanted to see you.

822
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,540

823

824
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,980
for college.

825
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,220
I lied.

826
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,660
I didn't want you to think that...

827
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,460
