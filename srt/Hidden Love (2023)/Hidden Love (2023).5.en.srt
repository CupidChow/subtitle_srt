00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,420
Come on.

191
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:38,700
Show me

192
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,530
your physics paper

193
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,850
from the last final exams.

196
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,580
Did you not pay attention in class?

197
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,180
How could you get this question wrong?

198
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,110
♪A bright face under a calm disguising face♪

199
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,180
I did.

200
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,730
I just didn't understand it.

201
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,700
This question on the conservation of energy
was a giveaway question.

202
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:11,770
At first...

203
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,730
At first, I wanted to choose B.

204
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:16,770
That's right.

205
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,490
The correct answer was A.

206
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,510

00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,010
Remember it,

209
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,220
and don't get questions
like the conservation of energy

210
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,100
wrong next time.

211
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,460
It was probably because
I wasn't paying enough attention.

212
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,820
But even if I'd paid full attention,

213
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,340
I wouldn't have understood it either.

214
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,490
This is really difficult.

215
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,420
Didn't I tell you last time

216
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,610
that you should pay attention in class?

217
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:43,650
Have you forgotten about it?

218
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,100
That was such a long time ago.

219
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,370
Are you saying

220
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,130
that I need to remind you every day?

221
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,650
Is that okay?

222
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,940
♪Pretending like I don't care before you♪

♪Wouldn't want you to find out I'm all smitten♪

225
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,530
I'll start you off with Ampère's Law.

226
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,220
Do you know the Left-Hand Rule?

227
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:09,650
Look.

228
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,100
Let's say there's a uniform magnetic field

229
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:12,940
over here,

230
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,580
and here's the direction of the current.

231
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,100
So, hold out your left hand.

00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,820

236
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,890
You should digest this first

237
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,010
and work on this sample paper.

238
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:51,940
I'll check it later.

239
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,250
I'll give you three lessons a week

240
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,100
during the winter break.

241
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,010
Is three times too much for you?

242
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:07,580
No.

243
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,250
That's too little.

244
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,850
Can we have lessons every day?

245
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,580
I have my internship four days a week though,

246
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,180
and the remaining three days are all yours.

247
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,370
You didn't like

248
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,340
getting a tutor, no?

249
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,370
You're not bad at tutoring.

250
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,610
It's novel.

251
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,340
Of course.

252
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,100
I can't believe

253
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,370
you're so keen on learning now.

254
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:40,940
Not bad.

255
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,420
Focus!

256
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:48,700
I can explain

257
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,700
the Lorentz force to you

258
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,340
in our next lesson.

259
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,980
By the way, Jiaxu,

260
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,220
can I ask you a question?

261
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,010
Go ahead.

262
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,250
Why did you choose to attend university

263
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,100
in Nanwu

264
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,010
instead of Yihe?

265
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,980
Isn't Yihe University great too?

266
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,250
I

267
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,490
didn't want to stay in Yihe all the time.

268
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,010
Isn't it nice to visit other places

269
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:17,940
as well?

270
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,850
Why did you choose Nanwu then?

271
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,250
How do I put this?

272
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,250
My dream

273
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:29,890
is to be in the gaming industry

274
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,820
in the future.

275
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,300
Nanwu is the city

276
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,340
with the biggest gaming industry.

277
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:35,490
That's why I came here.

278
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,300
What are you thinking about?

279
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:41,980
Hurry up and do your work.

280
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,090
Sorry, I'm late.

281
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:21,570
So,

282
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,810
have you digested what I taught you

283
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,380
in the last lesson?

284
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,380
Jiaxu,

285
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,180
did you not sleep?

286
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,180
I was working late yesterday,

287
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,010
so I slept late.

288
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,010
Let's see.

289
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:38,900
Why don't I

290
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,570
do my homework first?

291
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:41,980
You can check it for me

292
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,010
after I'm done,

293
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,460
and explain it to me
if there's anything incorrect.

294
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,940
You have nothing to do

295
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,140
while I'm at it anyway,

296
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,980
so you can go and rest for a while.

297
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:50,620
What do you mean?

298
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:51,900
Are you trying to be lazy

299
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,900
or tell your parents on me

300
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,090
so that they'll get you a new tutor?

301
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,460
That's not it.

302
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,490
I was just kidding.

303
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:00,620
How about this?

304
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,180
Complete

305
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,530
this set of papers.

306
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:08,660
And when you're done,

307
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,420
I'll explain them to you.

308
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,220
Wake me up later.

309
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,420
I'm going to take a nap.

310
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:28,900
Are you slacking off?

311
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:40,940
What were you up to?

312
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,290
Slacking off.

313
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:45,810
Are you done with the papers?

314
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:53,700
Show me

315
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,490
the set of papers you worked on

316
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,420
over the weekend.

317
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,380
You've got

318
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:18,900
this question wrong.

319
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,980
The electric charge is negative.

320
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,250
Thus, its direction of motion

321
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,730
is opposite to the direction of the current.

322
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,380
I guess I'm bad at tutoring.

323
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,940
You're getting worse the more you learn.

324
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,660
Jiaxu,

325
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,010
be more confident.

326
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,660
You've tutored me well.

327
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,530
It's just that I couldn't remember very well,

328
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:42,900
and I really couldn't understand it.

329
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,660
I just don't find physics interesting,

330
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,250
so it's hard for me to remember things.

331
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,380
What do you think is interesting then?

332
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,420
In short, physics is boring.

333
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,010
I work so hard to tutor every day,

334
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,250
but you're so relaxed.

335
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:15,900
Yeah,

336
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,330
it was your tutoring session, not mine!

337
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:18,660
Let me play a few rounds.

338
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,380
My legs!

339
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,860
Go away!

340
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:23,660
Shoo!

341
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,290
Come on.

342
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,090
Let's play together.

343
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:27,900
Air Drops!

344
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,810
Go that way.

345
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,180
I have something to tell you.

346
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:31,980
What is it?

347
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,330
Don't tell me you're quitting!

348
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,660
Don't be ridiculous.

349
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,530
I'm so good at tutoring.

350
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,290
I wanted to say

351
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,530
that I'd like to take Kiddo

352
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,810
to the City Museum of Science and Technology

353
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,180
one day when we're all free.

354
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:44,620
Why?

355
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:45,660
She's not interested

356
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:46,660
in physics at all now,

357
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:47,530
and she can't seem to master it.

358
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,330
Hence, I thought

359
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,620
maybe we could visit
the City Museum of Science and Technology

360
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:51,980
to see

361
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:52,860
if it'll pique her interest.

362
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,330
You're pretty responsible.

363
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,570
If I didn't know better,

364
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,090
I'd think you were her real brother.

365
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,090
Please also tell your parents

366
00:21:59,090 --> 00:21:59,730
for me.

367
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:01,810
There's no need for that.

368
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,490
They're very busy at the end of the year.

369
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,140
As her brother, I can decide it for you.

370
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:07,700
When are you going?

371
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,290
I'll tell you when the time comes.

372
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,090
Hurry up! We're driving.

373
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,250
There's no one, so don't worry.

374
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,010
Have you been here before?

375
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,530
No.

376
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,010
This place is quite interesting.

377
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,490
I used to love

378
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,180
visiting here.

379
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,420
Why are there only two tickets?

380
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,050
Are you not going in?

381
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:34,660
Only brats would visit a place like

382
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,900
the Museum of Science and Technology.

383
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,140
Of course I'm not interested in it.

384
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,220
Who's a brat now?

385
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,570
That's enough.

386
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,570
I gave you the money for three tickets just now.

387
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,220
You have to give me back my change.

388
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,620
I'll use it to play some games at the cybercafé.

389
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:49,900
I'll pick you guys up later!

390
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:50,530
Bye-bye!

391
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,770
How pretentious!

392
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:55,770
Let's go.

393
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,010
I'll show you around in there.

394
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,180
Don't you think this slide

395
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:08,900
is interesting?

396
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:10,810
There are a lot

397
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,290
of physics ideas behind this.

398
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,010
The reason

399
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,090
why this slide

400
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:15,860
is curved

401
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,380
instead of being a straight line

402
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:18,620
is based on

403
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,250
the brachistochrone curve principle.

404
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:20,980
Therefore,

405
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,250
this slide might seem very high,

406
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,220
but when you go down,

407
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:24,530
you'll go fast in the middle of the slide,

408
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,980
and then it'll level out

409
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,250
when you reach the end.

410
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:28,620
It'll also make you

411
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,330
a little safer.

412
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,140
Do you want to try it out?

413
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,010
Go and have some fun.

414
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,010
Let's go!

415
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:46,770
How was it?

416
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,810
Was it fun?

417
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,900
Was the middle section

418
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,900
particularly exciting?

419
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:52,490
Yes,

420
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:53,980
but it wasn't that fast.

421
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,380
This is what I meant

422
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,330
by the physics principle

423
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,380
that I told you just now.

424
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,380
[Race Against the Tsunami]

425
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:02,980
By the way,

426
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,700
here's a bonus geographical knowledge for you.

427
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:06,330
The tsunami.

428
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,810
Did you know that the definition of a tsunami

429
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,660
is a catastrophic wave,

430
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,140
usually caused by

431
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,660
an underwater earthquake?

432
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,490
It can reach

433
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,700
a maximum wave speed

434
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,290
of over 700 km per hour.

435
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,700
Also, look at the waves.

436
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,140
They may be only

437
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,460
a meter high in the sea,

438
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,090
but when they reach the shore,

439
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,420
they can be tens of meters high.

440
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,900
Hence, it's a huge threat

441
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,220
to the cities by the sea.

442
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:30,620
What?

443
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:31,770
Run!

444
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,010
Hurry up, Jiaxu!

445
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,460
We're going to be swamped by the tsunami!

446
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,570
How is that possible?

447
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,530
We've outrun the tsunami.

448
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:45,900
Come and try this out.

449
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,570
Put both your hands

450
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,180
on top of this flowerpot.

451
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,010
Look at the screen.

452
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,220
This is incredible!

453
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,140
This is the thermoelectric sensing technology.

454
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,050
When the flowerpot senses

455
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,010
the temperature of your palm,

456
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,860
its thermoelectric sensor will convert

457
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,770
the change in temperature

458
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,330
into a change in power,

459
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,570
which triggers the screen to play.

460
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,290
Look

461
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,420
at this flower in full bloom,
attracting butterflies.

462
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,140
It's actually related to physics as well.

463
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,290
How amazing!

464
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,860
Here's my suggestion, Sang Zhi.

465
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:32,490
I know

466
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:33,700
you may have some

467
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,620
personal preferences now,

468
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,250
but try not to get sidetracked

469
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,570
and study hard.

470
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,860
It's because your future dreams

471
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,380
and all the things you want to do in the future

472
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,570
will probably need

473
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,900
to be achieved through studying.

474
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:50,570
Jiaxu,

475
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:51,900
I think

476
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,860
you were probably very rebellious

477
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,140
when you were my age.

478
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,050
How come?

479
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,490
It's because you play video games.

480
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,180
And that's why I was rebellious?

481
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,460
My teacher said that we can't play video games.

482
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,050
When I was your age,

483
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,290
I'd be especially happy

484
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,940
even if I could only play video games

485
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:08,810
for an hour a week.

486
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:11,860
It was a time

487
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,810
when I could escape

488
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:16,770
from the negative realities

489
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,530
of my life by playing video games

490
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:19,940
and taking a break.

491
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:30,810
Well,

492
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,770
that

493
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,380
must be a great video game.

494
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,570
So,

495
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,090
you think video games can bring you joy

496
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,900
and comfort, right?

497
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,050
That's right.

498
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,620
Don't you find it

499
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,420
very relaxing to play video games?

500
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,180
So at that time,

501
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:51,860
I dreamed

502
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,940
of creating

503
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,220
my own video game

504
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:56,810
and spreading the joy

505
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,330
to more people.

506
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,180
I'll study hard

507
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,250
and find my own dream.

508
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,530
But you have to work hard too, Jiaxu.

509
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,620
Because I think

510
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,570
you'll soon be able

511
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,620
to achieve your dream.

512
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,700
You believe in me that much?

513
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,730
Let's work hard together then.

514
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,050
We can do it!

515
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,530
Okay!

516
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,090
Have some water.

517
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,810
I noticed

518
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,250
you like to draw.

519
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,050
Drawing is a hobby

520
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,620
that you can keep up.

521
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,620
It takes imagination to draw.

522
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:20,980
Besides,

523
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:22,860
I've always felt

524
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,900
that people who like to draw

525
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,090
are people

526
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,050
who have a good heart for the world.

527
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,620
They can record

528
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,730
what they think

529
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,810
is beautiful in this world

530
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,490
through their paintbrush.

531
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,660
Jiaxu.

532
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,330
Can you not

533
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,660
be in a relationship?

534
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:46,980
What do you mean?

535
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,940
Don't you have a dream too?

536
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,860
If you get into a relationship,

537
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,980
you'll delay your dream.

538
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,660
I'm almost done with university.

539
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,860
Do I still need

540
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,980
to avoid a relationship
due to my studies and whatnot?

541
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,330
Why didn't you

542
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,460
tell this to your brother?

543
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:05,050
I...

544
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,010
I did.

545
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,250
What did he say then?

546
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,860
He said, "Go away, little demon!"

547
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,250
I said it

548
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,530
because my classmate's brother

549
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:20,810
had a girlfriend,

550
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,860
but that girl

551
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,570
treated my classmate really badly.

552
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:25,940
How so?

553
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,290
I don't know.

554
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,660
She treated your classmate badly?

555
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:31,810
Moreover,

556
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,620
if you have a girlfriend,

557
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,570
you won't be able

558
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:37,860
to treat me this well again, right?

559
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,490
Now you know I've been treating you well.

560
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,140
Why are you thinking that far ahead?

561
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,380
If you don't see me

562
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,180
in a couple of years,

563
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,900
you'll probably forget everything about me.

564
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:53,860
How about this then?

565
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:55,220
In the future,

566
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,700
I'll find a girlfriend who is gentle

567
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,330
and treats you well.

568
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:01,530
This way,

569
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,420
it'll be like having
someone else to treat you well.

570
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:04,420
All right?

571
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:15,940
Fine.

572
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,860
When you find one,

573
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,730
can you show her to me first?

574
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:26,620
Sure.

575
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,290
I'll show you when I find one.

576
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,420
I'll remember it.

577
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,750
♪Could I look at you one more time?♪

578
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,270
♪Let my heartbeat steal a second♪

579
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:44,140
♪My hidden longing will become♪

580
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,460
Is there anything else you'd like to check out?

581
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:47,220
Your brother is here.

582
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,010
Let's call it a day if you're tired.

583
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:50,660
Let's go.

584
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,180
Yan!

585
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,330
Well,

586
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,980
what's wrong with you?

587
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,460
How was it?

588
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,570
Did you find the motivation to study?

589
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:07,530
Yes.

590
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,250
Then...

591
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,090
We went

592
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,010
on a slide,

593
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,860
and we went down like this.

594
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:14,530
Weren't you there to learn?

595
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,220
Hello, Xun?

596
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,980
I've modified that

597
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:17,730
and sent it to you

598
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:18,380
this morning.

599
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:21,860
It still needs to be modified?

600
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,940
It sounded like you guys were playing.

601
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:23,220
Sure.

602
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,330
I happen to have my laptop with me today.

603
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,050
I'll look for a place
to finish the modification now

604
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:26,530
and send it to you.

605
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,730
All right, goodbye.

606
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:31,940
Send your sister back first.

607
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,180
I'll do some work

608
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:33,980
over there.

609
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:35,250
Got it.

610
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,940
Remember what I've explained to you today.

611
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:39,980
Go home.

612
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,980
Do I need to give you a ride?

613
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:41,700
No, thanks.

614
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,620
Here, put on your ugly hat.

615
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,050
Where's the strap?

616
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,730
Go away!

617
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,940
Stupid little demon, I was so nice to you,

618
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,420
and you didn't even wait for me.

619
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:15,010
Yan!

620
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,220
My sketchbook is missing.

621
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:19,860
It's that book

622
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,860
I usually draw in.

623
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,010
I didn't see it.

624
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:22,900
I checked the car just now.

625
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:23,490
There was nothing there.

626
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,180
Really?

627
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,490
Take me there and show me.

628
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,490
Let's move!

629
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,660
There was really nothing there.

630
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,330
I've told you.

631
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,250
Just buy another one

632
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,180
if you've lost it.

633
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,140
Are you sure you've checked everywhere?

634
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,380
Yes!

635
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,940
From the Museum of Science and Technology

636
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,250
to here.

637
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,050
The car.

638
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,050
My room.

639
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,570
It's the Museum of Science and Technology.

640
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,420
Hello, how are you?

641
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,090
I visited
the Museum of Science and Technology today

642
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,620
and accidentally left

643
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,490
my sketchbook there.

644
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,860
It was a green sketchbook.

645
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,290
Did you pick it up?

646
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:22,620
Yes.

647
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,730
We passed it to the boy

648
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:28,730
who was with you.

649
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,140
Did he not give it to you?

650
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,330
(What should I do)

651
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,810
(if Jiaxu sees it?)

652
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:06,860
Little demon, I have your sketchbook.

653
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,300
I'll throw it away if you don't want it.

654
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,260
Give it to me!

655
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,980
Duan Jiaxu dropped it off

656
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:14,980
on his way to work.

657
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,260
Did he look inside?

658
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,650
How would I know?

659
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,210
Why didn't you ask him?

660
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:23,420
Is there anything

661
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,420
shady in there?

662
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,460
No.

663
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:26,490
Fine.

664
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,980
I'm going back to sleep then.

665
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,940
(He could've just called me.)

666
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:50,090
(Why did he ask Sang Yan to pass it to me?)

667
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:54,490
(Doesn't that mean he has seen it)

668
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,050
(and felt awkward,)

669
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,530
(that's why he didn't give it to me himself?)

670
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,020
(Then, what if...)

671
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,860
Why are you back?

672
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,380
It was too annoying

673
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,690
to stay at home.

674
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,690
Did you come back here to keep me company?

675
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:35,980
Oh, right. Xu,

676
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:36,860
listen,

677
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,730
don't come on Tuesday for now.

678
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,780
Come on Thursday instead.

679
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:40,530
Why?

680
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,940
Little demon is experiencing puppy love.

681
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:43,570
I scolded her for half a day

682
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,940
and confiscated her phone and laptop.

683
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:45,500
I guess

684
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,460
she won't be in the mood to study.

685
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:47,020
Forget it.

686
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:48,340
Puppy love?

687
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,340
Is it with that classmate of hers?

688
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:52,860
No,

689
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,340
it's online dating! Can you believe it?

690
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:55,650
What?

691
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,530
That's right. She told me herself.

692
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:58,460
All right,

693
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,170
I'll go there next week then.

694
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,090
It's normal for her to have such thoughts

695
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,050
at her age.

696
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:07,980
Anyway, just talk some sense into her

697
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,570
and make sure she knows the limits.

698
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,420
She should understand
what she needs to understand.

699
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:12,900
You know what?

700
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:14,570
I don't care about other people.

701
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,380
My sister is just not allowed to do so!

702
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,020
I must break them up,

703
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,940
or I'll beat that guy up!

704
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,050
(He should already)

705
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:05,420
(know)

706
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,210
(about my online dating partner story
that I made up.)

707
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,090
(How should I face him)

708
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,820
(during our lesson later?)

709
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,090
(He wouldn't think)

710
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,940
(that I was drawing him anymore, right?)

711
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,690
(What)

712
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,570
(should a broken-hearted person look like?)

713
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,820
(Should I act sad,)

714
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,500
(upset,)

715
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,130
(and miserable?)

716
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,980
(Will he not believe it?)

717
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,610
Little demon!

718
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,300
(Or, should I...)

719
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,130
Little demon!

720
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,610
Little demon.

721
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,090
How have you been

722
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,340
these past few days?

723
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,940
I'll take you for a ride

724
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,610
when you finish your lesson.

725
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,090
I won't tell Mom and Dad.

726
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:12,530
I don't want to be scolded either.

727
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,130
I heard from your brother

728
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:40,980
that you're dating online.

729
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:45,340
How did you meet him?

730
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:46,690
Tell me.

731
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,500
You don't have to be so nosy.

732
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,610
Why can't I care about you?

733
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,210
You asked me not to be in a relationship,

734
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:58,860
but you did the opposite yourself.

735
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,570
(From what he said,)

736
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,210
(I think he believed)

737
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,090
(that)

738
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,340
(the non-existent online friend
was the one I liked.)

739
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,570
So, it was your little boyfriend

740
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,730
who asked you to go and see him?

741
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,530
How old is he?

742
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,940
He's graduating from university soon.

743
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,900
How old did you say he was?

744
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,090
Twenty-something.

745
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:39,610
Where did he tell you to meet him?

746
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:43,170
In Yihe.

747
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:51,980
Sang Zhi,

748
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:53,900
does

749
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,300
that older boyfriend of yours

750
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,170
know how old you are?

751
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,940
What's his phone number?

752
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,050
And you're still covering up for him?

753
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:23,900
Sang Zhi,

754
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,460
I don't want to lose my temper with you,

755
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,170
but you need to know

756
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,130
that your family
has your best interests at heart.

757
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,050
They wouldn't let you do it

758
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,090
because they believe it's something

759
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,130
that would hurt you.

760
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,130
You can't be in a relationship

761
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,500
until you graduate from high school
or until you're an adult.

762
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,210
After you've graduated from high school

763
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:40,980
and gone to college,

764
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,380
you can do whatever you want.

765
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:43,650
No one will stop you.

766
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,300
Do you hear me?

767
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,170
But I couldn't resist the temptation.

768
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:23,220
♪Love is when butterflies spring from my eyes♪

769
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:27,590
♪And ripples of excitement
sprawling across my vision♪

770
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,020
♪A bright face under a calm disguising face♪

771
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,190
♪But I can't contain my joy♪

772
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,220
♪I have someone I really like♪

773
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:49,760
♪My heart jingles when I think of you♪

774
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,420
♪I wish I could read your mind♪

775
00:43:55,590 --> 00:44:00,660
♪To check if my secret liking isn't unrequited♪
