what would you do

19
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,860
while I'm doing my revision?

20
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,140
I'd

21
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,660
be sitting here.

22
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,900
Sit here?

23
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,220
I want to get more glances at you.

24
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:35,940
Is that enough for you?

If you don't leave,

00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,220
I won't be able to focus.

Can't I stay here quietly

28
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,980

29
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,300

31
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,300
All right, then.

32
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,940
You're such a cruel girlfriend.

That's what I'm doing.

46
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,620

50
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,060
I think your cooking

51
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,100
is really nice.

52
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,140
Do you like it?

53
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,100
Not everyone gets to taste it.

54
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,700
You're the first one.

55
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,580
-I'm done eating.
-I'm done eating.

56

57
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,340
Are you done, too?

58
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,220
Give it to me.

59
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:16,980
I'll do the dishes.

60
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,020
You should get some rest.

61
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,620
I can do the dishes.

62
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,980
Let me help you with something.

63
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,260

Why don't I take over?

73
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,100

74

What are you doing?

106
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,300

107
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,060
some vocabulary.

108
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,460
Why are you doing it on the floor?

109
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,220
It's more exciting.

110
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,220
It's less likely to feel sleepy this way.

111
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,940
Exciting?

112
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,420
You like excitement, huh?

118
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,580

I was doing my revision.

121
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,820
Then I was so sleepy. So I wanted to take a nap.

122
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,460
But I told you

123
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,980
about my determination just now.

124
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:46,940
Well...

125
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,060
If you saw me sleeping,

126
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,060
I'm afraid you'd think

127
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,100
I don't want to talk to you.

128
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:52,980
So...

129
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,980
I'm not that petty.

130
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,460
Go ahead and have a nap.

131
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,820
I'll wake you up later.

132
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:05,820
Lie down.

133
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:11,700
Well,

134
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,700
won't you feel bored?

135
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,820
A little bit.

136
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,580
But

137
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,220

What's wrong?

Jiaxu,

142
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,420
it's not

143
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,900
that I don't like

144
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,420
you being like this.

145
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,260
It's because I get nervous

146
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,540
when you get close to me.

147
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,820
I don't know why.

148
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,300
So,

149
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,740
I just want to tell you

150
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,540
that it's not that I don't like you.

151
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,460
That means you like me.

152
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:22,980
Well...

153
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,540
It's just too...

154
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:31,780
I get it.

If so,

156
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,020
we'll see how it goes.

157
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,780
Take your nap now.

158
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,900
Call me if you need anything.

159
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,540
You eat it.

160
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,580
Maybe I should have one.

00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,420
What flavor do you want?

162
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:46,940
Any flavor will do.

163
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,260
This one, then.

164
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,620
Give out the candy or hold hands?

165
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,940
Hold hands or hold hands?

166
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,620
Well, hold hands it is.

167
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,580
Why are you asking this so seriously?

168
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,620
Can I hold your hand?

Lately,

00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,660
you've been applying for internships?

172
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,500
I've sent my resume to several companies.

173
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,500
But I haven't received any reply yet.

174
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,500
Why do you suddenly want to do an internship?

175
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:49,900
Because

176
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,100
I want to give it a try.

177
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,380

180

they either do it when crossing the street

181
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,380
or hold hands

182
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,300
by accident.

183
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,820
No one would do what you did

184
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,980
and ask if they could hold hands.

185
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,580
That was so strange.

186
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,340
I chose to do it that way

187
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,420
because I made you upset

I wasn't mad.

191
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:42,820
I was...

192
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,780
nervous.

00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,580
I know.

Now,

you became my girlfriend out of a sudden.

196
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,340
Do you find it hard to get used to?

197
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,300
Not at all.

198
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,620
Don't overthink.

199
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,100
I know I haven't told you this.

200
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,580
But I really like you.

201
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,020
I really, really do.

Hello?

00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,300
Hey, Duan Jiaxu.

209
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:13,700
Next week,

210
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,980
I'm going to Yihe for a business trip.

00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,020
This time you have to treat me

00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,020
to something delicious.

to brush me off.

215
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,500
Okay, no problem.

216
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,940
This time, I'll treat you

217
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,900
to a seafood feast, how about that?

218
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,460
Why are you suddenly being so generous?

219
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,660
There must be a reason
behind this abnormal behavior.

220
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,500
Brat,

221
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,740
could it be

222
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,540
that you've gotten the girl?

223
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,660
Yeah.

224
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,460
Not bad!

225
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,820
You have to thank me for this, no?

226
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,460
If it weren't for me,
would you have gotten the girl?

227
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,500
Yes, that's why

228
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,180
you can order anything you want to eat.

229
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:47,700
Okay?

230
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:51,740
How nice.

231
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,740
That means you'll get married

00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,660
earlier than Sang Yan.

00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,300
We must provoke him a little.

I can't stand him anymore.

No,

Bro,

245
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,820
I have to admit something to you.

246
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,020
There's something
I haven't been honest with you about.

247
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,340
What is it?

248
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,580
You know this girl, too.

249
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,500
I know her?

250
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,020
You're in Yihe, and I'm in Nanwu.

251
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,100
How do I know her?

252
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,180
You didn't meet her in Yihe.

253
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,740
Not in Yihe?

254
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,020
Do we have any juniors

who work in Yihe?

00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,460
I can't seem to recall it.

00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,780
She's studying at a university in Yihe.

258
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,300
Study?

259
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,020
Don't tell me

Okay, that's all. Bye.

262
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:02,820
What?

263
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,500
Seriously, man.

264
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,740
I really have to thank you for this.

00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,980
Why are you thanking me?

266
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,660
Did I help you with anything?

267
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,060
When you first met Sang Zhi,

268
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,940
she was a kid

00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,340
at the age of 14. How could you...

270
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,460
Tell me.

271
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,740
Have you told Sang Yan about this?

272
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,740
I haven't told him yet.

00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,580
When are you planning

00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,100
to tell him?

275
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,340
I planned

276
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,700
to go back to Nanwu and tell him in person.

277
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,780
I think it's better

278
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,340
to tell him in person about this matter.

279
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:36,940
Oh, right.

280
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,020
I have to recall

281
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,420
the message quickly.

282
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,780

I'm telling you first.

289
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,700
I have nothing to do with this.

What's wrong with asking me?

306
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:12,740
It's not like that.

307
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,460
You should ask me about things like this.

But then again,

I don't go after others.

311

Usually, it's the others
who are crazy about pursuing me.

312
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,260
It's more suitable asking Qian Fei.

313
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,340
He's good at pursuing others.

314
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,460
Go away.

You could brag about this for three years.

to possess in the first place?

(and tenacity.)

Every time we face any difficulties

in a competition,

374
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,620
we have to grit our teeth and persist.

Every time we fall,

376
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,420
we have to work hard to stand up

377

00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,540
Did you not sleep well?

567
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,420
You look exhausted.

568
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,980
How so?

569
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,780
You just look tired.

570
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:31,980
I'm fine.

571
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,180
I slept soundly last night.

572
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,260
We don't have to

573
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,020
do this.

574
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,860
We can go out for a walk

575
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,700
or have something delicious.

576
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,380
I thought you really wanted to do this.

577
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,260
Are you that worried about me?

578
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,820
I haven't tried this in a long time.

579
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,500
I've been waiting to show off my skills.

580
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,820
Let me help you with that.

581
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,140
Slow down.

582
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,340
Hold onto the railing.

583
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,220
I want to remind you of something.

584
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,300
What is it?

585
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,460
I'm going

586
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,580
to kiss you today.

587
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,540
I wasn't planning

588
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,300
to tell you this.

589
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,020
But...

590
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:30,540
But

591
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,260
I was afraid you would find it too sudden.

592
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,500
You're not nervous, are you?

593
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,500
I... I'm okay, too.

594
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,260
So,

595
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,660
were you giving me a heads-up?

596
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,500
If

597
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,580
you're not willing to do that today or...

598
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,580
I am.

599
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,220
So,

600
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,700
who's going to initiate it? You or me?

601
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:06,780
Of...

602
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,380
Of course that would be me.

603
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,220

604
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,460

Sang,

699
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,580
did your parents agree

700
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,980
to let you stay and have an internship in Yihe?

701
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,460
No, they didn't.

702
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,860
Why not?

703
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,380
Doing an internship is good.

704
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,420
-You can get to know the workplace.
-That's right.

705
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,440
It's not that they don't want me
to do an internship.

706
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,420
They just don't want me

707
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,540
to do it in Yihe.

708
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,060
They found me an internship

709
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,180
in Nanwu,

710
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,060
and they want me to go back there.

711
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,500
Then go back to Nanwu.

712
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,380
But I still feel

713
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,500
that staying in Yihe

714
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,060
may get me more opportunities.

715
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,500
Do you think staying in Yihe

716
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,660
has more job opportunities

717
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,940
or do you think your boyfriend

718
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,580
who is staying in Yihe is better?

719
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,860

735
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,380

00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,020
No.

757
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,460
When I saw you acting like this,

758
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,900
I thought you were jealous.

759
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,140
Are you really not jealous?

760
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,300
I am.

761
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,300
Just now,

762
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,460
I saw you flirting with her.

763
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,020
Me?

764
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,580
How did I flirt with her?

765
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:29,900
You did this.

766
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:33,780
That's not it.

767
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,100
She asked me

768
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,900
about the location of the cafe.

769
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:41,420
So I...

770
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:42,660
I told her

771
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,180
it's over there. That's all.

772
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,620
Couldn't you have told her properly?

773
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,540
Did you have to do this?

774
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,100
I'm not talking to you.

775
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,020
Okay.

776
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,420
Sorry to bother you.

777
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,500
Can I add you on WeChat?

778
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:10,780
Sorry,

779
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,020
I have a boyfriend.

780
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,140
Okay, then.

781
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,820
This watermelon looks pretty good.

782
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:22,300
Let's go.

783
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,140
What's wrong? Are you angry?

784
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:25,820
I'm not.

785
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,300
Are you jealous?

786
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:29,980
How is that possible?

787
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,500
He just asked for your WeChat contact.

788
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,700
What's there to be jealous about?

789
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:35,780
Wait.

790
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,660
I didn't give it to him.

791
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,500
But I saw you flirting

792
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,500
with him just now.

793
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,020
When did I flirt with him?

794
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:42,980
He didn't even ask for directions.

795
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,060
You did this to him.

796
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,500
What was that?

797
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,980
I said, "Sorry,

798
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,100
I have a boyfriend."

799
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:50,900
What do you have?

800
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,420
A boyfriend.

801
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:54,700
Present.

802
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,180
