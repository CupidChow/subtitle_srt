00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,540
Just ten minutes earlier than you.

193
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,420
Then what are you doing?

194
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,580
So he sent you back here, huh?

195
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,380
So which identity

196
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,260
did he use to send you back?

197
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,340
I'm not sure.

198
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,380
Not sure?

199
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,500
This is how you described it?

200
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,540
Did anything happen?

201
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,700
He told me

202
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,260
he had never been in a relationship
for the past few years.

203
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,900
Did he tell you himself?

204
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,900
I guess so.

205
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,380
So what else are you unsure about?

206
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,100
Wei,

207
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,300
do you remember

208
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,420
what I told you before

209
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,180
about his way of speaking

210
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,420
and his personality

211
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,300
being...

212
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,980
But I do think

213
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,340
he's a bit strange lately.

214
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,420
Strange?

215
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,060
He's getting stranger than before.

216
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,660
I just feel that...

217
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,220
He made me feel

218
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,460
that he has feelings...

219
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,300
I...

220
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,380
Maybe I'm overthinking

221
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,700
or too sensitive.

222
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,220
So you think

223
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,060
he also likes you?

224
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:33,740
No.

225
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,380
Well, not really.

226
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,420
That what is it?

227
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,540
Maybe just a little.

228
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:46,940
Oh my god.

229
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,540
You're such a coward.

230
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,180
How can you not dare

231
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,900
to even say it?

232
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,540
What's so bad about you?

233
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,940
I just think

234
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,140
it's impossible between us.

235
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,580
It's precisely because I like him

236
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,140
that I've always had this feeling.

237
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,580
So maybe

238
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,820
when he did something ordinary,

239
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,380
I'd misinterpret his intentions.

240
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,460
Sang...

241
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,020
It's been more than just a day or two.

242
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,780
I know how this feels.

243
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,220
And considering

244
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,100
our relationship,

245
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,540
we can't really have any changes.

246
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:32,860
Sang,

247
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:33,980
tell me.

248
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,180
What exactly are you worried about?

249
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,660
If he were a stranger

250
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:45,780
or someone

251
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,260
who never watched me grow up,

252
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,060
I would definitely pursue him

253
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,060
if I liked him this much.

254
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,980
Even if it means being ghosted

255
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,500
or being rejected,

256
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,860
I wouldn't be afraid.

257
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,180
It's just because this person

258
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,540
watched me grow up.

259
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:02,940
Can he really

260
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,140
have such feelings for me?

261
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,860
He can't be considered as someone

262
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,100
who watched you grow up.

263
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,980
At most,

264
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,380
he's someone you knew as an older brother

265
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,740
when you were a child.

266
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,020
I'll tell you what I think.

267
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,740
So you listen, okay?

268
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,300
I'm looking at this

269
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,580
from the perspective of an observer.

270
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,140
Now, both of you

271
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,060
are adults, right?

272
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,700
Even if he's four or five years older than you,

273
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,180
so what?

274
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,260
In today's society,

275
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,460
it's not strange

276
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,140
even if there's a seven or eight years gap.

277
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,540
Let alone four or five years.

278
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:33,900
Besides,

279
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,780
none of us think

280
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,780
it's strange.

281
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,500
But you're the issue.

282
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,420
What are you so conflicted about?

283
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,620
So what do you think I should do?

284
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,060
First of all,

285
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,340
stop thinking

286
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,820
about the fact that he's older than you.

287
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,620
Just interact

288
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,020
with him naturally.

289
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,220
Understand?

290
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,220
Interact naturally.

291
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,540
And secondly,

292
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,660
if the enemy doesn't make any move,
you do the same.

293
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,700
But if he does,

294
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,660
you must strike first.

295
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,100
Got it?

296
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:18,980
Think about it carefully.

297
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,140
I need to unpack my things.

298
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,500
If the enemy doesn't make any move,
I do the same.

299
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,860
But if he does,

300
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,780
I must strike first.

301
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,220
(How did you two meet?)

302
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,060
We met when we went out for fun.

303
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:44,940
Where did you go?

304
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,180
A pub.

305
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,100
I remember

306
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,740
when you were drunk, you told me you met him

307
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,620
at a karaoke.

308
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:56,740
Yes.

309
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,260
I met him at a karaoke.

310
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,260
(Looks like there is no such person.)

311
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,700
(Could it)

312
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,380
(really be me?)

313
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,620
Hey, Shenlan.

314
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,060
Call Qian Fei.

315
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,560
[Qian Fei]

316
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:16,620
What's up?

317
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,100
I'm busy right now.

318
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:18,740
What is it?

319
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,780
You're pretty smart.

320
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,660
That girl from before

321
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,620
said the guy she likes

322
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,740
is most likely me.

323
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,020
Right? I was right, right?

324
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,100
I knew it was you.

325
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,220
The moment you described it to me,

326
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:27,980
I knew it was you.

327
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,780
Since you're so clever,

328
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,860
I want to ask you something.

329
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,380
How did you

330
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,260
win your wife's heart?

331
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:33,940
Well,

332
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,540
it's my charming personality.

333
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,820
Why? Are you planning to pursue someone?

334
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:38,900
Just go ahead.

335
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,340
She likes you, doesn't she?

336
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:40,980
You can just confess to her directly

337
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,500
and that's it.

338
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,180
No.

339
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,420
I must pursue her.

340
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,620
Mainly, my girl

341
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,340
has always felt

342
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,540
that I couldn't possibly like her.

343
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,380
So,

344
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,060
I have to be straightforward with her

345
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,620
to make her happier.

346
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,900
Your girl?

347
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,580
How is she your girl now?

348
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,820
Does she know

349
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,340
that you already know

350
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,060
she likes you?

351
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,060
She doesn't know yet.

352
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,700
So I have to pretend

353
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,820
that I don't know either.

354
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:08,820
I have

355
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,620
to save her face, you know.

356
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,820
As expected of you.

357
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,060
When do you plan

358
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:14,740
to tell her?

359
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,820
Can you quickly tell me

360
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,300
how you won your wife's heart?

361
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,060
I'm busy right now.

362
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,180
Stop bothering me, will you?

363
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:22,980
Let's talk later in the evening.

364
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,140
Remember, okay?

365
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,500
Okay, bye.

366
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,740
[Duan Jiaxu]
(The lady)

367
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,180
(you saw at the airport that day...)

368
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,800
[Jiaxu]

369
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:53,940
Sang!

370
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,060
Keep it down.

371
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:56,900
Sang,

372
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,060
the enemy has made his move.

373
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,300
What?

374
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,420
The enemy is making his move.

375
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,060
Should I make mine too?

376
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:04,820
Yeah.

377
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,020
Now?

378
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:06,660
Yes, now.

379
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,220
What do I do?

380
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,220
We'll talk after you answer the call.

381
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,220
Answer it now.

382
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:10,780
I should head out.

383
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,540
No, just do it here.

384
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,020
Right here.

385
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,260
Answer it now.

386
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:13,820
Come on,

387
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,500
or else he hangs up.

388
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:15,900
Hello?

389
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,060
What took you so long to answer the phone?

390
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:21,980
Are you busy?

391
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,020
No.

392
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:24,780
What's going on?

393
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:26,740
I'll tell you later.

394
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,980
When will you be free?

395
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,100
Why? Is there anything you need from me?

396
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:38,940
Oh, nothing.

397
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,540
I just want to ask you out for a meal.

398
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,660
A meal?

399
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,820
He's asking her out for a meal.

400
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:46,660
Can I?

401
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,060
Sure.

402
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,020
I still owe you a meal anyway.

403
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:56,740
What do you mean by that?

404
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,420
Are you saying

405
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,420
you're planning to use the meal I'm treating you

406
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,180
as repayment for what you owed me last time?

407
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,740
That's quite a good deal.

408
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:05,940
So,

409
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,020
when are you free?

410
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,020
Saturday.

411
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,260
Oh, wait. I can't.

412
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,100
How about Friday?

413
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,500
I have to go to the library to study

414
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,740
with my classmates this Saturday.

415
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:15,900
Okay.

416
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,700
Then,

417
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,260
I'll send you

418
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,420
the time and the name of the restaurant to you.

419
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,260
Okay.

420
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,060
That's all then.

421
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,300
Bye-bye.

422
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:31,740
Bye-bye.

423
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,780
What's going on?

424
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,100
Don't exclude us both.

425
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,780
It's Sang Zhi's crush

426
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,580
asking her out.

427
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,260
Really?

428
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:53,980
Crush?

429
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:54,980
You mean

430
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,020
the one

431
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,060
you've been secretly admiring?

432
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,580
The one working at a game-developing company

433
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,260
who's handsome

434
00:22:59,260 --> 00:22:59,940
and the one you threw up on?

435
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,900
That crush?

436
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:01,980
Well,

437
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,260
you don't have to mention

438
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,460
about me throwing up on him.

439
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,540
Okay.

440
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,780
So he asked you out for a meal, huh?

441
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,100
That's great.

442
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,180
It's working out, Sang.

443
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,780
Your secret crush will no longer
stay as a crush soon.

444
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,820
What do you mean by that?

445
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,740
It's not like we don't know each other.

446
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,260
What about you and Jiang Ming?

447
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:20,740
You two...

448
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:21,740
Me and him?

449
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,060
We're

450
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,660
just ordinary friends.

451
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,660
I already made it clear to him.

452
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,060
Our Sang sure is charming.

453
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,420
If he suddenly asks you out,

454
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,020
is it possible that he's going to confess to you?

455
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,180
Confess?

456
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,060
That's not possible.

457
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,300
It's just a meal.

458
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,460
Why not?

459
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:47,940
I'm sure...

460
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,780
Wait a minute.

461
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,180
Since the enemy made his move,

462
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,740
it's definitely more

463
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,460
than just a meal.

464
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,940
You have to be fully prepared.

465
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:57,940
-She's right.
-Understand?

466
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,500
Do something about your hair

467
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,300
and your outfit.

468
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,060
[14 March, Wednesday]

469
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,990
[He never forgot what he promised me back then.]

470
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,000
[I misunderstood him.]

471
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,740
We tested it several times

472
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,580
with the quality assurance engineer.

473
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,780
The Celestial Progression System's

474
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,740
overall process

475
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,020
is already functional.

476
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,940
The response capacity of non-player characters

477
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,420
looks even more real than before.

478
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,100
However,

479
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,180
the generalization ability
of artificial intelligence

480
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,220
is still not very strong.

481
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,020
Wang,

482
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,460
any ideas?

483
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,020
I think

484
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,900
even though there hasn't been a player trial,

485
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,980
considering the current level of completeness,

486
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,940
I still have confidence

487
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,100
in the Celestial Progression System.

488
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,220
What's with that attitude?

489
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,380
I'm just stating

490
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,460
my opinion honestly, okay?

491
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:55,500
Besides,

492
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,900
there's still room for improvement.

493
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,100
We just need to

494
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,500
add more language data
and expand our language database

495
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,340
so that players could feel

496
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,820
every character in our game world

497
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,860
truly exists.

498
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:06,660
That's good.

499
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,340
Then,

500
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,340
based on the players' profiles

501
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,540
and their discussion points,

502
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,860
we'll also expand

503
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,540
our learning library.

504
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,100
Let's work hard

505
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,100
to make artificial intelligence

506
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,500
more realistic and trustworthy.

507
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,420
Next month, we'll invite players

508
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,620
for a small test.

509
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:21,940
We're just a few months away

510
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,820
from the launch.

511
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,420
Everyone, keep up the hard work.

512
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,420
Thank you, guys.

513
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,260
Then I'll get going too.

514
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,140
Thank you for your hard work, Wang.

515
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:30,700
Bye-bye.

516
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:35,940
Our Duan

517
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,420
sure is a talented guy.

518
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,700
He looks especially handsome today.

519
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,580
What?

520
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,140
You look cool today, Duan.

521
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,700
Work seriously.

522
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:06,780
He's here. He's here.

523
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:08,740
He's here.

524
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,100
He's already here.

525
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,180
Are you ready to go?

526
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,500
I'll be right there.

527
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,260
Sang,

528
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,300
it's your first date.

529
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,540
It's not a date.

530
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:35,940
It's just a meal.

531
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,620
-Yeah, right.
-Sure, it's a meal.

532
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,460
You look pretty.

533
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,020
If I go,

534
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,100
will you guys feel lonely?

535
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,060
Not at all.

536
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,020
Just go.

00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,340
♪Trying to hide the happiness under a calm face♪

538
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,060

Bye-bye.

540
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:50,900
Bye-bye.

541
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,420

-Have fun.

You look pretty today.

549
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:41,740
Later,

550
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,660
we'll go to the restaurant

551
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,580
we went to last time.

552
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,780
I want to introduce someone to you.

553
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,820
Someone else is joining?

554
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,420
You'll know when you guys meet later.

555
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:52,620
Let's go.

556
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,340
(Didn't I promise you before?)

557
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,580
If I have a girlfriend,

558
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,220
I'll introduce her to you first.

559
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,300
(If he has a girlfriend,)

560
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,260
(it would be inappropriate for me
to sit in the front passenger seat.)

561
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,340
Are you taking me as a driver?

562
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,340
Remember to buckle up.

563
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,340
(He seems to be in a good mood today.)

564
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,140
(Is he really taking me)

565
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,260
(to meet his girlfriend?)

566
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,260
Over there.

567
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,740
Let me do the introduction.

568
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,260
This is Siyun.

569
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,060
The producer of "A Dream of Jianghu",

570
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:32,900
my superior.

571
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,820
This is Sang Zhi.

572
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:37,700
Nice to meet you.

573
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:38,460
Nice to meet you too.

574
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,100
Come

575
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,260
and take a seat.

576
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,380
Sit.

577
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,940
Before,

578
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,860
I went to the airport to pick you up with him.

579
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,900
Do you still remember me?

580
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,540
Yes, I remember.

581
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,020
Well,

582
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,260
I always hear Duan talk about you.

583
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,620
I heard you're studying at Yihe University.

584
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,180
Yes.

585
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,020
The last time I saw you,

586
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,740
you were still in high school.

587
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,660
Now, you look so beautiful.

588
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,020
You must be hungry.

589
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:11,660
Here.

590
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,580
Why don't you order what you want to eat?

591
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:15,740
Go ahead.

592
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,500
Siyun,

593
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,740
have you ordered what you wanted?

594
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,380
Yes, I've ordered some.

595
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,380
See what you like to eat.

596
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:33,980
Jiaxu,

597
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,340
what do you want to eat?

598
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,420
Why don't you and Siyun order first?

599
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,540
I need to go to the washroom.

600
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:41,460
Okay.

601
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,540
We'll order these for now.

602
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,500
Excuse me.

603
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,660
Thank you.

604
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,500
Last time at the airport,

605
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,660
I didn't have a chance

606
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,660
to greet you

607
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,380
when I met you.

608
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,700
I'm sorry to have troubled you

609
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,580
at the airport back then.

610
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,460
It was no trouble at all.

611
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,580
It was indeed inappropriate of me

612
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,020
to tag along.

613
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,940
But I didn't think much of it.

614
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,140
I wanted to lend a hand.

615
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,460
Duan had a fever

616
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,860
that day.

617
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,380
I wanted to ask my husband to drive him there.

618
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,420
But he had to meet

619
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,780
a client at the last minute.

620
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,260
So I had to bring him there.

621
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,700
He wasn't feeling well that day.

622
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,340
So I got off the car with him

623
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,100
to go and find you.

624
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,220
Later,

625
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,020
he said he was afraid
you might feel uncomfortable

626
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,460
because there was a stranger around.

627
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,580
So he asked me to leave first.

628
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,340
That's why I didn't

629
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,180
greet you that day.

630
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,780
It's okay.

631
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,820
At first, I thought

632
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,780
you were a relative of his

633
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,580
because he was very angry that day.

634
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,180
When you were crying in the restroom,

635
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,420
he was still talking about it.

636
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,140
The restroom is over there.

637
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:56,780
Go first.

638
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,940
I'll take you to eat something delicious later.

639
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,420
It's alright.

640
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,260
I remember

641
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,340
the first time I met her.

642
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,380
She was wrestling around with her brother.

643
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,340
She could cry anytime.

644
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,620
Previously, her biggest worry was probably

645
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,380
getting her parents called
to see the homeroom teacher or something.

646
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,140
But just now,

647
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,140
when I saw her holding back tears

648
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,140
and not daring to cry,

649
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,020
I felt sorry for her.

650
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,020
Well, that's how young girls

651
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,300
slowly grow up.

652
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,780
Don't worry too much.

653
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,780
(So,)

654
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,460
(that was what they were talking about
at that time.)

655
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,140
(I actually thought)

656
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:46,980
(they were...)

657
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,380
What's wrong?

658
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:50,740
Oh, nothing.

659
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,580
Duan

660
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,700
is a great guy.

661
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,380
He's young and promising.

662
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,580
He's also good-looking.

663
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,900
The most important thing is

664
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,500
that since I've known him,

665
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,020
he has always been single

666
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,020
and doesn't involve

667
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,820
in any messy relationship.

668
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,300
To be honest,

669
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,420
I'm really curious

670
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,740
about what kind of girl

671
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,220
this guy will end up with in the future.

672
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,460
Have some water.

673
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,300
Thank you.

674
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:27,980
What are you guys doing here?

675
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,540
Didn't we agree

676
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,700
to have a meal together today?

677
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,700
I searched online
and saw this restaurant has good reviews.

678
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,380
So I brought everyone here.

679
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,060
Duan,

680
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,820
who's this?

681
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,140
Who is she?

682
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:43,860
Who is she?

683
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:44,980
Why don't you introduce her to us?

684
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,060
A friend.

685
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,540
(Friend?)

686
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,620
What kind of friend?

687
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,060
(He said I'm his friend,)

688
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,980
(not a sister.)

689
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,500
(In the past,)

690
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,740
(he used to say I was his sister,)

691
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,420
(a relative's child.)

692
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,020
Duan,

693
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:01,940
make the introduction.

694
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:02,820
Come on.

695
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,220
My friend's name is Sang Zhi.

696
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,500
She's studying at a university here.

697
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,140
This is Xun.

698
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,620
Our company's

699
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,300
middleware consultant

700
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,780
and also Siyun's husband.

701
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:13,780
I'm Li Xun.

702
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:14,980
Hello, Xun.

703
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,020
Hi,

704
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:16,980
I'm Jia Yang.

705
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:17,980
Duan's underling.

706
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:18,540
Nice to meet you.

707
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,780
I'm Bai, you can just call me Bai.

708
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,060
Hello there.

709
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:21,700
I'm Zhang Sen.

710
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,820
I'm also Duan's underling.

711
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,740
Hello, I'm Bo.

712
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,620
Hi, I'm Mi.

713
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,540
-Hello.
-Hi.

714
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,660
I thought you guys are here for a meal.

715
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,420
Go and eat.

716
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:30,900
Wait.

717
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:31,940
Why don't we eat together

718
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,740
since it's a company gathering?

719
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,660
Since you're his friend,

720
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,500
let's eat together.

721
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,820
Excuse me.

722
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,780
Can we join the tables?

723
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,780
Come and give me a hand.

724
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,180
Help me out here.

725
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:38,820
Let's join the tables and sit together.

726
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,180
I'll help you.

727
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:41,620
Menu, please.

728
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,380
How about we eat elsewhere?

729
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,100
Can we?

730
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,260
Xun, Siyun.

731
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,540
We still have something to do.

732
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,660
Why don't you guys eat? We'll leave first.

733
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,540
You're not joining us?

734
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,580
You guys, go ahead.

735
00:34:59,180 --> 00:34:59,780
Bye-bye, Siyun.

736
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,420
Xun, bye-bye.

737
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,340
Are you guys leaving just like that?

738
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,020
Why aren't you joining us?

739
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,180
Duan, why are you leaving?

740
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,260
Is Duan leaving with her?

741
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,060
What do you want to eat?

742
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,220
I'll make a reservation.

743
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,100
I... I'm still not hungry.

744
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:28,740
Jiaxu,

745
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,100
let's not come

746
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,700
to this restaurant again later.

747
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,140
I feel we're not meant

748
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,100
to come here.

749
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,220
Actually, they just wanted

750
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,660
to join in the fun.

751
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,860
They meant no harm.

752
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:40,740
I know.

753
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,380
I meant this restaurant.

754
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,100
All right.

755
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,860
Let's find something else to eat.

756
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,780
Jiaxu,

757
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,300
did you ask Siyun

758
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,420
to explain what happened?

759
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,700
She told you?

760
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,380
Yes, she told me.

761
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,020
Jiaxu,

762
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,340
didn't you tell me

763
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,700
at the airport at the time?

764
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,420
I believed you.

765
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:18,500
Is that so?

766
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:25,780
I know

767
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,060
girls your age

768
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,140
always like

769
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,340
to believe

770
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,020
in some strange sixth sense.

771
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,060
And I don't want you to misunderstand.

772
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,060
Or else,

773
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,620
it'll be troublesome in the future.

774
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,460
So where are we going later?

775
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,180
Well...

776
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,020
If you don't want to eat anything,

777
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,340
why don't we go and watch a movie?

778
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,340
I know

779
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,300
there's a new animated film released recently.

780
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,140
I happen to know

781
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,300
there's a cinema nearby.

782
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,580
It should be ahead.

783
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,340
We still have fifteen minutes.

784
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,180
So we can take our time.

785
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,300
Jiaxu,

786
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,420
can I order a drink?

787
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,700
Sure.

788
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:36,860
What do you want?

789
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:40,980
-Well...
-Welcome.

790
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,340
I'll have White Peach Oolong

791
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,260
with 30% sugar.

792
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,380
White Peach Oolong with 30% sugar.

793
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,220
Large and make it hot.

794
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,460
[Yu Xin]
(How are things?)

795
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:50,940
No, thanks.

796
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,620
Just one cup?

797
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:54,740
Yes, how much is it?

798
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:55,860
Scan the code here.

799
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,140
One White Peach Oolong with 30% sugar.

800
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:58,740
Hot one.

801
00:37:59,260 --> 00:37:59,620
Done.

802
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,420
[Sang Zhi]
(I might)

803
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,420
(go back late.)

804
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,300
She's coming back late.

805
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,740
Late? What time exactly?

806
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,860
What's the situation?

807
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,780
Ask her. I'll ask her.

808
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,100
Then,

809
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,500
does that mean it's a success?

810
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,420
Don't come back.

811
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,020
Seriously?

812
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,420
[Ning Wei]

813
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,220
(Something is up here.)

814
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:18,940
[Ning Wei]
(Did I make the right guess?)

815
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,980
(Did he confess?)

816
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,260
[Sang Zhi]
(No.)

817
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,900
(We're going to the movie together.)

818
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,940
[Yu Xin]
(Could it be the theater version?)

819
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:25,780
(Didn't we agree)

820
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,500
(to watch it together?)

821
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,460
Who are you texting?

822
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,500
My roommates.

823
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:33,580
Excuse me.

824
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,900
Your White Peach Oolong is ready.

825
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,260
Would you like to drink it directly

826
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,060
or take it away?

827
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:37,820
-Directly.
-She'll drink it directly.

828
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:41,700
Here.

829
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,420
Thank you.

830
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:43,900
Thank you.

831
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,460
Take care.

832
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,580
Can you help with this?

833
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,260
Sure.

834
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,220
Aren't you drinking?

835
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,900
I'll buy a bottle of water

836
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,020
at the cinema later.

837
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:54,740
What's so funny?

838
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,300
As expected of you.

839
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,060
What about me?

840
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,700
Nothing much. Just very healthy.

841
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,300
Healthy?

842
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:06,980
What's wrong?

843
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:09,980
Why is it milk tea?

844
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,260
Milk tea?

845
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,700
It really is milk tea.

846
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,580
Did they get the cups mixed up?

847
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:19,780
Don't tell me you're allergic

848
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,660
to milk tea.

849
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,900
I'm allergic to milk.

850
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,060
But it's okay.

851
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,380
I just took a small sip.

852
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:28,860
Do you feel

853
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,860
any discomfort?

854
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:30,860
No.

855
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,860
Then wait here for me.

856
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:35,980
I'll get you another one.

857
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,620
Are your really okay?

858
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,620
I bought you tea.

859
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:49,500
Okay.

860
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,020
Thank you.

861
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,460
What...

862
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,500
What happened to your face?

863
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,980
It's breaking out in a rash.

864
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,580
Don't touch it with your hand.

865
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,020
I'll take you to the hospital.

866
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,780
It's okay. I can just buy some medicine.

867
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:02,900
Listen to me.

868
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,180
Let's go.

869
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:04,860
Then,

870
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,860
what about the movie?

871
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,180
We'll watch it next time.

872
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,420
Why does it have to be today?

873
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,660
We couldn't even watch the movie.

874
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,060
It's really frustrating.

875
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,020
Come on, take the medicine.

876
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,060
It should make you feel better.

877
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,660
The doctor said to take two pills.

878
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:27,460
Siyun.

879
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,020
What a coincidence.

880
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,140
How so?

881
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,700
I happened to see a cake on the way.

882
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,100
So I bought it for you.

883
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,660
What do you want?

884
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,100
Siyun,

885
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,940
are you free this Friday?

886
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,260
I want to buy you a meal

887
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,700
and

888
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,140
ask you for a favor.

889
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,220
What favor?

890
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:53,580
Well,

891
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,140
do you remember
the girl I picked up at the airport

892
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,420
with you before?

893
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,380
Your relative's kid.

894
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:02,260
She

895
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,620
might have misunderstood

896
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,540
that you're my girlfriend.

897
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,540
I want you to help me explain it to her.

898
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,220
Sure, no problem.

899
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,180
I'll find an opportunity

900
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,660
to talk to her over the meal.

901
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:13,340
That would do, right?

902
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:16,940
By the way,

903
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,620
can you also

904
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,220
tell her

905
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:20,860
that I haven't had a girlfriend

906
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:21,980
all these years?

907
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,900
Do I have to mention that too?

908
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:26,540
Okay.

909
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,540
Is there anything else you want her to know?

910
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:29,580
That's all.

911
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,020
I can leave after the meal, right?

912
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:33,620
Okay.

913
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,340
I won't be the third wheel.

914
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,740
I'll get back to work then.

915
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:39,380
Go on.

916
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:40,540
Thank you.

917
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:47,660
By the way...

918
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,540
What else do you want me to do?

919
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,940
When you say

920
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,060
I haven't been dating,

921
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,500
can you make it sound more natural?

922
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,180
Just...

923
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:55,980
You know...

924
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,580
Okay, I know what to do.

925
