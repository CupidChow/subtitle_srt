[Episode 13]

17
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,380
I don't usually drink much.

18
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,700
Who did you go with?

19
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:57,860
My roommates.

20
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,700
I know all of them.

21
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,780
Roommates?

22
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,300
The guy

23
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,300
who came out with you yesterday,

24
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,620
1.95 meters tall,

25
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,780
the one who just gave you a hamburger,

26
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,340
is he also your roommate?

27
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,100
No, that's a friend

28
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,580
of my roommate's boyfriend.

29
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,660
Is that him?

30
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,700
What do you mean by that?

31
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,100
The guy you like.

32
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,260
Is it him?

33
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,100
Is he?

34
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:34,660
No.

35
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:36,940
No?

36
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,100
So tell me,

37
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,420
if you don't like this type,

38
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,140
what kind of guy do you look into?

39
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:41,620
I don't want to.

40
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,540
Jiaxu.

41
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,340
The bubble...

42
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,220
Is that guy cute

43
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,300
and delicate-looking?

44
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,300
No.

45
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,500
He...

46
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,020
He's manly.

47
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,460
Manly?

48
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,220
So,

49
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,700
you like

50
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,220
muscular guys?

51
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,340
Do you?

52
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,700
I don't.

53
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,900
He has no muscles,

54
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,740
yet manly.

55
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,260
Plus, he's attentive to everyone.

56
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,460
But the guy you described

57
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,420
sounds like a jerk.

58
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:34,940
He's not a jerk.

59
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,820
He sure is.

60
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,660
He's not.

61
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,740
You're so nosy.

62
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,940
I'm nosy?

63
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,860
I haven't seen such a guy

64
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,100
throughout my life.

65
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,220
Gosh.

66
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,180
I'm just curious.

67
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,300
You're so nosy.

68
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,820
Can you stop asking?

69
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:49,780
Fine.

70
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,420
I won't ask anymore.

71
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,340
(If you're curious,)

72
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,940
(just look in the mirror.)

73
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:04,980
Jiaxu.

74
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,260
Yes?

75
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,220
You...

76
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,260
You're in your twenties now.

77
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,580
Why don't you see someone

78
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,060
instead of bothering me...

79
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,260
I don't have a girlfriend, though.

80
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,740
Maybe

81
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,900
you can introduce one to me.

82
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,460
That won't do.

83
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,780
I only know girls around my age.

84
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,380
Around your age?

85
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,620
I'm fine with that.

86
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,420
What do you mean?

87
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,540
Like what it sounds.

88
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,620
(Is he kidding me?)

89
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,820
(He has never said something like this)

90
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,900
(before.)

91
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,380
Pull over.

92
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,820
Mom.

93
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,020
Zhi.

94
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,140
Zhi.

95
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,380
Zhi.

96
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,380
I missed you so much.

97
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,260
You're finally home.

98
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,260
What took you so long?

99
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,220
Is the flight delayed?

100
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,260
No.

101
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,700
It's Yan.

102
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,700
Yan made me wait at the airport

103
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,860
for so long.

104
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,860
Why?

105
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:49,860
Why did you let Zhi

106
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,660
wait at the airport?

107
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,460
No, Mom.

108
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,500
You asked me to buy

109
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,180
her favorite

110
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,420
crispy duck with yam paste.

111
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,020
I waited in line for half an hour.

112
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,820
You should've gone

113
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,500
and waited in line earlier.

114
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,020
That's right.

115
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:58,580
It's dangerous

116
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,380
to leave Zhi alone

117
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,180
in the airport.

118
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,060
My sweetheart.

119
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:02,580
You've lost weight.

120
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,620
No.

121
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,420
I made you

122
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,460
your favorite dish, what's it?

123
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,140
Steamed fish.

124
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:06,980
Not only that...

125
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:07,740
I've bought you big strawberries.

126
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,340
Strawberries?

127
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,140
Big strawberries.

128
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:10,980
White strawberries.

129
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,900
Carry the luggage in.

130
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,340
I...

131
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,340
Take all of them.

132
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,820
So when the little princess comes home,

133
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,300
I become a worker?

134
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,220
The door...

135
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,580
The little princess is home.

136
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,460
Mom.

137
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,780
Your New Year present.

138
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,180
You bought this for me?

139
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,180
Something you like.

140
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:44,900
Open it.

141
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,100
Be careful, it's hot.

142
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,900
Is this it?

143
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,620
Yes.

144
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,780
And this too.

145
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,860
You bought two.

146
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,700
I've been saving up for a long while.

147
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,740
Thank you so much.

148
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,180
Dad.

149
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,460
This is

150
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,620
your New Year present.

151
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,620
Thank you.

152
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,660
It's hand cream.

153
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,380
You can wear it

154
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,020
when you go to the construction site.

155
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,980
And your hands won't get chapped
during winter.

156
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,420
Thank you, Zhi.

157
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,340
My daughter is always considerate.

158
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,820
I've grown up now.

159
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,540
I've become mature.

160
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:12,900
Thank you.

161
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:13,940
Don't worry about me.

162
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,900
Because you've given her too much allowance.

163
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,740
Stop offering her next semester.

164
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:18,980
What about mine?

165
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,780
That's more like it.

166
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,020
Nice.

167
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:24,860
Really?

168
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,020
Super cool.

169
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,020
Mom, look at him.

170
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,220
He's cool, right?

171
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:29,620
What's wrong?

172
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,340
What the heck is this? I don't want it.

173
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:30,820
Take it back.

174
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,180
Why not?

175
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,580
They look ugly.

176
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,940
It's not ugly.

177
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,380
I don't like the glasses.

178
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,420
Dad, do you think I look good with these on?

179
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,180
You look sophomoric.

180
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,580
Nice.

181
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,940
I know you have fine taste.

182
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,940
The asymmetric glasses

183
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,540
is on-trend this year.

184
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:48,740
Don't you like it?

185
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,260
No, I don't.

186
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,500
No?

187
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,180
No.

188
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:51,940
No?

189
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,580
No.

190
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,620
Say you like it!

191
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,580
I like it!

192
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,140
Say you like it heartily.

193
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,020
I heartily don't like it.

194
00:07:59,180 --> 00:07:59,580
Well, enough.

195
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,540
I really enjoy it

196
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,460
when our home has so much noise.

197
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:02,620
Eat this.

198
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,020
Sit.

199
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,740
Tastes good?

200
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,300
Little demon.

201
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,900
You know what,

202
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,420
I waited in line for half an hour

203
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,780
to buy

204
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,420
the crispy duck with yam paste.

205
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,580
You better finish them, besides...

206
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,700
Thank you, my brother.

207
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,780
Give me my glasses back.

208
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,460
I'll take them since they're free.

209
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,140
Tastes good?

210
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:34,780
Zhi.

211
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,940
Last time,

212
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,540
you told me Duan has appendicitis.

213
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,300
How is he now?

214
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,500
He has already recovered.

215
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:43,740
The doctor said

216
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,380
because his meal timing is irregular.

217
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,860
He didn't eat properly.

218
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,100
So you heard that too.

219
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,380
You mustn't skip meals.

220
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:50,780
Before,

221
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,180
he had a tough life

222
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,140
in which he often worked.

223
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,380
Probably it contributed

224
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,340
to his health issues.

225
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,900
How is his work now?

226
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,780
Pretty well.

227
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,420
Many of my coursemates

228
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,780
know about the game he designed.

229
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,620
It's popular now.

230
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,380
Good to hear that.

231
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,180
This boy

232
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,340
is pretty good.

233
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,500
Look at Yan.

234
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,660
He looks dumb.

235
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,060
Sang Yan.

236
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,260
Look at Duan

237
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,100
and yourself.

238
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,380
I've set up a meeting for you

239
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,740
with Ms. Zhang's daughter.

240
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,700
The girl waited for you all afternoon

241
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,300
and you didn't show up.

242
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,140
I've told you,

243
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,220
I'm not going.

244
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,980
But I've made the date for you.

245
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,020
Why didn't you go?

246
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,580
You should've turned up

247
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,140
out of courtesy

248
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,460
and met with her.

249
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,420
Dad.

250
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,220
Mom.

251
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,020
Do I look like

252
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,140
I need that?

253
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,340
Absolutely not.

254
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,140
So, stop setting up meetings like that.

255
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,340
I won't go.

256
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,180
Blind date?

257
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,380
Fine.

258
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,820
I've poked my meddling nose.

259
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,940
You've been idly

260
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,700
and doing nothing all day.

261
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,220
Don't you have time

262
00:09:59,220 --> 00:09:59,860
for an afternoon tea?

263
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,940
I didn't know you were so busy.

264
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,340
That was close.

265
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,940
You're so stubborn.

266
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,420
You'll end up alone.

267
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,300
That's enough.

268
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,220
Don't waste the strawberries.

269
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,100
I found

270
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,180
that we've lost the dynamic.

271
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,300
I'll toss one. Open wide.

272
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,580
Don't waste the strawberries.

273
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,500
Zhi, I made this streamed fish for you.

274
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,060
Eat it.

275
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:23,980
I'll toss the bowl.

276
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,220
Zhi.

277
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,580
I made this steamed fish for you.

278
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,820
Hurry and eat.

279
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:28,700
Chop-chop.

280
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,300
It's going to get cold.

281
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:29,700
All right.

282
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,340
Hurry and eat.

283
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,060
Come on.

284
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,220
I don't need them.

285
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:42,860
Put them back.

286
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,460
Not this.

287
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,980
Are you trying to hit me with that?

288
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,340
Get off me.

289
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,460
What's wrong with you?

290
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,620
You must want something from me.

291
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:06,860
You...

292
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,580
Do you go on a blind date?

293
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,580
Why do you care?

294
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,820
No wonder

295
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,300
you're so kind to me.

296
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,460
So, you didn't go on that blind date?

297
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,700
Do you think

298
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,300
I need to go on a blind date?

299
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,420
Don't you need that?

300
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,980
But how are you going
to carry on with your life later

301
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,700
if you don't go on blind dates?

302
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,980
Was it because you felt embarrassed?

303
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,740
If you do feel that way,

304
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,620
you can

305
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,580
ask Duan Jiaxu to go with you.

306
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,580
Will you take him with you?

307
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,620
You're single.

308
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,940
He's one year older than you,

309
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,500
and he's single too.

310
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,420
Besides...

311
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,700
Besides, I guess he would want

312
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,340
a girlfriend now.

313
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,820
Maybe you can go to Yihe,

314
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,700
or he can come to Nanwu.

315
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,220
You two can go on a blind date together.

316
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,580
So you won't

317
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,460
feel embarrassed.

318
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,580
Why?

319
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,620
Did Duan Jiaxu rub you the wrong way?

320
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,540
It's just

321
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,060
that he's not young.

322
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,780
If he still can't find a girlfriend,

323
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,620
he might

324
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,460
end up being pathetically alone.

325
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,060
That's his matter

326
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,660
to end up pathetically alone.

327
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,140
Don't compare me

328
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,060
with him.

329
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,860
So, are you going on blind dates or not?

330
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:44,820
No.

331
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,860
In that case...

332
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,100
But Mom told you to go.

333
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,180
Do you know why?

334
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,740
Because there's one girl

335
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:04,860
trying to pursue me.

336
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,420
Got it?

337
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,020
What's with that look?

338
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:16,940
I mean it.

339
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,540
So,

340
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,940
you should ask Duan Jiaxu

341
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,860
to go there alone

342
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,780
and enjoy the blind date

343
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,780
with his tacky pick-up lines.

344
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,100
Open the door.

345
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,540
Open it.

346
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,460
Climb over it.

347
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,780
Open the door.

348
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,220
You're so childish.

349
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,620
Come on and say, "Yan, you look gorgeous."

350
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,460
Come on.

351
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,500
You look gorgeous.

352
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,700
Louder.

353
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,700
You look handsome.

354
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,540
Louder.

355
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,020
What's wrong with you?

356
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,620
You look gorgeous. Open the door now.

357
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,500
You should've done that earlier.

358
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,220
My good sister.

359
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,580
Please.

360
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,460
Gorgeous, my foot.

361
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,500
I have to go out later.

362
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,420
Mom!

363
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:20,980
Mom!

364
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,020
Zhi, smell this.

365
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,460
Does it smell like the sun?

366
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,180
Why would it smell like the sun?

367
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:28,900
I've sunned the quilt

368
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,300
the entire day.

369
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,220
That's why

370
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,700
I just finished making the bed.

371
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:35,580
All right.

372
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:36,820
Go and take

373
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,060
the teddy bear blanket.

374
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,060
Is it still in the cabinet?

375
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,220
Yes, inside there.

376
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:42,900
Okay.

377
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,580
Did you see it?

378
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,060
Yes.

379
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:03,900
I'll put it here.

380
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:04,900
I'll do it.

381
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,620
Mom, go and get rest.

382
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,300
It's late now.

383
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,420
Good night.

384
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,220
Good night.

385
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:09,780
All right.

386
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,020
I'll go and wash this first.

387
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:11,580
Go ahead.

388
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,020
Okay.

389
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:12,780
Good night.

390
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,180
Bye-bye.

391
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:13,820

00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,500
(Maybe)

395
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,140
you can introduce one to me.

396
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,700
That won't do.

397
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,900
I only know girls around my age.

398
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,460
Around your age?

399
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,260
I'm fine with that.

00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,740

(Is she 18 years old?)

409
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,220
(Is it fine as long as she's 18 years old?)

410
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,220
Isn't she considered an adult if she has grown up

411
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,620
and is already in college?

412
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,420
Why not?

413
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,100

418

Hey, don't.

Tell me.

00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,500
I'm so curious.

467
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,100
Please.

468
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,300
What kind of girl is she?

469
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,900
It's a little girl.

470
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,300
She's a bit younger.

471
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,660
You don't know her.

472
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,180
What's wrong with young age?

473
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,780
As long as she's not a minor.

474
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,900
If she's of legal age,

475
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,740
you should pursue her

476
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,700
or I'll look down on you.

477
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,580
Well, it's not like that.

478
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,740
I somewhat

479
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,500
feel guilty about it.

480
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:33,780
Guilty?

481
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,740
Aren't you worried that the girl

482
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,660
might be taken by others?

483
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,700
That's normal.

484
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,340
If she can meet a good guy,

485
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,700
I'm happy for her.

486
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,060
So, that means

487
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,940
she has someone she likes?

488
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,460
What an impressive girl.

489
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,220
She doesn't even take an interest in you.

490
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,740

491
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,700
Tell me

492
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,300
what kind of guy does she look into.

493
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,220
I can analyze it for you

494
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,020
and give you some advice.

495
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,500
Tell me.

496
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,740
Well...

497
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,180
This guy

498
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,740
is quite a flirt.

499
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,020
He's a ladies' man and attentive to everyone.

500
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,500
Maybe he's a bit shameless.

501
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,420
Aren't these referring to you?

502
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,100
Are you insulting me?

503
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,020
No.

504
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,100
Is there any chance

505
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,700
that the one she talked about is actually you?

506
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,180
Impossible.

507
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,740
I saw that guy before.

508
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,540
His image fits

509
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,260
her description quite well.

510
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,700
He likes flirting.

511
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,700
Such a jerk.

512
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,740
Maybe not.

513
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,020
You see,

514
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,060
one

515
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:32,900
will speak otherwise

516
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,420
when they're in front of their crush.

517
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,340
When I was in college,

518
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,340
I courted a girl,

519
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,940
Wan Ling from the School of Foreign Languages.

520
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,820
When she broke up with her boyfriend,

521
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,660
she would come to me.

522
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,580
But when she got back together
with her boyfriend,

523
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,500
she came and asked me,

524
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:42,900
"Qian Fei,

525
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,220
what kind of girl do you like?

526
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,500
I can introduce one to you."

527
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,580
I hardly answered that

528
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,340
when I looked at her.

529
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,820
So, I simply made up someone

530
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,540
based on her.

531
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,300
You made up a girl

532
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,060
based on her?

533
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,500
It's not possible.

534
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,260
But it's possible too.

535
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:05,940
Right?

536
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:07,740
I tell you what,

537
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,700
I swear to you,

538
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:09,740
I've never seen guys

539
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,660
who look so similar

540
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,780
to the description like you do in my life.

541
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,100
Excuse me, I'd like to order some more.

542
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,820

543
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,220
(is me?)

544
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,820
Mister, what would you like to order?

545
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:25,740
Chicken wings.

546
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:26,660
All right.

547
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,500
And this too.

548
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,340
Okay, right away.

549
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,100

550
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,300
(See you later.)

551
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:54,900
(Sure.)

552
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,260
(Why did he tell me this?)

553
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,220
Should I leave the red envelope here?

554
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,060
No, Zhi.

555
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,220
We're waiting for you. Hurry over.

556
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:11,940
No?

557
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:12,660
It's fine.

558
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,580
-Come on, let's go.
-Let's go.

559
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:14,780
What took you

560
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,740
so long today?

561
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,100
The traffic is terrible.

562
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:17,940
You know what,

563
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,500
Qian Fei is so nervous.

564
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,020
Bro,

565
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,660
did you put on more weight
because you're too happy?

566
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,580
Not much weight.

567
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,180
Not much.

568
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:30,820
Hi, Zhi.

569
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,900
Qian Fei.

570
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,260
Happy wedding day.

571
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:35,980
When we were at the entrance earlier,

572
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,540
I've stopped her

573
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,340
from giving the red envelope.

574
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,220
You won't take it, right?

575
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:38,740
Yes.

576
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,180
Well,

577
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,500
it's nothing, please accept it.

578
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,500
I can't accept this.

579
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,500
It's the thought that counts.

580
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,260
No need to give me a red envelope.

581
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,220
Please take it.

582
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,260
No.

583
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:45,820
No.

584
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,420
You're so generous today.

585
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,500
Am I?

586
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,740
You should give me two.

587
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,180
Don't just drink by yourself.

588
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,500
Let's have a drink

589
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,980
after the wedding, all right?

590
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,300
Take your seat.

591
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,180
Right, come on and sit.

592
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,020
You'll sit here.

593
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,500
Sit here.

594
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,020
Let's go, Zhi.

595
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,180
Go and take a seat.

596
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:02,980
You sit here.

597
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,460
Sit.

598
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:05,700
If he doesn't want this,

599
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,420
give it to me.

600
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:07,700
Duan.

601
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:08,940
Duan.

602
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,180
Over here.

603
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:09,780
Over here.

604
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,260
What took you so long?

605
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,460
I was making rounds outside.

606
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,940
You cleaned up nicely today.

607
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,500
He's handsome, right?

608
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:17,540
Hey, man.

609
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,740
Do you know what time it is now?

610
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:19,580
My wedding is ending soon

611
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,540
if you still haven't arrived.

612
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,700
Well, I was making rounds outside.

613
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,340
(Isn't that the tie I gave him?)

614
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:28,740
Do your best.

615
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:29,820
I'll go and get ready now.

616
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,500
Go ahead.

617
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:30,820
Sit over there.

618
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,540
Give it to me.

619
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,260
Come on, take a seat.

620
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,220
Sit.

621
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,780
You're so well-dressed today.

622
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,500
Duan, say something nice.

623
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,420
It's New Year now.

624
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,460
I'll give you a red envelope.

625
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,660
It's hard to come up
with something nice about you.

626
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,660
Maybe

627
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,740
I'll call you "darling brother".
How does it sound?

628
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,500
Call me "bro", please.

629
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,260
Bro, please.

630
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,100
I'm fine with "bro".

631
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:56,900
Darling brother.

632
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,260
Ugh, that's gross.

633
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,900
Duan.

634
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:06,900
You've become more gross

635
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,860
years after graduation.

636
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,420
Indeed.

637
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,620
Darling brother, you see.
They badmouth me.

638
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,420
The red envelope is in my hand now.

639
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,540
Starting today,

640
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,620
Sang Yan

641
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:19,900
is my darling brother.

642
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,940
Are you insane?

643
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,980
Sang Yan, stop resisting.

644
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,540
I think that's okay.

645
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,220
Sure, okay.

646
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,580
It makes me cringe.

647
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,460
I got goosebumps all over.

648
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:29,860
Brother.

649
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:31,820
Stop calling me that.

650
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:32,860
Hearing that

651
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,740
makes me sick.

652
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:35,940
Then...

653
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,740
Did something

654
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,260
happen to him?

655
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,380
He looks

656
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,260
weird today.

657
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:45,820
Come on.

658
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,860
I'll tell you what happened to him.

659
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:49,820
Here.

660
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,260
Yihe City Psychiatric Hospital.

661
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,500
You can register at the hospital

662
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,580
right after you go back.

663
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,060
Darling brother, you're so considerate.

664
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,420
You've even found a hospital for me.

665
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,460
Man,

666
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,180
stop calling me that.

667
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:03,660
Okay?

668
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,820
Why is that, my darling brother?

669
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:05,820
Scoot over.

670
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,580
Scoot over, Zhi.

671
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,380
Let's switch seats.

672
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:08,500
Gosh.

673
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,060
I'm about to puke even before I drink.

674
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,980
Sit over there.

675
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:11,500
Okay?

676
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:11,780
Please.

677
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,700
I beg of you.

678
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,740
What's wrong with you?

679
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,660
Scoot over.

680
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,300
Long time no see.

681
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,380
It's been a while since you two last met.

682
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,580
We just met last week.

683
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,500
Coming next,

684
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,460
let's welcome our groom,

685
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,740
who grows plump with the nourishment of love

686
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,740
and still looks gorgeous,

687
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,900
Qian Fei

688
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,780
and his beloved bride,

689
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,620
Shiwen.

690
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:40,340
Let's welcome them to the stage!

691
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,300
I wonder if the staircases

692
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,300
can bear the weight of their love.

693
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,500
Let's give them a round of applause!

694
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:54,860
Come on, Fei.

695
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,820
Look at the sturdy staircase,

696
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,860
it's like the path of their future.

697
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,580
With each and every step they take,

698
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,340
they walk their way out

699
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,180
for their happiness and stability.

700
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,260
And this moment

701
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,780
deserves cheering and applause

702
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:09,940
from all of you!

703
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,500
Qian Fei.

704
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,860
You have become so chubby because of love.

705
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,060
I know

706
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,540
you must have much gratitude deep within.

707
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,180
Why not

708
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,180
take the mic

709
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,020
and say something to everyone?

710
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:23,620
I...

711
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,540
First of all, I'm grateful to you

712
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,540
for coming to my wedding.

713
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,140
I've never thought

714
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,620
that I would get married so early.

715
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,060
I... I...

716
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,140
I'm sure my buddies

717
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,980
didn't expect

718
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,140
that I would get married so early.

719
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,780
I want to thank my wife.

720
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,660
The figure isn't a problem,

721
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,740
and height isn't a problem too.

722
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,460
Even someone like me

723
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,100
can marry

724
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,340
such a beautiful wife.

725
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,140
I...

726
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,380
Buddies,

727
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,980
I have a wife!

728
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:49,860
Well done.

729
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,620
Help me to take a photo.

730
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,260
Help me to take a photo.

731
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,580
All guests,

732
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,660
let's raise

733
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,620
our glasses!

734
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,620
What are you doing?

735
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:01,980
Raise your glass.

736
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,060
Oh, right.

737
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:03,820
Raise the glass.

738
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,500
Buddies!

739
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,500
Eat and drink to your heart's content.

740
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,580
Cheers!

741
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:08,580
All right.

742
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,260
Cheers.

743
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,180
Let's count down from three

744
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,660
and wish them a happy marriage.

745
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,340
Three,

746
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:12,980
two,

747
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:13,580
one.

748
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,500
Happy marriage!

749
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,260
Cheers!

750
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:20,900
All right.

751
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,580
As we watch the lovely newlyweds

752
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,140
leave

753
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:23,740
the wedding stage,

754
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,580
so, it marks

755
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,180
the commerce

756
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,380
of Qian Fei and Shiwen's

757
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,100
wedding banquet!

758
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,100
I wish all of you

759
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,060
to enjoy the food and become as chubby as Qian Fei!

760
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:34,740
I want this.

761
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,620
It's not far from you, though.

762
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,100
Fine.

763
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,340
You can have

764
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,180
all the corns.

765
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,720
[Why didn't you say hi?]

766
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:44,900
Are you happy now?

767
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,060
(Why didn't you say hi?)

768
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,500

774
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,860
Like you don't know this.

775
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,780
It's my pet name.

776
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,420
Why I've never heard that

777
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,340
from your brother before?

778
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,740
He calls me that too,

779
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,340

780

your Brother No. 2?

794
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,220
Because you're older than Yan.

795
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:09,580
So,

796
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,300
he's No.1 and you're No.2.

797
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:17,980
Fine.

Why do you care?

801

Share it with me.

802

Is he in the same year

803
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,740
and same college as you?

804
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,380
No.

805
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,620
Who else do you know?

806
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,740
I know people outside of the school too.

807
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,100
How did you meet him?

808
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,300
We met while we hung out.

809
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,060
Where?

810
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,420

811
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:00,820
That's not right.

812
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,380
You told me

813
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,100
that you met him at a karaoke

814
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,780
when you got drunk last time.

815
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,180
(Did... Did I say that?)

816
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,340
(What did I say?)

817
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,460
Yes.

818
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,780
We met at a karaoke.

819
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,300
I have met with many friends.

820
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,020
So,

821
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,260
I get confused.

822
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,500

823
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,100
Nothing.

824
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,940
I just think

825
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,940
that Qian Fei is quite smart.

826
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,260
What does Qian Fei

00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,260
How did you take an interest in him?

829

(Give me a break, please.)

830
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,340
Why should I tell you?

831
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:03,700
Look at him.

832
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,540
Let's switch places.

833
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,940
No, I don't want to.

00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,380
Is this how you respond

847
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,460
