00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,420
to come

197
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,780
with money tomorrow.

198
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,900
Jiaxu.

199
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,220
I'll be fine.

200
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,380
Don't worry.

201
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,380
Why would you go to a hidden alley?

202
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,580
A classmate brought me there.

203
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:33,940
Who?

204
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,980
She is being extorted too.

205
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,860
She was scared

206
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,660
so she brought me with her.

207
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,660
Your friend was extorted.

208
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,700
Instead of telling the teacher

209
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,540
or her parents,

210
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:45,940
she brought you with her?

211
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,420
She was worried that those bullies

212
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,380
would take revenge

213
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,460
on her.

214
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,380
You don't need

215
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,220
a classmate

216
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,060
like that.

217
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:04,740
Also,

218
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,380

388
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,820
Did you hear

389
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,140
the girl from just now?

390
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,980
She's so meek.

391
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,460
Who are you?

392
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,340
Wait...

393
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,060
What are you doing?

394
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,260
Smoking at such a young age?

395
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,580
Hey!

396
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,300
I heard

397
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,980
you extorted money

398
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,940
from my friend?

399

401

It doesn't matter?

402
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,060
I know you, that's all.

403
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,260
You extorted 50 yuan from my sister

404
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,340
and even slapped her.

405
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,700
No, I didn't.

406
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,060
I took 50 yuan from her.

407
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,220
I didn't do anything else.

408
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,260
Don't make things up now.

409
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:11,660
I...

410
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,100
I took 50 yuan.

411
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,940
If you want, I can give it back.

412
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,460
Even if you take two yuan

413
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,380
from my sister,

414
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,300
I will come to you

415
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,500

418
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,460
How old are you?

419
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:35,820
Why hustle in the street

420
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,620
when you can study instead?

421
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:37,820
Answer.

422
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,060
Hey.

423
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,420
You have the money. Leave now.

424
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:39,900

425
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,900
your own business.

426
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,740
We got the money.

427
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,780
But one more thing.

428
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,500
Who

429
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,340
is the gang leader?

430
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,660
You?

431
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,740
Are you scared now?

432
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,260
Listen now, young girl.

433
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,660
Violence cannot solve anything.

434
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,020

You hear me?

438
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,500
Focus on your study and don't

439
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,740
do this again.

440
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:26,780
Let's go.

How did you settle this?

442
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,460
You gave her a good scare?

443
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,020
Tell me.

444
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:07,460
I'm curious.

445
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,660
You know

446
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,620
what I said?

447
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,540
I told them that I killed 10 people every month

448
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,260
and I had hit my quota this month.

449
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,900
And so, I would return next month to kill them.

450
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:15,380
Come on.

451
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,660

No, you.

459
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,300
Really?

460
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,740
Give me a lollipop.

00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,100
I'll show you what

00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:33,860
Please.

Have mine.

00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,940
Don't bully my sister.

Here.

467
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,500
You can have it.

Take it.

No.

471

I don't want it.

I was joking!

476
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,340
Keep it.

477

488
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:39,900
Give it back.

489

00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,820
of peace and love.

583
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,980
That everyone would care for each other.

584
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,140
Look, Zhi.

585
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,660
What your mom and I

586
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,900
are talking about

587
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,860
is what kind of career

588
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,740
do you want for yourself?

589
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:40,820
I want to draw.

590
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,220
Can I draw for a living?

591
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,260
That's all you want to do?

592
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:47,980
Either way,

593
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,900
physics will not play a part

594
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,700
in my life.

595
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,340
I think.

596
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:57,940
Zhi,

597
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,900
before you figure out

598
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,860
what you want to do

599
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,980
with your life,

600
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,260
you should get some help

601
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,340
for physics.

602
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,740
I talked to your classroom teacher and we agreed

603
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,220
that you have your strengths and weaknesses.

604
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,420
Therefore, during the winter break,

605
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,420
we will hire a tutor

606
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,980
for your physics.

607
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,420
No use seeking help.

608
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,820
Ask yourself honestly.

609
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,420
Do you need help with physics or not?

610
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,540
You are the tutor Dad

611
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,340
hired?

612
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,300
Yes.

613
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,260
Listen there now.

614
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,420
I scored

615
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,900
above 270 for my physics in high school.

616
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,900
So don't underestimate me.

617
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,020
Snobbish, aren't you?

618
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:40,980
I have the right to.

619
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:45,500
Come on.

620
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,300
You scored 66 and you

621
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,540
are criticizing me already?

622
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,420
Score 666 and we can talk.

623
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,500
I don't want you to be my tutor.

624
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,540
Bye.

625
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,220
Stay.

626
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:57,820
Pay attention now.

627
00:36:59,220 --> 00:36:59,820
Let me see.

628
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:02,980
Okay.

629
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,060
Kepler's laws

630
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,580
of planetary motion.

631
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,300
Listen to me.

632
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,660
Do you know the three laws?

633
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:10,700
No?

634
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,300
Okay.

635
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,060
This is

636
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,740
the formula of gravity.

637
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:15,500
What is F?

638
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,380
F is Force of Gravity.

639
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,260
G is gravitational constant.

640
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,580
M is mass.

641
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,300
You have a capital M and a small m.

642
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,740
Both are masses.

643
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:25,900
What is R?

644
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,140
R is the distance.

645
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:27,660
Next question.

646
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,580
Wait. What is this R?

647
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,180
R

648
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,100
is the distance.

649
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:31,420
Next question.

650
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:31,900
Wait.

651
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,020
Don't move on just yet.

652
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,980
F is...

653
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,540
This is the third time now.

654
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,100
F is Force of Gravity!

655
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:37,500
Wait.

656
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,620
What is the difference between F and G then?

657
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,100
Both Ms are Masses.

658
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:41,780
What is R squared?

659
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,940
Distance!

660
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,860
You didn't explain anything.

661
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:45,660
You...

662
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,300
You're too dumb.

663
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,340
It's not my fault.

664
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,580
Yan, you'll pay for this!

665
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,420
You're done for.

666
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,900
Die!

667
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,380
Die, Yan!

668
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,220
Mom!

669
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:57,900
Scared now?

670
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,340
Go back and study!

671
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,140
She's too dumb.

672
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,180
He's impatient.

673
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,060
Find someone else.

674
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,020
All right. We'll find another tutor.

675
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,780
I don't want you to bicker all day long

676
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,420
and ruin Mom's mood.

677
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,620
I didn't say that.

678
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,580
It's mainly because your dad

679
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:30,900
doesn't want to put up with this.

680
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,060
Also,

681
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,980
can she be tutored

682
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,740
in her room

683
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,660
instead of my room?

684
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,220
No.

685
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,260
Why not?

686
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,620
I'm not the one being tutored.

687
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,660
I don't want a stranger

688
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,780
to come inside

689
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,500
my room.

690
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,500
I don't want

691
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,380
a stranger

692
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,660
to come inside my room either.

693
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,660
Enough.

694
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,860
Stop arguing.

695
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,060
Yan, do you think

696
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:50,700
I would let

697
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,060
a stranger

698
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,100
go inside

699
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,380
your sister's

700
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:54,980
room?

701
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,700
That's right.

702
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,620
I'll be worried.

703
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:57,380
Indeed.

704
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,660
I'm so scared.

705
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:03,540
I see it now.

706
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,180
I'm just a CCTV.

707
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,420
This is it.

708
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,780
Then be the CCTV.

709
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,660
Zhi.

710
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,180
I thought you were asleep.

711
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:27,500
Mom.

712
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,540
I drew Yan.

713
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,340
[My name is Sang Yan Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha]

714
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,140
You gave him a pair of glasses.

715
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,380
Smell it.

716
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:36,620
Do you like it?

717
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,980
I already found you

718
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,180
a tutor.

719
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,780
At 10 AM tomorrow,

720
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,300
he'll come here to tutor you.

721
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,500
Sleep now

722
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,700
and wake up early.

723
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,900
Have some oatmeal.

724
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:51,820
Goodnight.

725
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,060
Sleep now.

726
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,420
(She found another tutor.)

727
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,700
(So soon.)

728
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,620
(I don't want a tutor.)

729
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,060
(I don't want.)

730
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,740
(Silly, dumb dog.)

731
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,700
(Maybe)

732
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,940
(I should sneak out tomorrow morning?)

733
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:31,780
(That way,)

734
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,580
(the tutor will know I am a belligerent student)

735
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,140
(and will quit on the spot.)

736
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:21,300
Jiaxu.

737
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,980
This is the 3D model document.

738
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:23,500
Crosscheck it

739
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,620
and return to it before you finish work.

740
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,300
Okay.

741
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,300
Xun.

742
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,340
Duan.

743
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,780
Your optimization is perfect.

744
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:38,660
Thank you.

745
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,260
Well done.

746
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,420
It's my job.

747
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:42,780
Oh.

748
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,860
I remember from your resume that you're from Yihe?

749
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,340
Yes.

750
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,660
I'm also from Yihe.

751
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,060
For real?

752
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:50,900
Which high school did you attend?

753
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,780
No. 2 High School.

754
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,260
I'm from No. 3 High School.

755
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,380
I knew it.

756
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,420
I would have heard

757
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,940
of a handsome junior

758
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,140
otherwise.

759
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,780
You're graduating soon.

760
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:02,780
Are you

761
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,100
returning to Yihe?

762
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,860
I'm still undecided.

763
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,260
Still undecided?

764
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:10,660
Yes.

765
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,380
Listen.

766
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,180
This decision will determine your career.

767
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,500
Pick

768
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,620
a city you like.

769
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,500
I see.

770
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:18,820
After Chinese New Year,

771
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,540
the company will assign me
to the headquarters in Yihe

772
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,780
for Tales of Adventures.

773
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,140
Join me if you're interested.

774
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,380
We can work together.

775
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,100
