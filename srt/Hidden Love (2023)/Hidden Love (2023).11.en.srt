00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,870
I guess

21
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,630
I'll take this one with me.

22
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,800
Okay.

23
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,240
Perfect. One for each of us.

24
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,120
Why don't we get something to eat?

00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,950
It's late.

26
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,120
We should go back.

00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,070

00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,240

Sang Zhi,

31
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,430
do you want to get dinner together

32
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,510
at the cafeteria?

33
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,240
I'll just order takeaway.

34
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,190
You're back.

35
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,270
The three of us were just talking

36
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,350
about spending New Year's Eve

37
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,800
at the Central Plaza.

38
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,630
It's recommended by influencers.

39
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,190
I bet

40
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,270
we can get lots of nice pictures.

41
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,240
Central Plaza?

42
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,550
Yes.

43
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,510
A lot of people will be there.

44
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,360
Right?

45
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,430
That's what I told her.

46
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,160
She wouldn't listen.

47
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,270
Then…

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,160
Why don't you join us, Jiang Ming?

49
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,240
It's New Year's Eve.

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,310
The more, the merrier,

51
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:15,950
right?

52
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,310
Sure.

53
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,630
I have to go back to my dorm.

54
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,390
You guys carry on.

55
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,270
Bye.

56
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,680
You guys played the claw machine?

57
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,600
Did he win this for you?

58
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,560
I got this myself.

59
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,480
Well,

60
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,680
what do you think about Jiang Ming?

61
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,430
I think he's a good guy.

62
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,680
He's handsome and nice.

63
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,670

64
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,240

66
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,950
(I'll ask you one last time.)

67
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,920
Are you sure you won't spend New Year's Eve

68
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,920
with us?

69
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,430
I am sure.

70
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,510
It's cold outside.

71
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,040
But if you…

72
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,360
No more buts.

73
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,190
Sang said no.

74
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,920
Besides,

75
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,120
the place will be crowded.

76
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,600

77
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,430
or heads?

78
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,040

79

82
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,190

00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,310
This won't do.

92
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,630
are the second prettiest.

93
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,830
Okay. Great. Let's go.

94
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,270
I think it's too short.

95
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,160
I'll go change.

96
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,240
It's not too short. It's fine.

97
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,510
It's perfect for this occasion.

98

Let's go.

99
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,720
Let… Let me get my coat.

100
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,360
Okay.

Let's go.

104
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,240

106
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,920
I'll order takeaway.

107
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,630
We'll bring home tasty treats too.

108
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,830

122
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,310
I don't want her to get mad at me again.

123
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,680
Why? Just tell her.

124
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,750
Last time,

125
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,510
I ordered hot pot
and she talked my ear off for three days.

126
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,000
It's fine.

127
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,040

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,190
What do you think?

134
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,190
Doesn't she look pretty

135
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,390

136
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,040
Yes.

137
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,190
Be more confident. Stand straight.

138
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,800

139

150
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,270

165
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,320
Nothing.

166
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,550
There's a company dinner tonight.

167
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,600
I can bring my family.

168
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,080
I want you to come with me.

169
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,150
I'm not your family.

170
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,870
I'll pass.

171
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,790
I'm about to eat the takeaway I ordered.

172
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,480
Takeaway on New Year's Eve?

173
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,910
If you don't like crowds,

174
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,630
we can get dinner together, just you and me.

175
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,200
I don't feel like going out.

176
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,320
You owe me a meal.

177
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,550
You're not trying to get out of it, are you?

178
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,200
I'll make a reservation right now.

179
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,200
You get ready

180
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,120
to come out.

181
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,310
I…

182
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,320
I'm almost at your university.

183
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,510
I'll get changed.

184
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,510
Okay.

185
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,480
I'll call you when I get there.

186
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,760
[Chapter 11: Moved. If this is love.]

187
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,120
Try this.

188
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,360
Why didn't you go out

189
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,670
with your dormmates?

190
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,150
Do you guys not get along?

191
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,440
No.

192
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,720
We get along just fine.

193
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:45,910
But they're going

194
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,150
to the Central Plaza today

195
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,870
for the New Year's Eve Countdown.

196
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,000
It's too crowded for me

197
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,240
and Yihe is too cold.

198
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,360
I didn't want to go out.

199
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,630
But you said yes the minute I asked.

200
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,320
That's because…

201
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,320
It's because

202
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,390
I owe you a meal.

203
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,440
If I didn't come,

204
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,150
you would think I'm trying to get out

205
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,390
of treating you to a meal.

206
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,960
I was just kidding.

207
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,030
By the way,

208
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,440
I didn't mean

209
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,670
to tease you

210
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,790
at the hospital.

211
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,750
So

212
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,440
I wanted to formally apologize

213
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,030
to you today.

214
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,720
You don't have to do that.

215
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,360
It's not a big deal.

216
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,480
Besides, that was a long time ago.

217
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,720
All right.

218
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,000
Eat more.

219
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,910
It's my treat.

220
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,120
Consider it my apology.

221
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,720
Didn't we agree that it was my treat?

222
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,960
I owe you a meal, anyway.

223
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,840
What do you mean?

224
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,910
Are you saying

225
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,320
that we don't have to meet again

226
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,790
after this meal?

227
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,270
You have no sympathy

228
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,630
for this lonely old man.

229
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,720
You won't even have a meal with your brother.

230
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,870
Jiaxu,

231
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,720
start digging in.

232
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,480
You're really talkative today.

233
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,150
It's not like I get to have a meal with you every day.

234
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,390
So what if I want us to talk more?

235
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,440
Let's talk about you.

236
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,630
How are your studies?

237
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,080
Are you interested in them?

238
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,670
The lecturer says

239
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,270
that we won't have

240
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,600
too many compulsory modules in the first year.

241
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,350
But there'll be a lot

242
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,270
in the second year.

243
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,480
Let's sit here.

244
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:01,960
Okay.

245
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,390
Here.

246
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,600
That's what my lecturer said.

247
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,360
Why won't you answer my calls?

248
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,600
I told you

249
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,840
there's no need

250
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,120
for us to stay in touch anymore.

251
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:32,960
Ying!

252
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,510
Who are you?

253
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,670
What's wrong with you?

254
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,870
What's wrong with you?

255
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,390
It's none of your business.

256
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,790
Do you know why I did that to him?

257
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,630
I don't care about the reasons behind it.

258
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,480
Why did you do it?

259
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,440
Listen here.

260
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,790
If you assaulted him,

261
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,360
I would return the favor.

262
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,510
Ying!

263
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,240
Ying!

264
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,960
What are you trying to do, Jiang Ying?

265
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,910
Who is she?

266
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,030
Duan Jiaxu!

267
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,480
Ying, don't do this! Let's go.

268
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,310
Sorry, miss.

269
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:04,950
Please leave.

270
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,240
You think you don't owe me anymore?

271
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,480
You owe me for the rest of your life!

272
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,550
I tell you!

273
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,150
Please leave.

274
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:10,870
Go.

275
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,750
You think you don't owe me anymore?

276
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,430
Duan Jiaxu!

277
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:13,960
Get out!

278
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,630
I will never let you go!

279
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,870
Let me go!

280
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,480
Are you okay?

281
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,480
Let's leave, Jiaxu.

282
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,750
It's cold. Put your coat on.

283
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,750
So, Jiaxu,

284
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,030
who is that woman?

285
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,270
Someone unimportant.

286
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,150
To be precise,

287
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,960
I guess she's my father's former creditor.

288
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,240
Wait.

289
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,790
I'm going in.

290
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,840
I ran into her once.

291
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,390
You did?

292
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,630
It was the time

293
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,030
I went to your place to get your things
when you were sick.

294
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,200
We brushed past each other.

295
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,510
She didn't do anything to you, did she?

296
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,480
So I guess

297
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,790
she was there

298
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,440
to see you.

299
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,870
So… Does this happen every time

300
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,750
she sees you?

301
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,240
No.

302
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,510
Jiaxu,

303
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,670
as you said,

304
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,030
she's your father's former creditor.

305
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,670
So it has nothing to do with you.

306
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,790
You shouldn't let her bully you.

307
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,750
I don't…

308
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,390
There's no way she can bully me.

309
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,400
What's the matter?

310
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:15,920
I'm fine.

311
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,640
I don't need this…

312
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,750
Does it hurt?

313
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,960
No.

314
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,920
I forgot to say this.

315
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,200
Thanks, Sang Zhi.

316
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,270
(I wish that all bad things)

317
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,640
(will stay away from Jiaxu.)

318
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,000
(I wish that someone can be with him.)

319
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,680
(I wish that person is me.)

320
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,920
Are you not going to make a wish?

321
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,750
It's the first snow of the year.

322
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,480
Yihe doesn't get snow often.

323
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,480
The last time it snowed

324
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,920
was when I was in my first year of high school.

325
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,640
I guess

326
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,400
I'm quite lucky.

327
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,640
I'm lucky too.

328
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,960

329
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,750

Goodness. I wish

I never have to listen

363

If you're jealous,

365

you should get a boyfriend too.

00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,240

367
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,240
Wang.

I…

You don't?

372
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,310
This is the first snow we've seen

373
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,110
in Yihe in years.

374
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,440
But you don't have anything to wish for.

375
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,480
You watch romance dramas, right?

376
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,720

377
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,070

on the first snow will come true.

378
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:16,830
Really?

379
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,750

00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,440
(ignoring me when I'm so excited?)

570
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,450
(No.)

571
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:16,820
[Duan Jiaxu]

572
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:19,880
Well?

573
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:20,880
Are you still up?

574
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,030
What?

575
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:22,840
Did you miss me?

576
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,550
I'm hanging up.

577
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,590
Don't.

578
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:26,920
If you're still awake,

579
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,960
talk to me.

580
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:28,750
Did you know?

581
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,510
I proposed today.

582
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,400
Did you know how I proposed?

583
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,320
I took her home

584
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,590
and I told her I was thirsty.

585
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,630
I told her to get me a bottle of water

586
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,670
from the trunk.

587
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,630
So she did.

588
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,070
The minute she opened it,

589
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,070
she saw that it was filled with roses.

590
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,150
I went up to her

591
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:40,710
and said,

592
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:41,750
"Will you be

593
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,630
my wife?"

594
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,440
Guess what she said.

595
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,430
She said,

596
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,030
"Doesn't that make me your Qianqi?"
(*Qianqi is a homophone of "ex-wife")

597
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,510
Isn't she cute?

598
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,670
Nice.

599
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,150
But I'm sad

600
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,630
to hear that.

601
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,390
You always said

602
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,550
you were going to stay single with me.

603
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,630
I just said that

604
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,360
to make you feel better.

605
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,550
I can't believe you took it seriously.

606
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,030
All right.

607
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,030
Congratulations, bro.

608
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,510
We've been talking about me all this time.

609
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,190
What about you?

610
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,550
Didn't you say

611
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,390
you were going

612
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,320
on a blind date?

613
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,030
Did you?

614
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,630
What blind date?

615
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,630
That's impossible.

616
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,840
What about someone that caught your interest?

617
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,230
You must have feelings for someone.

618
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:35,760
Jiaxu,

619
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,920
I think I caught a trace of something

620
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,000
from your seconds

621
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,320
of silence.

622
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,320
What's going on?

623
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,880
Who is it?

624
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,000
What…

625
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,590
Tell me.

626
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,880
Have you calmed down yet?

627
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,030
Hurry up and go to sleep.

628
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,440
You're about to get married.

629
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,270
-Don't.
-I'm hanging up.

630
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,000
Tell me who it is…

631
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,110
What am I thinking?

632
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,670
[No eggs, no milk]

633
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,800
Kiddo.

634
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,280
Wei.

635
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,590
What did you buy?

636
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,360
That's a huge box.

637
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,880
Two pairs of shoes.

638
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,960
They were on sale.

639
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:30,760
I couldn't help

640
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,440
but buy two pairs.

641
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,400
(Jiaxu.)

642
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,070
What did you buy?

643
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,440
(I have something for you.)

644
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,590
Stationery.

645
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,620
(I'll go to your company.)

646
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,270
You have nothing but study on your mind.

647
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,630
What stationery is there to buy?

648
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,280
-What did you buy, Sang?
-Wei.

649
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,280
I bought…

650
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,630
Qiang.

651
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,190
Can you carry it?

652
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:46,590
I'll carry it for you.

653
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,320
I can do it.

654
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,440
You have a class later.

655
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,070
I'll manage.

656
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:49,670
It's fine.

657
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:50,760
Let's grab something to eat

658
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,510
after I finish class.

659
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,230
Sure.

660
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,230
Sang Zhi,

661
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,480
you weren't there on New Year's Eve.

662
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,400
Are you free this weekend?

663
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,840
Let's decompress.

664
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,110
But exams are around the corner.

665
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,000
Maybe after we finish our exams.

666
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,320
Exams?

667
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,000
Oh, right.

668
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,000
I have a friend

669
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:10,960
who just opened up a bar.

670
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,230
Why don't we

671
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,630
all go there to celebrate

672
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,510
after we finish the exams?

673
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,230
Let's talk about that

674
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,150
after we finish the exams.

675
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,400
What should we eat for dinner?

676
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:19,670
Oh, yes.

677
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,670
They said

678
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,670
a new place had opened up.

679
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,630
Let's try that place.

680
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,360
They said it was good.

681
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,230
Tonight?

682
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,550
You guys try it for me.

683
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,000
I'll pass.

684
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,070
Where are you going?

685
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,320
I'm going to deliver
an electronic peephole camera

686
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,710
to my relative.

687
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,480
All right.

688
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,800
I'll be leaving now.

689
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:37,920
Bye.

690
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,630
Bye.

691
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,630
Be careful. Come back early.

692
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,710
Stay safe.

693
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,510
NPC feedback.

694
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,230
If we program it this way,

695
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,150
every time the player runs into the character,

696
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,670
it will trigger

697
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:50,800
the detection of the event.

698
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,150
If so,

699
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,630
phones with less-quality specs

700
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,670
won't be able to process it.

701
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,550
It will lag.

702
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,760
Can I write it with C instead?

703
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,400
Stop it with the C.

704
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,110
JAVA is the best.

705
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:04,670
It's fine.

706
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,150
It's not a big deal.

707
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,800
We've had a long day.

708
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,710
Let's end this meeting here.

709
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,360
-Good work, Duan.
-Good work.

710
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,000
Let's go.

711
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,550
It's tough.

712
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,280
Clean up after yourself.

713
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,830
[Sang Zhi]

714
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,590
(Where are you?)

715
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,070
What should we do?

716
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,030
Go downstairs and stop her.

717
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:46,760
Okay.

718
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:47,550
Duan.

719
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,360
Come here.

720
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:52,630
What's the matter?

721
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,880
Jiang Ying is making a scene downstairs again.

722
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,710
I asked security to stop her.

723
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,760
It should be fine.

724
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,790
You cannot enter.

725
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,480
Wait.

726
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,440
Wait at the entrance.

727
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,190
Listen to me!

728
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,230
I'm looking for Duan Jiaxu!

729
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,000
He works here.

730
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:31,510
I know.

731
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,190
I know what you're saying,

732
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:32,550
miss.

733
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,480
But you cannot go inside right now.

734
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,400
I'm his friend.

735
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,000
I'll help you.

736
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,150
We'll report this right now.

737
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,230
If permission is granted…

738
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,550
I just need to tell him something.

739
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,230
Please wait here.

740
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,030
Calm down.

741
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,030
My colleague has…

742
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,230
Wait. You can't go inside.

743
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,430
It's important.

744
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,030
You cannot go inside.

745
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:44,550
I know.

746
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,320
I know what you mean.

747
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,110
Please!

748
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:46,920
Miss, you cannot go inside without permission.

749
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:47,710
Wait…

750
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,800
You cannot go inside without permission.

751
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,030
We're working.

752
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:50,800
You cannot just go inside.

753
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,390
Please.

754
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,110
Jiaxu.

755
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:52,880
You cannot go inside.

756
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,630
I'm his friend.

757
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,230
My superior said

758
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,110
that we cannot let you in.

759
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,070
Come with me.

760
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:57,590
He must be upstairs.

761
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,510
Mr. Duan is not in the building anymore.

762
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,550
Don't push me.

763
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,480
Why didn't you answer your phone?

764
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,030
Sorry.

765
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,280
My phone ran out of battery.

766
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,360
I forgot to charge it last night.

767
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,360
Why didn't you tell me

768
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,320
you were here?

769
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,440
I did.

770
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:16,760
I sent you a message.

771
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,710
Did you not see it?

772
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,360
I was busy. I missed it.

773
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:20,920
It's okay.

774
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,440
Sang Zhi,

775
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,710
don't come straight to my company

776
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,670
or my place anymore.

777
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,360
Even if you do, let me know beforehand.

778
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:27,920
Okay?

779
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,280
Have you eaten?

780
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,320
I wanted to give you this.

781
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,480
Electronic peephole camera.

782
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,310
That woman

783
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,630
keeps harassing you.

784
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,880
You can install this on your door.

785
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,150
You can connect it to your phone.

786
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,550
There's a smart camera.

787
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,320
You can use it to call the police too.

788
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,440
So

789
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,840
it'll come in handy.

790
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,070
That's all.

791
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,230
Thanks.

792
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,480
Go back to work.

793
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,670
I'm going back to class.

794
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,840
(That woman)

795
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,310
(keeps harassing you.)

796
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,960
(You can install this on your door.)

797
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,360
(So)

798
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:02,840
