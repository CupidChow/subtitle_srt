17
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,490
I give up.

18
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,090
Wait.

19
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,790
Let me take first dibs.

20
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:57,920
The three of us

21
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,690
were competing for the ranking together.

22
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,120
Then

23
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,020
I suddenly got a call.

24
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,290
The one where you scolded me.

25
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,790
The day we almost won the game?

26
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,720
Yes. That day.

27
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,690
I told you before, didn't I?

28
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,690
Her again?

Valentine's Day

30
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,590
was around the corner.

31
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:11,520
So I bought her roses.

32
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,490
That's so tacky.

33
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,760
Is buying roses tacky?

34
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,090
Yes, it's so tacky.

35
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,990
Bro, you have no game.

36
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,090
Alright.

37
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,420
Eat.

38
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,920
It doesn't matter how many flowers you give.

39
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,720
I'm telling you.

40
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,490
What flowers did you give?

41
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,590
You don't know about the flowers either?

42
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,520
And it's extremely tacky.

43
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,920
He gave red roses.

44
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,720
Do you know?

45
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,360
You still don't remember.

46
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,090
Can you

47
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,990
care about me?

48
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,190
I'm telling you.

49
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:35,590
Didn't she

50
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:36,560
post on Weibo,

51
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,390
saying if only

52
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,260
she'll get red roses

53
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,060
on Valentine's Day.

54
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,520
I liked the post.

55
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,390
After that,

56
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,090
I immediately went downstairs

57
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,160
to get her red roses.

58
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,120
I ate too much.

59
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,490
To be honest,

60
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,260
we shouldn't have ordered so much food.

61
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:52,920
We ordered a table of food

62
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:53,790
before you came.

63
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,290
Did he do all that

64
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,320
because he didn't want me to be embarrassed?

65
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,690
One wanted your number.

66
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,260
One wanted your number.

67
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,990
No one wanted mine.

68
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,190
Wouldn't I have become your backup?

69
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,660
Why don't you just change your name to Sang Yan?

70
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,060
Wouldn't you be yourself then?

71
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,920
Or you can change it to Duan Jiaxu.

72
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,090
Okay. I'll get the car.

73
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,590

00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,090

00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,160
Zhi.

00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,360
Don't you want to play the claw machine?

81
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:23,920

82
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:24,820

00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,160
Besides, my home isn't that far away

153

Jiaxu.

155
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,190
You must be very busy right now.

156
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,120
I've kept you

157
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:00,920
long enough.

158
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,190
So

159
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,860
I'll get out of your hair.

160
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,760
I've never seen you care so much about me before.

161
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,490
I'm sending you home no matter how busy I am.

162
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,520
Walk faster.

163
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,620
Jiaxu, it's getting dark.

164
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,160
Are... Are you not going back to school yet?

165
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,020
Don't worry, Kiddo.

166
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,060
I will

167
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,390
keep today's incident a secret.

168
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,520
Really?

169
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,420
Pinky promise?

170
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,060
You must also promise me

171
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,020
you'll pay attention in class

172
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,490
and break the school rules from now on.

173
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,260
Okay?

174
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,190
Okay.

175
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,520
I'm not joking.

176
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,220
If your teacher

177
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,520
wants to meet your parents again,

178
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,160
what happened today will be exposed.

179
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,620
I'll get into trouble.

180
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,590
You can come again next time.

181
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,390
Next time?

182
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,960
No.

183
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,420
I just think

184
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,820
you're very nice to me.

185
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,320
You treat me better than my brother.

186
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,360
So...

187
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:22,620
If

188
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,060
something like this happens again,

189
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,790
can I

190
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,320
ask you to pretend to be my brother?

191
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,560
Got it.

192
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,360
Go home.

193
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,790
Next time?

194
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,260
Here.

195
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,260
By the way,

196
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,720
The light bulb in your kitchen is broken.

197
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,360
After you get inside,

198
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,720
give this to your dad.

199
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,760
Okay.

200
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:58,720
Thank you, Jiaxu.

201
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,560
Don't mention it.

202
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,020
Hurry inside.

203
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,720
Goodbye, Jiaxu.

204
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,920
Be good.

205
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:08,620
Bye.

206
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,920
Difficult kiddo.

207
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,360
Let's go.

208
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:25,300
[Chapter 3 Considerate. Get a little closer]

209
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,190
Why did you lie to me again?

210
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,720
I don't wan to go.

211
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,660
I really don't.

212
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,560
We're already here.

213
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,720
Let's go together.

214
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,120
Besides, I already bought the gift.

215
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,090
Yeah.

216
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,360
I didn't buy any gift.

217
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:37,790
It doesn't matter.

218
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,620
We'll just say

219
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,160
we bought it together.

220
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,020
It's no big deal.

221
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:40,660
Come on.

222
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,090
Just say you bought it yourself.

223
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,990
I hardly know him anyway.

224
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,360
It's fine.

225
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,120
Let's go together.

226
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,260
We agreed

227
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,120
to meet here.

228
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,820
Welcome.

229
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,590
Sang Zhi.

230
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,720
Jiaxu.

231
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,260
Hanging out with your classmate?

232
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,090
Hello, Jiaxu.

233
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:07,760
Hello.

234
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,260
Do you work here?

235
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:13,720
Here.

236
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,390
See if there's anything you want.

237
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,660
Order here later.

238
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,920
Find a table first.

239
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,090
He's so handsome.

240
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,660
Who is he?

241
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,720
I don't remember

242
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,790
your brother looking like that.

243
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,720
He's my brother's friend.

244
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,360
Your brother's friend?

245
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,490
He's handsome.

246
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,790
And your brother's handsome too.

247
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,760
Sang Zhi, you're so lucky.

248
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,220
See if there's anything you want.

249
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,590
I want...

250
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,860
Red bean

251
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,860
or milk custard with mango.

252
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,160
I'll get the milk custard with red bean.

253
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,760
Saigon milk custard.

254
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,220
Can't I eat these?

255
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,420
I'll get the milk custard with red bean.

256
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,260
Milk custard with red bean then.

257
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,190
Have a look.

258
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,760
I want...

259
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,860
Pearl sago with coconut milk.

260
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,020
Is that all?

261
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,720
Yes.

262
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,660
I'll go order then.

263
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,020
Keep an eye on my phone.

264
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,760
Sure.

265
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,760
What do you like to order?

266
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,490
I want

267
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,260
one milk custard with red bean.

268
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,860
and one pearl sago with coconut milk.

269
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:32,860
Okay.

270
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,360
Which one is yours?

271
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,320
The pearl sago with coconut milk.

272
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,720
You're one yuan short.

273
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,720
No, I'm not.

274
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,620
You peeked at me so many times.

275
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,220
If I let you look at me for free,

276
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,090
I'll suffer a huge loss.

277
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,790
No wonder you have no customer.

278
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,390
It's because you're running a shady shop.

279
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,160
I became a shady shop

280
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,820
because I charged you an extra yuan?

281
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,660
I didn't peek at you.

282
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:13,490
Okay.

283
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,190
I'm the one talking nonsense.

284
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,990
Would I really charge you?

285
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,190
Keep it to buy yourself candy.

286
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,160
No.

287
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,390
Didn't you work here

288
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,920
to make money?

289
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,920
If I don't pay you,

290
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:25,860
how are you gonna make money?

291
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,760
Take back the money.

292
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,590
I won't lose a lot of money

293
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,590
just because I bought you a dessert.

294
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,260
Your classmate is waiting.

295
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,320
Sang Zhi.

296
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,420
Is your brother's friend

297
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,390
buying us desserts?

298
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,260
Yes.

299
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,120
That's great.

300
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,260
I don't have much money left

301
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,260
after buying the gift.

302
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,020
I just wanna ask

303
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,020
where are you now?

304
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,090
Where are you?

305
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,360
We've been waiting for you for a long time.

306
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,120
Fu Zhengchu, hurry over.

307
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:19,420
Alright.

308
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,390
Your milk custards.

309
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,790
Thank you.

310
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,660
Thank you, Jiaxu.

311
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,860
You're having it hot.

312
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:33,660
Try it.

313
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,020
It smells so good.

314
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,260
Do you wanna try mine?

315
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:43,820
Duan.

316
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,760
Gao.

317
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,520
I

318
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,790
got to run to the second store.

319
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,620
By the way,

320
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,560
How about I give you

321
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,560
half a month of your advance first?

322
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,020
Thank you, Gao.

323
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,520
Alright, get back to work first.

324
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,190
I'll take care of the place.

325
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:56,660
Okay.

326
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,220
Did he keep working

327
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,520
because he short of cash?

328
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,160
Fu Zhengchu!

329
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,220
Sang Zhi, sorry.

330
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:17,820
I'm late.

331
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,190
Hello.

332
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:21,660
Hello, Jiaxu.

333
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:23,620
Hello.

334
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:28,860
Sang Zhi.

335
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,720
Your brother works here?

336
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,560
But isn't your family rich?

337
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,620
Will you mind your own business?

338
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,590
It's late.

339
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,490
Let's go play.

340
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:46,860
Let's go.

341
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,620
We're not done.

342
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,390
Stop eating, Sang Zhi.

343
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,790
Let's go.

344
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,320
Everyone's waiting for us.

345
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,860
You can eat anything there.

346
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,820
Let's go.

347
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:58,990
Zhi, let's go.

348
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,320
Are you hanging out with your friends?

349
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,320
Be careful.

350
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,390
Go home before dark.

351
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,320
Leave her to us.

352
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,190
Enjoy.

353
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,020
Goodbye, Jiaxu.

354
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:15,760
Goodbye.

355
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,120
Bye.

356
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:18,560
Let's go.

357
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,420
Zhi.

358
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,190
Why does your brother's friend

359
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,620
sound like my dad?

360
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,390
My dad said the same thing

361
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,860
before I left home.

362
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,360
We haven't been out in a while.

363
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,420
Just the thought of it makes me happy.

364
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,720
Wait, Zhenru.

365
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,120
Give me a minute.

366
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,720
Zhi, where are you going?

367
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,960
They're already waiting for us.

368
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,160
Why did you come back?

369
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,860
Jiaxu, are you short of cash?

370
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,860
I heard from my brother that you're working.

371
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,790
Then I saw you working today.

372
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,490
I wanted to say

373
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,790
you don't have to buy me dessert

374
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,360
if you're short of cash.

375
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,690
I can afford to buy you

376
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,490
dessert.

377
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,990
Why are you overthinking?

378
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,080
♪A bright face under a calm disguising face♪

379
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,480
♪But I can't contain my joy♪

380
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,220
♪I have a weird intuition♪

381
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,880
♪My heart jingles when I think of you♪

00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,780

00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,480
♪I'm falling in love with you♪

384
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,220
This kid.

385
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,190
Happy birthday to you.

386
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,990
Happy birthday to you.

387
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,760
Happy birthday to you.

388
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,220
We wish you

389
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,160
health,

390
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:13,890
good luck.

391
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,760
great fortune,

392
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,120
and happiness with your family.

393
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,360
Enough.

394
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,160
-Come on.
-Here. Let's have cake.

395
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,720
-Come one.
-Make a wish!

396
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:22,690
Make a wish.

397
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:26,760
Here.

398
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:27,360
Make a wish.

399
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,490
I wish

400
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,190
Sang Zhi...

401
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,790
Wait.

402
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,390
Do you have something to say to me?

403
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,320
I have something to tell you.

404
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,260
Could I

405
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,620
go home first?

406
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,060
I already spent your birthday with you

407
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,760
and finished singing the birthday song.

408
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,060
I really wanna go home.

409
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,060
Goodbye.

410
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:57,820
You guys can continue.

411
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,990
Have fun by yourselves.

412
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,220
Sang Zhi!

413
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,360
Fu Zhengchu.

414
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:01,920
Chase after her.

415
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,190
Quick.

416
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,360
You guys can eat first.

417
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,060
I'll be back in a minute.

418
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,720
Okay, we'll cut the cake when you get back.

419
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,490
Fu Zhengchu!

420
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,190
Fu Zhengchu's celebrating his birthday,

421
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,420
but Sang Zhi left early.

422
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,960
He won't be happy.

423
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,320
Yin Zhenru.

424
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,960
Sang Zhi's really not a good friend.

425
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,060
Sang Zhi!

426
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,520
Why did you follow me outside?

427
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,420
Are you not gonna celebrate your birthday?

428
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,160
I

429
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,590
came out for some air.

430
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,960
You get your air.

431
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,160
I'm going home.

432
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,820
Let me see you off.

433
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,460
We know each other well.

434
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,020
You don't need to do that.

435
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:53,720
Sang Zhi.

436
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,820
I don't believe you can't tell.

437
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,960
Can't tell what?

438
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,220
I worked so hard

439
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,520
to get into the same high school as you.

440
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,790
Do you not know?

441
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,590
I know.

442
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,590
So I think you should

443
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,820
study hard.

444
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,960
Why do you keep telling me to study?

445
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,220
If...

446
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,990
If I

447
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,590
have a crush on you,

448
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,590
what do you think?

449
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,260
I can't think of anything.

450
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:19,820
No.

451
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,790
What I meant is

452
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,660
you should think about

453
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,190
how to study hard.

454
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,090
Don't make jokes like this.

455
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,290
I'm not joking with you.

456
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,220
Have you forgotten that you knocked out

457
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,790
one of my teeth when were were kids?

458
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,360
It has been years.

459
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,420
Didn't I break my hand too?

460
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,390
You're right.

461
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,190
Well.

462
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,820
Well, Sang Zhi.

463
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,820
No.

464
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,520
Let's not talk about it.

465
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,520
Sang Zhi.

466
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,990
It's my birthday today.

467
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,560
I chose today

468
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
to tell you these.

469
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,260
You're always doing this to me.

470
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,290
Can't you reject me some other time?

471
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,060
Why are you always doing this?

472
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,460
You start crying

473
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,260
before even saying much.

474
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:00,960
You've done this since little.

475
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
I'm not crying.

476
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:02,860
You cried.

477
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,020
What are you doing?

478
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,520
Stop crying!

479
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,420
Fu Zhengchu.

480
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,990
Why did you...

481
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,360
Did I bother you?

482
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,220
Hello, Sang Zhi's brother.

483
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,190
Goodbye.

484
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,260
Jiaxu, were you eavesdropping?

485
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,460
Yeah.

486
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,290
You sound so righteous.

487
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,460
You're in high school.

488
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,660
You can't date so early.

489
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:35,860
I didn't.

490
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,790
I'm not dating.

491
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,720
Really.

492
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,190
Weren't you eavesdropping?

493
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,090
Didn't you hear me tell him

494
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,160
to study hard

495
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,460
and not think about other things.

496
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,620
Come to think of it.

497
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,560
It's normal to have these ideas

498
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,360
during adolescence.

499
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,520
But your task now

500
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,990
is to study hard

501
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:54,790
and not get distracted.

502
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,620
I told you I didn't.

503
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,960
I really didn't.

504
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,260
I trust you.

505
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,220
But Sang Zhi.

506
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,920
It's nice to have people who like you.

507
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,190
You can thank him for liking you

508
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,660
before gently rejecting him.

509
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,420
But you can't hurt him.

510
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,460
I didn't hurt him.

511
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,560
I saw him crying.

512
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,920
He was crying

513
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,160
because he's a crybaby since he was little.

514
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,620
He and I grew up fighting.

515
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,920
And he's always the one who cried first.

516
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,620
Fighting?

517
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,090
No wonder

518
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,820
your teacher kept wanting to see your parents.

519
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,860
It didn't happen everyday.

520
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:45,290
Just a couple times.

521
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,160
Put out your hand.

522
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,460
Take it back.

523
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,090
Otherwise,

524
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,290
people will say

525
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,360
I blackmailed a high school student

526
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,390
if word about this gets out.

527
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,420
It's not blackmail.

528
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,990
I had dessert.

529
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,260
I should pay for it.

530
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,260
What dessert

531
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,160
costs this much?

532
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,620
Do you really think

533
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,560
I'm running a shady shop.

534
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,920
Jiaxu.

535
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,660
I just think it's a little hard for you

536
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:19,790
to work multiple jobs

537
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,190
because you're short of cash.

538
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,020
If I can

539
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,390
help you,

540
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,520
but don't overthink it.

541
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,990
If it were my brother,

542
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,060
I would help him too.

543
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,390
I swear.

544
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,520
So you're feeling bad

545
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,060
about me?

546
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:42,860
No.

547
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,460
Sorry.

548
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,790
Are you mad?

549
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,460
I'm not.

550
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,090
Thank you, Sang Zhi.

551
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,190
Do you know you need to be nice to me now?

552
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,220
I'm touched

553
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,720
that you did that

554
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,960
and think that way.

555
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,720
But

556
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,660
I'm not that broke.

557
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,390
How about this?

558
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,190
When I'm so broke

559
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,260
I can't afford to feed myself,

560
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,420
I'll borrow money from you.

561
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:22,790
Okay?

562
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:30,790
Alright.

563
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,460
I need to get back to work.

564
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,560
You know how to get to the nearest bus stop,

565
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,160
don't you?

566
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,260
Yes.

567
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,390
Can you go home by yourself?

568
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,460
Yes.

569
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,020
Goodbye then.

570
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,220
Zhenru.

571
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,460
What's the teacher's main focus?

572
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:19,990
It's this one.

573
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,460
15th century BC.

574
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:23,620
This question type.

575
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,820
Zhenru.

576
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:35,660
Zhenru.

577
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,560
What did you sign up for sports day?

578
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,620
The name list is ready.

579
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,620
Look at me.

580
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,860
The annual sports day

581
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,460
is about to begin.

582
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,860
This year,

583
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,660
we have a lot of sports.

584
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,020
So

585
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,560
the school decided to

586
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,220
[Ru, why are you not talking to me?]
borrow the venue from Nanwu University as usual.

587
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,990
Is everyone joining?

588
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,790
Yes.

589
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,190
Sang Zhi.

590
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,590
Why don't I

591
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,260
see your name?

592
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,290
Sir.

593
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,260
I'll be the record clerk this year.

594
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,860
That's not a sports.

595
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,260
Well.

596
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,190
You can join high jump.

597
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,160
I can't jump.

598
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,290
I have bad knees.

599
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,660
You're 17,

600
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,720
not 70.

601
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:24,990
You have

602
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,290
knee problems at such a young age.

603
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,360
This proves that you lack exercise.

604
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,090
You're joining this.

605
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,790
I'm scared I'll drag everyone down

606
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,990
with this flaw.

607
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:35,620
It doesn't matter.

608
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,760
Participate

609
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:38,990
and show yourself.

610
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,560
It doesn't matter whether you win.

611
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,460
What matters is participation,

612
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:43,720
not prizes.

613
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,460
What do I want?

614
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,720
I want you to be involved.

615
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,360
It's you then.

616
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,060
Also,

617
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,820
go to the class monitor

618
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:56,860
and give them

619
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,290
the sizes you wear.

620
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,260
I'm going to order
the class uniforms for everyone.

621
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,460
Sir.

622
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,990
What's the design for the class uniform?

623
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,020
It's a secret.

624
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,460
It will look very good.

625
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,020
It has the energy

626
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:11,360
of 17-year-old students like you.

627
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,220
100 meters.

628
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,790
Chen Liqiang.

629
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,720
Train hard with your three classmates.

630
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,760
Zhenru.

631
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:21,990
Zhenru.

632
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:23,560
Zhenru.

633
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,720
Where are you going?

634
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,060
I'm going to the store.

635
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,760
I'll go with you.

636
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,560
What do you want to eat?

637
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,390
It's my treat.

638
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,090
No thanks.

639
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,820

Get set.

643
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,360

-Go!

644
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,460

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,160
-Go!
-Go!

646

Go!

647
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,190
Fu Zhengchu, go! Fu Zhengchu.

648

It's Sang Zhi's turn.

655
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:26,990
Let's go with her.

656
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:27,760
Let's go together.

657
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,760
I'm not going.

658
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,520
You girls go ahead.

659
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,220
Bye.

660
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,060
We'll leave first.

661
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,990
Yes, right over there.

662
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:37,660
Thank you.

663
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:38,920
It's so good-looking.

664
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:40,790
It's pretty good-looking.

665
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:41,620
Sang Zhi

666
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,620
Good luck.

667
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,290
Fighting.

668
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,790
I'm going to accept my award.

669
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,460
[Women's high jump (qualifying round) registration area]

670
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,390
26.

671
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,360
Xie Jialu, okay.

672
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,360
You're disqualified from the competition.

673
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:11,920
Go home.

674
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,190
You're really annoying.

675
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,460
You're not tall enough.

676
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,390
1.2 meters won't do.

677
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,620
I'm already 155 cm.

678
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,290
Here.

679
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,560
Class 1, Sang...

680
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:23,720
Here.

681
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,790
Sang Zhi.

682
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,960
Here. Turn around.

683
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:29,560
Let me see.

684
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,360
No.

685
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,220
Turn around and show me.

686
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,460
No.

687
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,220
Turn around.

688
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,220
Turn around.

689
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:35,520
Turn around.

690
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,390
Let me see.

691
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:39,920
What are you doing?

692
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,820
It's a match!

693
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,620
0155.

694
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:45,660
Jeez.

695
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,860
Are you worried that the whole world doesn't know

696
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,460
you're 1.55 meters?

697
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,290
-Jeez.
-Go.

698
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:48,820
Zhi.

699
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,760
What sports are you participating in today?

700
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,260
High jump.

701
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:55,860
1.55 meters participating in high jump.

702
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,020
The sunflower's cute.

703
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,220
I didn't choose it.

704
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,090
Do your best.

705
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,260
Good luck, Little Demon.

706
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,820
-It's really funny.
-You're so noisy.

707
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,090
I was sleeping.

708
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,390
Wear a cap.

709
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:29,920
Don't get sunburned.

710
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,190
How was the warm-up?

711
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,860
Exercise more.

712
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,090
Don't twist your feet.

713
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,660
What are you doing?

714
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,460
Mom and Dad told me to take photos.

715
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:55,560
Can't you

716
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,960
film me when I look good?

717
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,390
Why do you have to do it when I'm...

718
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,620
You gotta tell me

719
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,560
when you look good.

720
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,390
Otherwise, I won't know.

721
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,360
-Don't this photo look like...
-Delete it.

722
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,090
1.55 meters.

723
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,660
Give it to me.

724
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,590
Delete it.

725
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,620
Don't touch it.

726
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,390
Stop bullying my sister.

727
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,620
What's the meaning of this?

728
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,620
You hear that?

729
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,220
My brother asked you to stop bullying me.

730
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,190
Who's your brother?

731
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:21,820
What?

732
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,820
Fine.

733
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:24,660
You can have it.

734
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:25,460
Let me take a couple of photos.

735
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:25,960
Go away.

736
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,860
Let me take a couple of photos. You're handsome.

737
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,460
Fine.

738
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,020
You can have it.

739
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:30,760
Give me back my camera.

740
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,220
Look.

741
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,860
Don't you look handsome?

742
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:35,620
Grade 11.

743
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,560
Do you really think I look handsome, Bro?

744
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,460
Women's high jump competition

745
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,460
will begin soon.

746
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,560
Alright, time for the competition.

747
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,360
Do your best.

748
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,290
You can do it.

749
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,290
Next, 0845,

750
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:55,820
Mr. Chen.

751
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,720
Junior high isn't involved.

752
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:58,590
Why are you here?

753
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,290
I'm here to watch and learn.

754
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,760
Junior high is having our sports day

755
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,620
next month.

756
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,460
Mr. Ling.

757
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,160
High school

758
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,290
is different this year.

759
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,260
How is it different?

760
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,720
Look at your class uniform.

761
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,160
What a scene.

762
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,460
It's trendy and stylish.

763
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,290
Most importantly,

764
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:15,720
it's energetic.

765
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,720
Look at who chose it.

766
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:19,660
Next.

767
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,020
Number 0155.

768
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,020
Sang Zhi.

769
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,390
Height of starting point, 1.05 meters.

770
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,260
-Go!
-Go!

771
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,290
Sang Zhi, good luck.

772
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,160
-Go!
-Go!

773
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,660
Go, Sang Zhi!

774
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,160
Go!

775
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,860
Good luck, 0155.

776
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,190
-Go!
-Go!

777
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,860
-Go!

778
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:40,560
Go!

779
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,390
Sang Zhi, good luck.

780
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,860
Go, Sang Zhi!

781
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,290
-Go!
-Go!

782
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,220
Do this

783
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,090
and she'll jump over in an instant.

784
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:03,820
What the hell?

785
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,760
Sang Zhi, go.

786
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,060
Sang Zhi, work on the legs.

787
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:07,820
Do your best, Sang Zhi.

788
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,560
Work on it.

789
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:09,860
Go!

790
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,760
-Go!
-Go!

791
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,090
-Go!
-Go!

792
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,620
-Go!
-Go!

793
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:23,490
Jump.

794
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,090
Don't grab the rod, Little Demon.

795
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:30,190
Sang Zhi, go.

796
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:30,890
-Go!
-Go!

797
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:31,490
Sang Zhi!

798
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,290
Good luck.

799
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,820
Go, Sang Zhi.

800
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:33,620
Do your best, Sang Zhi.

801
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:34,890
Go.

802
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,090
Good luck, Little Demon.

803
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,490
Good luck. Do your best.

804
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,190
Sang Zhi, go!

805
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,760
-Go!
-Go!

806
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,090
Go, Sang Zhi.

807
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,220
Are you okay?

808
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:20,990
Here.

809
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,890
Make... Make way.

810
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:22,960
Get up first.

811
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:23,490
Get up first.

812
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:23,790
Here.

813
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,720
-Be careful.
-Three, two, one, go.

814
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:26,960
It hurts.

815
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:27,660
-Be careful.
-What's wrong?

816
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,090
This hurts.

817
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:28,790
She probably sprained her ankle.

818
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,120
Take Sang Zhi

819
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,220
to the medical room.

820
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:31,990
Yes.

821
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,620
Sure.

822
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,020
Get on my back first.

823
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:33,690
I'll take you treat it.

824
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:35,790
Be careful.

825
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,490
Be careful.

826
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,890
Don't touch that leg.

827
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,690
I don't...

828
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:42,590
Let's go.

829
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,220
Sang Zhi's brother?

830
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:47,020
Hello, Sir.

831
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,120
This is...

832
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,560
My... My dad.

833
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:52,820
Let's go.

834
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:53,590
Let's go.

835
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,020
Hurry.

836
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,390
This... this is your...

837
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:57,790
It's all your fault.

838
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:58,190
My dad.

839
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,360
I'm so sorry, Sir.

840
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,490
Jeez.

841
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,490
Did you hurt your head when you broke your leg?

842
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:03,090
Do you think I'm old?

843
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:03,620
You called my your dad.

844
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,820
Can you stop scolding me?

845
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:05,990
You've been scolding me all day.

846
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,860
You were so bad at jumping

847
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:07,820
and insisted on doing it.

848
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,660
Jeez.

849
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,120
Alright, stop arguing.

850
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,990
I'll tell Dad when I get home.

851
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,490
Are you going to complain again?

852
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,020
Are you going to complain again?

853
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:11,660
Are you going to complain again?

854
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,220
Stop moving!

855
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:13,390
Watch... Watch out her leg.

856
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,420
I don't want you to carry me. I...

857
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,020
Then how are you going to walk?

858
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:15,820
You sprained your ankle.

859
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,360
Put me down.

860
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:17,960
Stop moving.

861
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,490
Let me carry her.

862
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:19,960
Sure.

863
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,490
You can carry her.

864
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:21,360
You're still arguing with her?

865
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,090
Watch out her leg.

866
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:22,960
-Okay.
-Be careful.

867
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,860
-Here.
-Her leg.

868
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,390
Are you okay?

869
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,960
Why is the medical room empty?

870
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,020
Take her there first.

871
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,860
I... I'll get someone to go there.

872
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:30,560
Sure.

873
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,490
You still talk so much when you've hurt your foot.

874
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:40,860
Sit down first.

875
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:42,990
Be careful.

876
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,490
Don't touch that leg first.

877
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,090
Let me disinfect it for you first.

878
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,390
It might hurt a little.

879
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,390
Bear it for a while.

880
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,360
Does it hurt?

881
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:20,090
Hang in there.

882
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,960
It'll be over soon.

883
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,260
You're so badly hurt.

884
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,690
What about this hand?

885
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:46,820
Does it hurt?

886
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,690
Why are you looking at me like that?

887
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,120
What's the matter?

888
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,260
You're nice to me.

889
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:00,960
Unlike my brother.

890
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,620
All he does is yell at me.

891
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,560
Do you think your brother's not nice to you?

892
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,220
He doesn't love me at all.

893
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,190
He doesn't love you?

894
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,290
Did you not see how panicked he was

895
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,390
when you fell?

896
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:15,420
He rushed over

897
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,620
and carried you on his back in no time.

898
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,560
He doesn't love you?

899
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:20,620
What's going on

900
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,820
in your little head?

901
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,720
But he's always yelling at me.

902
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,190
I'm already hurt.

903
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,220
But he was still yelling at me.

904
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,890
It's an impossible task

905
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,590
to make your brother stop yelling.

906
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:33,790
I'm done.

907
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:34,960
Be careful

908
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,020
with these wounds.

909
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,720
Don't touch them.

910
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,060
Don't let them touch water.

911
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,620
How are the wounds doing?

912
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,220
I've treated

913
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,020
the grazes.

914
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,820
But you better

915
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:47,560
take her

916
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,790
to the hospital to check the sprain.

917
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,420
Sure. Have a drink first.

918
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:52,960
Here.

919
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,090
Have a drink and we'll go to the hospital.

920
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,290
By the way, take the camera first.

921
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,990
Here. Get up here.

922
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,120
Your brother have classes in the afternoon.

923
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,290
Only your dad can take you to the hospital.

924
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,860
I beg you.

925
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,020
I also have to send you to school
these couple of days.

926
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,560
How troublesome.

927
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,190
It's fine.

928
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,260
If your dad

929
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,220
can't send you to school,

930
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,290
I'll do it.

931
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,890
Listen to him.

932
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,120
Get on his back.

933
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:44,890
Be careful.

934
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:46,560
Be careful.

935
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:47,890
Don't strangle me.

936
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,790
I'll leave you to it alone.

937
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:57,790
Let's go.

938
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,260
Wait.

939
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:00,060
Why wait?

940
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:00,990
[Temporary medical station]
Wait.

941
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:01,590
Wait.

942
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:03,790
I can't see.

943
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,990
Help... Help her up first.

944
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:06,790
Be careful.

945
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,360
Proceed with the competition.

946
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:15,720
Be careful.

947
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,290
What?

948
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,620
Be careful.

949
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,590
He's nice.

950
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,290
He's very nice to me.

951
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,420
But he seems to be nice to everyone.

952
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,120
I'm not the most special one.

953
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:14,120
That's all for my class today.

954
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,060
Class dismissed.

955
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,820
Sang Zhi, bye.

956
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:18,720
Bye.

957
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:29,690
Hello?

958
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:30,860
Little Demon.

959
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,190
Duan Jiaxu will pick you up today.

960
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:34,690
He'll probably

961
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,720
be late for about 20 minutes.

962
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:36,590
Wait for him.

963
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:40,960
Got it.

964
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,020
Also,

965
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,090
be good.

966
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,120
Stop causing others trouble.

967
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:45,990
When have I

968
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,060
caused him trouble?

969
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,190
Alright.

970
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,120
All that matters is that you got the message.

971
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:51,560
I gotta go. Bye.

972
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,560
Why would I cause him trouble?

973
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:05,490
Sang Zhi.

974
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,790
Can you go shopping with me?

975
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,860
I'm not going to tell Mom and Dad.

976
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:39,990
They're at work.

977
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,190
It's kind of a hassle for them to make the trip.

978
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,060
I already rook the day off for you.

979
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:46,960
Don't worry.

980
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:52,460
Here.

981
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,190
Hold tight.

982
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,460
Look what this is.

983
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:04,960
I'll open one for you.

984
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,020
Here.

985
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,060
So

986
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:28,860
did you purposely left

987
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,220
to get me some candy?

988
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:32,860
You're overthinking.

989
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,220
I went to buy water for Duan Jiaxu

990
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,420
and brought you one since I was there.

991
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:39,720
It's all your fault today.

992
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,460
You call me ugly every day.

993
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,590
I didn't even say anything.

994
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:44,560
It's different.

995
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,620
How is it different?

996
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,820
I'm speaking the truth.

997
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:51,020
Go!

998
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,820
