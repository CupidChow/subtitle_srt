00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,540
(After you wake up, drink more water.)

573
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,460
(I'll pick you up at ten)

574
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,460
(and take you to the airport.)

575
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,540
Oh, you're up.

576
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,460
You're finally awake, Sang.

577
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,140
Yes.

578
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,180
How are you feeling?

579
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,300
-Slowly.
-Watch your head.

580
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,220
Was the person who sent you back last night

581
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,780
your brother's friend,

582
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,980
your crush whom you mentioned

583
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,820
before?

584
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,660
Is he the one?

585
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:37,620
♪My heart jingles when I think of you♪

586
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,940
You said he was handsome,

587
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,220
but you didn't say he was that handsome.

588
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,540
I told you before.

589
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,580
How could I know

590
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,940
he's such good-looking?

591
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,020
Compared to Chen Qiang,

592
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,420
Chen Qiang is truly weak.

593
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,260
He's not a match for him.

594
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,220
Not at all, okay?

595
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,140
Oh.

596
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,980
When he

597
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,180
sent me back here yesterday,

598
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,500
did

599
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,540
he

600
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,580
look upset?

601
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,580
No.

602
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,900
Did he look upset?

603
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,260
No.

604
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:05,940
Nope.

605
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,740
He looked pretty fine to me.

606
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,540
Upset?

607
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,380
Wait a minute.

608
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,500
Did you do something to him?

609
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:12,700
Nothing.

610
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,460
What did you do?

611
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,220
Nothing.

612
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,820
Nothing? I don't believe you.

613
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,020
I didn't do anything.

614
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,660
Anyway, you guys

615
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,580
have to watch me.

616
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,540
I must never drink anymore.

617
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,380
If I ever drink,

618
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,380
I'm a dog.

619
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,700
What did you do?

620
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,860
Did you kiss him?

621
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,140
No, I did not. I would never.

622
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:30,900
Why are you so worked up?

623
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,660
I'm sure you did.

624
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,740
You must have confessed your feelings to him.

625
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,260
Am I right?

626
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:34,900
Did you confess to him?

627
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,420
If I did confess,

628
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,060
I probably

629
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,090
wouldn't wake up today.

630
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,660
-Then what did you do?
-What did you do to him?

631
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:40,660
-Tell us.
-Come on.

632
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,380
I did nothing.

633
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,820
She couldn't have vomited, right?

634
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:43,700
Impossible.

635
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,460
You didn't, right?

636
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,500
Did you throw up?

637
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,860
Did you really

638
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,460
throw up on him?

639
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,020
Well...

640
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,420
I need to pack my things.

641
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,540
I... I have to pack up my stuff.

642
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,260
So,

643
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,220
she did throw up.

644
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,620
She threw up on her crush.

645
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,420
Sang

646
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,580
threw up on your crush.

647
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,500
Why does he insist on taking me to the airport?

648
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,980
How can I face him

649
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,620
after what happened last night?

650
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,900
Good morning, Jiaxu.

651
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,060
Morning.

652
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,140
Let me help you with your luggage.

653
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,660
Sang Zhi!

654
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,300
Jiang Ming.

655
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,180
Good morning.

656
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,020
Are you okay?

657
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,060
You had too much to drink last night.

658
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,620
I'm okay.

659
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,020
Do you need something from me?

660
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,420
You were drunk last night.

661
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,100
So I don't know

662
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,460
if you still remember

663
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,460
what I said.

664
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,820
I'm sorry.

665
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,380
I don't really remember...

666
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,620
I...

667
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,900
Hi, sir.

668
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:41,820
You guys go ahead.

669
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,660
Sorry, Sang Zhi.

670
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,220
I didn't know your brother was here.

671
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,500
It's okay.

672
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,900
What were you trying to say just now?

673
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,500
Actually,

674
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,260
I wanted to tell you that

675
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,100
on New Year's Eve.

676
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,860
But you didn't come that night.

677
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,860
Last night,

678
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,380
I sang a song at the bar.

679
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:05,940
Song?

680
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,620
For you...

681
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,500
Yes.

682
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:09,900
I was playing the guitar

683
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,140
as I sang at the bar.

684
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,500
Yes, you even played the guitar

685
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,740
and sang.

686
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,660
I prepared the performance for you.

687
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,620
For me?

688
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,620
I'd prepared

689
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,820
that song for a long time.

690
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,380
Thank you.

691
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:28,900
Sang Zhi,

692
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,900
I like you.

693
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,660
I want you to know that.

694
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,860
It's good to be appreciated by someone.

695
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,100
You can thank him for appreciating you

696
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,740
and then politely reject him.

697
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,500
Thank you for liking me.

698
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,220
I understand.

699
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,300
But

700
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,060
I'm into someone else.

701
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:12,980
So,

702
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:13,980
I'm sorry.

703
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,180
It's okay.

704
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,900
There's no need to apologize.

705
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,700
We're still friends

706
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,580
after this, right?

707
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,060
Of course.

708
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,700
Take the breakfast with you and eat it on the way.

709
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:35,900
Okay.

710
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:37,820
Thank you.

711
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,540
You should get in the car.

712
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,580
Your brother is waiting for you.

713
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:42,780
I'll get going then.

714
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,020
Bye-bye.

715
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:02,780
Is it delicious?

716
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,780
Then eat more.

717
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,220
After this, I have something to ask you.

718
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,020
We went to the bar yesterday

719
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,860
because we...

720
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,700
We had planned to have fun.

721
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,900
The exam was difficult, you see.

722
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,460
The bar was also nearby

723
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,860
the campus. So...

724
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,860
It was mostly students at the bar,

725
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,260
so it was not dangerous at all.

726
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,900
Besides, you know

727
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,780
I don't usually drink much.

728
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,100
Who did you go with?

729
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,180
My roommates.

730
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,100
I know all of them.

731
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,340
Roommates?

732
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,220
The guy

733
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,060
who came out with you yesterday,

734
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,380
1.95 meters tall,

735
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,660
the one who just gave you a hamburger,

736
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,220
is he also your roommate?

737
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,940
No, that's a friend

738
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,420
of my roommate's boyfriend.

739
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,220
Is that him?

740
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,580
What do you mean by that?

741
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,780
The guy you like.

742
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,940
Is it him?

743
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:37,980
Is he?

744
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,420
What's this?

745
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,780
The breakfast he gave me.

746
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,980
Is this a beef burger?

747
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,220
You can't eat this.

748
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,260
I'll take it.

749
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,380
I'm sorry, Jiaxu.

750
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,180
I threw up on you,

751
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,060
right?

752
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,580
I wasn't dreaming, right?

753
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:46,940
Are you really

754
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,620
that hungry?

755
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:49,900
No.

756
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,100
Why don't you

757
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:56,980
give me

758
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,060
the clothes I dirtied?

759
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,020
I'll give them back to you after I clean them.

760
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,940
You drank quite a lot last night.

761
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:05,980
It's okay.

762
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,340
I know you drank too much,
