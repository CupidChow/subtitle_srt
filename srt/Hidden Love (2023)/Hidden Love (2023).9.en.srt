00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,390
for different players.

196
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,040
We could

197
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,240
give it a try right now.

198
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,510
We can test it

199
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,510
with a player account that is

200
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,600
more active.

204

207

208
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,680
Okay.

(I don't care! I want it!)

210

(Bad footwork.)

211
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,360
(You can't drink with that, my friend.)

212
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,240
Fang Siming is an interesting guy.

213
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,360
Theoretically speaking,

214
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,190
when a large amount of data

215
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:24,790
is fed

216
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,590
to the AI,

217
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,040
the AI will manifest its own behavior

218
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,430
when the amount of data

219
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,430
reaches a certain level.

220
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,160
This is the part

221
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,030
where researchers

222
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,910
across the globe

223
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,510

224
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,960

225

a technical upgrade

226
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,270
in this regard,

227
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,200
this could be a huge breakthrough

228
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,360
for our game.

229
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,870
But this is just a demo.

230
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,000
If we are to

231
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,750
complete this system

232
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,000
successfully,

233
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,670
we need

234
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,270
a lot of

235
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,480
NPCs in the game.

236
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:53,840
Given

237
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,670
our staff and technical capability,

238
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,320
I fear it might not be viable.

239
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,360
If we take the risk recklessly,

240
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,070
we will exert more risks

241
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,200
to the project.

242
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,200
That is a problem.

243
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,870
I need time

244
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,440

00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,600
No.

Don't you think

253

that will be a risky move?

254
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,990
I think

255
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,790
it's a bit risky.

But there are also the solutions.

259
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,670
We have more solutions.

260
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,390
Yes, Xun.

00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,670
are dating.

387
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,910
Yeah, we can see that.

388
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,510
Ning Wei, oh Ning Wei.

389
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,240
You didn't waste any time, did you?

390
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,630
Are those matching outfits?

391
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,320
Yeah.

392
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,390
So...

393
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,270
You were here to see Sang?

394
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,600
I got the premiere ticket last night.

395
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,390
Sang Zhi,

396
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,190
would you like to

397
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,120
watch it with me?

398
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,030
Just her?

399
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,270
That can't be nice.

400
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,270
Yeah.

401
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,320
Shut it.

402
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,960
If you're free,

403
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,000
feel free to join.

404
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:45,720
We're free.

405
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,240
Yes.

406
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:46,910
Yeah.

407
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:47,600
Okay.

408
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,840
This Sunday at 8 PM,

409
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,790
meet up at Dayue Cinema.

410
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,750
Hold on.

411
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,000
This Sunday?

412
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,240
I probably can't make it.

413
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,200
I have plans for this Sunday.

414
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:55,960
What plan?

415
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,510
Come on, Sang.

416
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,670
Come with us.

417
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,870
Let's go.

418
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,840
It's been ages since we last watched a movie.

419
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,600
(If things get awkward during the dinner)

420
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,750
(with him,)

421
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,680
(I'll have an excuse to leave.)

422
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,200
Come on.

423
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,240
Go on.

424
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,030
Sunday, 8 PM.

425
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:11,960
Okay.

426
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,680
See you at the cinema.

427
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,350
Okay.

428
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,110
See you there.

429
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,790
This is all thanks to you.

430
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,960
Let's head for the class.

431
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,790
Thanks.

432
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,480
We have a class next.

433
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,400
Let's go.

434
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,000
Come on.

435
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,200
Qiang!

436
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,270
Let's go.

437
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,200
Coming.

438
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,750
Are you Mr. Duan Jiaxu?

439
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,680
Yes.

440
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,400
Your parcel.

441
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:50,960
Thanks.

442
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,750
Don't mention it.

00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,550
(Did you receive the parcel?)

445
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,480
(I sent you some tonics.)

446
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,550
(There is also
an essential oil lamp for stress relief.)

447
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,240
(Take care of yourself.)

448
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,830

(Do not contact me again.)

453
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,240
Okay.

454
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,350
It makes your skin fair.

455

[Duan Jiaxu]

456
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,030
[Jiang Ying]

00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,440
(What do you mean not to contact you again?)

458
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,750
(Jiaxu.)

459
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,110
(When will you be free?)

460
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,310
(Can we meet up?)

461
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,590
[Jiang Ying]

462
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,350
Come on, Duan. The meeting is starting.

463
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,400
In a moment.

464
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,000
You only had half an egg?

465
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,640
You skipped your lunch.

466
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,720
I'll have it over at the meeting.

467
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,830
I'll take it there for you.

468
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,110
I've decided

469
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,030
to employ Duan's idea.

470
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,200
The Celestial Progression System
will be the main feature.

471
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,590
However,

472
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,480
the new storyline, dungeons,

473
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,720
and factions must remain.

474
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,830
The maps too.

475
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,160
These will be the main focus.

476
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,510
If we are going down this path,

477
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,880
you will have full cooperation
from the planning department

478
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,200
and the game art department.

479
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,350
But given the circumstances now,

480
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,550
I can't come up with an idea

481
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,030
of assigning work

482
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,270
so everyone can deliver quality work on time

483
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,590
without overworking.

484
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,400
We also still don't know if
the Celestial Progression System

485
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,110
is compatible with most smartphones.

486
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,400
That's a problem too.

487
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,440
Wang's concern is justified.

488
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,000
Duan.

489
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,680
Do you have a solution

490
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:45,550
for that?

491
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,350
Well...

492
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,310
My idea so far

493
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,310
is to take

494
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,640
some workload off

495
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,630
the other departments

496
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,550
with tech.

497
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,510
For example,

498
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,790
the manual form filling.

499
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:58,950
It can be done

500
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,590
using tech.

501
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's been decided.

502
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,110
Let's give it our best.

503
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,950
We'll solve every problem

504
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,640
along the way.

505
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:07,550
Okay?

506
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,960
If you ever

507
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,350
need coordination,

508
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,510
just let us know.

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,720
Wang and Duan

510
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,830
will be in charge of

511
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,720
this new project.

512
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,240
Let's go.

513
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:25,960
Let's go.

00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,400

519
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,920
Sorry, Sang Zhi.

520
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,110
I don't think

00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,160
I can make it there tonight.

522
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,920
Are you working overtime?

523
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,240
Yeah.

524
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,200
Order something for yourself.

525
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,400
Don't starve.

529
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,440
Not at all.

530
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,400
Are you sick?

531
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,830
It's a little gastric pain.

532
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,920
Maybe it's food poisoning.

533
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:46,920
It's alright.

534
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,200
I'll take some medicine.

535
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:48,960
No.

536
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,830
Shouldn't you go to a hospital?

537
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,160
This is nothing serious.

538
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,590
Why don't you go to a hospital?

539
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,240
Holding off the pain won't make it better.

540
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,750
Where is your office?

541
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,640
Don't trouble yourself.

542
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,750
I'm alright.

543
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,640
Where is the office?

It's nothing.

Wait here.

555
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,680
I'll get a taxi.

556

Just wait here for me.

560
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,200
It's alright.

561
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,270
I can hold it.

562
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,640
Lean on me.

563
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,310

Are you helping an old man,

567

young girl?

568
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,550
Can you walk

569
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,720
on your own?

570
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,240
I...

571
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:20,480
Slowly.

572

I'm not saying you're a kid.

573

00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:43,920
Be careful.

580
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,400
Be careful.

581
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,920
I'll book a ride.

582
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,510
What is the address?

583
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,680
I didn't mean it.

584
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,310
I didn't mean it either.

585
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:31,920
Jiaxu.

586
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:32,920
Get in the car.

587
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,790
Watch it.

588
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,390
I'm fine.

589
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:45,920
Mind the head.

590
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,510
Hello.

591
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,200
Hello.

592
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,070
Hello.

593
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,240
Is he drunk?

594
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,440
Is he hurt?

595
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,830
No.

596
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,880
Is he going to throw up?

597
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,270
No, sir.

598
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,200
Sir.

599
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,270
I won't throw up. I can hang in there.

600
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,510
Wait. Let me make it clear.

601
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,750
If you throw up in here,

602
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,000
that's 200 yuan.

603
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:07,880
Okay?

604
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,480
He's not throwing up.

605
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,640
He has a stomach ache.

606
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:11,350
To the hospital.

607
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,110
Take us to the hospital.

608
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,830
Okay.

609
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,920
Be quick.

610
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,680
Okay.

611
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,070
[Yihe City Hospital, Outpatient Building]

612
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,350
(Judging by the Doppler ultrasound scan,)

613
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,350
[Diagnostic Imaging Report]
it's acute appendicitis.

614
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,960
And judging by the looks of it,

615
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,920
it's gone on for some time.

616
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,790
Had you not come here,

617
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,640
there'd be a hole in it.

618
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,960
What do we do now?

619
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,480
One, conservative therapy.

620
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,070
Stay and get the inflamed part removed.

621
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:42,720
The hospital?

622
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,510
The other method

623
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,720
is surgery.

624
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:45,880
But...

625
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,880
Do the surgery.

626
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,830
Okay.

627
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,510
It's alright.

628
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:01,750
Sang Zhi.

629
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,920
It's late.

630
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:05,960
You should head back to school.

631
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,830
It's unsafe to head back late.

632
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,680
I'll wait outside.

633
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,240
It's not a major surgery.

634
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,470
It's alright.

635
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,310
I'll wait.

636
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,240
I need the surgery.

637
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,480
Stop talking.

638
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,960
Go on

639
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,750
and get yourself something to eat.

640
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,710
(Had I not)

641
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,350
(asked him out for dinner,)

642
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,350
(he would have just held it off)

643
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,880
(and never come to the hospital.)

644
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,750
Avoid overworking.

645
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,400
Alcohol.

[Mom]

647
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,110
Hello, Mom?

648
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,000
Zhi?

649
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,310
It's past 10 PM.

650
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,880
Why didn't you call me just now?

651
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,590
Are you at the dorm?

652
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
Are you going out with friends?

653
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,270
No.

654
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:26,160
Do you remember my brother's classmate?

655
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,830
He gave me physics tuition

656
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,960
back in high school.

657
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,200
It's Duan Jiaxu.

658
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,270
I remember.

659
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,440
It's Duan, right?

660
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,790
The plan was to

661
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,160
have dinner together,

662
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,830
but he suddenly fell sick.

663
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,920
So I took him to the hospital.

664
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:43,920
He's sick?

665
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,640
What is it? Is it serious?

666
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,440
Acute appendicitis.

667
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,440
He's going through surgery.

668
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,640
Poor thing.

669
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,110
He doesn't have a family.

670
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,510
What do you mean?

671
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,750
He lives in Yihe, right?

672
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,400
I never

673
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,110
told you about his background.

674
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,790
Sir.

675
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,680
I have 6,000 yuan left after the funeral.

676
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,750
Take this for now.

677
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,310
I'll pay you the balance

678
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,270
after I get a job.

679
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,160
Duan.

680
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,960
Keep the money to yourself.

681
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:23,830
Take your time.

682
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,070
But...

683
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,920
You have to take the money.

684
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,920
Keep it.

685
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,880
Keep the money.

686
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,720
You've been through a lot.

687
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,590
I'm alright.

688
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,310
It was nothing.

689
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,720
Sir, madam,

690
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,920
you should

691
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,750
take the money.

692
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,160
There are things I must tend to.

693
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,400
I should get going.

694
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,000
Thanks for the time.

695
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,680
Duan.

696
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,960
Dinner is ready.

697
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,270
Leave after dinner.

698
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,400
Never mind, madam.

699
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,110
Thank you

700
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,830
for all the help.

701
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,590
Both of you took great care of me.

702
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,200
Without you...

703
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:18,830
Thank you.

704
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,350
Raise your head, child.

705
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,510
Come on.

706
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,240
I must get going.

707
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,680
Poor thing.

708
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,880
He's only a college freshman.

709
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,640
He's only 18 years old.

710
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:40,960
Who knows

711
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,110
what else he'll face?

712
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,200
Yan.

713
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,350
Watch his back in school.

714
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,160
Okay.

715
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,070
In less than six months,

716
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,480
he paid us back the rest of the sum.

717
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,480
But his mom

718
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,790
passed away.

719
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,200
Zhi.

720
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,640
Don't stay outside too late.

721
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,240
Stay safe on the way.

722
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,400
I'm hanging up now.

723
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,310
(He can only be discharged after seven days.)

724
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,310
He can't

725
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,270
have solid food for now.

726
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,160
He'll have

727
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,270
fluid for a week.

728
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,990
Should anything comes up,

729
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,720
we'll contact you.

730
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,000
Thanks.

731
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,030
Thank you.

732
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,400
Jiaxu,

733
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,550
I asked the nurses.

734
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
You'll only need these

735
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,440
while you're in the hospital.

736
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:01,830
But

737
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,960
if you need anything else,

738
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,070
let me know.

739
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,920
I'll get it for you.

740
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,750
Thank you, Sang Zhi.

741
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,830
It's getting late.

742
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,200
You should head back to school.

743
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,920
Get a taxi

744
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,270
after you leave.

745
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,000
Send the plate number

746
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,920
of that taxi.

747
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,070
Let me know when you reach the dorm.

748
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,240
Okay?

749
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,350
Jiaxu...

750
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,920
I'm not a kid anymore.

751
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,960
Don't worry about me.

752
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,160
I know what to do.

753
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,160
Okay.

754
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,640
Leave the things here.

755
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,920
I'll put them away later.

756
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,400
Is the wound hurting?

757
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,070
I got anesthetics,

758
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,550
so it doesn't hurt.

759
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,750
I don't feel a thing.

760
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,350
Don't worry.

761
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:47,920
Head back to school.

762
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,960
I'll visit you tomorrow.

763
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,400
Come when you have no classes.

764
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,510
I'm an adult.

765
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,590
Don't trouble yourself for me.

766
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,920
It's alright. Go on.

767
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,840
(Is she upset?)

768
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,780
She will probably

769
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,550
be concerned about it.

770
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,400
Hello?

771
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,590
Hello, buddy.

772
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,190
You got your appendix removed.

773
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,630
How does it feel?

774
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,440
Not bad.

775
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,590
Would you like to try it?

776
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,400
That won't be necessary.

777
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:52,840
But I heard

778
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
my sister helped out.

779
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,550
Yeah.

780
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,400
You troubled her for your own problem.

781
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,880
You should have gone to the hospital.

782
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,280
Are you calling

783
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,320
only to tell me that?

784
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,830
No.

785
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,590
I had dinner with my parents.

786
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,000
They told me you got sick.

787
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,550
I'm celebrating with you.

788
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,230
If there's nothing else,

789
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,000
I'm hanging up.

790
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,030
I'll carry on with the game.

791
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,000
Hold on.

792
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,280
I want to tell you something.

793
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,590
What is it?

794
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,000
Forget it. It's nothing important.

795
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:25,910
Buddy,

796
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,320
can you not do this every time?

797
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,800
Just spill it

798
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,920
like a real man.

799
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,880
It's nothing. Bye.

800
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,030
Hey!

801
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,360
Why did you come back?

802
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,070
Jiaxu.

803
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,230
I gave it some thoughts.

804
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,400
I should stay here

805
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,280
and look after you.

806
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,990
If I fall sick and there is no one

807
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,400
by my side,

808
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,800
you'll do the same for me.

809
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,360
Right?

810
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,000
Did you have dinner?

811
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:29,960
I brought dinner.

812
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,000
You've starved all day

813
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,000
and now you only eat bread?

814
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,880
Forget this.

815
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,800
I'll order a takeaway.

816
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,320
Never mind. I'm not hungry.

817
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,360
You've eaten nothing.

818
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,630
Of course you are starving.

819
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:51,920
I'm not hungry at all.

820
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,480
If I were,

821
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,960
I'd get something to eat.

822
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,000
I'm not a kid anymore.

823
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,320
I don't need you to be worried.

824
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,670
(She is stuffed like a pufferfish.)

825
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,190
Jiaxu, what's so funny?

826
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,150
Nothing.

827
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:10,840
Where are you going?

828
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,510
I'm going to freshen up.

829
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,400
Go on.

830
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,440
(He can't get off the bed today.)

831
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,550
(So he can't clean himself.)

832
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,000
(Maybe I should...)

833
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:10,880
Jiaxu.

834
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,190
The doctor says you can't take a shower today.

835
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,590
You could wipe your face.

836
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:15,800
Sure.

837
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,800
I can help you.

838
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,920
Never mind. I'll manage.

839
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,230
What if your wound tears up?

840
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,070
You'll spend

841
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,320
even more days here.

842
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,480
Alright.

843
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,920
I don't have a nice outfit

844
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,760
to go to the movie!

845
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,920
It's only across the campus.

846
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:09,350
Do you

847
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,400
have to take so long with the makeup?

848
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:10,960
Let's go.

849
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,000
Of course I have to!

850
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,480
I'm meeting someone I like.

851
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,400
I can't help

852
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,440
the urge to look good.

853
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,110
You don't get it.

854
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,510
Okay, I don't get it.

855
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,920
Ms. Wei's Guide to Love Life.

856
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:21,960
Come on.

857
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,480
Wait for me.

858
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,870
You look good enough. Let's go.

859
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,150
Just wait for a second!

860
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,230
Hurry up.

861
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,480
Fine. Stop telling me that.

862
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,440
Sang, bye.

863
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,190
Bye.

864
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:34,800
Hurry up!

865
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:36,360
Right away.

866
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,510
See you. Bye.

867
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,760
See you later.

868
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,480
Bye!

869
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,400
It's been a while.

870
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:59,800
You even learned how to put on makeup.

871
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,880
You really are different now.

872
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:47,940
♪Love is when butterflies flutter in my heart♪

873
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:52,310
♪And ripples of excitement
sprawling across my vision♪

874
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,740

875
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,910
♪But I can't contain my joy♪

00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,940
♪I have someone I really like♪

00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:14,480
♪My heart jingles when I think of you♪

00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,140
♪I wish I could read your mind♪

00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:25,380
♪To find out if you like me too♪
