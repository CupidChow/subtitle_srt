00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:37,980
Have something.

190
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,740
You should have something first.

191
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,580
Don't meddle when you don't know anything.

192
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,220
That means she's free then?

193
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,860
Duan, look into my eyes.

194
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:04,660
Who is it?

195
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,260
Who might not be free?

196
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,740
Eat your food.

197
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,100
Don't be nosy.

198
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,420
Something's going on.

199
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,740
Here he is.

200
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,500
Look!

201
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,460
I told you already.

202
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,260
I knew he would reply to her.

203
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,140
What did he write?

204
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,340
Let me see.

205
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,540
(What about Thursday night?)

206
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,260
What about Thursday night?

207
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:35,620
Fine.

208
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,380
Since he has tried this for the third time,

209
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,100
let's give him a pass then.

210
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,700
Hurry.

211
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,780
Stop being pretentious.

212
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,540
Hurry up.

213
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,260
(That's fine.)

214
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,850
[Sang Zhi]

215
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,900
Do I look okay?

216
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:55,620
Yeah.

217
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,580
You look beautiful.

218
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,980
There's a new noodles shop on the street

219
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,140
to the right of our university.

220
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,020
I heard that it was pretty good.

221
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:01,460
Is that so?

222
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,020
Let's go there together.

223
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,540
You guys can go by yourselves then.

224
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,980
I...

225
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:06,940
Sure.

226
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,220
We'll do a taste test for you.

227
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,310
What noodles do you guys want to try?

228
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,780
I heard from Yuting

229
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,980
that their shrimp...

230
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:13,780
Sang Zhi.

231
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,620
Sorry about this.

232
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,660
What's the matter?

233
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,100
Why did you start with an apology?

234
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:22,860
It's like this.

235
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,140
There's a bug

236
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,180
in the system we developed.

237
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,420
So,

238
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,220
we're dealing with it urgently.

239
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,700
I think

240
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,540
I might not be able

241
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,500
to join you for a meal today.

242
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:33,900
Okay.

243
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,180
Will you work until very late?

244
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,620
Will you take dinner?

245
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,580
Do you want me to order something for you?

246
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,060
Why did the alarm sound again?

247
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,660
Duan.

248
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:41,700
Duan,

249
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,340
save us.

250
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,620
Lower your volume.

251
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:45,860
Hello?

252
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,060
You should get back to work then.

253
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,700
That's fine.

254
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,580
Don't worry about me.

255
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:50,740
Sorry about that.

256
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,260
Remember to take dinner, okay?

257
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,260
Okay.

258
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,500
Goodbye.

259
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:57,940
Goodbye.

260
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,620
Done.

261
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,180
Looks like

262
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,300
I have to join you guys today.

263
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,100
Where's the shop?

264
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,340
It's to the right of the university's entrance.

265
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,140
You're all dolled up.

266
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:09,940
Are you sure you want to have noodles?

267
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,100
Can't I have noodles like this?

268
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,340
I guess so.

269
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,420
Let's go.

270
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,300
Let's go.

271
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,340
See you.

272
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,740
Goodbye.

273
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,860
She's so pretty.

274
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,820
Hello, Jiaxu?

275
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,140
Sorry.

276
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,700
You're apologizing again?

277
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,260
This time,

278
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,380
a colleague of mine

279
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,820
encountered some issues.

280
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,980
We have to change the program
and add more functions to it.

281
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,780
I guess you don't have a choice.

282
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,140
If so,

283
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,780
you can call me when you're free then.

284
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,860
You're not upset, aren't you?

285
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,700
Once I'm done here,

286
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,060
I'll take you out for some good food.

287
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,060
I'll hang up first.

288
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,740
(Didn't he say that he was going to court me?)

289
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,580
(Is he even trying here?)

290
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,300
I don't want it.

291
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,660
Wait for me!

292
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,780
I'll stop.

293
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,580
Wait for me!

294
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:19,540
What's the matter?

295
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,260
Why did you come back?

296
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:28,860
You...

297
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,300
What are you doing here?

298
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,060
I thought you were going on a date?

299
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,020
Yeah.

300
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,660
You scared me.

301
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,940
He canceled the date.

302
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,420
Didn't he say he wanted to court you?

303
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,300
Do you know how many times he has stood you up?

304
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,580
It doesn't look like he's trying to court you.

305
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,340
He's busy with work.

306
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,460
He didn't do it on purpose.

307
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,780
So what if he's busy with work?

308
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,140
Don't tell me he has no time for you at all?

309
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,540
I'm sure he has time before

310
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,460
and after work.

311
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,420
I'm sure he has time

312
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,340
to see you if he wants to.

313
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:54,900
Precisely.

314
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,620
But he's really busy.

315
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,260
He's so busy that he has no time

316
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:58,980
to sleep.

317
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,900
It's already curfew

318
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,420
when he comes after work.

319
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,860
Why are you still defending him?

320
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,340
Sang,

321
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,060
don't you blame him?

322
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,420
It's fine.

323
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,900
I'm utterly speechless.

324
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,460
I can't just teach him

325
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,460
how to court you.

326
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:21,900
Sang,

327
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,220
did you not have dinner?

328
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,260
Are you hungry?

329
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,010
Oh, yeah.

330
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,420
Where's the leftover food we packed...

331
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,940
It's delicious.

332
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,340
That's right.

333
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,020
We packed some fruit too.

334
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:35,940
They're delicious.

335
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,060
Here. Take it.

336
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,220
You haven't had dinner, right?

337
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:41,780
Take a sniff. It's nice...

338
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,060
Don't eat that first.

339
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:44,980
You should finish the hamburger first.

340
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,300
Let me have some fruit first.

341
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:46,940
Don't.

342
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,860
You shouldn't have the fruits first.

343
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,860
But why?

344
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:50,540
You see,

345
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,500
the hamburger will spoil

346
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,540
if you keep it until tomorrow.

347
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,740
You should finish this first.
It'll fill up your tummy.

348
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,780
Have this.

349
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,660
Take a sniff. It smells great.

350
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,100
Currently,

351
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,820
the character modeling

352
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,940
is basically completed.

353
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,100
Regarding that,

354
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,620
we actually

355
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,140
optimized the fluidity

356
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:09,900
of the characters'

357
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,060
techniques.

358
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,420
Currently,

359
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,820
we've basically

360
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,100
optimized

361
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,180
everything there is.

362
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,980
There's no issue for now.

363
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:18,820
Yes.

364
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,700
I'm sure everyone knows

365
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,820
how much Jia Yang has improved.

366
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,740
You flatter me.

367
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,620
It's been tough on you guys.

368
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,380
Our optimization

369
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,580
has proved

370
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,420
to be effective.

371
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,500
So,

372
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,980
I would like to congratulate you guys.

373
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:35,980
We don't need to work overtime today.

374
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,220
Let's go back and rest.

375
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,500
We can finally get off work on time.

376
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,570
[Nursing Home]

377
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,700
This won't do.

378
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,900
What are you drawing?

379
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,380
Sang.

380
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,220
Why are you back again?

381
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,780
Don't tell me he canceled the date again?

382
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,980
I was stood up again today.

383
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,300
Wait, what?

384
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,660
How many times has he stood you up?

385
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,900
Was it work again?

386
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,180
It's not work this time.

387
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:09,940
However,

388
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,500
I didn't ask him about it.

389
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,740
And I don't bother doing so.

390
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,460
Does it count as courting
when he doesn't take her out for dates?

391
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,460
Of course not.

392
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,740
What is he doing?

393
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:18,980
All right.

394
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:19,780
It'll be fine.

395
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,780
Even if he's not here for you, we're here for you.

396
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,660
We'll keep you company.

397
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:22,940
Yeah.

398
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:23,620
Let's grab some coffee.

399
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,420
No.

400
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,300
I don't

401
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,460
feel like going out today.

402
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,340
Come on.

403
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,180
-Let's go.
-No.

404
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,460
You have to.

405
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,180
No thanks.

406
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,260
You have to go.

407
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,340
No thanks.

408
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,220
Let's go.

409
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,900
[Jianfa Yibai Nursing Home]

410
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,580
(Mr. Duan,)

411
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,460
your father isn't doing well

412
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,220
lately.

413
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:41,700
I see.

414
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,180
Dr. Yang, thank you.

415
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,740
He has been bedridden for nine years.

416
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,500
His health and immunity

417
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,100
are subpar.

418
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,260
His pulmonary edema

419
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,300
is getting worse lately.

420
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,020
I suggest you take him to the hospital

421
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:54,940
for surgery

422
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,980
to remove the excess water in his lungs.

423
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,100
If not, an infection

424
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,740
might occur.

425
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,780
It'll be worse by then.

426
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,220
Do you think

427
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,180
he can regain consciousness?

428
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,100
Miracles will happen

429
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,780
as long as he's still alive.

430
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,500
If so, Dr. Yang, please deal with

431
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,100
the hospital transfer procedures for me.

432
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,220
I'll make a move first.

433
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,260
Okay.

434
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,180
Jiaxu!

435
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,500
Mom, look.

436
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,260
It's snowing today.

437
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,260
Call your dad.

438
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,060
Why isn't he back yet?

439
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,260
Didn't we say we were going
to celebrate your success

440
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,540
for getting 1st place in the city's

441
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,060
physics contest?

442
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,020
I'll ask him.

443
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,260
Don't eat it yet.

444
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:51,820
How is it?

445
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,900
He didn't pick up.

446
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:54,780
Call him again.

447
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,100
Dear, you're back.

448
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,500
Dad.

449
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:07,820
What's the matter?

450
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,740
Did you take alcohol?

451
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,700
I'm done for.

452
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:15,940
What do you mean?

453
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:16,660
I'm done for.

454
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,180
What do you mean?

455
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,020
Dad, what's the matter?

456
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,300
I crashed into someone.

457
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,580
Where did it happen?

458
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,500
At the hamburger shop on Renmin Road.

459
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,500
How is that person doing then?

460
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:33,540
You see,

461
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,580
no one saw it.

462
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,100
I drank.

463
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,500
I can't afford to call the cops.

464
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,340
Duan Zhicheng!

465
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,340
Have you lost your mind?

466
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,940
How could you drive after drinking?

467
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:44,940
Are you out of your mind?

468
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,740
What were you thinking?

469
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:46,660
Jiaxu!

470
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,340
Jiaxu!

471
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,220
Jiaxu!

472
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,220
Don't call the cops.

473
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:49,980
Don't call them.

474
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,780
Dad, listen to me!

475
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,260
We have to save that person!

476
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,900
It'll get worse

477
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,020
if something happens to him!

478
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,100
Dad, you can't escape from this.

479
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:58,740
Dear,

480
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,060
go and turn yourself in.

481
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,420
We'll figure something out together.

482
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,020
I don't want to go to jail.

483
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,020
Dear, go and turn yourself in.

484
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,940
Jiaxu!

485
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,020
Dear!

486
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,260
A car accident happened outside

487
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,100
the hamburger shop on Renmin Road!

488
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,540
Please save him!

489
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,340
Go and turn yourself in!

490
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,220
Dad!

491
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:14,580
Dad!

492
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,260
Dear!

493
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,540
Dear!

494
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,500
(Dear!)

495
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,340
(Dear!)

496
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,340
You're back.

497
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,500
Why are you still awake?

498
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,020
You're making that again?

499
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,260
You came back late too.

500
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,540
Look at the time.

501
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,700
Did you skip dinner again?

502
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,540
I wasn't hungry. I was waiting for you.

503
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,540
I brought back some noodles for you.

504
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,540
You should put that aside.

505
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,940
Let's have dinner together.

506
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,500
You're wasting your money again.

507
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,460
They don't cost

508
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,420
that much.

509
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,420
Let me finish this first.

510
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,300
-Let's eat first.
-Okay.

511
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:26,940
Try this.

512
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,460
I heard from my colleagues

513
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,940
that this restaurant was pretty good.

514
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:36,500
Here.

515
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,180
Other kids are enjoying themselves

516
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,940
after the college entrance exam.

517
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,380
But my son has to do two jobs

518
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,220
right after the exam.

519
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,460
And you work from morning until night.

520
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,940
It's because I'm young.

521
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,380
Young people should endure more hardships.

522
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:56,900
By the way, Mom,

523
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,380
I told

524
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,540
my boss

525
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,700
about the advance.

526
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,100
But he told me

527
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:03,820
that I could only take

528
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,020
half a month's worth as I'm a newcomer.

529
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,180
But that's fine.

530
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,700
I'll think of something else.

531
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,380
Just let me handle this.

532
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,980
I'll try to borrow money from our relatives.

533
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,820
You should stop borrowing money from them.

534
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:14,940
I'm serious.

535
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,780
Mom, I have something to tell you.

536
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,420
What is it?

537
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,380
After giving it some thought,

538
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,260
I think I won't attend university in Nanwu.

539
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,380
Right now, earning money is more important.

540
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:32,740
That won't do.

541
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,700
You have to attend university.

542
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:36,660
You see,

543
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,380
our family is in huge debt.

544
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,580
There's no need for me to attend university.

545
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,860
I will work in the morning

546
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,260
and do part-time jobs

547
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,020
at night.

548
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,700
We'll be able to repay the debt eventually.

549
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:48,540
You mustn't

550
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,700
let our mistakes

551
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,260
affect your future.

552
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,340
But you know that...

553
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:54,940
No buts.

554
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,100
You have to attend university.

555
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,540
If not,

556
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,020
don't call me Mom.

557
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,500
Mom, what's wrong?

558
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,340
I'm fine. Maybe it's because I skipped dinner.

559
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,380
My tummy

560
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,140
is protesting.

561
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,140
How many times have I told you this?

562
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,820
You can't just skip your meals.

563
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,380
I'll get you some water.

564
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:34,860
Mom, time to eat.

565
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,180
Are you done with the discharging procedures?

566
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,620
You're not going to be discharged.

567
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,980
What are you doing?

568
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,740
Sit down and rest.

569
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,540
