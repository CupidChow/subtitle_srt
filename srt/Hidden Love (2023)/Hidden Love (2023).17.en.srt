What are you doing, Duan Jiaxu?

19
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,220
What did you call me?

20
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:30,660
I mean,

21
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,740
what were you doing?

22
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,860
Given our current relationship,

23
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,180
I don't think it's right for you

24
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,020
to call me Duan Jiaxu.

25
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,460
You...

26
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,420
I wasn't asleep just now.

27
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,660
I know what you were doing.

28
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,340
So, you weren't asleep?

What was I doing then?

Tell me.

Lean closer.
I don't want to say it out loud.

32
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,220
Closer.

33
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,100
You want to whisper it into my ear?

34

I don't know

47

That means you were

48
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,140

Well...

You took advantage of me first.

00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,500
that no matter what I do to you,

53
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,060
you will do the same to me?

54
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,620
That's not what I meant.

Yes.

96
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,580
He's attracting attention.

97
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,740
I think it's because

98
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,300
he bailed on Sang a few times before,

99
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,260
so this time

100
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,180
he came specifically to make it up to her.

101
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:52,980

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,580
I didn't.

107
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,940
I had no one to walk with me.
Why would I do it?

108
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,740
Didn't my brother take walks with you?

109
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,100
Your brother takes walks with me?

110
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,740
Am I that desperate?

111
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,580
I'm going to tell him you said that.

112
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,700

You're here to watch the basketball game too?

128
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,940
He said he wants to check it out.

129
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,180
Look at Chen Qiang.

130
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:49,940

141
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,380
Are you okay?

142
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,100
Did you sprain your ankle?

143
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:08,820
Yes.

144
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,460
Lift your leg.

It's okay.

150
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,020
This is an old injury.

151
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,180
I'll get better after I get some rest.

152

Get some rest.

00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,380
Please hold this for me.

164
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,900
Wait here for me.

165
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,780
You will defend him.

166
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,020
He's pretty good.

He's perfect.

Are you going home or traveling?

203

I'm not going home for the break.

during the summer break either.

231

is better than spending time at home.

235
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,180
Agreed.

00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,460

The power is out.

763
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,980
There's nowhere to study.

764
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,220
Why didn't you tell me?

765
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,900
I was just about to go to the library.

766
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,100
The library you mentioned,

767
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,900
the one nearby, I know it.

768
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,340
It has very limited seating.

769
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,860
By now, all the seats would've been taken already.

770
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,340
Then...

771
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,820
There is a cafe ahead.

772
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,540
Let's go to my place.

773
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,980
Your place?

774
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,700
To study.

775
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:20,940
You haven't had lunch, right?

776
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,260
Perfect.

777
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,780
I'll make something delicious for you later.

778
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,380
You can cook too?

779
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,100
I got a lot of skills, you know.

780
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,660
Like what?

781
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,940
Like...

782
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,260
Change into slippers.

783
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,380
You can study

784
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,500
in my room later.

785
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,380
There's a desk inside.

786
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:01,980
I...

787
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:03,980
I can

788
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,460
just study here.

789
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,380
No need to go to your room, actually.

790
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,220
I'll be cooking here later.

791
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,380
Aren't you worried

792
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,340
about me disturbing your studies?

793
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,260
What are you thinking?

794
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,020
I've already tidied up the desk for you.

795
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,860
Study well.

796
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:32,700
Jiaxu,

797
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,180
what will you be doing

798
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,500
while I study?

799
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,780
I'll

800
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,300
just be sitting here.

801
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,540
You'll be sitting here?

802
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,860
I want to look at you more.

803
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:23,820
Welcome.

804
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:24,780
Hi.

805
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:25,660
Hi.

806
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,620
Excuse me,

807
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,940
do you provide personalized cakes?

808
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,060
Yes, we do.

809
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,060
I have a picture.

810
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,940
Can you make something like this?

811
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,580
Yes, we can.

812
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,380
When would you like to have it?

813
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,340
Next Monday. Can you make it?

814
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:40,820
Yes, we can.

815
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,820
Let me take it down.

816
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,660
Miss, what's your surname?

817
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:49,940
Sang.

818
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,300
8-inch.

819
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,700
Miss, your phone is ringing.

820
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,780
Have you taken a photo?

821
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,740
Yes.

822
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:03,820
Hello, Mom.

823
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,220
Hello, Zhi.

824
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,100
I was outside just now.

825
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,060
I just got home.

826
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,420
Did you say something

827
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,260
about the recipe for longevity noodles?

828
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,260
Is someone celebrating his birthday?

829
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,660
It's Jiaxu's birthday.

830
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,620
Oh, it's Duan.

831
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:23,260
You know I'm studying in Yihe.

832
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:26,020
And Jiaxu has been taking care of me a lot,

833
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,500
and he's all alone here.

834
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,660
So,

835
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,140
I thought

836
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,900
of making him

837
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,540
longevity noodles.

838
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,340
But

839
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,460
I'm sure

840
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,140
you make the most delicious ones.

841
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,300
You're becoming more considerate.

842
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,820
All right, I'll write down

843
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,340
the recipe for longevity noodles

844
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,220
and send it to you later.

845
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,300
Okay.

846
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,380
Bye-bye.

847
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,460
Miss, here.

848
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,100
An 8-inch cake.

849
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,500
And you will collect it next Monday.

850
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,140
Will you be picking it up yourself?

851
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:01,620
Yes.

852
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:02,420
Okay.

853
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,780
Okay, the order is made.

854
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:04,500
