17
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,500
It's almost the curfew of my dorm now.

18
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,820
I'll make a move first.

19
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:57,820
Goodbye.

20
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,780
Next song.

21
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,340
Pass me the microphone.

22
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,180
Pass me the microphone, Ming.

23
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:00,740
The microphone is over there.

24
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,260
This is mine.

25
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,580
Jiang Ying?

26
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,780
How did you know I was here?

27
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,340
Wait.

28
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,380
Do you know

29
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,660
that his father is in a vegetative state?

30
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,220
I just don't want

31
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,420
a young girl like you to be led astray.

32
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,020
His father's hospital bill

33
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,540
costs

34
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,340
nearly 100,000 yuan per year.

35
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,340
No girl

36
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,700
has the time and money

37
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,060
to waste on him.

38
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,420
I do.

39
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,380
I have the time and money to waste on him.

40
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,980
If so, do you know

41
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,220
that his father killed someone while driving?

42
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,060
He's a murderer.

43
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,140
So? What has that got to do

44
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,140
with Duan Jiaxu?

45
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,140
Fine.

46
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,300
You can choose not to mind it.

47
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,060
However, your parents will never

48
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,260
agree to your relationship.

49
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,340
I don't need you to worry about that.

50
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,380
Don't tell me

51
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,660
you think he truly fancies you.

52
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:00,700
Duan Jiaxu

53
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,940
grew up without love

54
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,340
due to family reasons.

55
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,780
If anyone treats him well,

56
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,460
he'll think of it as love.

57
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,700
Do you treat him very nicely?

58
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,860
If you think he fancies you,

59
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,220
let me ask you this, then.

60
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,700
What does he like about you?

61
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,740
You may have fallen head over heels
in love with him.

62
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,820
But what if you want to break up with him?

63
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,220
Guess what he'll say?

64
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,420
You think

65
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,980
he's pretty sensible, huh?

66
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,580
In reality,

67
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,380
he won't even care.

68
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,060
He couldn't care less

69
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,580
about breaking up with you.

70
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,100
He can find

71
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,940
thousands of other girls like you.

72
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,380
I hit the nail on the head,

73
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:44,780
didn't I?

74
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,420
Let go.

75
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,300
Why do you think

76
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:46,820
I said this about him?

77
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,220
Why?

78
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,100
Let go.

79
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,180
His father

80
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,340
killed my father!

81
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,060
Would you turn into another me

82
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,580
if your family members

83
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,740
had experienced something like that?

84
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,460
I understand.

85
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,140
However, his father was the one

86
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,580
who made the mistake.

87
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,820
His father committed a crime.

88
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,380
He will bear legal responsibility.

89
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:18,780
He will...

90
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,020
Receive the punishment he deserves?

91
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,540
Did you know something?

92
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,700
His father

93
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,820
actually did a hit-and-run!

94
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,660
He was afraid of imprisonment.

95
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,340
He was afraid of accusations.

96
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,700
He tried to commit suicide.

97
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,580
But in the end?

98
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,900
His father didn't die.

99
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,500
My father died instead.

100
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,140
I was the one who was punished!

101
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,180
So you think Duan Jiaxu

102
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,740
has nothing to do with this incident,

103
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,660
don't you?

104
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,500
Jiang Ying.

105
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,260
Regarding the sin his father has committed,

106
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,140
Duan Jiaxu already tried to make up for it,

107
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:01,980
didn't he?

108
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,820
I know you're innocent.

109
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:05,900
But

110
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,700
isn't he innocent, too?

111
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,580
What has Duan Jiaxu

112
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,700
done wrong exactly?

113
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,140
You see,

114
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,020
this isn't an excuse for you to hurt him.

115
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,260
(His father)

116
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,340
(killed my father!)

117
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,780
So, you think Duan Jiaxu

118
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,340
has nothing to do with this incident,

119
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,220
don't you?

120
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,980
Would you turn into another me

121
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,580
if your family members

122
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,580
had experienced something like that?

123
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,580
(Let me tell you a secret.)

124
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,540
(I have)

125
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,020
(many debtors out there.)

126
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,220
Actually, those debts

127
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,780
aren't even mine.

128
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,020
That's why you don't need to repay them for me.

129
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,460
(So,)

130
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,120
(did she guilt-trip Jiaxu like this)

131
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,300
(in the past?)

132
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,220
Why are you drinking?

133
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,100
What's wrong?

134
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,060
Are you in a bad mood?

135
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,100
So,

136
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,420
did the gathering go well?

137
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,500
I bought some desserts for you.

138
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:50,940
It's bread.

139
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:53,940
Do you want to try it?

140
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,020
It's adorable.

141
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,180
Did something happen?

142
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,140
Why are you sitting by the riverside alone?

143
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,780
It's windy out here.

144
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,300
And you're taking beer.

145
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,460
Try it.

146
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,140
Is it nice?

147
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,260
The ears are nice.

148
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,060
Try the nose, then.

149
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:31,900
Here you go.

150
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,660
What do you mean by this?

151
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,180
I only bought you bread,

152
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,500
but you're giving me your bank card already?

153
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,940
There's 5,000 yuan on the card.

154
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,260
If my internship ends successfully,

155
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,420
I'll get another 3,000 yuan.

156
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,180
This way,

157
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,860
there'll be 8,000 yuan inside.

158
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,180
Why did you give me this out of the blue?

159
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,380
I just want to tell you

160
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,620
that I can be nice to you.

161
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,660
I can be nice to you for the rest of my life.

162
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,380
I'm serious.

163
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,700
So, our little Sang Zhi wants to take care

164
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,300
of me, huh?

165
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,180
Take this.

166
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:39,980
What?

167
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,740
The password to my card is your birthday.

168
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,780
You can use the money inside

169
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,420
to buy some beautiful dresses.

170
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,860
As for this card,

171
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,300
it's mine now.

172
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,580

173
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,140

175
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,260
So,

176
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:57,740
Boss,

177
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,980
what's your instruction?

178
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,060
I can satisfy all of your desires.

179
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,660
What?

180
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,180
I know I'm corny.

181
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,580
You finally admitted it, huh?

182
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,500
I was just joking.

183
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,660
Did you really think of me as corny?

184
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,500
Yeah.

185
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,300
Take it back.

186
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,740
It's useless even if you give it back.

187
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:28,740
I won't return

188
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,700
your card to you.

189
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,100
I didn't tell you to return it to me.

190
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,540

You gave it to me, and now,
you're telling me not to simply spend it?

195
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,940
Don't do that. You need to save up money.

373

It's inside.

Go now.

00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,820
You have to give your mother a video call, no?

383
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,740
It's not like you don't know who Jiaxu is.

384
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,700
It's not like

385

386
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,820
What do I know about his character, then?

It'll be fine.

Goodbye. Good night.

Of all the girls to woo,

How long have you two been seeing each other?

404
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,740
Two and a half months.

405
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,820
Do you even have a conscience?

406
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,340
You could've

407
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,900
dated a girl at her age

408
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,220
or even younger than her.

409
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,020
I wouldn't

410
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:23,980
object to it.

However, this is my sister we're talking about.

412

She knew you since junior high.

413
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,060
She thought of you as her elder brother.

414
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,740
How could you target her?

415
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,060
Last time,

416
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,540
I said I wanted to see you in Nanwu.

417
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,620
It was because of this.

418
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,420
This was indeed my fault.

419
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,660
Sorry, bro.

You can beat me up however you like.

Okay, Yan?

Don't call me that.

Are you sure that you're serious about it?

00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:31,980
What are you doing?

569
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,980
This is a restaurant.

570
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:33,820
What are you doing?

571
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,700
Why did you beat him up?

572
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,500
Why can't I beat him up?

573
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,220
I would've called the cops on you

574
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,020
if I were there last night.

575
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,380
I would tell the cops

576
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,140
to arrest you.

577
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:43,820
Go ahead, then.

578
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,020
Call the cops on me if you dare.

579
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,060
I'm going to cut ties with you.

580
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,020
You're done for.

581
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,700
From now on,

582
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,100
you're no longer my elder brother.

583
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,340
Wait.

584
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,420
Sang Zhi.

585
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:37,780
Is she okay?

586
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:38,980
She's fine.

587
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,420
She went to the washroom.

588
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,980
Did you dote on her too much?

589
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,620
Her temper

590
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,660
is getting worse.

591
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,380
Listen.

592
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,300
Don't try to stop me later.

593
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,980
I have to teach her a lesson today.

594
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:53,980
I have to stop you.

595
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,180
Why are you holding it against

596
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,060
a young girl like her?

597
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:57,780
Cut it out.

598
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,420
Bro,

599
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,140
tell me when you're free.

600
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,500
Why?

601
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,820
So that you can give me another beating.

602
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,100
To be honest,

603
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,500
my girlfriend

604
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,300
defended me just now.

605
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,380
I was pretty touched.

606
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,500
Sit.

607
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,420
Do you know how old you are?

608
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,380
You actually said
you were cutting ties with me, huh?

609
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:24,980
If so, from now on,

610
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:25,900
I'll sever my ties with you.

611
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,100
Sure.

612
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,580
Sever it if you can.

613
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,420
Excuse me.

614
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,860
Sorry for the interruption.

615
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,620
I'm starving. Can we order something first?

616
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,300
I already made the order.

617
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,140
You only started dating not long ago,

618
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,180
yet you're siding with some outsider right now,

619
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,820
huh?

620
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,620
Sang Yan.

621
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,980
Sang Zhi.

622
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,500
Don't you know how to communicate reasonably?

623
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,420
You were born with a mouth.

624
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,700
Can't you talk things over?

625
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,420
Must you get physical?

626
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,660
You want me to be reasonable?

627
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,300
I never resolve issues

628
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,700
with a wishy-washy method like that.

629
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,500
I'm not like you.

630
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,220
You never understand what I'm saying

631
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,420
even when I tell you every day.

632
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,460
What do you mean

633
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,180
by that?

634
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,100
Since when did I not

635
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,340
understand you?

636
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,340
I...

637
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,660
I can't imagine

638
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,620
how other people can get along

639
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,860
with you.

640
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,660
You're truly annoying.

641
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,500
Miss,

642
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,180
I was having a fight with my buddy.

643
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,100
That's none of your business.

644
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,380
That's none of my business?

645
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,500
So you don't think you're at fault

646
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,420
for beating him up?

647
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,300
Sang Zhi, calm down.

648
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,380
So you think being violent is okay?

649
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:43,980
Have some water.

650
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,900
Sang Zhi, here.

651
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:47,660
Sang Zhi,

652
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,140
calm down.

653
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,820
Why are you arguing with your brother?

654
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,300
You know

655
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,020
his character well enough.

656
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,380
I'm not trying to argue with him.

657
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,580
Just listen to him.

658
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,220
He doesn't think that he's at fault here.

659
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,220
Look at his lips.

660
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,300
I did that to him.

661
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,900
I also gave him a beating.

662
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,500
But he started the fight first,

663
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,020
am I right?

664
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:09,860
So,

665
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,900
it was self-defense.

666
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,620
That's not true.

667
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,500
Last night,

668
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,620
he stood there motionlessly

669
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,420
and let me beat him up.

670
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,020
So we're already even.

671
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,620
Wait, why did you beat him up?

672
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,020
Are both of you this childish?

673
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:25,860
Can't you two talk this over?

674
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,100
Must you two fight?

675
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,460
Why did you fight?

676
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,360
Can't you try to reason with him?

677
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,220
I guess the little demon still has a conscience.

678
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,220
Tell him.

679
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,300
Teach him how to reason.

680
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:38,900
I'll eat first.

681
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,260
Let's eat.

682
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,060
You must be starving.

683
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,540
So, did you two

684
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,580
treat your wound?

685
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,100
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

686
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,540
I think there's a bruise here.

687
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:54,980
Does it hurt?

688
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,180
Nope.

689
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,940
It's much better now.

690
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,260
I don't think so.

691
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,460
I think it still hurts.

692
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,380
His bruise is more serious.

693
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,180
Look at him.

694
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,900
Someone is doting on Duan Jiaxu now.

695
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,620
Younger sisters

696
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,300
are useless indeed.

697
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,660
I would rather get a girlfriend.

698
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,300
At least my girlfriend will care about me

699
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,620
and feel sorry for me.

700
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,620
Do you want some water?

701
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:33,900
No.

702
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,820
Since you're in Yihe,

703
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,140
any places you want to visit?

704
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,820
I'm busy for the next few days.

705
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,540
I need to work.

706
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,540
I can keep you company during the weekends.

707
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,980
I'm here to visit my brother.

708
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,300
I don't need your company.

709
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,940
I want my brother to keep me company.

710
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,340
I'll keep you company.

711
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,300
But I have to

712
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,740
bring my girlfriend with me.

713
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,060
Suit yourself.

714
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,700
I'll bring her with me, then.

715
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:06,820
Try this shrimp.

716
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,380
I want some shrimp, too.

717
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,540
Are you a bandit?

718
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,420
Aren't you a bandit yourself?

719
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,140
You're so annoying.

720
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,340
Try this.

721
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,100
Enough already.

722
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,500
Stop peeling it for her.

723
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,540
Who are you guys

724
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,060
trying to show off to?

725
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,140
It's not like I'm peeling it for you.

726
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,140
Is it nice?

727
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,740
It's nice, right?

728
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,300
It's delicious.

729
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,740
Enough already. Just stop.

730
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,740
Do you want to take a bath?

731
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:11,540
Later.

732
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,660
Don't you have another pair of slippers?

733
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,300
What a nutcase.

734
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:42,980
Did you find out

735
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:43,620
about my appendicitis

736
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,580
some time ago?

737
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:45,980
Yeah.

738
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:47,900
Did you kick me on purpose?

739
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,740
You'll be fine after that kick.

740
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,700
Look at you.

741
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,940
You should've watched where you were hitting me.

742
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,540
How can I

743
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,140
explain my bruise

744
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,140
to her tomorrow?

745
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,580
It's useless even if you apply the ointment to it.

746
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,140
She'll still see it tomorrow.

747
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,420
What a spoiled brat.

748
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:11,420
You do have a point.

749
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:13,740
If the little demon

750
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:14,940
sees you like this tomorrow,

751
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,100
she'll definitely say that I bullied you.

752
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,020
What about this?

753
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,500
You know me.

754
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,580
I'm a fair person.

755
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,620
Come on. Punch me.

756
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,780
I've never punched someone before.

757
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:33,940
I don't know how to do it.

758
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:36,900
Just punch me already.

759
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:37,860
Stop hesitating.

760
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,580
I have no idea how to.

761
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,180
Stand up.

762
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,380
Let's make this quick.

763
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,100
Are you okay?

764
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:00,060
I told you I don't know how to fight.

765
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,020
Here, put on some ointment.

766
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,140
I'm not

767
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:05,980
as fragile as you.

768
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,300
Put on some ointment.

769
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:08,980
No, thanks.

770
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,460
Do you want me to do it for you?

771
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:14,980
Hurry up.

772
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,260
As expected of you.

773
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,220
Here.

774
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,180
Don't be so fragile. You're a man.

775
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:47,220
All right.

776
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:48,460
Come on.

777
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,580
Do it yourself.

778
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,820
Here are your towel, clothes, and toothbrush.

779
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,940
I need to work tomorrow.

780
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:24,740
I'll go to sleep first.

781
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,300
Tell me if you need anything.

782
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,980
Wait, where should I sleep?

783
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,340
Don't tell me you want your guest

784
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,140
to sleep on the couch?

785
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:41,660
Duan Jiaxu!

786
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:42,860
Duan Jiaxu!

787
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:45,500
What?

788
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:46,860
You should be the one

789
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:47,940
