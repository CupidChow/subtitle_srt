00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,020
of everyone working together

192
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,620
in joined efforts.

193
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,420
Previously,

194
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,460
all I needed to do

195
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,860
was obey your arrangements

196
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,940
and work accordingly.

197
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,180
I didn't have to think about anything else.

198
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,620
But after going through this case,

199
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,380
I realized that coordinating the work

200
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,260
of so many people

201
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,060
could be quite challenging.

202
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,660
You did very well, though.

203
00:08:59,460 --> 00:08:59,940
Anyway,

204
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,340
I still want to thank you.

205
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,460
Siyun, Xun,

206
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,860
thanks for giving me this chance.

207
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,660
He has grown up.

208
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,020
Do you know

209
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,500
about his greatest virtue?

210
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,660
He's modest.

211
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,060
Now, you trust my judgment, huh?

212
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,460
I've brought back such a talent

213
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,740
to Yihe.

214
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:17,940
Duan,

215
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,820
we have something to tell you too.

216
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,700
You know

217
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,420
our former chief programmer left

218
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,780
and his position

219
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,660
has been vacant.

220
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,100
Xun and I have been discussing this lately,

221
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,340
and we want to recommend you

222
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,740
for this position in our company.

223
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,780
But we still need to apply

224
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,500
with the headquarters.

225
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,580
Do you think

226
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,940
you're up for it?

227
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,100
But my...

228
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,300
My credentials...

229
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,820
Credentials don't represent one's capabilities.

230
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,340
We both believe in you.

231
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,380
However,

232
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,740
it's not finalized yet.

233
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,580
We have to wait for approval
from the headquarters.

234
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:51,820
Anyway,

235
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,900
I don't think there should be any major issues.

236
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,020
Wait for our good news.

237
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,580
Okay.

238
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:57,860
In this case,

239
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,260
let me thank you in advance.

240
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,140
No need to thank us.

241
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,420
You've been occupied with work for so long.

242
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,140
What's your plan after this?

243
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,620
I plan

244
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,740
to make it up

245
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,740
to my girlfriend.

246
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,980
I want to take her for a holiday.

247
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,340
That's a good idea.

248
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,580
Do you want me

249
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,300
to give you some ideas?

250
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,500
Don't give him any lousy ideas.

251
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,340
They're young guys in love.

252
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,980
Your old-fashioned ideas

253
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,060
wouldn't be helpful.

254
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,220
Wait, does age matter in love?

255
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:23,700
What?

256
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,140
Ah.

257
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:27,940
Yes, it does.

258
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,940
I'll leave you alone, guys in love.

259
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,220
To pamper your girl,

260
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,500
just buy the best for her.

261
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,180
It has the Dream Castle!

262
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,060
But I played this when I was a kid.

263
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:46,980
That's fine.

264
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,420
It also has

265
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,620
the biggest carousel

266
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,980
in Yihe.

267
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,700
It'll make me dizzy.

268
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,740
If you find

269
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,020
these rides too boring,

270
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,340
it also has...

271
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,500
Look, here.

272
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,060
More thrilling rides.

273
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,580
I'll get scared.

274
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,460
Then have a look at this hotel.

275
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:13,900
I found it online.

276
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,060
It has a very high rating.

277
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,860
All residents gave positive feedback.

278
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,780
A high ratio of regular guests.

279
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,100
The most important thing is

280
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,580
that it's very close to the amusement park.

281
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,660
Whenever you feel tired,

282
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,180
we can go back to the hotel for some rest.

283
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,900
I don't think I'll get tired.

284
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,260
In this case, staying in this hotel

285
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,380
would be a waste.

286
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:40,900
Wait.

287
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,900
Do you not like

288
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,060
this amusement park

289
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,860
or do you not like

290
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,420
this hotel?

291
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,300
I like neither.

292
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:52,900
Actually,

293
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,180
it's not that I find camping a bad idea.

294
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,900
My main concern is

295
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,340
that a campsite

296
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,460
usually has many insects,

297
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,020
and maybe some venomous snakes.

298
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,620
I'm more worried

299
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,620
about how you wash up there.

300
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:05,820
What's worse,

301
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,660
if it suddenly starts raining at the campsite,

302
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:08,980
there won't be any shelters.

303
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,020
I don't want you to have a hard time.

304
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,420
Then have you considered this?

305
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,740
If we're going

306
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,260
to the places you've planned,

307
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,460
To get there,

308
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,940
we have to pay for the fuel.

309
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,980
Then when we reach there,

310
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,820
we have to buy tickets to the amusement park.

311
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,820
Food and drinks in it

312
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,180
cost money, too.

313
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,540
And just now,

314
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,060
you showed me

315
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,860
the package for two.

316
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:30,540
It...

317
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,380
It doesn't have much to offer.

318
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,700
Why is it so expensive?

319
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,900
And this hotel...

320
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,140
I don't think it's even necessary.

321
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,380
We just moved into this new flat.

322
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,860
If we spend money

323
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,020
on such things,

324
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:43,620
then...

325
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,940
So it's not

326
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,300
that you dislike those places,

327
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,420
but that you don't want me to waste money.

328
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,460
That's not true.

329
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,420
I...

330
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,260
I never wanted to go.

331
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,500
I truly want to go camping.

332
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,180
Why can't we just go?

333
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,060
I've already planned it.

334
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,060
Look at all these things

335
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,460
I've prepared.

336
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,540
Mosquito repellent,

337
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,660
ambiance lights,

338
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,780
tissues, wet wipes, garbage bags,

339
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,540
cards, board games,

340
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,060
bouquets, flower baskets, and the bubble blower.

341
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,300
All kinds of things for the camping,

342
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,580
I've got them ready.

343
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,540
Then why can't we go?

344
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,740
Such a thorough preparation, huh?

345
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,620
It's our first time camping.

346
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,860
Of course, I need to prepare

347
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,660
as many things as I can.

348
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,220
It's always better to be prepared.

349
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,180
And imagine this.

350
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,260
We'll bring

351
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,860
all these items with us.

352
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:41,980
There, we can

353
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,540
set up the tent together,

354
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,580
and put up small chairs

355
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,180
and a table.

356
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,740
Then we'll sit there.

357
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,300
Feels great, doesn't it?

358
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,180
After that, we can hear the sound of the waves

359
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,660
as we enjoy the sea breeze.

360
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,060
We'll wait for the sunset

361
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,180
and watch the sunrise.

362
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,500
At night,

363
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,020
there will be many stars,

364
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,980
filling the sky.

365
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
The most important thing is

366
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,060
that it will be just the two of us.

367
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,740
♪A fairy tale about the fallen Milky Way♪

368
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,140
If we go to the amusement park,

369
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,300
it'll be noisy.

370
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,940
But if we go camping,

371
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,940
it'll be just the two of us.

372
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,860
I think

373
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,900
♪Every inch of the wound is softly veiled
within the halo's radiance♪

374
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,700
it'll be very romantic.

375
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,420
What you just said

376
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,340
seems to tempt me.

377
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,340
Then beach camping.

378
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,220
We'll do that.

379
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:48,980
Really?

380
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,420
Tomorrow morning,

381
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,060
at seven o'clock,

382
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,380
we will set out together.

383
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,420
I'll get up at six o'clock

384
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,340
to pack.

385
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,220
Wait, I'll make it at five.

386
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:55,540
What?

387
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,380
I'll wake you up at four.

388
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,460
Seven o'clock?

389
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,300
So early?

390
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,380
Is it?

391
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,540
I don't even plan to sleep tonight, OK?

392
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,460
I need to check

393
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,620

396
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,300
was ruined just like this.

397
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,940

402
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,620

411
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,340
We'll screw from beneath.

Why does it look like

430
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,460
you're in a tent?

00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:51,980
You're right.

432
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,660
I'm camping.

433
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,340
It's so comfortable.

434
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,540
You're camping?

435

Where is she?

440
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:03,940

446
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,380
We were supposed to go camping

447
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,660
by the beach today.

448
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,700
But it rained.

449
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,540
So we're camping

450
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,060

Me?

458
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,140
I'll reverse the camera, okay?

459
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,700
I'm doing it now.

460
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,980
Can you see it?

461
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,060
Look.

462
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,020
Look.

463

Out there, it's...

464
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,260
It's raining.

465
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,060
Can you see it?

466
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,740
It's raining.

467
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,620
This is the tent.

468
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,820
The tent we set up.

469
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,140
Over here is the dining room.

470
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,020
Can you see it?

471
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,500
That's the kitchen.

472
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,660
This is the kitchen.

473
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,180
Right over here.

474
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,260
The rooms are over there.

475
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,900

479
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,740
I accidentally tripped

480
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,420
over some equipment.

481
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,500
Be careful.

482
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,580
Are you sure it was the equipment

483
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,780
instead of something worse?

484
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,020
Yan, I wasn't talking to you.

485
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,340
So don't speak.

486
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,140
Don't be mean.

487
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,340

488
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,740
your camping in the flat

489
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,460
reminds me of when I was a child

490
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,220
and used to set up a tent

491
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,140
in the living room.

492
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,260
It felt so safe.

493
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,340
Is it fun?

494
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,420
Yes, it's fun.

495
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,060
If you also want to have fun,

496
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,460
you can

497
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,260
set up one in the garden.

498

501
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,140

503
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,460
misses you and talks about you

504
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,700
all the time.

505
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,460

506
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,980

okay?

510
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,780
So you can be closer to me.

511
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,060
I won't think about it

512
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,460
until I graduate.

513
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,420
It's too early to think now.

514
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,260
Then you should

515
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,660
get back to what you were doing.

516
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,620
And we're going

517
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,780

522
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:43,660

Guys,

553
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,940
did you see the campus's announcement?

554
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,580
What?

555
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,260
Yihe University Design Competition.

556
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,060
I didn't see it.

557
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,060
Did you?

558
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,300
What do you think?

559
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,900
I think it's quite convincing.

560
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,020
And the prestige is high this year.

561
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,660
Many companies are participating.

562
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,300

563
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,020
Are you interested?

564
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,420

565
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,500
to gain some competition experience

566
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,580
and regardless of whether I get in

567
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,820

568
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,700

00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,740
That's exactly what I think.

574
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:05,580
Sang,

575
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,060
I'm so impressed with you.

576
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,260
How can your left and right brains

577
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,540
function so evenly?

578
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,540
One is for love,

579
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,420
and the other is for career.

580
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,740
Sang isn't like you,

581
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,540
a simple love creature.

582
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,980
Me? I'm not like that.

583
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,260
Then...

584
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,020
Of course, I'll take part.

585
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,420
I came back just to tell you guys about it.

586
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:26,660
Ning Wei,

587
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:27,740
you...

588
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,300
Forget it.

589
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,100
Wang,

590
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,340
will you be in?

591
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,180
I...

592
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,660
I won't.

593
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,820
I'll take part next year.

594
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,260
That's fine too.

595
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,180
It's just both of us, then.

596
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:45,780
-Let's sign up.
-Let's sign up.

597
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:46,900
Hurry.

598
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,660
Is it the official website?

599
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,580
Yes, the university's website.

600
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,660
Where we can sign up.

601
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,500
Wang,

602
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,500
why did you want to see me?

603
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,540
To give you something.

604
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:00,940
Here.

605
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,060
What's this?

606
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,460
It's an edited version of your interview.

607
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,300
Thank you.

608
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,500
I'll watch it.

609
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,340
It's nothing.

610
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:10,820
By the way,

611
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,260
did you submit your assignment?

612
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,340
Thank you for accepting my interview.

613
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:16,980
Well,

614
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,940
if you don't mind, I'll go for the training.

615
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,260
Can you wait for a while?

616
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,300
I have something to tell you.

617
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,700
Actually,

618
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,020
I like you.

619
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,460
Ever since our first meeting

620
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,100
when you helped me out,

621
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,260
I've got feelings for you.

622
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,700
And as we spent more time together,

623
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,660
I started to like you more and more.

624
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:47,740
I...

625
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:48,420
I...

626
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,820
You don't have to rush to answer me.

627
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,540
I just want to tell you

628
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,620
how I feel.

629
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,540
I admire you a lot

630
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,220
and really like you.

631
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,940
So don't feel pressured.

632
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:00,860
We will still

633
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,340
be good friends,

634
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,500
right?

635
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:12,820
That's all.

636
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,180
I'll go now.

637
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,180
Okay.

638
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,180
I confessed my love.

639
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,860
What's so hard about it?

640
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,580
What's wrong, Sang?

641
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,020
Maybe I'm expecting

642
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,060
too many themes.

643
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,500
I still haven't figured out

644
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,100
what I should really do.

645
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,300
It's okay.

646
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,180
Take your time to think.

647
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,420
You can search

648
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,420
through other materials,

649
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,660
books, that sort of thing,

650
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,660
just for inspiration.

651
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,020
What about you?

652
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:00,620
Me?

653
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,300
I'm working

654
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,660
on "The Century's Star Wars."

655
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,660
That's cool.

656
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,780
Not bad, huh?

657
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,140
I've been planning it

658
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,340
for a long time.

659
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,540
It's a prequel story for a game

660
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,060
I want to design in the future.

661
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,980
I'm quite confident about it.

662
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,140
Sounds good.

663
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,380
I'll get back to thinking, then.

664
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,940
If you don't have any ideas,

665
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:27,780
don't push yourself.

666
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,260
We still have time, right?

667
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,620
During the National Day holiday,

668
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,020
go back home and relax.

669
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,140
Maybe inspiration will come then.

670
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,420
Get back to your idea.

671
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,620
I'm already in the car.

672
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,780
I remember someone said

673
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,260
he would not pick me up.

674
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,580
And he also said

675
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,460
he didn't want to see me.

676
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,500
Ask Duan Jiaxu

677
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,620
if there's something wrong with him!

678
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,260
Why?

679
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,220
This morning,

680
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,620
he called me three times.

681
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,290
I silenced my phone

682
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,340
but he ordered a takeout for me.

683
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,900
Do you know what was written on it?

684
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,820
The remark said,

685
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,340
"My boyfriend is weak.

686
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,740
Please make sure he gets up to eat,

687
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,540
or the consequences will be dire.

688
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,300
Thank you."

689
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,820
I was speechless.

690
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,100
Maybe he just wanted you to get up

691
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,740
and have breakfast.

692
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,940
It's healthy for you.

693
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,220
He better be.

694
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,660
But I can understand his concern.

695
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,420
He's just worried

696
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,900
that no one would pick his girlfriend up.

697
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,900
If he was so worried about you,

698
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,460
why did he

699
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,260
trouble me

700
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,180
instead of coming back with you?

701
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,420
He's very busy.

702
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,180
Otherwise,

703
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:53,980
he would be coming back with me.

704
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:54,700
Listen.

705
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,180
I want you to text him

706
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,740
and say "Just you wait."

707
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,140
Why?

708
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,300
What do you want to do?

709
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,820
I'm going to beat him up.

710
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,260
I'm driving here.

711
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,340
Stay still, will you?

712
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,060
Nuisance.

713
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,180
Oh, no. I'm dead.

714
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,940
What's... What's wrong?

715
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,100
I can't believe I forgot about this.

716
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:20,740
What is it?

717
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,700
Give me the route.

718
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,330
The crispy duck with yam paste you want...

719
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,260
I forgot to buy it.

720
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,780
I thought it was something serious.

721
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:26,220
Hey,

722
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,380
tell me the route.

723
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,180
I can just don't eat it today.

724
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:29,820
No way.

725
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,460
Then Mom will scold me again!

726
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:32,940
Give me the route.

727
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,540
We'll go and buy some now.

728
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,780
Send me home first.

729
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,140
Then you go and buy it.

730
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,860
You've been fussing with your camera for two days.

731
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:53,940
Do you know how to use it?

732
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,540
I need to get the hang of it.

733
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,460
When Zhi comes back,

734
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,540
I'll take you two out for fun

735
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,940
and take beautiful pictures.

736
00:28:59,260 --> 00:28:59,780
Come on, dear.

737
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,340
Look at me.

738
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,180
One, two, three.

739
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,260
Pretty.

740
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,620
Try another pose.

741
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,980
Another pose?

742
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,740
Okay. One, two, three.

743
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,340
Gorgeous.

744
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,260
How about this?

745
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,820
Okay.

746
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,180
You showed up out of nowhere.

747
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,420
You freaked me out.

748
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,300
I just wanted to give you a surprise.

749
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,660
Dad, did you get a new camera?

750
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,260
Yes.

751
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,860
He just bought it.

752
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:27,340
How about a triple shot?

753
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:27,940
-Okay.
-All right.

754
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,460
-One.
-Okay.

755
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,220
One.

756
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,140
Okay, two.

757
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,100
Give me a different pose.

758
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:32,980
Okay.

759
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,460
And another one.

760
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,060
I'm so happy.

761
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:37,940
Beautiful ladies.

762
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:39,620
Where's your brother?

763
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,740

00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,300
I'm quite understanding,

956
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:58,980
right?

957
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,060
Mom!

958
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,820
What's your problem?

959
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,220
I want to tell Mom

960
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:05,940
not to make you dinner.

961
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,180
What the heck!

962
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,820
I'll go get ready, then.

963
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,340
Okay, you have two minutes.

964
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:16,500
Three minutes.

965
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,620
Three minutes at most.

966
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:19,980
You're so slow.

967
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,180
Fine, five minutes!

968
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,660
I'll wait for you downstairs.

969
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:28,340
♪Sunshine, rainbow, and white horse♪

970
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,100

971
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,100
♪Di-da♪

972
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,820
Can you tone it down a little?

973
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,980
Stop smiling like a fool.

974
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:58,780
Yan,

975
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,980
please focus on driving.

976
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,180
Just don't mind me, okay?

977
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,460
I don't understand

978
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,180
what's going on

979
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,700
in Duan Jiaxu's mind.

980
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,300
We'll eat with a bunch of guys.

981
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,500
But he insists on taking you along.

982
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,980
You didn't want to take me out for dinner.

983
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,220
And he didn't, either.

984
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,700
Is it wrong for me to have dinner?

985
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:14,620
It's not that.

986
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,460
Don't you feel awkward eating

987
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,500
with some people you don't know?

988
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:18,980
No.

989
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,700
People always say

990
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,500
others will feel awkward

991
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,340
if I don't.

992
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,300
You're right.

993
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,380
I'm the one feeling awkward.

994
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,300
That's great.

995
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,060
In my senior year,

996
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,780
I remember

997
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,420
you pretentiously said,

998
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,580
"I want to help you move into the new dorm.

999
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,660
Or I would feel really bad."

1000
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:36,940
You insisted on going.

1001
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,500
Now I finally understand.

1002
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,660
Stop pretending!

1003
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,140
I don't remember doing that.

1004
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,660
And there was one time

1005
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,980
when our parents were not at home,

1006
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,140
you insisted on joining us for hot pot.

1007
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,460
Duan Jiaxu and I

1008
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,620
even went to buy sanitary pads for you.

1009
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,980
It wasn't me who insisted on going that time,

1010
00:39:59,220 --> 00:39:59,900
-but you...
-That time...

1011
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,700
It was you, indeed.

1012
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,220
No, it wasn't!

1013
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,340
You insisted on taking me

1014
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,100
to eat hot pot.

1015
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:04,580
No, I didn't!

1016
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,780
You wanted to go!

1017
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,820
I didn't!

1018
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,860
You did!

1019
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,100
Do you think

1020
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:10,860
it's appropriate for you

1021
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:11,660
to discuss sanitary pads with me?

1022
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,580
Focus on driving

1023
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,620
and stop talking, OK?

1024
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,700
When you were little, you called him Jiaxu.

1025
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,420
Come on.

1026
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,460
You sounded closer to him than me.

1027
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,540
You just don't love me at all.

1028
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,660
I was being polite.

1029
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,180
And I was being respectful, understand?

1030
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,580
Then why weren't you being polite to me?

1031
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,500
And why weren't you being respectful?

1032
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,620
I love you.

1033
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,460
Are you sleepy?

1034
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,020
I'll have the sleeping bag ready.

1035
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,340
Come on,

1036
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,620
let's get some sleep.

1037
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,180
Which one do you want to sleep in?

1038
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:50,860
This one.

1039
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,140
I'll turn off the light, then.

1040
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,300
Good night.

1041
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,900
During the National Day holiday,

1042
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,780
I'll go back to Nanwu with you.

1043
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,060
You are?

1044
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,260
