The first one?

210
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,710
How do you want to celebrate?

211
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,870
I want

212
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,040
to eat well, have fun, and then party.

213
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,870

She's my best friend, Xu.

She works in a foreign company's

224
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,680
She happened to be eating nearby today.

225
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,440
So I asked her

226
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,440
to join us.

227
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,710

Isn't he handsome?

231
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,750
He is indeed handsome.

232
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,920

We know you don't drink.

00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,710
Thanks, bro.

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,920
that

252
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,080
we just dueted?

253
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,830
It's called

254
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,350
"It's like falling into a sea of love."

255
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:15,990
Ah, yes. That's the one.

No, I don't like it.

Hurry up and sing and dance for me.

288
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,530
Go quickly.

289
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,490
Hurry up.

00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,700
Wei, happy birthday!

291
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,770
Happy birthday!

292
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,340
I'm going outside for some fresh air.

293
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,220
I'll be right back.

294
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,250
Okay.

295
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,770
Sang Zhi?

296
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,010
Did you start smoking?

297
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,050
I don't smoke. That's not mine.

298
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,140
I clearly saw it fall

299
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,460
from you.

300
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,330
You've learned all the bad stuff.

301
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,810
I'm confiscating it.

302
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,220
No.

303
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,180
I told you

304
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,180
it belongs to my friend.

305
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,330
They may have misplaced it.

306
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,770
If you don't return it to me...

307
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,770
You even drink.

308
00:17:58,730 --> 00:17:59,660
Just a little.

309
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,290
I'll put the rest aside.

310
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,770
It's been so long, and you didn't even greet me.

311
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,090
Jia... Jiaxu.

312
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,180
Did you come here to have fun?

313
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,180
My roommate is celebrating her birthday.

314
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,290
When did the military training end?

315
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,900
It ended in mid-September last month.

316
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,140
There were seven days of holiday for National Day.

317
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,250
Why didn't you come and look for me?

318
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,250
I had classes.

319
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,460
You had classes during the holidays?

320
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,330
My mistake.

321
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:37,570
I went for a part-time job.

322
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:39,860
I see, part-time job.

323
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:41,330
Yeah.

324
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,250
I used to have part-time jobs too.

325
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,250
Other than working part-time,

326
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,660
I had to meet your teacher,

327
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,900
do your homework,

328
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,140
and send you to school.

329
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,330
Ungrateful thing.

330
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,810
This kiddo has no conscience at all.

331
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,730
Well, it was okay.

332
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:02,940
Jiaxu,

333
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,090
you were in your fourth year.

334
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,460
I'm only in my first year.

335
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,490
Maybe I'm just

336
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,730
a little busier than you.

337
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,810
Are you attacking my age now?

338
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:13,770
Sang Zhi,

339
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,860
take a moment and reflect.

340
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,050
What exactly

341
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:17,620
did I do wrong to you?

342
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,860
I never said that.

343
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:21,900
Also,

344
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,090
I'm a grown-up now.

345
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,220
If you keep calling me a "kiddo,"

346
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:30,900
don't you think

347
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,010
it's a little

348
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,530
awkward?

349
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,940
How much can you grow?

350
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,620
You're still a kiddo.

351
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:44,530
Yes.

352
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,090
I'm still a kid.

353
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,460
Two years...

354
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,530
After two years,

355
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,490
you've indeed grown older

356
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,620
and weathered.

357
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,290
Sang Zhi,

358
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,140
check your phone and see

359
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,050
how many messages I sent you.

360
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:04,810
You didn't reply even once.

361
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:05,900
Why?

362
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,180
It's what I told you before.

363
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,330
I have classes.

364
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,660
Do you need to isolate yourself
from the world during classes?

365
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,810
Of course, I have to isolate myself
from the world.

366
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,220
If I didn't,

367
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,180
how else could I get into Yihe University?

368
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,250
Fine.

369
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,220
It's past nine, and you're still not going back.

370
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,140
I'm leaving soon.

371
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,460
Pack your things. I'll send you back.

372
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,180
It's okay.

373
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,140
I can go back

374
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,180
with my friends.

375
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,050
That'll work too.

376
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:41,810
Sang Zhi,

377
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,380
it's been so long since I last saw you.

378
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:47,860
You've learned how to put on makeup.

379
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,860
You're indeed different from before.

380
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,770
Okay, okay, this looks good.

381
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,700
Don't move.

382
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,460
Okay, change your pose.

383
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,980
I'll take one of you and the cake.

384
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,490
Sang!

385
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,530
Where were you?

386
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,570
-Everyone is waiting for you.
-Yeah.

387
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,010
We're about to cut the cake.

388
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,180
I'm so sorry.

389
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,010
Come on, everyone. Gather around.

390
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,570
Come here.

391
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,250
Time to cut the cake.

392
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,530
-Light it.
-Light the candle.

393
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,460
Take the picture.

394
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,460
Take a picture first.

395
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,290
Wait, hold on.

396
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,620
Three, two, one!
♪Happy Birthday to you!♪

397
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,940
♪Happy Birthday to you♪

398
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,290
♪Happy Birthday to you♪

399
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,620
♪Happy Birthday to you♪

400
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,420
Make a wish.

401
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:02,770
Make a wish.

402
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,290
Okay, here I go.

403
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,530
It's recording now.

404
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,050
-Happy Birthday!
-Happy Birthday!

405
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,570
-Happy Birthday!
-Happy Birthday!

406
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,730
Time to cut the cake.

407
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,010
Let's move the cake over there.

408
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,570
There's more space there.

409
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,730
Wei, what time are we leaving?

410
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,490
I reserved this room

411
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,460
until 11PM.

412
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,140
Why?

413
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:27,940
Eleven o'clock?

414
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,620
My mom will call me.

415
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:32,460
You're right.

416
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,860
I almost forgot.

417
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,380
Why don't you go back first?

418
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,290
How long will you guys be here?

419
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,330
We won't stay too late.

420
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,660
In any case, you should go back first.

421
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,290
Just in case, your mom calls.

422
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,940
Okay, I'll go back first.

423
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,810
Don't stay out here too late.

424
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:47,700
Don't worry.

425
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,420
I'm going back first.

426
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,900
Remember to text us.

427
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:51,570
Stay safe.

428
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,380
Be careful on your way back.

429
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,620
Come back early.

430
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:54,290
Okay.

431
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,140
Take care.

432
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,940
Bring the leftovers for me.

433
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,140
Just leave.

434
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,810
Bring more.

435
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,940
Remember to text us when you arrive.

436
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,330
Be careful.

437
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,730
(I'm a grown-up now.)

438
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,980
(I'm no longer a kid.)

439
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,220
How much can you grow?

440
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:19,180
You're still a kiddo.

441
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,620
That old thing.

442
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:25,700
Did you scold me?

443
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,290
It should be me.

444
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,050
I'm the only "old thing"

445
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,860
you met tonight.

446
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,770
I wasn't talking about you.

447
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:45,730
Then who did you mean?

448
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,570
I just...

449
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,050
Just casually talking.

450
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:50,980
So tell me

451
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,860
who made you say that?

452
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,620
I'd like to know too.

453
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,050
Jiaxu, the thing is,

454
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,460
you don't have to be nosy about it.

455
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,620
Wait.

456
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,490
Didn't you say

457
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,140
you're going back with your friends?

458
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:15,620
Let's go.

459
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,330
Let this "old thing" send you back to campus.

460
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,700
Are you still cold?

461
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:56,490
No.

462
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,140
Jiaxu,

463
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,620
where's your house?

464
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:17,940
Wenting Garden.

465
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,570
Near the city library.

466
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,330
That's in the opposite direction

467
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,180
of my campus.

468
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,530
You have to take a big detour.

469
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,810
Actually,

470
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,180
I could go directly to the metro station.

471
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,490
Then...

472
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:40,180
Young lady,

473
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:41,860
I

474
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,730
wanted to settle a score with you

475
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,490
while sending you back.

476
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:53,530
Actually...

477
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,140
Actually,

478
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,700
that term

479
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,090
is considered civilized

480
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,460
in the young people's vocabulary

481
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,010
I think

482
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,050
it's not considered offensive, right?

483
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,770
How much did you drink tonight?

484
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,620
One bottle.

485
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,290
When you go out,

486
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,180
you should be more careful.

487
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,660
When you're out with strangers,

488
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,180
you shouldn't drink any alcoholic drinks.

489
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,220
They're not entirely strangers

490
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:32,420
We're from the same university,
just different departments.

491
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,050
Besides, my roommates were around.

492
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,490
I know.

493
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,220
I was just reminding you.

494
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,660
Why don't

495
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,290
we talk for a bit?

496
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,700
Why

497
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,570
do I feel you have something against me,

498
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,460
kiddo?

499
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,420
I don't like it when you call me that.

500
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,530
Kiddo,

501
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,940
I'm indeed five years older than you.

502
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,330
And after you're married,

503
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,220
your parents

504
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,850
will still think you're a kid.

505
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,220
So you want to be my dad?

506
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,330
It's just...

507
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,020
I mean

508
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,850
I'm already a grown-up.

509
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:55,740
So

510
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,370
if you keep calling me that,

511
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,660
I'll feel very uncomfortable.

512
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:04,900
Okay.

513
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,700
I get it.

514
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:29,660
Jiaxu,

515
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,330
what are you working as now?

516
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,700
Yan said you're a programmer.

517
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,500
Yes,

518
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,940
I'm a game developer.

519
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:41,850
Game developer?

520
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,020
I have a roommate
who's very good at playing games.

521
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:47,610
What's the name of the game you developed?

522
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,900
I can ask her.

523
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,660
"Tales of Adventures."

524
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,090
By the way,

525
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:57,420
I just remembered something.

526
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,900
Did you choose Yihe University

527
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,570
because of your old online friend?

528
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,020
Did you?

529
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,660
No.

530
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,810
No?

531
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,260
It's not because of that.

532
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,180
It's because Yihe University's
digital media program

533
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,610
is the best in the country.

534
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,420
And my scores were good enough.

535
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,460
So of course I came to Yi University.

536
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,700
I talked to your brother on the phone before.

537
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:27,940
He seemed to be quite angry

538
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,900
about you coming to Yihe University.

539
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,260
I thought

540
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,500
it was because of that old online friend.

541
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,050
No, it's not.

542
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:36,660
I...

543
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,500
I... I've...

544
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,570
I haven't been in contact with him
for a long time.

545
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,220
I'm glad to hear that.

546
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,460
My brother was angry

547
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,050
because I didn't tell him

548
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,530
when I applied to the university.

549
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,700
But I did tell my parents,

550
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,900
and they supported me in coming
to Yihe University.

551
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:08,940
I don't know what kept him busy.

552
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,290
He didn't ask me anyway.

553
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:11,770
So I didn't tell him.

554
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,460
I thought he didn't care.

555
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,330
But after I applied,

556
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,220
he criticize me

557
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,260
and argue with me.

558
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:21,020
So of course, I argued back.

559
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,740
Besides...

560
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,900
Besides, I'm an adult now.

561
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,850
I know what I'm doing.

562
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,260
Yeah,

563
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,940
Sang Zhi is all grown up now.

564
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,090
(But you still see me)

565
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,700
(as a kid.)

566
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,130
You came all the way here

567
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,420
by yourself

568
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,260
to attend university.

569
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,020
If you have any difficulties in the future,

570
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,090
you can come to me,

571
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:30,460
understand?

572
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,220
I was just joking

573
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,500
with you earlier.

574
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,260

It's very normal.

578

I really didn't think you had no conscience.

579
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,330
But you did call me an "old thing."

580

581
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:58,660
A young lady

582
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,940

583
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,090
Sorry.

584
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,850
I won't say that again.

585

It's good that you realize your mistake.

586

When you have free time in the future,

587
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,810

589

Go back and make some honey water to drink.

00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,730
when she liked the brother?

757
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,090
It was in high school.

758
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,170
That's normal.

759
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,210
You were underage at the time.

760
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:24,130
If he likes you

761
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:24,940
at that time,

762
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:25,980
then he would be the one with issues.

763
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:30,500
Let's not interrupt.

764
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:33,730
Sang,

765
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,130
describe this guy

766
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:36,860
to us?

767
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,130
He's handsome.

768
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,380
He's handsome.

769
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,610
Good grades.

770
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,090
He's very amusing when speaking.

771
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:53,650
He's...

772
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:56,500
What?

773
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,020
Very charismatic.

774
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,090
He's handsome and charismatic.

775
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,090
Then how did you two

776
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,020
know each other?

777
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,170
He's my brother's best friend.

778
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,570
He often comes to our house.
So that's how we got close.

779
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,530
Based on your description,

780
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,020
he definitely has a girlfriend.

781
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:14,570
It has to be.

782
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:15,860
Case closed.

783
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,300
You don't even know him.

784
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:18,820
Don't leave now.

785
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,500
Let's talk some more.

786
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:21,170
Wang, come on.

787
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,250
Time to get back to studying.

788
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,130
You guys are such mood spoilers.

789
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:28,980
Forget it.

790
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,610
I'll go and focus on my great endeavors.

791
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,250
Don't come back too late.

792
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:36,380
Okay.

793
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:37,860
Be careful.

794
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:38,650
Bye-bye.

795
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:39,420
Don't rush.

796
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,090
Bye-bye.

797
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:18,500
Welcome.

798
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:21,090
Excuse me, where's the honey?

799
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,860
Mister, it's on the last aisle.

800
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:24,250
Okay, thanks.

801
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:33,200
