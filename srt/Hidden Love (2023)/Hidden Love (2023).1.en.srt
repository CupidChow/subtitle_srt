00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,010
in the future.

192
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,610
Though you're now a small silly dog,

193
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,060
please don't be silly like him

194
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,420
when you grow up, okay?

195
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,650
You're good in this way.

196
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,460
Even you get me angry, huh?

197
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:34,940
Are you making me angry too?

198
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,420
I'm sure you'll become a big silly dog

199
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:38,850
like Sang Yan afterward.

200
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:04,890
Zhi, welcome back.

201
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,530
Mom.

202
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,060
Erm...

203
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,370
Hold on.

204
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:24,940
Take the fruit

205
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:25,850
upstairs.

206
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,820
Yan is back.

207
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,580
Yan is back?

208
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:30,650
Yes.

209
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,410
Be careful when you go upstairs.

210
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,300
-Okay.
-Yan...

211
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,730
She's rather weird today.

212
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,730
Yan.

213
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,340
What's up?

214
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,340
Did you get plastic surgery?

215
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,460
Come over and take a good look

216
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,060
if my face is well-fixed.

217
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,530
What's wrong with you?

218
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,130
Are you amazed by my dashing look?

219
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,220
You're more narcissistic than me,

220
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:31,770
Sang Yan.

221
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,820
Shut up.

222
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,250
Little demon, tell me now.

223
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,420
What have you done this time?

224
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,850
No... I did nothing.

225
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,370
No?

226
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:42,820
How is that possible?

227
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,940
If you hadn't,
you wouldn't have said that you missed me

228
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,300
and asked me if I came home.

229
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,010
Yan, something did come up.

230
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,740
Is this your sister, Sang Yan?

231
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,270
Do you think she's my daughter?

232
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:01,650
Yan.

233
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,690
Who is he?

234
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,290
My roommate, Duan Jiaxu.

235
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:14,770
Hello, Zhi.

236
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,620
I'm Duan Jiaxu.

237
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:17,930
Your brother's friend.

238
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,650
Do we look alike?

239
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,290
The bathroom is over there.

240
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,500
Do you want to look yourself in the mirror?

241
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,170
I don't look like you at all.

242
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:31,770
Really?

243
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,890
But your sister asked me

244
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,290
if I got plastic surgery just now.

245
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,810
What do you mean?

246
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:44,380
Yan.

247
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,020
Didn't you say

248
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,860
that you weren't coming back today?

249
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,170
Little demon.

250
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:52,860
Don't tell me

251
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,050
you mistook him for me.

252
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,410
And worst, the tweaked version of me.

253
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,380
Little demon.

254
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,770
What are you thinking about every day?

255
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,290
What's on your mind?

256
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,460
You...

257
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,020
Stop!

258
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,410
Isn't it natural for you
to become as handsome as him

259
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,410
after plastic surgery?

260
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,260
You look at your ugly face.

261
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,100
Besides,

262
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,260
Mom didn't tell me

263
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,260
that you brought your friend home.

264
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:10,980
Moreover,

265
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,340
there was only him in the room.

266
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,410
Naturally, I mistook him for you!

267
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:17,980
Keep it down!

268
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,100
Why should I?

269
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:19,890
Too loud!

270
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,570
You can't beat me.

271
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:23,860
Here, Zhi.

272
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,100
Have some fruit.

273
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,170
Don't bother with him.

274
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,610
Duan Jiaxu.

275
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,860
Do you want to take a shower before we go?

276
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:34,980
No.

277
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,340
Go and get changed now. We're leaving.

278
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:37,020
All right.

279
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,340
I'm going to get changed.

280
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:39,740
-Hurry up.
-Wait!

281
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:40,980
Yan.

282
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,170
I... I need your help.

283
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,050
Move.

284
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,260
I have an appointment for plastic surgery later.

285
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,220
My bad.

286
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:47,810
No way.

287
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,380
Do you want to leave me for dead?

288
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,410
I don't even know what you're asking for.

289
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:53,260
Fire away.

290
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,020
What's it?

291
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,860
Please say yes first.

292
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:58,980
I can't do that.

293
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,170
Are you going to report me to Mom?

294
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,260
Mom.

295
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,810
Mom.

296
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,690
Mommy.

297
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,930
Mommy.

298
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,170
You were laughing just now, though.

299
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,050
What has happened?

300
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,620
Mom, Yan beat me.

301
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:25,650
Mom.

302
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,340
Mom, Yan beat me.

303
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,020
Sang Yan.

304
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,100
Can you not do that to your sister?

305
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,500
Mom.

306
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,500
Stop that.

307
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,020
Why shush her?

308
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,140
How dare you bully her!

309
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,500
Mom.

310
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,140
Yan beat me.

311
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:50,860
He said I...

312
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,620
All right, dear.

313
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,570
There, there.

314
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:53,690
How could you do that to her?

315
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,170
I'm going to teach him a lesson.

316
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:57,140
Come with me.

317
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,050
What was going on?

318
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,050
I didn't touch her.

319
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:00,530
You...

320
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,220
You said you didn't touch her?

321
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,220
I saw that with my eyes.

322
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,380
Duan is still here.

323
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,170
How could you do that to your sister?

324
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:05,980
I won't do it again.

325
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,170
You should know you're a big brother.

326
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,020
Never again.

327
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,570
Not anymore.

328
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,770
Fine, it's good that you know you're wrong.

329
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,980
Can you get me a tissue paper?

330
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,020
Does this happen

331
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,620
to you both often?

332
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,050
It's nothing. Don't worry.

333
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,860
Mom didn't mean that.

334
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,500
We've been like this since we were little.

335
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,290
Didn't you ask Yan

336
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,860
for his help just now?

337
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,340
Why did you frame him, then?

338
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,050
Wait, Zhi.

339
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,530
Hold back your tears.

340
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:02,500
What about this?

341
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,340
I...

342
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,260
I'll talk to Yan

343
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,220
and ask him to help you.

344
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,290
What kind of help do you need?

345
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,140
It won't work.

346
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,500
I can tell he won't help me.

347
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:09,530
No, he won't.

348
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,340
Yan isn't that petty.

349
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:17,290
Jiaxu.

350
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,340
Do you have time tomorrow?

351
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:22,460
Tomorrow?

352
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,770
Yes, tomorrow.

353
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,570
What if I say

354
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,740
I'm not free?

355
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,450
No, you can't.

356
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,810
You must be available.

357
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,770
Why?

358
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,340
Hadn't you told Yan

359
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,930
about the plastic surgery thing,

360
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,170
I wouldn't have fought with him,

361
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,890
and he wouldn't have turned me down.

362
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,340
You might have a point.

363
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,930
So, tell me.

364
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,170
What do you need me to do?

365
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,790
Can you please

366
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,840
pretend to be my brother?

367
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:04,530
Real brother.

368
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,020
And

369
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,460
meet with my teacher.

370
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,220
You got called in by the school?

371
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,810
What have you done?

372
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,700
Can I not tell?

373
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,530
Sure, you can.

374
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,460
Well,

375
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:22,900
I don't have time tomorrow.

376
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,940
I wasn't paying attention during class.

377
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,220
I got called to answer questions.

378
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,260
I answered that correctly.

379
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,980
But he wanted to meet with my parent.

380
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,180
Do you expect me to buy that?

381
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,020
I'm telling the truth.

382
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,220
If you don't believe me,

383
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,740
you'll find out tomorrow when you go there.

384
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,610
Even if I lie to you now,

385
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:55,770
the teacher

386
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,900
will tell you everything tomorrow.

387
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:58,850
True.

388
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:00,980
Little demon.

389
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:02,260
Get out.

390
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,180
Can't I stay here?

391
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,370
I want to change my clothes.

392
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,610
Didn't you say to change it outside?

393
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,130
I want to change it here.

394
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,260
If so, he should

395
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:12,980
leave the room too.

396
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,700
I don't think

397
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,770
he enjoys seeing you get changed.

398
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,020
You two, get out.

399
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,530
I'm going to undress.

400
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,420
Took you long enough.

401
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:37,980
Close the door.

402
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,180
Jiaxu.

403
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,570
Are you coming or not tomorrow?

404
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,900
I've told you everything.

405
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,050
Why don't you seek Yan?

406
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,370
No way.

407
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,610
I framed him just now.

408
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,420
If I were to tell him...

409
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,610
Yan isn't like that.

410
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,770
What are you mumbling again?

411
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:08,420
Little demon.

412
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,130
Oh, a light bulb

413
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,050
burned out.

414
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:21,900
Mrs. Sang.

415
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,090
I'll get going.

416
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,460
You're leaving?

417
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,500
Are you not staying for dinner?

418
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,740
I've prepared many dishes.

419
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,260
I have a part-time job later.

420
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,050
Please enjoy the meal without me.

421
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:29,980
All right.

422
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,570
What about you, Yan?

423
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,700
I'm not eating since he's not.

424
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:34,500
Fine.

425
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,130
Take this trash out

426
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:35,740
for me.

427
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:36,660
Take the boxes

428
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,810
out first.

429
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:39,980
Hurry up.

430
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,330
I'll do it, Mrs. Sang.

431
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:41,940
No.

432
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:42,740
That won't do. I...

433
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,770
It's just a small deal.

434
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,260
I'm leaving.

435
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,180
All right, thank you.

436
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,660
Come for dinner next time.

437
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,420
Sure, Mrs. Sang.

438
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:48,940
Good.

439
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:50,090
I'll take my leave, Mrs. Sang.

440
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:50,770
Where are the boxes, Mom?

441
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,700
Just right there.

442
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,370
Bye, Zhi.

443
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,050
See you next time.

444
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,370
Bye?

445
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,130
Jiaxu.

446
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,370
Are you leaving so soon?

447
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,610
It's getting late now.

448
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,460
Why don't you leave after dinner?

449
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,020
Maybe next time.

450
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,810
When's the next time?

451
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,220
Duan Jiaxu.

452
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,500
Don't waste your breath
with an elementary student.

453
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,940
You're an elementary student.

454
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:13,850
I'm already in Grade 8.

455
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,500
Wow, you're an 8th grader.

456
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,610
Impressive.

457
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:17,810
Are you in Grade 8?

458
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,050
So,

459
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,700
you're 14?

460
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:23,810
Are you trying to say

461
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,770
that I'm too short

462
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,220
to be in Grade 8?

463
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,260
Rightfully so.

464
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,290
That's what he meant.

465
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,700
No, I didn't,

466
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,220
Zhi.

467
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,090
Don't mistake me.

468
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,420
I won't argue with you on this.

469
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:34,850
Anyway, I'll grow taller.

470
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,220
No worries at all.

471
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,020
You're not growing again.

472
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:37,770
But it's good for you, though.

473
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,610
People will think that you're 18

474
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,850
even when you're at your 30.

475
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,500
So, just because you're tall,

476
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:43,610
people would assume

477
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,500
you're my dad?

478
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:51,700
Bye.

479
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,370
You're 14.

480
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,500
What school do you go to?

481
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:55,850
Xuri Middle School.

482
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:57,700
Grade 8, Class 1.

483
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:00,700
And your name?

484
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,370
I'm Sang Zhi.

485
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,260
Sang Zhi?

486
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,700
Yes, "Zhi" as in innocence.

487
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:07,900
Duan Jiaxu.

488
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:08,940
Let's go.

489
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:09,810
Coming.

490
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,570
So, Sang Zhi,

491
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,180
you know

492
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,180
when we'll meet next time, right?

493
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,530
Bye.

494
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,530
Close the gate

495
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,420
before you leave.

496
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,330
(Next time?)

497
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,220
(Hold on.)

498
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,330
(When will that be?)

499
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,130
(Tomorrow?)

500
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,020
(So, is he coming over tomorrow or not?)

501
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,850
(Why didn't he give an exact answer?)

502
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,880
[First Chapter: I have been waiting. A secret kept]

503
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,770
Mom.

504
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,330
Good morning.

505
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,180
Good morning.

506
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,980
Good morning.

507
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,330
Morning, Zhi.

508
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,130
Good morning.

509
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,370
Good morning.

510
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:38,260
Little demon.

511
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,940
Can't you see me?

512
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,130
Little demon.

513
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,570
Yan, you're back.

514
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,050
Yes, this is my home.

515
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,260
Why can't I come back?

516
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,330
So, you know this is your home?

517
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:56,940
When was the last time you were back?

518
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:57,900
You can ask Dad and Mom

519
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,570
if they still recognize you.

520
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:02,770
I haven't seen you for a month,

521
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:04,500
and you're giving me this attitude?

522
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,500
What attitude

523
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,570
do you expect from me, then?

524
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,420
Welcome.

525
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,050
A warm welcome to you.

526
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,570
Welcome home, Yan.

527
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,130
Are you happy? Is this okay?

528
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:18,740
Happy.

529
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:19,610
Let me give you a big hand.

530
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,500
Well, stop it.

531
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,050
Enough.

532
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:21,610
That's enough.

533
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:21,900
That's enough.

534
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:22,570
The egg pancake is ready.

535
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,330
That's too much.

536
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:23,900
Sit down.

537
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:25,740
Hurry up

538
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:26,570
and taste it. Dad made you

539
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,420
the egg pancake with tuna.

540
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,020
Eat it while it's hot.

541
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,330
Nice.

542
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,020
My name is Sang Zhi,

543
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,330
and this is how I talk.

544
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,220
Stop making fun of her.

545
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:43,850
Come on.

546
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,500
Eat up.

547
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,530
Thanks, Dad.

548
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,220
Dad.

549
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,500
I'm moving back to the main campus.

550
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,130
So, I might need to borrow your car.

551
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:51,610
Do you have a lot of luggage?

552
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,940
I can get you a moving company.

553
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:54,180
Not necessary.

554
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,420
I'm just lazy to take the campus shuttle.

555
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,570
I remember that the main campus

556
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,090
is somewhere

557
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,260
near Zhi's school.

558
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,460
You can also

559
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,530
pick up Zhi from school later on.

560
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,260
No.

561
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,050
I'm in college now.

562
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:04,740
I'm taking care of the kid anymore.

563
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,420
I don't want it either.

564
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,570
I'm in Grade 11 now.

565
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:07,850
You'd better be.

566
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,330
Dad,

567
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,220
can I borrow your car

568
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,020
this morning?

569
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,330
I'm fetching

570
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,090
my roommate's luggage too.

571
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,020

My brother told me

762
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,740
all girls in college pursue him.

763
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:03,940
Well,

764
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:04,660
little girl.

765
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,130
I have never seen someone

766
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,420
more thick-skinned than him.

767
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,330
After hearing what you said, Sang Yan does

768
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,570
look more handsome lately.

769
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,940
Get off me.

770
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:24,260
You guys talk.

771
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,050
I'm off.

772
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:32,700
Zhi.

773
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,810
If you like

774
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:35,740
the doll,

775
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,180
take it with you.

776
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:39,980
Bye.

777
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,610
(He's leaving so soon.)

778
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:53,770
Duan Jiaxu

779
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:54,770
hasn't thrown that away.

780
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,850
What's wrong with him?

781
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,810
It's just a decoration

782
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,020
on his bed.

783
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,290
It's completely useless.

784
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,460
By the way, Fei,

785
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,220
does Jiaxu have a girlfriend?

786
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,290
Did his girlfriend

787
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,020
give him this?

788
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,370
He doesn't have a girlfriend.

789
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,980
He's busy every day

790
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,460
and has no time for that.

791
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:21,610
I think

792
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:22,900
that's a prize from some activity.

793
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,460
From last semester.

794
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:27,370
If you don't like it,

795
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:27,850
just leave it there.

796
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,700
That dog must have made a fool of you.

797
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,520
Dog?

798
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:33,700
Don't you know?

799
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,330
Both he and your brother are known
as Double Dogs of Nanwu.

800
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,810
I thought Yan was the only dog.

801
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:44,570
Enough of that.

802
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:45,770
Do you want a hot pot

803
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,700
or a barbecue?

804
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,460
I don't want.

805
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:50,500
What else do you want?

806
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,660
I'll drive you home after dinner.

807
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:52,660
No need.

808
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:53,770
I want to go home now.

809
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:54,660
I'm not eating anything.

810
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:56,900
I can drive you home.

811
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,900
I'll take the bus.

812
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,570
Oh?

813
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,570
Fine, it's almost time.

814
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:03,850
Let's go.

815
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:06,570
I'm leaving.

816
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,380
Bye-bye, see you next time.

817
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,300
Asimov.

818
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,130
The End of Eternity.

819
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,130
"But it resolves itself

820
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,730
into an identity.

821
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:30,300
There's a loop of small dimensions

822
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,860
with tributaries

823
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,210
on either side."

824
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,020
Can you understand this?

825
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,090
Maybe

826
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,980
this is the distance between us.

827
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,130
I can't understand a word

828
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,250
about the book he reads.

829
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:01,610
I only know the characters.

830
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,130
Sang Yan.

831
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,340
How's your thesis coming along?

832
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,820
I don't have enough references.

833
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,860
I'm going to the library tomorrow.

834
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,500
You're so invested in this.

835
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,980
I haven't finished mine yet.

836
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,460
Me either.

837
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,340
Why are you back?

838
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,570
I've brought some food for you.

839
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,170
Help yourselves.

840
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:20,820
Okay.

841
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,130
Sure.

842
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,460
It's all your fault.

843
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,020
If you didn't always bring food back

844
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:25,570
from work,

845
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:26,340
I wouldn't be so chubby now.

846
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:26,900
You're to blame.

847
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,130
Xu.

848
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:30,730
My sister phoned me just now,

849
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,420
saying that you have something

850
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,170
with her.

851
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,020
She has my thing?

852
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:34,940
Hold on.

853
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,650
I'll call her.

855
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:46,570

856
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:47,570
Kiddo.

857
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,090
What did I leave behind with you?

858
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:56,820
No,

859
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,780
it's not your thing.

860
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,650
I have left something

861
00:35:58,730 --> 00:35:59,780
at your place.

862
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:01,860
What's it?

863
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,340
An exercise book.

864
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,650
I'll ask Yan

865
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,980
to send it to you tomorrow morning.

866
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,020
But I haven't started writing it.

867
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,860
Are you asking me to do it for you?

868
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,460
No.

869
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:22,930
Because

870
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:24,080
it's an essay.

871
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,240
I might not have time to finish it.

872
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:28,890
Why don't you ask Yan

873
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:29,680
to do it for you?

874
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:32,970
He'll break my leg.

This homework

877
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,450
is a task given by your teacher.

878
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,160
If you don't bring it to school,

879
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,330
you can be honest with the teacher

880
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:53,240
and apologize.

881
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,640
Tell the teacher
you'll complete the essay afterward.

882
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:55,640
But you shouldn't

883
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,680
ask someone to do it for you.

884
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,810
What time do you usually arrive at school?

885
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,010
7:40 AM.

886
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:10,560
7:40 AM, I see.

887
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,850
So, you wake up at 7 AM.

888
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,680
Can you wake up

889
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:15,530
at 6 AM?

890
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:16,640
Why?

891
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,010
Tomorrow,

892
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,240
I'll be at the bus stop at 6:40 AM

893
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,490
and wait for you.

894
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,410
I'll accompany you when you write the essay.

895
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,080
Is that okay?

896
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,680
If so, you should plan out

897
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:32,600
the essay now.

898
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,160
After that, wash up and go to bed.

899
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:37,450
All right.

900
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,240
It's 6 AM.

901
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,560
Don't forget to set the alarm.

902
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,370
I'll call you then.

903
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,080
Go to sleep now.

904
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:47,330

It's trivial.

As early as possible.

913
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,160
Why so early?

914
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,010
I need to straighten out

my research topic

00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,850
to find breakthroughs for my arguments.

917
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,720
That's quite a work.

918
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,120

That makes sense.

919
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:37,410

(Will he really come?)

928
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,120
You can converse

929
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,410
the theorem in this way too.

930
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,200
Therefore,

931
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:41,410
we call the two theorems

932
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,200
the reciprocal theorems.

00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:32,970
Today's homework

953
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:34,490
will be the first ten questions

954
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:35,810
in the booklet.

955
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:36,680
Class dismissed.

956
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,680
Stand up.

957
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,240
Goodbye, sir.

958
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:42,280
Sang Zhi.

959
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,240
I'm waiting for your parent

960
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:44,970
in the office.

961
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,600
(Oh no,)

962
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,930
(what should I do now?)

963
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:10,970
So, Sang Zhi,

964
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:12,410
you know

965
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:13,600
when we'll meet next time, right?

966
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,330
What did he mean?

967
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:23,720
Will he come over tomorrow?

968
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,640
I'm Duan Jiaxu.

969
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,890
Duan Jiaxu.

970
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,240
Which three characters are they?

971
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:18,680
♪Love is when butterflies spring from my eyes♪

972
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:23,050
♪And ripples of excitement
sprawling across my vision♪

973
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,480
♪A bright face under a calm disguising face♪

974
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,650
♪But I can't contain my joy♪

975
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:39,680
♪I have someone I really like♪

976
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:45,220
♪My heart jingles when I think of you♪

977
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:50,880
♪I wish I could read your mind♪

978
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:56,120
♪To check if my secret liking isn't unrequited♪
