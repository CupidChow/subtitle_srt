17
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,100
You should feel better
after taking some medicine.

18
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,780
The doctor said to take two pills.

19
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,340
How is it? Do you feel better?

20
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,860
It doesn't work immediately.

21
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,100
Jiaxu,

22
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,700
you don't need to worry about me.

23
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,980
I think that milk tea was pretty good.

24
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,580
You want to have milk tea in this state?

25
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,260
That's not it. It was my first time trying it.

26
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:34,900
I was just

27
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,580
giving you my opinion.

28
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,500
I won't have it again.

29
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,980
I had milk before.

30
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,140
And I couldn't stop throwing up the entire night.

31
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,660
Did I buy milk

32
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,700
for you before?

33
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,500
Did you drink it?

34
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,580
Nope.

35
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,100
My classmate took it.

36
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,900
She threw away the bottle too.

37
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,740
It was pointless

38
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,060
to keep it anyway.

39
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,140
You should've

40
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,500
told me that you can't have milk.

41
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,340
I didn't drink it anyway.

42
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,420
I'll take note of it next time.

43
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,820
I was careless today.

44
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,980
Remember to check it

45
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,500
before you take your drink next time.

46
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,260
If not, you'll be in trouble.

47
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,900
Shall I send you back to your dorm then?

48
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:42,740
Let's go.

49
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,860
Stop scratching.

50
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,300
It'll be more severe.

51
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,540
You'll have rashes again.

52
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,420
I'm not scratching. I just feel hot.

53
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:08,860
Be a good girl.

54
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,060

00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,260
What's so funny?

00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,100
It feels like you're taking
your dog out for a walk.

57
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:35,780
Yeah.

58
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,140
I'm taking my dog,
which doesn't care about what it eats,

59
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,620

63

that I was your friend?

64
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,420
You used to...

65
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,700
Didn't you always tell other people

66
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,820
that I was your sister?

67
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,940
Are you taking me as your elder brother for real?

00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:30,740

71
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,700
Your birthday is near, right?

72
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,140
Looks like

73
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,660
I can't get a birthday cake for you then.

74

If not, you'll get an allergic reaction

75
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,500

76
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,260

(that he wants to celebrate my birthday for me?)

79

Our birthdays are pretty close.

00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,100
How do you plan to celebrate your birthday then?

81
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,940
I'm not celebrating it.

82
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,660
But why?

83
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,460
It's pointless to celebrate it alone.

86
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,220
She hasn't texted us yet.

87
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,460
I wonder

88
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,460
how her date went.

89
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,380
You're so nosy.

90
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:13,980
Did you catch a cold?

91
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,540
No.

92
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,060
I just have some symptoms.

93
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,100
I'll be fine after taking this.

94
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,780
You don't understand.

95
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,420
It's more interesting

96
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,780
when you observe

97
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,620
other people's relationships.

98
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,660
Besides,

101
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,300
Moreover, this is

102
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,260
their first date.

103
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,740
Now that I think about it,

104
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,180
Sang didn't even dare to say

105
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,340
that she fancied him in front of him.

106
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,300
She was so passive.

107
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,660
If I were in her shoes,

108
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,780
I would've

109
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,780
rushed forward and confessed to him.

110
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,940
I don't care.

111
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,660
I'll try to court him first.

112
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,100
Yeah,

113
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,660
it only works on your boyfriend.

114
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,740
How would you know?

115
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,460
Let me ask you this then.

116
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,100
What would you do if you had a crush

117
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:51,900
on someone?

118
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:53,980
You asked the wrong question.

119
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,220
I don't do that.

120
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,260
It's either I like him

121
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:56,940
or I don't.

122
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,420
Okay. Let me rephrase my question.

123
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,220
If you like someone,

124
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,700
will you court him or not?

125
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:03,860
I won't.

126
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,420
Why should I court him

127
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,260
if he never gives me any hints?

128
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,420
Why wouldn't you court him?

129
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,420
If he has the same mindset as you,

130
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,820
if both of you don't court each other,

131
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,780
both of you won't know about

132
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,580
each other's feelings.

133
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,420
I'm sure you'll regret it

134
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,460
if other girls

135
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,540
make him their boyfriend after this.

136
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,180
If

137
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,260
his heart

138
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,140
was won by someone else,

139
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,140
that means he isn't mine.

140
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,260
There's nothing to regret about.

141
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,300
There are plenty of men in the world.

142
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,380
Let me ask you this.

143
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,620
If you

144
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,980
like a guy,

145
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,140
will you court him or not?

146
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,340
Will you court him or not?

147
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,900
I don't know either.

148
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,460
What do you mean by that?

149
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,700
You asked the wrong person.

150
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,860
Who will join me

151
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,940
in the library tomorrow?

152
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:48,740
Me.

153
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,540
Me.

154
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,700
I'll ask Sang

155
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,940
to join us tomorrow.

156
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:52,620
Okay.

157
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,180
We already finished supper

158
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:58,940
for some time.

159
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,980
Why isn't Sang back yet?

160
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,180
Don't tell me she and her "elder brother"

161
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,100
went somewhere else?

162
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,260
I don't think so.

163
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,100
Moreover, this is

164
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,260
their first date.

165
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,260
It's late.

166
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,580
Why hasn't she returned yet?

167
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:13,980
Call her.

168
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,300
Sang, where are you now?

169
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,380
It's late, you know?

170
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:24,980
Wait.

171
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,460
What's with the getup?

172
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,580
What's wrong?

173
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:28,900
I'm fine.

174
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,100
I just had an allergic reaction
because I had milk tea.

175
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,340
Wait!

176
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,140
Why did you have milk tea?

177
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,460
I just took a sip.

178
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,900
Look at all the rashes. You're not okay at all.

179
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,380
You went on a date

180
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,860
looking like that?

181
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,020
How did it go?

182
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:44,900
How did it go?

183
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,500
Was it okay?

184
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:52,940
Wait!

185
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,300
Tell me how okay it was.

186
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,860
I...

187
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,940
I feel like...

188
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,420
Speak up.

189
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,060
I feel like he likes me.

190
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,180
Really?

191
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,740
Does he know

192
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,460
that you like him too?

193
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,020
No.

194
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,180
I never expressed myself in front of him.

195
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,780
I'm sure he knows that you like him

196
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,660
if you show him that smile.

197
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,460
But, Sang,

198
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,820
you mustn't let him know

199
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,220
that you still like him after this.

200
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,860
In a relationship,

201
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:23,900
men must be the ones

202
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,380
who court women.

203
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,300
But what if

204
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,380
he doesn't court me?

205
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,380
I don't think that'll happen.

206
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,020
Trust me this time.

207
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,100
Trust her this time. It'll work.

208
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,540
It'll be fine.

209
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,300
Just trust me this time.

210
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,420
I'm definitely right.

211
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:41,980
Okay then.

212
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,460
I'll wait for him to court me.

213
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,260
That's right.

214
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,100
If he doesn't court me,

215
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,020
I'll court him.

216
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,460
That was a waste of my time.

217
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,260
You're hopeless.

218
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,540
Look at your face.

219
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,780
Hurry and take your medicine.

220
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,820
Look at all the rashes.

221
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,060
Sang, you can do it.

222
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:11,930
[16 March, Friday. He said I was his friend
instead of his younger sister.]

223
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,340
Are you waiting at the entrance?

224
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,540
Okay.

225
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:17,940
I'll head there.

226
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,460
Sang Zhi.

227
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,300
Jiang Ming.

228
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,180
Happy birthday.

229
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,780
Here's your birthday present.

230
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,140
Thank you.

231
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,540
Thanks, but I don't think I'll take it.

232
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,260
I already bought it, you know?

233
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,620
I'll be in an awkward spot

234
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,020
if you don't accept it.

235
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,300
Just take it.

236
00:11:59,180 --> 00:11:59,620
Okay then.

237
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,500
Thanks.

238
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,780
Are you free later?

239
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,740
Let's celebrate your birthday together.

240
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,620
Hey.

241
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,140
I'll make a move first then.

242
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,380
Happy birthday once again.

243
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,700
Thank you.

244
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:19,820
Goodbye.

245
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,300
I'll hold it for you.

246
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,020
Was he

247
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,740
the manly man you mentioned?

248
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,700
I told you already.

249
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,820
Not him.

250
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:09,860
Is that so?

251
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,540
Take a look.

252
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,020
Did you take a clear look?

253
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,580
What are you doing?

254
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,260
Look at me.

255
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,780
Do I look like the man you mentioned?

256
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,620
(What is he talking about?)

257
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,260
(What does he mean?)

258
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,980
(Does he know about it already?)

259
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,060
(No.)

260
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,820
(I cannot admit it.)

261
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,860
(If I do,)

262
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,300
(I'd be telling him)

263
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,340
(that he was the one I had a crush on all along.)

264
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,300
You don't look like him.

265
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,900
Is that so?

266
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:09,700
Jiaxu,

267
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:10,780
you see,

268
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,260
you should stop mentioning him

269
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,180
in front of me.

270
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,740
You told me

271
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,780
that he was a jerk, right?

272
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,340
That's why I stopped contacting him.

273
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,180
Now,

274
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,980
I don't have a crush on anyone.

275
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,060
The person you mentioned,

276
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,220
he was like a central air-conditioning system, huh?

277
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,100
When did I...

278
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,980
(Did I tell him that that day?)

279
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,180
Yeah, a little.

280
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,460
Do you even know

281
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,380
what that term means?

282
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,900
Jiaxu, don't you know what it means?

283
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,100
I told you already.

284
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,300
You should surf the Internet more often.

285
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,180
Our gap is becoming apparent.

286
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:00,980
Tell me then.

287
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,660
What does the term mean?

288
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,620
It refers

289
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,860
to a guy

290
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,380
with many

291
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,700
female friends.

292
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,460
He's nice to all of them.

293
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,540
And he doesn't have a girlfriend.

294
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,980
So, are you saying

295
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,340
that a person is like a central
air-conditioning system

296
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,500
when he fulfills one of the three criteria?

297
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,100
Of course not.

298
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,180
He needs to fulfill all three criteria.

299
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,980
You're pretty good at framing people.

300
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,300
What did you say?

301
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,740
Did I say anything?

302
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,900
You did just now.

303
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,060
This is strange.

304
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,620
The movie was only shown in cinemas not long ago.

305
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,860
Why was it removed?

306
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,500
It's all because you're too busy.

307
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,940
Are you blaming me then?

308
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,180
No.

309
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:15,980
This is pretty good too.

310
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,980
The cinema in downtown

311
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,660
has bigger screens and better sound effects.

312
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,580
And today's your birthday.

313
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,620
Let's make it more meaningful.

314
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:48,860
Grab hold onto me.

315
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:49,860
If not, you'll fall.

316
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:08,820
Hold tight.

317
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:17,940
♪Love is when butterflies flutter in my heart♪

318
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,340
♪And ripples of excitement
sprawling across my vision♪

319
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,100
♪Trying to hide the happiness under a calm face♪

320
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,500
♪But I can't contain my joy♪

321
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,220
♪I have a weird intuition♪

322
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:44,580
♪My heart jingles when I think of you♪

323
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,500
You want to grab another drink?

324
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,180
You're not having any anyway.

325
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,740
Aren't you afraid

326
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,660
of blushing again?

327
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,500
It was

328
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,660
an allergic reaction. I wasn't blushing.

329
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,380
Hello. What would you like to order?

330
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:18,900
Hello.

331
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,060
The girl

332
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,420
with the square glasses,

333
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,620
is she here today?

334
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:24,740
She's on the night shift today.

335
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,340
I want

336
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,020
lemon tea with pearls.

337
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,460
Okay. Hot or iced?

338
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,180
Iced.

339
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,420
Make it hot.

340
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:31,860
Make it hot, please.

341
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,260
It's cold, you know?
You shouldn't take iced beverages.

342
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,260
I want it iced.

343
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,300
Okay.

344
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,820
It's stuffy in the cinema.

345
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,380
Iced lemon tea with pearls.

346
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,060
Fine, you can have it.

347
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,140
Here.

348
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,100
I'll scan your phone.

349
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:46,660
It'll be cold

350
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,660
in the cinema later.

351
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,700
Their air-conditioning is pretty strong.

352
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,340
Don't drink too much.

353
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,420
Mind your own business.

354
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,340
So, you think I'm annoying?

355
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:55,820
No.

356
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,460
Wasn't that what you meant?

357
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,020
No.

358
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,020
You should get used to it.

359
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,180
Thank you.

360
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,220
Take care.

361
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,620
I'll hold it for you.

362
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,300
Do you want it?

363
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,580
I can hold it myself.

364
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:02,740
You...

365
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,740
You can grab your drink if you like it.

366
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,580
You don't need to touch my hand on purpose.

367
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:19,980
I...

368
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,740
I can hold it myself.

369
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,820
It's cold, you know?

370
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,500
It's cold for you too, isn't it?

371
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,420
Yeah.

372
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,540
You should warm it for me.

373
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,460
We...

374
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,500
I don't think

375
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,900
this is appropriate

376
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,740
for me to do so.

377
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,300
You're right.

378
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,540
After all, you're not my girlfriend yet.

379
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,740
(What?)

380
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,420
Here you go.

381
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,540
Wipe your hands.

382
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,100
Hold it.

383
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,180
-Zhi.
-Jiaxu.

384
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:31,740
You first.

385
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,420
It's nothing.

386
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,260
I was planning to ask you

387
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,420
about what we'll do later.

388
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,060
Later,

389
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,460
you should come to my house.

390
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,740
The gift I prepared for you

391
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,700
is at my house.

392
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:47,740
After that,

393
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,780
we can have some cakes together.

394
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,500
Jiaxu,

395
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,300
did you tell me to go to your house?

396
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,460
Didn't you tell me

397
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,820
not to go to your house before?

398
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,300
You said I should head to your office
if I wanted to see you.

399
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,780
When did I say that?

400
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,060
The time

401
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,260
when I delivered
the electronic peephole camera to you.

402
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,660
You pulled me to the side

403
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,460
and told me

404
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,660
not to meet you in your house or your office.

405
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,300
You mean that time?

406
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,660
It's like this.

407
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:28,940
Jiang Ying

408
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:29,500
suddenly

409
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,580
came to find me in my office.

410
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,700
I was afraid she might

411
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,740
hurt you

412
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,540
if she saw you.

413
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:35,820
That's why...

414
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,500
However,

415
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,100
I was hasty back then.

416
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,420
That's why I might not have
expressed myself clearly.

417
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,300
So,

418
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,660
you were upset

419
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,420
because of that?

420
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,340
You're making it as if

421
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,340
I'm a petty person.

422
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,700
That's not it.

423
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,260
That was indeed my fault.

424
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,260
I should've

425
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,340
clarified myself back then.

426
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,500
Let me

427
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,740
apologize to you.

428
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,220
I guess

429
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,180
I was being petty

430
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:32,980
too.

431
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,500
I apologize to you too.

432
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:36,980
I'm sorry.

433
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:39,820
So now,

434
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:40,980
since our misunderstanding has been resolved,

435
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:42,660
let's have some cakes.

436
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,300
Let's go.

437
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,740
I prepared these for you.

438
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,620
For me?

439
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:14,980
They're pretty good.

440
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,460
You don't need to change into them first.

441
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,220
You haven't been to the balcony yet, right?

442
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,540
Go and check it out.

443
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,940
Why are there two cakes?

444
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,300
I made one of them.

445
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,660
It doesn't contain any dairy products.

446
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,780
You can have it.

447
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,380
It's this one, right?

448
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,260
You could tell?

449
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:20,940
It's pretty obvious.

450
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,420
If so,

451
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,100
why did you buy this one?

452
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,580
I was afraid that I might do a terrible job.

453
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,700
That's why I bought another one

454
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,660
so that you could put your candles on it.

455
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,620
Not at all. It looks great.

456
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:32,380
Is that so?

457
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,220
If so, you can pick one to put your candles on.

458
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,180
If so, I'll go with

459
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:40,900
this one.

460
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,060
Okay.

461
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,580
How many candles do you need?

462
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,340
One is enough.

463
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,100
This one.

464
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,580
That won't do.

465
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,060
You need 19 of them.

466
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,660
Now, you need to know

467
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,500
your own age.

468
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,700
Jiaxu,

469
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,420
if we have to know our own age

470
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,980
when we celebrate our birthdays,

471
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,340
I don't think

472
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,540
I can fit all of them on your birthday cake.

473
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,700

Sang Zhi, you're officially 19 years old.

Try it.

492
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:09,980
See if it's nice.

493
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,380
Is it nice?

494
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,500
It's nice.

495

Great.

498
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,380
Here's your birthday present.

499
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,540
But you already prepared a cake for me.

500
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,420
You got me a present too?

501
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,180
The cake will only last for a while.

502
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,460
It's better if I give you a present

503
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,260
that lasts longer.

504
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,500
Thank you, Jiaxu.

505
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,380
You can unwrap it

506
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,140
when you get back.

507
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,180
Okay.

508
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,180
I'll try it too.

509
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,820
Did someone buy that for you?

510
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,660
Aren't you going to unwrap it?

511
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:29,940
I'll do it when I go back.

512
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,460
That guy is trying to woo you.

513
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,260
Looks like you're pretty popular, huh?

514
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,220
If so, can you tell me

515
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:49,940
how good a guy should be

516
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,140
before he can woo you?

517
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,580
What? That's nonsense.

518
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,020
If so, can you tell me

519
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,500

521
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,300
He must be handsome,

522
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,220
have a good temper,

523
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,420

576
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,620
I have to

you'll think that I'm being nice to you

What I meant was

593
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,380
you should woo me

594
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,980

Sure.

597
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,580
If so,

598
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,380
can you tell me

You're making it as if

602
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,940
I will definitely say yes to you.

603
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,420
How could you say no to me?

604
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,500
You won't be able to win my heart.

605
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,460

I'll woo you for a long time then.

608
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,500
I'll woo you for several decades.

609
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,020
But if you go and make acquaintances

610
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,660
with other young boys,

611
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,020
I'll complain

612
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,380
to your parents.

613
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,980
Why should you complain to them?

614
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,940
Did you forget the time

615
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,300
when I pretended to be your parents
and met your teacher?

616
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,700
It was so long ago.

617
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,780
Why are you bringing it up again?

618
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,700
I'm a nostalgic person.

619
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:49,620
By the way,

620
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,500
I forgot to tell you this.

621
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,300
You look great today.

622
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,100
I know.

623
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,340
You dolled yourself up

624
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:06,860
for this date.

625
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,700
I'm sure you have feelings for me, right?

626
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,500
It's my birthday.

627
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,700
Can't I doll myself up during my birthday?

628
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,500
Did you think I dolled myself up

629
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,780
because of you?

630
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:16,780
Fine.

631
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,700
I know you have no feelings for me.

632
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,500
Can't I just imagine things

633
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,460
and make myself happy?

634
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,140
If so, you should keep it to yourself.

635
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,940
I want to say it out loud

636
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,180
so that you can hear me.

637
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,220
By the way, Jiaxu,

638
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,540
you...

639
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,940
You haven't

640
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,700
confessed to me yet, right?

641
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,140
You just asked me

642
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,300
whether you could woo me or not.

643
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,820
And I think I didn't reject you,

644
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,580
right?

645
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,060
If so,

646
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,060
can I take the cake with me?

647
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,700
So, are you saying

648
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,060
that you'll say yes if I confess to you

649
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,380
right now?

650
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,020
No way.

651
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,620
You can't take it with you then.

652
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,260
You can keep this.

653
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,380
Let me take this back, okay?

654
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,620
No.

655
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,460
Why are you so petty?

656
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,140
I'm just saying

657
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,540
that you can woo me for a little longer.

658
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,620
It's not like I didn't agree...

659
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,100
I...

660
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,900
You have to woo me

661
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,820
before I can know

662
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,860
if I have any feelings for you.

663
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,380
Understood?

664
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:38,540
Fine then.

665
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,580
That's okay.

666
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,380
If you don't have any feelings for me,

667
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,860
I'll woo you until you have feelings for me.

668
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,540
Finish the cake.

669
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,860
Sit down and enjoy it.

670
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,140
You can take the cake with you.

671
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,820
You mean both?

672
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,060
If you like them,

673
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,340
I can make them for you every day.

674
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,340

He's so good at this.

718
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:41,580

719
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,340
Knead it repeatedly.

720
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,620
That's right. Make it round

721
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,340
after repeating that several times.

722
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,020
After that, you can knead it.

723
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:52,860
Don't do it like that.

724
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,420
Here, let me show you.

725
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,060
Push it forward.

726
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,100
When you almost reach the end,

727
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,180
you have to pull it back.

728
00:40:59,300 --> 00:40:59,860
You can't just

729
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,780
push it until the end.

730
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,340
Got it?

731
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,140
Okay, I'll do it.

732
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,100
You couldn't master it

733
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,700
when you came to work in my shop

734
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,420
when you were in 12th Grade.

735
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,180
But now,

736
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,140
you're here to learn it again.

737
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,140
Are you seeing someone?

738
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:19,620
Am I right?

739
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,460
You brat.

740
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,260
Listen.

741
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,500
The cake will taste different

742
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,940
if you put your heart into making it.

743
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,100
Remember that.

744
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:33,580
Okay.

745
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,500
Knead it.

746
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,900
That's right. Front and back.

747
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:37,780
Be careful.

748
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:38,940
That's right.

749
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,940
What's with the crack?

750
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,620
Did I bake it for too long?

751
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,500
Listen.

752
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,260
Don't give up yet.

753
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,020
This is tough to make in the first place.

754
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:54,820
You should've listened to me

755
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:55,900
and done something simpler.

756
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:56,580
It would've been done by now.

757
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,900
It's fine. I'll try again.
