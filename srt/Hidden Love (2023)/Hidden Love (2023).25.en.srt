00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,020
Shut it.

197
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:24,980
125kg?

198
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:25,900
Who?

199
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,540
Me?

200
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,140
Duan Jiaxu, you have changed.

201
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,260
You're not

202
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,540
the same man I know.

203
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,340
Listen.

204
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,860
I have another identity now.

205
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,060
My brother-in-law

206
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,140
is sitting in front of me.

207
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,740
I have to take his side.

208
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,380
Right, Brother-in-law?

209
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,820
Brother-in-law?

210
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,340
Wait.

211
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,780
You're dating my sister.

212
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,900
Now, you're as dumb as her.

213
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,940
Brother-in-law is so mean.

214
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,260
How mean.

215
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,540
So harsh.

216
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,020
[Sang Zhi]

217
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,660
Do you mind?

218
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,980
Yes.

219
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,420
Hello?

220
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,660
You're still outside?

221
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,540
Yes.

222
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,860
Chen Junwen came back today.

223
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,140
Sang Yan, Qian Fei, and I

224
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,100
threw him

225
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,860
a welcoming party.

226
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,580
Are you back in your dorm?

227
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:25,900
Yes.

228
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,580
Call me

229
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,700
when you're home.

230
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,060
Okay.

231
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,260
I'll call you when I'm home.

232
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:34,740
By the way,

233
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,540
I'm not

234
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,820
cheating on you

235
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,820
with the three of them.

236
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,260
They are next to you?

237
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,620
Yes.

238
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,460
Tell them

239
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,460
I'm very jealous now.

240
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,380
Bye.

241
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,980
Now I know why you two

242
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,860
are going to be

243
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,900
family now.

244
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,340
You two are just the same.

245
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,860
Don't drag me into this.

246
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,580
I seem to remember

247
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,540
that someone told his younger sister

248
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,540
that every girl in our school

249
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,540
was obsessed

250
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,780
with him.

251
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,860
Who could possibly be this narcissistic?

252
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,180
Shameless too.

253
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,700
Yeah, who?

254
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,300
Indeed.

255
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,260
That's

256
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,180
on you, Brother-in-law.

257
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,340
Brother-in-law.

258
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,300
Shut up.

259
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,060
When are you coming?

260
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,380
When your parents are free.

261
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,340
Why?

262
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:26,980
I'll be there.

263
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,460
Me too.

264
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,540
Me three.

265
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:31,660
Bugger off.

266
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,580
Don't be nosy, you two.

267
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,940
Why can't I come?

268
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,820
I'll come.

269
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,380
Let's not tease them.

270
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,580
Have this.

271
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,900
You're punctual.

272
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,980
So you were serious about coming.

273
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:12,780
Of course.

274
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,380
Because Sang Zhi

275
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,180
said my parents don't like you

276
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:16,780
so I'm here to find out

277
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,580
if it's true or not.

278
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,820
Just so I can mock you.

279
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,540
You are all dressed up.

280
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,220
Just sit by the side

281
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,060
and shut up.

282
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,100
Don't say anything.

283
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,620
I'm staying out of it.

284
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,140
I wouldn't be here if Sang Zhi

285
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,380
didn't ask me to help out.

286
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:34,740
Come in.

287
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,820
Duan!

288
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,820
Long time no see, Mrs. Sang.

289
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,300
I bought you and Mr. Sang some food.

290
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,180
Why? No need for that.

291
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,020
Keep it.

292
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,700
No.

293
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,740
Please take it.

294
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,420
I insist.

295
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,260
Take it.

296
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,900
He can carry it.

297
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:57,860
I'll carry it.

298
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,740
I'll carry it.

299
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,740
Mom.

300
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,180
I'll help out.

301
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,220
Sang Zhi's father is cooking.

302
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:05,780
It'll be ready soon.

303
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,540
Make yourself at home.

304
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,020
Okay.

305
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,220
Find a seat.

306
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:08,580
Go ahead.

307
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,020
Okay.

308
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,700
I like the food.

309
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,540
Duan.

310
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,540
Have you found a place

311
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,140
for your company?

312
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:45,660
Yes.

313
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,700
It's inside the Tech Zone of my headquarters.

314
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,380
I already assembled my team.

315
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,260
I like the environment there.

316
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,700
Perfect for a start-up.

317
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:53,620
Yes.

318
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:54,740
We will

319
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,140
head into full operation soon.

320
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,340
Good.

321
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,140
Have some more.

322
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,100
Sure.

323
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,660
Mr. and Mrs. Sang.

324
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,420
I have to use the loo.

325
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,460
Enjoy the meal.

326
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,460
It's upstairs.

327
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,060
Have some fruits.

328
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:32,860
Thanks.

329
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,540
Duan, are you full?

330
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,500
Yes.

331
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,220
You didn't eat a lot.

332
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,500
Was the meal not to your liking?

333
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,340
No.

334
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,700
It's delicious.

335
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:41,820
I'm glad to ear that.

336
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:43,820
Try this amazing tea.

337
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:44,700
Thanks.

338
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,180
Do you want some?

339
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:45,980
No, thanks.

340
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,700
Just drink it.

341
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,500
Ignore him. Enjoy the tea.

342
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,020
Mr. Sang.

343
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,260
I have thought a lot

344
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,180
about

345
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,540
what you told me

346
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,020
last time.

347
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,340
I understand why you

348
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,660
have your misgivings regarding

349
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,820
my relationship with Zhi.

350
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,940
You want to protect her.

351
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,860
But I'm here to tell you

352
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,980
that I'm very serious about this relationship.

353
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,420
You see,

354
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,940
after the car accident involving my father,

355
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,980
the victim's family

356
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,020
did come to pester us.

357
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,420
However, it has

358
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,500
been dealt with now.

359
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,980
You need not worry about it anymore.

360
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,140
Sang Zhi will graduate in two years' time.

361
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,020
Before that, I will work here

362
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,100
for mu future and hers.

363
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,900
Are you sure you want

364
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,340
to start over in Nanwu?

365
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,580
Yes.

366
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,020
Mr. and Mrs. Sang,

367
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,260
I would be a different person

368
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,060
if I hadn't

369
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,980
met Sang Zhi at all.

370
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,980
Sang Yan told me that you're working now.

371
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,820
And I can see how hard you're working.

372
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,580
I just want to let you know

373
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,860
that if you have financial problems,

374
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,460
you don't have to buy me desserts.

375
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,260
Jiaxu.

376
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,100
Don't sweat about it.

377
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,860
Once I grow up

378
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,260
and make money,

379
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,380
I'll help you settle the debt.

380
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,100
She always puts me

381
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,580
before herself.

382
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,100
Ying!

383
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,540
Does it hurt?

384
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,500
It's not a major operation.

385
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:41,500
I'll be fine.

386
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,420
I'll wait for you.

387
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:43,940
She

388
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,260
is younger than me.

389
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,060
I should be the one protecting her

390
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,420
yet she is the one who keeps reassuring me.

391
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,620
As long as I'm here,

392
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,860
I will not

393
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,900
let any harm come your way.

394
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,540
Because I love him.

395
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,420
And so many others love you too.

396
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,020
We all love you.

397
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,220
She heals my past

398
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:17,900
so I

399
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,380
will safeguard her future.

400
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,860
Mr. and Mrs. Sang.

401
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:26,900
I

402
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,900
don't have a lot in my possession.

403
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,540
But I will give everything

404
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,340
to Zhi.

405
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,500
Jiaxu.

406
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,580
We see

407
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,740
your sincerity.

408
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,900
Zhi has brought up her relationship

409
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:47,780
with you

410
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,020
to us

411
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,300
many times.

412
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,140
But of course,

413
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,460
it's just her side of the story.

414
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,700
We were unsure about the whole thing.

415
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,180
Earlier on,

416
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,260
we said

417
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,780
that we were worried

418
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:58,820
about your family.

419
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,860
That was because we didn't

420
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,060
want Zhi to get hurt.

421
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,180
If you can give us

422
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,580
your word that you'll protect her,

423
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,220
that's all we want to hear

424
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,940
as her parents.

425
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:11,620
Duan.

426
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,460
My husband and I

427
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,740
really want...

428
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,580
In fact,

429
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,060
it all boils down

430
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,300
to her happiness.

431
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,180
Yes.

432
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,260
The rest

433
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,540
is not a problem.

434
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:27,740
I know.

435
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,100
Now I know why

436
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,180
Zhi is such an excellent girl.

437
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,220
She is so lucky

438
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,220
to have parents like you two.

439
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,540
You

440
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,900
forgot

441
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,820
to add brother.

442
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,420
What?

443
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,460
Don't be narcissistic.

444
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,020
I'm part of the family too.

445
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,380
Have some tea, Duan.

446
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:02,980
I'm her brother too.

447
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,580
Thanks, Mrs. Sang.

448
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,380
Does Little Demon

449
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,660
know I went to see her parents?

450
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,380
I haven't told her yet.

451
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,420
As

452
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,620
a man,

453
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,300
you need to toughen up.

454
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,140
Did you

455
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,580
hear what you said just now?

456
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,620
Why?

457
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,140
If you spoil her like that,

458
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:22,900
she

459
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,220
will be the death

460
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,620
of you.

461
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,540
And I'm telling you now.

462
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,500
Spoil her and she

463
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,460
will take it for granted.

464
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,860
She'll think it's her entitlement.

465
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,740
I don't mind it.

466
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,420
One more thing.

467
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,060
Don't

468
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,580
keep everything

469
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,580
to yourself.

470
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,940
That's not manly.

471
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,300
We should all learn

472
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,220
to open up.

473
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,900
Thanks, bro.

474
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:53,940
I'm serious.

475
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,860
Thank you

476
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:58,780
for all your help so far.

477
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,340
You're crazy.

478
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,300
The first time

479
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,860
I met Sang Zhi,

480
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,340
we were walking on this street

481
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,220
to take out the trash.

482
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,460
Your sister should be quite obedient, right?

483
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,900
Obedient?

484
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,620
She's in her rebellious phase.

485
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,620
She won't listen to me.

486
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,380
You know how

487
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,140
my parents

488
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,020
always spoil her.

489
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,380
She's in a junior high now

490
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,860
but she acts like an elementary school student.

491
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,220
Really?

492
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,020
I have something to tell you.

493
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,380
Your sister's teacher wants to see your parents.

494
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,060
She kept asking me if I

495
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,340
could see the teacher on her parents' stead.

496
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,180
Jiaxu.

497
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,500
Can you come tomorrow or not?

498
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,860
I told you everything already.

499
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,140
Why don't you ask Sang Yan?

500
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,420
I can't.

501
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,500
I did him dirty just now.

502
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,220
Oh, Sang Zhi.

503
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,300
See you

504
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,260
when I see you.

505
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,460
Bye.

506
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,420
Close the door for me when you leave.

507
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,500
Go meet her teacher tomorrow.

508
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,020
I knew it. That's why she insisted

509
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,100
to invite you over for dinner.

510
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,980
She and her secret agenda.

511
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,380
It's nothing

512
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,580
serious, is it?

513
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,100
What else can it be? It's just

514
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,060
to see a teacher.

515
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,300
However, she needs to learn her lesson

516
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,740
so I will not pamper her this time.

517
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:33,700
Ignore her.

518
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,260
No.

519
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,940
I just promised her.

520
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,540
Or we can go

521
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,260
together tomorrow.

522
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,540
It's just a simple meeting.

523
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,060
You promised her. I didn't.

524
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:44,740
You go.

525
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,700
She followed me till the entrance

526
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,980
just to check if I

527
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,620
would

528
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,060
help her and meet with the teacher or not.

529
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,060
I forgot about it already.

530
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,980
Slow down, Brother-in-law.

531
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,020
Aren't I punctual?

532
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,460
You're not at your dorm?

533
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,700
I'm home

534
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,860
because I don't have a class tomorrow morning.

535
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,060
I figure

536
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,020
I could come home to snack.

537
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:53,740
And tomorrow,

538
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,460
I can wake up late.

539
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,500
Who is this?

540
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,780
You

541
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,740
are extra chirpy today.

542
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,500
I am happy.

543
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,020
What happened?

544
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,740
Tell me.

545
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,820
So

546
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,460
I went to see your parents today.

547
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,900
And

548
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,580
they agreed to let us be together.

549
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,500
How did you convince them?

550
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,980
What did they say?

551
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,100
They are supporting us now?

552
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,340
For real?

553
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,500
Are you happy?

554
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,020
Very.

555
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,740
Me too.

556
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,180
And

557
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,980
from now on,

558
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,740
tell yourself firmly

559
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,180
that you're the best.

560
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,780
You, Duan Jiaxu, is the best

561
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,340
human being in the world.

562
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,300
And no one can tell you

563
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,180
otherwise.

564
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,100
Okay?

565
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,180
I miss you.

566
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,820
I miss you too.

567
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:14,940
Oh.

568
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,300
Are you free at the end of the month?

569
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,500
The end of the month?

570
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,580
Why?

571
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,220
My design

572
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,020
won an award.

573
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,940
The ceremony is at the end of the month.

574
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:32,980
Wow.

575
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,460
Will you come?

576
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,540
When did you say it is

577
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,340
again?

578
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,020
The end of the month.

579
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,460
It might be a bit complicated.

580
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,460
You see,

581
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,820
I have a new project at the moment

582
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,340

I'll take photos of them.

Four years passed by in a blink of an eye.

784
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,220
We have graduated.

785
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,220
Stop.

786
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,380
I don't want to cry today.

787
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,620
You know I never listen to you.

788
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,340
We always

789
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,260
bicker.

790
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,540
After today,

791
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,260
we will part ways.

792
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,620
I'll shut up.

793
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,540
What if

794
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,300
I miss

795
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,580
bickering with you?

796
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,340
Chen Qiang is good at bickering too.

797
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,180
He will not talk back to me.

798
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,180
I'll miss it too.

799
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,820
I'm going to bawl my eyes out.

800
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,940
Don't cry.

801
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,100
I can't stand this.

802
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,540
We'll be fine.

803
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,460
Even though we have graduated,

804
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,380
even though we only spent four years together,

805
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,140
even though

806
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,020
it's not a very long time,

807
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,980
the bond we have will never appear.

808
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,180
It's always online.

809
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,020
Always online.

810
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,060
Wei.

811
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,580
Your makeup is smudged.

812
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,220
If we take photos together later,

813
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,220
you'll look...

814
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,100
Which spot?

815
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:43,940
Oh, yes!

816
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,020
Reapply your makeup.

817
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:45,620
Okay.

818
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,020
Yes.

819
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,780
We need to take more photos later.

820
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,940
Find a toilet nearby.

821
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,700
I'll come with you.

822
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,820
Go.

823
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:50,860
Don't forget your cosmetic kit.

824
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,780
Yes!

825
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:52,220
Hurry.

826
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,420
Draw your eyebrows.

827
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:53,700
Okay.

828
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:54,700
Want some water?

829
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,460
Yes, please.

830
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,340
Later. Thanks.

831
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,020
I have to save my makeup.

832
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,540
Okay.

833
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,060
Get your own water bottle if you're thirsty.

834
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,700
Okay.

835
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:00,940
Go.

836
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,580
Come on.

837
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,700
This way then.

838
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,100
Chen Qiang.

839
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,500
Do you remember

840
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,900
what are you going to say?

841
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,020
Rose.

842
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,020
Then you hurry to get the rose.

843
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,500
Go get it.

844
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,780
And then we...

845
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,140
Give me.

846
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,020
make a heart here.

847
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,380
Then pile it up.

848
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,380
After that,

849
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,380
sprinkle a ring of roses around it.

850
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,340
Where to start?

851
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:21,860
From here.

852
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:24,980
Pile it up, right?

853
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:26,620
Come.

854
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,500
I'll help you.

855
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,060
Good.

856
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,020
There are too many.

857
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:30,980
Change it.

858
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,860
It's OK.

859
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,820
It's OK.

860
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,940
It can be piled up.

861
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,220
Hurry up.

862
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:35,940
How?

863
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:36,700
Like this.

864
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,860
Do it this way.

865
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,020
Pile them all up, huh?

866
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:39,420
Right.

867
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,500
Make a heart and roses.

868
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,100
What do you think?

869
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:44,820
Good.

870
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,020
She should like it.

871
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,140
Hope it works out.

872
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,140
Don't open your eyes.

873
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,140
What?

874
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:55,860
Don't open your eyes.

875
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,020
I just got my makeup done.

876
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:57,980
Don't mess with me.

877
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:58,860
I won't.

878
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,100
I won't touch you.

879
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,100
Be careful. Be careful.

880
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,180
Follow our steps.

881
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,540
Be careful.

882
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,860
Have we arrived yet?

883
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,620
Almost there.

884
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,020
Come on.

885
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,220
Get ready.

886
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,100
Take a step with your right foot.

887
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:10,780
Take a step.

888
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,180
Which foot?

889
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:15,900
Stand up.

890
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:16,900
Come here.

891
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,500
Are you ready?

892
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,460
Ready.

893
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:20,500
OK, three.

894
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:21,780
two.

895
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:22,860
one.

896
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,180
Excuse me.

897
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,580
This is pretty sudden.

898
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,380
I thought of my ways to do it.

899
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:06,940
Sang Zhi.

900
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,340
I always felt that

901
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,140
being alone

902
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,700
doesn't matter.

903
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,620
But until I met you,

904
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,700
you show me

905
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,100
loving and being loved

906
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,820
is such a happy thing.

907
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,420
Thank you for giving me.

908
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,420
so much love.

909
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:36,820
It's because of you.

910
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,860
I found out

911
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,700
I'm such a nice person too.

912
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,460
Turn out

913
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,420
I do deserve to be loved.

914
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,060
It was you who made me

915
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,100
want to to try

916
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,500
to love someone no matter what.

917
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:27,940
I have nothing else

918
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,020
to give you

919
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,260
but on thing,

920
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,510
a lifetime

921
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:34,710
with only one person.

922
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,760
I hope you can

923
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,440
be the witness of it.

924
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,440
But the time

925
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,360
will be a little long.

926
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,960
I want to fulfill it

927
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,190
with all my life.

928
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:56,880
Will you marry me?

929
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:01,880
Say yes.

930
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,360
Marry him.

931
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,440
Marry him.

932
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,190
Sang.

933
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,360
Sang.

934
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,190
Kiss!

935
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,760
Kiss!

936
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,440
I am quite envious of you.

937
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,550
You secretly liked me for so long.

938
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,510
The feeling

939
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,190
of loving person in the heart

940
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,030
is good.

941
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:36,630
I'll tell you a secret.

942
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,150
Before I showed you

943
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,510
that I like you,

944
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,400
I had secretly liked you.

945
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:47,800
Really?

946
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:55,760
Do you still remember

947
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,030
the first snow in your freshman year?

948
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,480
That's when it started.

949
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,880
Our story

950
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,590
began when he was 22 years old.

951
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,110
I used to hide secretly

952
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,440
my thoughts for him.

953
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,710
I didn't dare to let anyone find out.

954
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,480
I tried to be a better person

955
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,760
to catch up with

956
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,070
When I came to him,

957
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,000
I just found

958
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,440
that I never ran alone.

959
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,320
He was also trying to run towards me.

960
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,280
With five whole years,

961
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,400
I healed the wounds of his youth

962
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,440
and e fulfilled my young first love.

963
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,590
Our story

964
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,710
began when he was 22 years old.

965
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,440
and ends when I am 22 years old.

966
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,190
Why did you secretly hide one?

967
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:48,630
