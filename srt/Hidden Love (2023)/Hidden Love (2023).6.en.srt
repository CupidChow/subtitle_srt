00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,260
Then, I can just casually not go home.

380
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:32,230
Am I right?

381
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,150
I just wanted to say it's cheap.

382
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:33,780
You can invite your classmates to come over

383
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,670
and eat at home.

384
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,060
Duan Jiaxu,

385
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,300
where are you going?

386
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,500
Where are you guys going?

387
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,630
I'm going home for a bit.

388
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,990
I happen to be going to your area.

389
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:43,910
Let's go together.

390
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,500
Sure. If you're free,

391
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,430
come to my house for dinner.

392
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:47,430
Okay.

393
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:49,780
Then I won't join.

394
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,340
I have to go back to the dorm and do my assignment.

395
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,470
-Okay.
-Bye.

396
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:52,990
Bye.

397
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,710
Hello, little demon.

398
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,390
You hung up, huh?

399
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,060
What's wrong?

400
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,630
She hung up on me.

401
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,300
Let's go.

402
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,100
(Why don't I call Sang Yan)

403
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,820
(and ask where they are?)

404
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,260
(Forget it.)

405
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,230
(They should be here soon.)

406
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,300
Don't worry.

407
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,300
What's the situation?

408
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:46,820
Chen Junwen...

409
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,300
(He's finally home.)

410
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,910
How many times have you forgotten your keys?

411
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,020
I can't get it for you.

412
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,340
If you want, you have to get it yourself.

413
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,500
Are you that foolish

414
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,540
or just clumsy, huh?

415
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,150
I'm already home.

416
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,260
How can I open it for you?

417
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,950
(Why is he alone?)

418
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,230
Little demon!

419
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,540
Why didn't you close the door?

420
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,820
Don't you know there are mosquitoes?

421
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,540
Duan Jiaxu

422
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,710
was supposed to come to my house.

423
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,300
But the library

424
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,500
gave him a call.

425
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,740
So he had to go back to work.

426
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,540
I'm sure you know

427
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,670
making money is all he could think about.

428
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,150
All right, that's all.

429
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,100
I'm hanging up now.

430
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:23,910
Bye-bye.

431
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,100
Little demon,

432
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,390
why did you ask me to come back?

433
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,430
Dad and Mom said

434
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,820
to come back
to have dinner together this weekend.

435
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,950
Eat dinner together?

436
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,820
Can't you tell me over the phone?

437
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,910
Dad! Mom!

438
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:43,780
Yan?

439
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,060
Yan is back.

440
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,020
Why are you back?

441
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,100
I thought you were coming home tomorrow.

442
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,390
It's the weekend. So let's have dinner together.

443
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,190
You're getting more thoughtful.

444
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,780
Your dad and I have been busy working

445
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,060
outside all day and are sweating.

446
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,100
We'll go and take a shower first.

447
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:00,910
-Okay.
-Okay.

448
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,990
After a shower, I'll make dinner for you.

449
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:02,540
Okay.

450
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,300
Mom, why don't

451
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,430
you let Yan make dinner?

452
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,740
Him? Dinner?

453
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,020
That would work too.

454
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,340
Cook the rice first.

455
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,950
Then wash the vegetables.

456
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,150
I think cooking rice is too simple.

457
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,060
It's okay.

458
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,260
Let him cook the rice.

459
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,230
I'll make the dishes.

460
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:28,870
Yan.

461
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,100
Which library

462
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,470
is Jiaxu working at?

463
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,670
Is it the university's library?

464
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,580
Why are you asking me this?

465
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,340
Nothing.

466
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,870
I'm just curious.

467
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:40,470
Are university students

468
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,300
so busy?

469
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,430
What do you guys usually busy with?

470
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,540
Busy trying to get away
from a little demon like you.

471
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,470
Busy sleeping in class.

472
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:50,580
Isn't that

473
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,870
the same as middle school students like us?

474
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,580
How can that be the same?

475
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,740
We university students

476
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,870
have one more thing to do,

477
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,060
which is dating.

478
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:59,580
Dating?

479
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,470
Well, I should've known.

480
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,740
A kid like you

481
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,820
wouldn't understand this.

482
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,340
How is that possible?

483
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,500
How is it possible for any girl

484
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,150
to like you?

485
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,190
Listen,

486
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,630
there are plenty of girls chasing after me.

487
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:12,540
Even the CRH-train series

488
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,630
can't accommodate all of them.

489
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,340
What's wrong with you?

490
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,390
It's been so long

491
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,630
since I heard

492
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,910
someone could brag this exaggeratedly.

493
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:24,780
You don't believe me, huh?

494
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,190
Okay, listen.

495
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,390
Do you know

496
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,190
why all of my roommates have no girlfriends?

497
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,260
All of them have no girlfriends at all?

498
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,540
Because those girls

499
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,910
are lining up to pursue me.

500
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,100
Do you think I'd believe that nonsense?

501
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,700
[Sender: Duan Jiaxu]

502
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,260
(Another reward from Jiaxu)

503
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,150
(for my exam scores.)

504
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,230
Hello?

505
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,910
Hello, Jiaxu.

506
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,390
I received

507
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,870
the package you sent.

508
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,910
It's a black doggie soft toy.

509
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,020
So?

510
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:11,230
Do you like it?

511
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,670
It looks familiar.

512
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:17,870
Is that so?

513
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,630
Does it look like Sang Yan?

514
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,100
You still remember my essay.

515
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,100
Of course, I do.

516
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,950
I was on the street one day,

517
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,060
and I saw this dog.

518
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,060
It reminded me

519
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,500
of the drawing you made.

520
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,500
So I thought

521
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,020
it would be a perfect gift for you.

522
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,630
Congratulations!

523
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,340
You scored 95 on the physics exam this time,

524
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:42,870
right?

525
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,390
Oh, Jiaxu.

526
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,580
Give me your address.

527
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,500
I want to send you something.

528
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,020
You want to send me something?

529
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,670
Just exchanging favors.

530
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,390
No need.

531
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,100
Why? It's important.

532
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:02,950
How much pocket money

533
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,100
do you have in a month?

534
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,190
Keep the money

535
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,780
and spend it on yourself, okay?

536
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,100
No need to send me any gifts.

537
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,950
Let me send it to you.

538
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:12,910
Really, no need.

539
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,580
Your thoughtfulness

540
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,100
already makes me happy.

541
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:18,780
So

542
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,910
Yan said

543
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,060
you'll come back

544
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,260
for your graduation ceremony.

545
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:24,990
Is that so?

546
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,190
Yes.

547
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:27,580
Are you going?

548
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:29,870
Yes.

549
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:31,740
That's great.

550
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,230
We'll see each other then.

551
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,990
I have to go now.

552
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:38,430
Bye-bye.

553
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:39,870
Bye-bye.

554
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,580
(Then, consider it as your graduation gift.)

555
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:13,390
Who's there?

556
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,390
Long time no see.

557
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,390
Why are you here?

558
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,150
Aren't you inviting me in?

559
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,390
It's not convenient.

560
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:33,950
Sorry about that.

561
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:40,870
Here.

562
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:43,870
Isn't that person

563
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,260
in a bad condition?

564
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:46,910
Don't worry

565
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,740
about returning the money this month.

566
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,500
It's fine.

567
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,580
I can figure it out myself.

568
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,300
I just don't want you

569
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,340
to have a hard time.

570
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,150
Really, no need.

571
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,150
Thank you for the offer.

572
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:01,580
By the way,

573
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,430
has the time for your graduation ceremony

574
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:03,990
been decided yet?

575
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,870
Can I go too?

576
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,300
No need.

577
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,260
All right.

578
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,950
Since you're returning to Yihe,

579
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,860
we'll have time to meet again.

580
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,140
Then,

581
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,340
I wish you an early happy graduation.

582
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:27,620
Thank you.

583
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,860
I'll keep in touch with you again.

584
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,990
Three, two, one!

585
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,750
Cheese!

586
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:02,950
(Smile a little.)

587
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:03,990
(A bit lower.)

588
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,060
(Okay, smile.)

589
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,190
(Three, two, one.)

590
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,300
Your classmate?

591
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,620
Actually, we don't know each other.

592
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,670
Sang Yan, come here quickly!

593
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:12,710
Over there.

594
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,060
Hello, Mr. Sang.

595
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:23,750
Hello, Mr. Sang.

596
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,100
Congratulations.

597
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:24,820
All of you have graduated.

598
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,270
Thank you, Mr. Sang.

599
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:31,710
Mr. Sang,

600
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,470
where's Mrs. Sang?

601
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,540
She's sick with a cold and fever.

602
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,910
I told her to rest at home.

603
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,270
Many people have fallen sick lately.

604
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:38,910
Yeah.

605
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:39,950
Sang Yan,

606
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,510
you came late.

607
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,060
I haven't taken pictures with you.

608
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,510
Let's take some pictures.

609
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,340
Okay, let's go.

610
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,140
Let me help you guys take it.

611
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,430
-Thank you, Mr. Sang.
-Thank you, Mr. Sang.

612
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,100
Thank you, Mr. Sang.

613
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:46,620
It's all right.

614
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,430
Look this way.

615
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,190
One, two, three.

616
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:52,910
Change a different pose.

617
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,780
Ready? One, two, three.

618
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,910
All done. Take a look.

619
00:28:59,300 --> 00:28:59,820
Thank you, Mr. Sang.

620
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:00,510
Qian Fei!

621
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:02,910
Qian Fei, come and take some pictures with us!

622
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,510
Come on!

623
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:03,910
Let's go.

624
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:04,820
Dad, I'll go over.

625
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,540
Jia, come and join us.

626
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:07,540
Come.

627
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,100
I heard

628
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,670
you'll work in your hometown.

629
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:10,910
Yes.

630
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,060
I've already found a job.

631
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,950
It's not bad to work back in your hometown.

632
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:15,380
After all,

633
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,710
it's a familiar place.

634
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,140
When you have time, come to Nanwu.

635
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,340
Remember to come to my house for a meal.

636
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,710
Okay, that's for sure.

637
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,140
Good.

638
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,060
Let's go find your brother
and take a photo together.

639
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,100
Let's take it together.

640
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:25,820
Okay.

641
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,710
Long time no see, Zhi.

642
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,270
This is for you.

643
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,470
For me?

644
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,270
I thought

645
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,340
it was for your brother.

646
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,340
He... He already has one.

647
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,340
This one is for my physics tutor.

648
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,190
I hope he

649
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:52,620
has a happy graduation

650
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:53,950
and be happy every day.

651
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:55,710
Thank you.

652
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:57,540
I like it very much.

653
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,100
Then, I wish my student

654
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,710
a bright future and smooth academic progress.

655
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,670
(The graduation ceremony is about to begin.)

656
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,230
(All graduating students,)

657
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,620
(please gather in the auditorium.)

658
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,780
Jiaxu, you should go ahead.

659
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,430
I'll go and find my brother

660
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,060
by myself.

661
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,710
It's okay. I'll take you there.

662
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,270
I'll text your brother.

663
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:21,990
Come on.

664
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:33,750
Duan.

665
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:34,300
Duan.

666
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:34,750
Hey, Duan.

667
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:35,710
[Nanwu University Class of 2016 Graduation]
Come and join us.

668
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:36,670
Let's take a picture together.

669
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,100
Okay.

670
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,430
I'll go and take a picture with them.

671
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,540
Duan, who's this?

672
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,060
My sister.

673
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:43,540
Oh, hi.

674
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:44,990
Can you help us take a photo?

675
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,270
Okay.

676
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,030
Thank you.

677
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,190
Just press this.

678
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:48,540
Okay.

679
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:49,950
Come on, everyone.

680
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:50,950
Let's take a picture.

681
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:51,750
-Okay.
-This is it.

682
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,780
-Stand over here. Closer.
-Okay.

683
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,140
Okay.

684
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,140
Three.

685
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,340
Two.

686
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:57,430
One.

687
00:30:58,910 --> 00:30:59,340
Good.

688
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,670
Okay. Thank you.

689
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,540
Jiaxu.

690
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,270
Professor Zhang,

691
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,620
thank you for your help.

692
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,710
I hope to see you shine and excel

693
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,190
in the gaming industry.

694
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:10,580
I'll do my best.

695
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,670
I believe in you.

696
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:12,470
Thank you.

697
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,430
Okay, guys.

698
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,580
I'm going inside first.

699
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:14,910
Okay.

700
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:15,470
Okay, Professor.

701
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,100
Duan,

702
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,300
participating in competitions

703
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,620
and research projects with you
at this university

704
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,030
was the most painful and happiest thing

705
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,060
for me in these four years.

706
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,580
Both painful and happy?

707
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,190
Yeah.

708
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,270
It sounded complicated.

709
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,710
Do you remember the time

710
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,380
we stayed up late every night

711
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,950
and could only eat instant noodles
when we were hungry?

712
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,470
It was so difficult at that time.

713
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,100
But it will all pay off.

714
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,340
Tomorrow,

715
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,270
I'll be returning to my hometown.

716
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,750
You're leaving tomorrow?

717
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:40,750
What about you two?

718
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,580
I'll probably leave tomorrow too.

719
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:43,710
I don't know

720
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,620
if we'll have a chance to meet again in the future.

721
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:46,060
It's okay.

722
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,750
There'll always be an opportunity to meet again.

723
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:49,710
I have to go inside first.

724
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:50,750
Okay, I'll see you later.

725
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:51,380
Okay.

726
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,670
Jiaxu,

727
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,140
does that mean

728
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,100
it'll be difficult to meet your classmates

729
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,540
after graduation?

730
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,780
I guess so.

731
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,030
How do I explain this to you?

732
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,340
We may take

733
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,380
the same course.

734
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,300
But after we enter society,

735
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:19,620
everyone

736
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,030
will make their own choice.

737
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,540
Gradually, we'll take

738
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,540
a different path.

739
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,470
Maybe

740
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,580
it'll be really hard to meet again.

741
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,430
Then,

742
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:40,910
what about me?

743
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,300
You?

744
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,140
You're not the same as them.

745
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,430
They

746
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,670
won't be like you,

747
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,540
who secretly gave me red packets

748
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,380
during the Chinese New Year

749
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,060
and even came to give me flowers

750
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:01,990
on my graduation day.

751
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,340
Don't worry.

752
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,510
After I leave,

753
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,230
I'll come back to see you whenever I have free time.

754
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,030
When

755
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,140
will you be free?

756
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,190
I'll let you know in advance

757
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,300
before I come back,

758
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:23,470
okay?

759
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:32,380

Jiaxu,

952
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,950
do you want some hangover soup?

953
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,870
I don't drink alcoholic drinks.

954
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:22,700
So no need to go through the trouble.

955
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,470
It's already late. You should go to bed.

956
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:26,990
I'll sleep after taking a shower.
