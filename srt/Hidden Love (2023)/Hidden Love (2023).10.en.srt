00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,140
I'm sorry

191
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,860
I couldn't make it.

192
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:40,830
But

193
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,430
we can catch a movie some other time

194
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,540
when you're free.

195
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:44,830
Sure.

196
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,350
I…

197
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,740
I'm free next weekend.

198
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,660
Then…

199
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,260
Let's watch a movie next weekend.

200
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,310
It's on me.

201
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:55,950
Okay. Then…

202
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,230
See you next weekend.

203
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,020
Yes. So I…

204
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,190
I'm going to warm up now.

205
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:04,950
Bye.

206
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,860
Bye.

207
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:18,120
[Abnormal]

208
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,830
Then, the characters are projected,

209
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,430
and the whole scene will…

210
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,350
Wait.

211
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,660
Jiaxu?

212
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,190
Ms. Siyun.

213
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,780
The logic in this part

214
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,740
is too winded.

215
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,230
The program won't run.

216
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,710
I don't have a computer with me right now.

217
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,020
Why don't you have them send one

218
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,540
from the company?

219
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:45,900
I'll write this bit.

220
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,070
It's okay.

221
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,310
Focus on recovering.

222
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,190
I'll have them

223
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,500
handle the other parts first.

224
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,620
It's fine.

225
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,740
I have nothing to do here anyway.

226
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:56,900
Jiaxu,

227
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,070
if your wound

228
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,740
opens up again,

229
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:01,950
who is going to work for me?

230
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,540
Rest well.

231
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,770
[Jiang Ying]

232
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:43,020
[Voice Message]

233
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,660
(I'm sorry.)

234
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,310
(I know)

235
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,110
(I was too emotional.)

236
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:48,590
(I'm sorry.)

237
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,020
(I will change this time.)

238
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,350
(I will control myself.)

239
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,470
158.

240
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,950
(Here, look at the camera.)

241
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,530
(This must be his mother.)

242
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,630
(Nice to meet you.)

243
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,990
(I am Sang Zhi.)

244
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,630
(I think)

245
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,060
(he will need underwear.)

246
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,780
Wait!

247
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,190
I'm going inside.

248
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:36,540
Thank you.

249
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,340
Jiaxu, it's me.

250
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,300
Jiang Ying.

251
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,470
Jiaxu?

252
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,580
Jiaxu, are you home?

253
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,150
Open up!

254
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,260
Jiaxu.

255
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:51,340
You're here.

256
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,740
I didn't know you were in the bathroom.

257
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,540
It's okay. I can do it myself.

258
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,580
An old man

259
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,950
took up the bed next to mine.

260
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,950
He went downstairs for a stroll.

261
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,580
Hot water.

262
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:11,580
Thanks.

263
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,260
It's hot.

264
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,630
You brought a lot of stuff.

265
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,630
It's not that much.

266
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,430
Two sets of clothes.

267
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,780
One for you to wear when you're discharged.

268
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,470
The other can keep you…

269
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,060
Um…

270
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,390
I…

271
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,260
I brought the stuff you needed.

272
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:47,540
Thanks.

273
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,470
Jiaxu,

274
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,340
don't stay up too late working.

275
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,820
You're still recovering.

276
00:22:59,300 --> 00:22:59,820
Okay.

277
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,300
I promise

278
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:02,870
I'll shut off the computer

279
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:03,910
at 10 PM sharp.

280
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,260
One hour left.

281
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,230
Hello.

282
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,300
Hello.

283
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:18,950
Hello.

284
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,500
Have you eaten?

285
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:24,710
Here.

286
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,340
Sit.

287
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,060
Not yet. I'll have dinner later.

288
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,540
Not yet?

289
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,500
It's already past 8 PM.

290
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,150
I'm not hungry yet.

291
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,470
Stop putting away the things.

292
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,540
Go and eat dinner.

293
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,820
I'll get dinner in a bit.

294
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:38,670
I'll order delivery for you.

295
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,390
I went to get your things

296
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,950
right after I finished class.

297
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,630
I haven't even

298
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,540
sat down yet,

299
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,820
but you keep telling me to eat.

300
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,820
Why do you keep

301
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,390
telling me to eat?

302
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:56,740
Boy,

303
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,020
is this your wife?

304
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,260
Sir,

305
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,540
how did you come to the conclusion

306
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,670
that she is my wife?

307
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,190
She's beautiful.

308
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,230
Here.

309
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,580
Okay.

310
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,150
Thank you.

311
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,150
Sir,

312
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,740
this is my little sister.

313
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,870
Not my wife.

314
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,300
I know your wife looks good.

315
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:20,630
Sorry.

316
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:21,950
My dad

317
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,430
is hard of hearing.

318
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,020
Dad,

319
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:26,990
that's his sister.

320
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,300
Not his wife.

321
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,580
You can't marry

322
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,150
your sister.

323
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,390
You're not married yet?

324
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,430
Boy,

325
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,470
you don't look young anymore.

326
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,870
Why aren't you married yet?

327
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,820
Don't keep the girl waiting.

328
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,260
Sir,

329
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,630
please stop teasing me.

330
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,150
I have a wound on my stomach.

331
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,020
Boy,

332
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,100
I'm not joking.

333
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,020
You need to get a move on.

334
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,060
Your wife is pretty

335
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,670
and caring.

336
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:00,470
Look at her

337
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,500
carrying around all these bags.

338
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,470
You must cherish her.

339
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,710
Or else

340
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,300
you'll regret it.

341
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,300
Okay.

342
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,540
I understand.

343
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,540
He has poor hearing.

344
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,580
Don't mind him.

345
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,340
Just think of it as a joke.

346
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,630
(A joke?)

347
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,780
(You shouldn't joke)

348
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,780
(about these things.)

349
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,430
Sir,

350
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,710
he is not my lover.

351
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,340
He is too old

352
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,870
to be my partner.

353
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,020
He is old enough to be my dad.

354
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,950
It's great to be a dad!

355
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,060
Once you two get married,

356
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,870
hurry up and have a child.

357
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:49,910
You'll settle down.

358
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,260
Settling down is more important than anything.

359
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,390
I'm going to get something to eat.

360
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,230
Eat more.

361
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:12,340
Order more.

362
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,670
Why is your wife leaving?

363
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,190
My wife is going to eat.

364
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,300
She's going to eat dinner.

365
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,710
That's not something to joke about.

366
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,340
Jiaxu.

367
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:53,470
You're up.

368
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,780
Don't tell me you worked all night.

369
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,580
I shouldn't have brought you

370
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:01,340
the laptop.

371
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,540
Jiaxu,

372
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,740
you had an operation,
and you've been hospitalized.

373
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,230
Why won't you just rest?

374
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,190
Do you really think

375
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,430
you are Superman?

376
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,390
You've found out

377
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,390
about my hidden identity.

378
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,990
What hidden identity?

379
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,100
How can you stay up all night?

380
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,020
Oh, the couple is bickering
the minute they're awake.

381
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,430
When's the wedding?

382
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,670

She is thin-skinned.

572
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,910
But you still made relationship jokes

573
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:38,470
about her.

574
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,470
Of course she would be mad.

575
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,830
You even said

576
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,870
she had a boy she liked.

577
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,870
Of course that would make her even angrier.

578
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,740
I'm not the one who made the joke.

579
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,140
It was that old man.

580
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,660
She is taking it out

581
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:51,950
on me.

582
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,350
You're an accomplice.

583
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,100
She took care of you.

584
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,540
But you made jokes about her

585
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,790
with that old man.

586
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,950
You're lucky she took care of you

587
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,390
until you were discharged.

588
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,220
I only wanted

589
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,580
to get rid of that old man.

590
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,030
It's all the same

591
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,620
to her.

592
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,740
Let me interrupt you guys.

593
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,510
So you called Siyun and me over

594
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:13,950
because of this problem you have

595
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:14,790
with your relative?

596
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,870
This is such a petty matter.

597
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,830
I thought you had

598
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:19,870
relationship problems.

599
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,180
You best pray

600
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,540
that I don't have relationship problems.

601
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:23,430
Who will help you

602
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,390
with the game expansion if I do?

603
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,950
Well, thanks.

604
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,740
How about this?

605
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,260
Find some time

606
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,470
and take her out for a meal.

607
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:32,580
Talk things through with her,

608
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:33,790
and it should be fine.

609
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,030
Also,

610
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,740
you should be more careful.

611
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,660
She's an adult now.

612
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,100
You can't joke about anything anymore

613
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,100
like you did when you were kids.

614
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,580
Got it.

615
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,260
Siyun is right.

616
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,580
End of counselling.

617
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:46,700
Get back to work.

618
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,510
I'll get it for you, Honey.

619
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,060
(Are you…)

620
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,650
[Jiang Ying]

621
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,030
Hello?

622
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,100
I told you

623
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,310
not to contact me anymore.

624
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:32,990
Jiaxu,

625
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,310
let's meet up.

626
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:35,740
I called you,

627
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:36,390
but you…

628
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,100
I told you.

629
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:37,950
Let's not

630
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,100
stay in touch anymore.

631
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,060
So you're just going

632
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:41,990
to abandon me? Is that it?

633
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,180
Duan Jiaxu.

634
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:44,660
I'm busy.

635
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:45,430
I'm hanging up.

636
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:04,180
[Jiang Ying]

637
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:14,990
Do you want some more?

638
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,310
Are you scared?

639
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,700
No.

640
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,740
I love this.

641
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,030
I'm sorry.

642
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:08,060
I didn't know you were afraid of chickens.

643
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,740
It's okay.

644
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,910
I'm not afraid of anything

645
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,180
but

646
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:15,510
animals with sharp beaks.

647
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:17,950
I see.

648
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:18,870
It is…

649
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,060
It was really tall.

650
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:26,580
Do you want to wipe your sweat?

651
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,470
I'll use the bathroom.

652
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:32,620
Okay.

654
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:37,350
