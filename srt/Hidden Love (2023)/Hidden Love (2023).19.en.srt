17
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,140
Hello.

18
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,100
Yes, it's me.

19
00:01:59,500 --> 00:01:59,980
Okay.

20
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,460
All right.

21
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,380
Noted.

22
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:05,740
What's the matter?

23
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,580
I passed the interview.

24
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,500
Really?

25
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,260
Is that true?

26
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,500
You can do your internship already.

27
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,420
What is it?

28
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,540
-What are you talking about?
-Well,

29
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,820
that means

30
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,300
I can't go to the party.

31
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,020
But you've promised me.

32
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,100
Hurry up and get ready.

33
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,020
How was

34
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,860
the interview with him?

35
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,420
Well, nothing much.

36
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,100
How is it?

37
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,380
Nothing special.

38
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,460
Well,

39
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,980
I should give you some advice.

40
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:53,940
First...

41
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:54,860
Stop.

42
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:55,820
Please don't.

43
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,620
Your ways with Chen Qiang

44
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,020
aren't suitable for Wang.

45
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,940
Wang should

46
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,420
depend on herself.

47
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,460
Thank you.

48
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,380
All right, then.

49
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,260
All the best!

50
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,060
Good luck to me.

51
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,180
(Compared to)

52
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,060
the intended results,

53
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,500
can we

54
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,380
improvise

55
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,300
on the details?

56
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,180
Jiaxu.

57
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,180
What do you think?

58
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,980
In my opinion,

59
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,580
this is good to go.

60
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,460
As it reconstructs

61
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,780
the design of the previous scene

62
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,740
and the functions

63
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,380
are optimized.

64
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,740
About the lighting,

65
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,060
can we refine it

66
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,420
a little bit more?

67
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,500
It looks

68
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,940
rather stiff to me.

69
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,660
Our game's weather system

70
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,020
updates in real time.

71
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,180
Now,

72
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,580
the day seems fine.

73
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,180
However, I think

74
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,700
we can still adjust the night view.

75
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,540
Look at that.

76
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:04,940
Siyun.

77
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,460
Are you okay, Siyun?

78
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,660
What's wrong, Siyun?

79
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,580
Have a seat.

80
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,420
Are you okay?

81
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,060
I'll get her a cup of water, Duan.

82
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,100
Okay, hurry up.

83
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,220
Do you need to go to the hospital?

84
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,540
It's okay.

85
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,300
My gastric problem has persisted for a while.

86
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:20,820
No, Siyun.

87
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,340
I really think

88
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,540
you should go to the hospital.

89
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,900
Otherwise, your gastric will become serious.

90
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,180
It's okay, I'm used to it now.

91
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:25,660
Honey.

92
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,060
Xun.

93
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:26,780
Are you okay?

94
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,660
You're having gastric pain again, aren't you?

95
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,500
Come on, let's go to the hospital.

96
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,340
I'm not going.

97
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,500
No, listen to me. Come on.

98
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,740
We're in a critical period now,

99
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,780
I must stay with the team.

100
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,020
You've got us.

101
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:35,380
You have us.

102
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,020
Your health is more important.

103
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:36,860
Yeah.

104
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,340
Look at them.

105
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,140
They're telling you to go to the hospital.

106
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:38,980
Is your work

107
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,220
more important than your health?

108
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,740
We can come back to work later, okay?

109
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,500
Hurry up, help her up.

110
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:43,860
Let's go.

111
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,700
Go, Siyun. I mean it.

112
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,980
I'll leave this to you, Duan.

113
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:46,900
You can stay.

114
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,740
I'll send her to the hospital.

115
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,220
Xun.

116
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:48,980
I'll get the car.

117
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,620
Okay.

118
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:50,860
Be careful, Xun.

119
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,500
Be careful.

120
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,060
Oh, dear, Ning Wei.

121
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,580
You've brought so many things.

122
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,860
Are you going for a beauty pageant?

123
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,020
It's my first time

124
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,900
traveling with Chen Qiang.

125
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,220
Of course I need to bring more cosmetics

126
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:01,900
and clothes.

127
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,740
Look at you.

128
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,220
It's so nice to stay single.

129
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,260
You don't have to bring anything.

130
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,340
Come on, I'm going for an internship.

131
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,460
I'm not going for a beauty pageant.

132
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,580
That's right.

133
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,420
Sang.

134
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,300
You look like

135
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,340
a working professional today.

136
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,380
Nonsense.

137
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,100
Yes.

138
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,100
Good.

139
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,620
I'm trying

140
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,780
to dress formally.

141
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,140
Otherwise,

142
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,140
my boss would think that I'm weird.

143
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,620
By the way,

144
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,460
you'll be staying in the dorm alone.

145
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,580
Will you be scared?

146
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:30,980
I'll be okay.

147
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:31,980
Don't you worry.

148
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:32,660
You don't need to be scared.

149
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,940
The company where I'm doing my internship

150
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,660
is only two hours

151
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,740
away from the dorm.

152
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,380
If you feel scared,

153
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:36,980
call me.

154
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:37,940
I'll come back right away.

155
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,060
Who needs you to accompany her?

156
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,500
She has her "elder brother".

157
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:43,820
Let me have an interview with you.

158
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,540
You start your internship early.

159
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,340
Are you staying

160
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,540
so you can spend more time with him?

161
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,660
I'm staying because I really
want to do the internship...

162
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,740
Okay, say no more.

163
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:52,980
We understand.

164
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,300
Your perfume smells so strong.

165
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:55,860
Does it smell nice?

166
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,500
It's a bit too much.

167
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,300
Is that so?

168
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,300
I think it's all right.

169
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,300
What's the matter?

170
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:08,900
Hello, little demon.

171
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,420
I'm busy dating.

172
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:12,860
By the way,

173
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,540
have you booked your flight ticket?

174
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,180
I'll pick you up at the airport.

175
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,500
Didn't I tell you
that I'm going for an internship,

176
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,260
hence I won't be coming back?

177
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,540
Didn't Dad and Mom tell you?

178
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,580
Say that again.

179
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,940
I finally

180
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,860
got an internship offer.

181
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,180
It's hard

182
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,580
to get an internship offer here.

183
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,500
I've finally gotten an offer.

184
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,300
Of course I need to go.

185
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,580
Besides, Dad and Mom have agreed to this.

186
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,660
I'll give you one more chance.

187
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,580
Think before you speak.

188
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,860
I already...

189
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,260
I did think...

190
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,780
I did think before I speak.

191
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,420
I...

192
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,860

00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,060
I hope that your days at work

383
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,860
would be as bright as the sunflowers.

384
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,260
I like it.

385
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,540
Good.

386
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,220
Let's go.

387
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,220
You must be hungry, right?

388
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,260
No.

389
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,500
Are you going to eat this?

390
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:48,740
Is it yummy?

391
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,140
It's good.

392
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,500
How was your first day

393
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,340
at work?

394
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,420
Tiring?

395
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,700
Is your workload

396
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,380
manageable?

397
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,460
How are your co-workers?

398
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,620
Why are you laughing?

399
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,500
You're acting like...

400
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:15,900
What?

401
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,900
A father.

402
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,860
You're naggy. Don't you think so?

403
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,100
You're really naggy.

404
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,580
You have a lot of questions.

405
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,180
You find me naggy now?

406
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:27,900
Never mind.

407
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,940
You don't have to worry about me.

408
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,730
I'm working now.

409
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,020
I'm a mature adult.

410
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,180
I'm no longer a child.

411
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,180
A mature adult.

412
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:46,900
Very well.

413
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:49,900
And

414
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,180
I have a gift for our little adult.

415
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,380
It's so cute.

416
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,020
It looks like you, isn't it?

417
00:15:59,180 --> 00:15:59,660
Is it

418
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,140
a pig?

419
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,420
It's a rabbit!

420
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,260
How is that a pig?

421
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,260
Its ears are so huge.

422
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,100
It looks like a pig, though.

423
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,060
It looks like Sang Yan.

424
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,540
I got this for you

425
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,060
as I thought of

426
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,580
when I first started my internship,

427
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,140
I was lost and clueless.

428
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,420
I was stressed out.

429
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,220
I tended to doubt myself.

430
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,740
Hence, I hope

431
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,180
that you won't go through this.

432
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,620
That you can be happy

433
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,420
and everything will go well.

434
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,700
Besides, I know

435
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,540
that you stay for the internship

436
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,260
as you want to spend some time

437
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,220
with me.

438
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,100
If you're upset,

439
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,180
just tell it.

440
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,180
It's very stress relieving.

441
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,060
Screw you, Sang Yan.

442
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,540
Did you have a fight with your brother?

443
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,260
How did you know?

444
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,340
I'm not blind.

445
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,340
It's obvious.

446
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,460
He blocked my number.

447
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,540
Why?

448
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:13,860
He doesn't want me

449
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,900
to stay here.

450
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,060
He wants me to go home.

451
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,620
Moreover,

452
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,620
did you tell him

453
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,540
that we...

454
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,140
I haven't told him yet.

455
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,740
I thought

456
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,460
we could go back together this break

457
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,220
to tell him about it.

458
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,820
It's better to tell him in person.

459
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,860
However, now,

460
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,020
we could only go back

461
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,380
during the National Day holidays.

462
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,900
We need to be sincere.

463
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,180
Don't worry about it.

464
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,780
Leave that to me.

465
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,980
He's so childish.

466
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,540
He's really childish.

467
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,100
Looks like I'd need

468
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,180
to buy you a new one soon.

469
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:06,050
[2 July, Monday. Don't doubt yourself. ]

470
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,900
[Face the challenges happily.]

471
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,460
About the creative direction

472
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,260
for the cosmetic advertisement,

473
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,260
I hope that everyone

474
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:13,980
can share their ideas.

475
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,020
But I have two requirements.

476
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,180
It needs to be

477
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,980
more immersive.

478
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:17,700
Any other ideas?

479
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,500
Perhaps we can use blue or green,

480
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,300
the cold colors.

481
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:21,940
Okay.

482
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,540
Handle this.

483
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,420
Put it next.

Good job.

502
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:10,900
I'll treat you to a meal later.

503
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:11,540
Okay.

504
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,100
Sang Zhi.

505
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,300
Do you want to eat something first?

506
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,020
You can continue your task later on.

507
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,500
I'll pass.

508
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:20,900
Okay.

509
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:21,780
Good luck.

510
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:52,820
Hello?

511
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,060
Are you going out to eat now?

512
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,660
Not yet.

513
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,980
I'll go after I'm done with my work.

514
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,700
Have you eaten?

515
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,100
I'll be having a meeting later.

516
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,860
I'm afraid that I'd be too busy to give you a call.

517
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,660
You can let me know

518
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,540
after you're done.

519
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:06,500
Okay.

520
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,660
You're not done yet?

521
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,140
If so, why are you on the phone?

522
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,500
I'll call you later.

523
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,180
I'm sorry.

524
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,020
Please refrain from doing personal stuff

525
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,820
during working hours.

526
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:22,980
Okay.

527
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,180

528
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,580
Xun asks you over.

530
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:35,540
Okay.

531
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,380
You can go first.

534
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,060
I'll clock out now.

535
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,100
My boyfriend is here to pick me up.

536
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,620
Bye.

537
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,180
Can you get off work early today?

538
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,820
I think so.

539
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:03,540
I'm planning

540
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,820
to pick my boyfriend up from work.

541
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,540
I'll give him a surprise.

542
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:06,820
Okay.

543
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:07,660
I'll leave first.

544
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,140
-Goodbye. See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

Xiaoyu.

546
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,820
I've organized the invoices.

547
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,860
Where do I place them?

548
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,260
Just put them on my table.

549
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,500
There's another box here.

550
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,740
Settle it before you leave.

551
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,340
Are you leaving?

552
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:38,700
Let's go.

553
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,260
We'll leave first.

554
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:39,900
Goodbye.

555
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,500
Bye.

556
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,500
Don't stay too late, Sang Zhi.

557
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,340
Bye.

558
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:49,980
Bye, Pengxing.

559
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,140
You're so hardworking, Sang Zhi.

560
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,180
Goodbye.

561
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:57,820
Goodbye.

562
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,340
Why is it reporting an error again?

563
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,980
Am I one of The Powerpuff Girls?

564
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,500
I'm always fixing...

565
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:19,620
I think

566
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,460
that I can't survive until the day of the launch.

567
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,660
Duan.

568
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,340
Duan.

569
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,700
Don't look at me.

570
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,980
I still have a lot on my plate.

571
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,900
You two.

572
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:42,780
No wonder Siyun

00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:14,780
Hop on.

766
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,140
Breakfast.

767
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,060
Let's go.

768
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,380
Did you sleep well yesterday?

769
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:49,620
What's wrong?

770
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,540
Your outfit is still the same.

771
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,580
You look tired.

772
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,980
What did you do last night?

773
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,140
Didn't we bid each other good night?

774
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:05,980
Well...

775
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,420
If you have another

776
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,300
girlfriend,

777
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,460
you should let me know.

778
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,700
Otherwise, you'll be tired.

779
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,580
You'd need to spend time with me during the day

780
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,860
and spend the night

781
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,620
with another girlfriend.

782
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,140
No.

783
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:16,860
Sang Zhi.

784
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,540
I...

785
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,060
I have many sets of this outfit.

786
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,140
Besides, I only have one girlfriend,

787
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:24,900
which is you.

788
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,060
That's more than enough.

789
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,540
Don't try to change the topic.

790
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,100
Be honest with me.

791
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,420
Did you work through the night?

792
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:38,900
No.

793
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,340
I did work overtime,

794
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,780
but I didn't work through the night.

795
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,020
I slept.

796
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,740
I was just afraid that you would be

797
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,660
worried about me.

798
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,460
So,

799
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,940
I didn't tell you about it.

800
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,260
I know.

801
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,740
I'll inform you in advance from now onwards.

802
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,380
Is that okay?

803
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,300
No.

804
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,660
You can tell me about it.

805
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,780
So you don't have to send me to work,

806
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,380
and you can rest in the morning.

807
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,420
No way.

808
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,060
I must still send you to work.

809
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,820
Listen.

810
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,100
You should rest before you go to work,

811
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:42,780
okay?

812
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:43,860
Got it.

813
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,660
All the best, intern!

814
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,460
You keep reminding me

815
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,740
not to skip my meals every day.

816
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,260
You should not do that either.

817
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,660
Otherwise, I'll get mad.

818
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,820
Okay.

819
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:57,660
I'll get going, then.

820
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,460
See you.

821
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,620
Bye.

822
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,380
Hold on.

823
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,060
Okay.

824
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,340
What's the matter, Xiaoyu?

825
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,140
Nothing much.

826
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,620
I have a question.

827
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,100
Are you still in contact

828
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,620
with Duan Jiaxu?

829
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,740
Why do you ask about him?

830
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,700
I saw him in front of

831
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,420
my company.

832
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,780
He's in front of your company?

833
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,220
Well,

834
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,620
do you still remember when we

835
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:17,940
had a meal together?

836
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,020
He brought a girl along.

837
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:19,980
That girl

838
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,940
threw water on you.

839
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,780
That girl

840
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,820
is doing her internship at my company.

841
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,180
I saw

842
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,180
that they're quite close.

843
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:30,820
Wait a minute.

844
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,740
Are they in a relationship?

845
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,020
Are you okay?

846
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:43,860
I'm okay.

847
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,060
Should I come and meet you now?

848
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,420
I'm really fine.

849
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,420
Go to work, Xiaoyu.

850
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:53,860
I'll get back to work now.

851
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,540
Talk to you later.

852
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,380
Goodbye.

853
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,020
Has Xiaoyu told you

854
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:07,980
about her feedback on the slides?

855
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,140
I submitted it to her last night,

856
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,100
but she hasn't replied yet.

857
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,580
It's been a while,

858
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,420
yet she still hasn't replied.

859
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:20,980
Well,

860
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,980
perhaps she has no comments

861
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:23,820
and approves it right away.

862
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,460
Sang Zhi.

863
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,300
Please come over.

864
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,580
Is this your first time doing a proposal?

865
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,340
You're going to show this to the client.

866
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,700
The most basic requirement

867
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,020
is to have a simple yet persuasive layout

868
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,060
and the data must be clear and direct

869
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,060
so the client will understand
the proposal at once.

870
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,900
Look at the title.

871
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,180
The font size is huge,

872
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,260
but the font size of the content is small.

873
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,180
Noted.

874
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,700
As you mentioned

875
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,860
that the font size must follow...

876
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,620
I told you

877
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,700
to not act on your own authority.

878
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,100
Did I ask you to do it like a rigid fool?

879
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,300
Xiaoyu.

880
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,260
Please help me have a look

881
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:06,900
at Jia's draft.

882
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,540
It's really urgent.

883
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,540
Amend it at once.

884
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,780
Improvise

885
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,580
on the original template.

886
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:14,980
Remember,

887
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,780
be simple and organized.

888
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:17,620
Do you understand?

889
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:25,980
What are you doing?

890
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,780
She's just an intern.

891
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,940
Why are you so harsh on her?

892
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,700
Xiaoyu.

893
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,580
I notice

894
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,900
that you don't really like Sang Zhi, do you?

895
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,020
Well...

896
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,940
It's hard for us to hire an intern.

897
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,540
I think Sang Zhi is rather

898
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,420
smart and obedient.

899
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,500
Don't you scare her away

900
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,820
within a month.

901
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:12,900
Obedient?

902
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,740
You don't know what she's like

903
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,740
in private.

904
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,780
Well, judging by your words,

905
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,540
you seem to be upset with her.

906
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,180
She doesn't know anything,

907
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,060
yet she acts like she knows everything.

908
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,020
I just don't like her.

909
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,100
Hello, Ying.

910
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,220
Hello, Xiaoyu.

911
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,580
Let's have a meal

912
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,540
together later.

913
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:09,940
Tonight?

914
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,100
I can't make it tonight.

915
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,300
The company is having
a team-building event tonight.

916
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,420
Where is it?

917
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,660
It's at the karaoke lounge

918
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,580
that we frequent.

919
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,580
I'll talk to you later.

920
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,300
I need to go.

921
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,620
Let's have dinner together next time.

922
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,340
Okay.

923
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,420
See you soon.

924
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:44,620
[Duan Jiaxu]
(How much have you drank?)

925
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,060
[Sang Zhi]
(Just a little.)

926
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,700
(I'm bored.)

927
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,060
(I want to leave here.)

928
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,500
(Find an excuse)

929
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,580
(and I'll pick you up.)

930
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,460
(Okay.)

931
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,020
It's almost the curfew of my dorm now.

932
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:29,340
I'll get going first.

933
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,300
Goodbye.

934
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,020
Next song.

935
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,700
Come on, pass me the microphone.

936
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,340
Pass me the microphone, Ming.

937
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:34,940
This is mine.

938
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,700
There's no good food nearby.

939
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:03,980
The restaurants

940
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:04,540
are closed now.

941
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,260
What did you get?

942
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,580
Supper from one of the restaurants.

943
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,300
Eat up.

944
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:13,500
Here you go.

945
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,340
Thanks.

946
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,260
Just hold on a little longer.

947
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,180
It's always hard in the beginning.

948
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,620
Back then, Xun and I

949
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:24,820
always did coding

950
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:25,540
till sunrise.

951
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:26,940
Eat up.

952
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,020
I really miss

953
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:31,700
my bed.

954
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:34,580
I wonder

955
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,820
if my fish are still alive.

956
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,060
After this,

957
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,340
I want to go to the beach,

958
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,980
stay in the biggest sea-view room,

959
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,860
and enjoy the sunset.

960
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:43,660
Sure.

961
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,900
Send me the receipt

962
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:45,660
for reimbursement.

963
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:46,340
Really?

964
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,260
Thank you, Duan.

965
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,100
Duan.

966
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,740
After this,

967
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:50,900
what's your plan?

968
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,140
I'll be moving into a new place.

969
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:56,260
After that,

970
00:43:58,620 --> 00:43:59,580
I'll spend time with my girlfriend.

971
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,300
I want to have a girlfriend, too.

972
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:06,860
Well,

973
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,460
you should wait until your program

974
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,100
is working fine.

975
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:10,580
You're right.

976
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:11,940
Let's hurry up and eat.

977
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:12,980
Let's get back to coding after this.

978
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,020
When my program no longer has an error,

979
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:14,940
I'll get a girlfriend.

980
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:15,740
Eat up.

981
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,460
You don't have to be that serious.

982
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:18,500
Eat up.

983
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:21,860
Hurry up.

984
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:22,540
Eat up.
