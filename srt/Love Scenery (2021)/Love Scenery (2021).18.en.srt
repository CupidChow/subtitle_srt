*[Episode 18]

3
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,800
What's wrong with Liang Chen?

4
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,720
What else could it be?

5
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,280
It's like...

6
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,840
Well, the doctor said

7
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,080
her throat...

8
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,078
The vocal cords.

9
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,239
Vocal polyps.

10
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,439
Yes!

11
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,400
That's the one.

12
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,320
See, Ms Ma is the experienced one.

13
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,040
Liang Chen

14
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,760
must be feeling depressed now.

15
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:13,143
This is where I normally compose music.

16
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,920
It's my workplace in general.

17
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,240
I need to answer a call.

18
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,680
Feel free to look around.

19
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,680
Okay.

20
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
Hi, Jia Yun.

21
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,175
Liang Chen.

22
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,440
Tomorrow noon,

23
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,714
could you spare me some time?

24
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,878
Why?

25
00:02:37,985 --> 00:02:38,824
[This is the thing.]

26
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,000
My uncle

27
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,760
is an otolaryngologist.

28
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,240
He is a leading expert
in treating vocal polyps.

29
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,885
[I've shown him your medical record.]

30
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,000
[He made a new diagnosis
and treatment plan for you.]

31
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,680
I hope you can meet
him as soon as possible.

32
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,240
Treatment plan? Is it surgery?

33
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,560
Surgery might be unavoidable.

34
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,639
Thanks, Jia Yun.

35
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,320
I need some time to think it over.

36
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,220
Okay.

37
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,039
Once you made up your mind,

38
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,200
let me know.

39
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,721
Okay.

40
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,995
What are you looking at?

41
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,200
This is Foster's violin.

42
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,600
How do you know about it?

43
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,878
This is a handmade violin from the UK.

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,320
I have an identical one.

45
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,640
You know how to play violin?

46
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,800
I can play all your songs.

47
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,320
Can I have a listen?

48
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,948
No problem.

49
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,000
But...

50
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,880
You have to promise me one thing.

51
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,800
What is it?

52
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,080
I will let you know later.

53
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,800
I still remember I once went to school,

54
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,080
I overheard someone playing this song.

55
00:05:54,073 --> 00:05:56,513
That was not you, right?

56
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,160
You overheard it?

57
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,600
I never would have
thought that you could play so well.

58
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,920
Actually I saw you that day.

59
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,920
I was in my car.

60
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,320
Were you outside?

61
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,920
I recognized you at first glance.

62
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,560
Why are you giggling?

63
00:06:30,268 --> 00:06:31,704
I see something

64
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,280
on your face.

65
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,206
Is it dirt?

66
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,526
Eye boogers.

67
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:45,952
I'm just kidding.
You actually believed it?

68
00:06:47,966 --> 00:06:48,994
Of course not.

69
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,200
You look happy,

70
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,400
so I'm willing to play along.

71
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,987
Senior.

72
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,040
It's time for you to keep your promise.

73
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,520
What promise?

74
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,520
Please get your medical treatment.

75
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,250
But...

76
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,520
I'm afraid.

77
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,320
Senior.

78
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,200
If this accident hadn't taken place,

79
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,160
once you are 30 years old,

80
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,880
or even 40 years old,

81
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,639
would your voice still be the same?

82
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,760
Of course not.

83
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,520
Will you still be singing then?

84
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,320
I will sing as long as I live.

85
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,200
Your voice quality

86
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,960
might change as age catches up,

87
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,840
but your strength won't be weakened,

88
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,055
and technique will
gradually get stronger too.

89
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,720
I believe

90
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,520
the change

91
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,680
would just be in your tone

92
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,636
or singing techniques.

93
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,360
Right?

94
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,830
Do you really think I can do it?

95
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,280
There are so many songs

96
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,745
I want to hear you sing.

97
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,920
Jia Yun, sorry to interrupt

98
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,160
and calling you

99
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,000
late at night.

100
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,080
[It's fine.]

101
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,400
I've been waiting for your call.

102
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,200
I've made up my mind.

103
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,240
I want to go for medical treatment.

104
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,280
So I wonder if you could

105
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,160
help me to contact your uncle?

106
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,400
[I knew it.]

107
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,040
[You would make the right choice.]

108
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,326
What's going on?

109
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,760
I'm here just to take two books.

110
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,600
You've been out

111
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,360
all night.

112
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,280
Where were you?

113
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,428
I met a friend, that's all.

114
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,080
Then...

115
00:10:32,986 --> 00:10:34,177
Did you both

116
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,880
have fun?

117
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,240
What are you all trying to imply?

118
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,520
Nothing, nothing.

119
00:10:43,154 --> 00:10:45,314
Oh yes, your virtual friend,

120
00:10:46,248 --> 00:10:47,808
is she from our school?

121
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,934
Yes.

122
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,359
What's wrong with you all?

123
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,720
Jing, I...

124
00:10:59,114 --> 00:11:01,634
I know this is not an easy journey,

125
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,600
but just ignore
those judgemental ones.

126
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,640
Keep it up!

127
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,560
We'll always back you up.

128
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,880
Are you all stalking me?

129
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,040
Don't you spread one word about it.

130
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,098
We understand.

131
00:11:24,312 --> 00:11:25,799
If this was made known to others,

132
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,240
it won't be good for both of you.

133
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,680
Don' worry, Jing.

134
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,640
It's a deal.

135
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,480
I'm leaving.

136
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,440
Hi, Qi Qi.

137
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,240
I've dressed my wound.

138
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,120
Just attend your class.

139
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,496
You don't have to pick me up.

140
00:12:00,848 --> 00:12:01,684
Bye.

141
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,863
What are you doing?

142
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,400
Be careful, my leg!

143
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,600
What are you trying to do?

144
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,040
Aren't you wounded?

145
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,348
We are escorting you to class.

146
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,640
We'll soon be family.

147
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,880
You just cannot count on this person,

148
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,920
going to class by himself
without even thinking to help out.

149
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,760
Exactly.

150
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,240
But please don't worry.

151
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,680
We will admonish him later.

152
00:12:25,928 --> 00:12:28,408
Say, he doesn't even know
how to be tender and loving.

153
00:12:29,073 --> 00:12:31,033
He's bad at caring for others.

154
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,199
Keep your voice down!

155
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,359
He told us not to be ostentatious.

156
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,533
Ostentatious? Seriously?

157
00:12:35,614 --> 00:12:36,894
We are helping him.

158
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,720
What are you talking about?

159
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,720
Go to class.

160
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,240
-Help!
-Come, over here.

161
00:13:09,777 --> 00:13:11,143
[When is your appointment
with the doctor?]

162
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,720
[At 3pm.]

163
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,400
[Okay, let me know if you need anything.]

164
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,520
You are seeing doctor this afternoon.

165
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,000
We'll go with you.

166
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,800
Don't worry, Jia Yun will be there.

167
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,280
You were against
getting the surgery, right?

168
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,080
What changed your mind?

169
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,960
I've thought this through.

170
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,240
Even without surgery,

171
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,640
as age catches up,

172
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,400
my voice will still change.

173
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,320
But not my skills.

174
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,960
As far as my techniques go,
they will only get better.

175
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,680
It's my voice that changes.

176
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:00,761
Just a different singing technique.

177
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,480
So, It's not that scary after all.

178
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,920
I'm a roly-poly,

179
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,566
not so easily beatable.

180
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,840
Chen Chen.

181
00:14:20,418 --> 00:14:21,668
We have faith in you.

182
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,480
I have to go.

183

*[Tai He Medical Hall]

184
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,160
How is it, uncle?

185
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,720
In my opinion,

186
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,600
you don't need a surgery for this.

187
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,200
When you were first diagnosed,

188
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,640
it was due to over-usage of your voice,

189
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:10,896
which caused haemorrhage from phonotrauma.

190
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,039
There was inflammation.

191
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,319
When you got a laryngoscopy,

192
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,840
it looked rather severe.

193
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,280
Now the result shows that

194
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,520
the inflammation has healed.

195
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,560
Redness and swelling are basically gone.

196
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Most importantly, your polyps are not big.

197
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,040
I will prescribe some medication,

198
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,320
and combine it with nebulization.

199
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,280
A complete recovery is highly possible.

200
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,640
Is that so? That's wonderful.

201
00:15:33,721 --> 00:15:34,921
Thank you very much.

202
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,320
But please take precaution in the future.

203
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,960
Do not overuse your voice.

204
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,678
Have a light diet.

205
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:41,999
Take note on work-rest balance,

206
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,680
Take good care of your vocal cords.

207
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:44,639
Don't worry.

208
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,600
I'll take good care of

209
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
of my own vocal cords.

210
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
That's great.

211
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,040
Jia Yun.

212
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,280
Thank you so much.

213
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,640
I'm glad you're alright now.

214
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,920
I'm surprised that I don't
have to go through surgery.

215
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,160
What wonderful news.

216
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,880
Lu Lu Xiu.

217
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,720
Is she alright now?

218
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,000
Shan Shan, what brings you here?

219
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,000
I...

220
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,960
I was on the way, so I decided to drop by.

221
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,649
Jia Yun.

222
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,800
You both take your time.

223
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,960
I'll be off.

224
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,040
Jia Yun, I can't thank
you enough for everything.

225
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,080
I'll treat you to a meal.

226
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,042
Sure.

227
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,417
-Bye.
-Bye.

228
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,520
Let's go in.

229
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,240
Is that for me?

230
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,680
Here's the old duck
soup from behind the campus.

231
00:18:24,297 --> 00:18:26,337
I remember it was your favourite.

232
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:29,505
It has been a long time
since I last had it.

233
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,960
It still tastes as good as it used to be.

234
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,040
Seems like it's still the same owner.

235
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,520
Are you okay?

236
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,480
I'm fine, why?

237
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,640
I heard from Sun Bin Yu

238
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,600
there's something wrong
with your vocal cords.

239
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,999
I went for a consultation today.

240
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,280
The doctor told me

241
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,720
that my vocal cords can recover.

242
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,200
I'm glad. I was so worried.

243
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,989
Glad that you're fine.

244
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,280
You treat your vocal cords
as important as your life.

245
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,200
When I got here, I was thinking
how I should console you.

246
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,960
I was thinking,
it doesn't really matter anyway.

247
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,080
I stayed away from music for so long,

248
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,200
yet I'm still doing fine, aren't I?

249
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,960
Take more.

250
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:35,259
I'll leave you be.

251
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,040
Shan Shan.

252
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,640
Could you stay a little longer with me?

253
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,080
What's wrong?

254
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,920
I have no idea what's up with me.

255
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,600
Perhaps

256
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,720
I'm still frightened.

257
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
I thought

258
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,040
I could no longer sing like I used to be.

259
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,760
You have no idea.

260
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,720
When I got my letter of diagnosis,

261
00:20:10,855 --> 00:20:12,040
I was really shocked.

262
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,400
I was thinking,

263
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,440
if I couldn't sing any more,

264
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,520
what else could I do?

265
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,280
I couldn't just be an airhead.

266
00:20:43,465 --> 00:20:44,440
Everything is alright now.

267
00:20:47,989 --> 00:20:48,973
It's alright now.

268
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,482
*[Liang Chen]

269
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,840
Hi, how is everything going?

270
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,600
Where are you?

271
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,080
Wait for me. I will be right there.

272
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,468
Aunty.

273
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,874
-Aunty.
-Who's that?

274
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,360
Stop shouting.

275
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,400
The place is closed.

276
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,680
What do you want?

277
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,440
Aunty, my girlfriend is in danger.

278
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,640
Could you open the door for me?

279
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:05,096
Young people nowadays are impulsive.

280
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,680
Just stay calm.

281
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,040
Don't quarrel.

282
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,680
Everything will be okay.

283
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,160
Just persuade her gently will do.

284
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,560
Everything will
eventually fall into place.

285
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,320
Thanks, aunty.

286
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,040
Be careful!

287
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,080
No quarrelling!

288
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,440
Liang Chen!

289
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,320
Call me 'senior'.

290
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,760
Are you okay?

291
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,600
I went to the hospital today.

292
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,840
The doctor said,

293
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,720
I can no longer sing.

294
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,960
Don't worry.

295
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,520
There will always be other options.

296
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,480
But please don't harm yourself.

297
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,620
I'm kidding!

298
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:40,679
It's not serious.

299
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,920
No surgery required.

300
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,400
Are you...

301
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,960
angry?

302
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,360
Please don't be mad at me.

303
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,320
I was just joking with you.

304
00:24:09,632 --> 00:24:11,952
Okay, I'm sorry.

305
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,240
Okay, I'm not angry any more,

306
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,080
for the sake of your pitiful look.

307
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,880
How dare you lie to me?

308
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,720
Senior.

309
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,920
Can I be your boyfriend?

310
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,547
That depends on your performance.

311
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,200
Then can I

312
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,160
hold your hand?

313
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,320
No, you can't.

314
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,200
Then what about...

315
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,720
No, you can't.

316
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,988
What I'm trying to say is,

317
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,160
can I send you home?

318
00:26:50,697 --> 00:26:52,137
That's...okay.

319
00:26:52,218 --> 00:26:53,879
It's late now after all.

320
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,082
Senior.

321
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,120
Are you a roly-poly?

322
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,600
What do you mean by that?

323
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,282
You always think the other way round.

324
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,080
Lu Jing.

325
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,080
Thank you very much.

326
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,000
I always have my head in the cloud.

327
00:27:39,145 --> 00:27:41,025
Thanks for being with me during this time.

328
00:27:41,823 --> 00:27:42,903
Or else,

329
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,732
I tend to take things too hard.

330
00:27:44,854 --> 00:27:46,414
Do you feel relieved now?

331
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,080
I feel like

332
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,720
I've gotten back something
I had lost earlier.

333
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:56,272
I've also figured out that

334
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,640
I should start over again.

335
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,680
What you mean by starting all over again?

336
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,720
As for my future,

337
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,600
the moment when I
was ready for surgery

338
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,039
I've planned

339
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,440
for the worst scenario
of losing everything.

340
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,960
But when I found out
I didn't have to have surgery,

341
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,360
the very first thought
that came to me was that

342
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,120
from now on,

343
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,560
I'll only sing

344
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,360
the songs that I myself like.

345
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,520
Then?

346
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,800
Then what?

347
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,160
Am I not part of your

348
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,640
future planning?

349
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,186
It's cold in the corridor.

350
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,800
Go inside and rest.

351
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,555
Good night.

352
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,844
Good night.

353
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,680
Bye.

354
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,200
Waiting for me?

355
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,120
You're back.

356
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,400
No class tomorrow?

357
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,640
Throwing garbage again?

358
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,000
Obviously.
I can't be patrolling the grounds.

359
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,440
I think that's a good idea.

360
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,599
The neighbourhood is
not quite safe recently.

361
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,400
I can hardly see a patrol guard.

362
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,320
Don't worry. It's very safe.

363
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,142
What an amorous smile.

364
00:30:20,223 --> 00:30:21,823
Something good happened recently?

365
00:30:23,136 --> 00:30:24,656
Good thing?

366
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,440
You mean love?

367
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,120
How dare you talk about
love in front of a bachelor.

368
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,920
Lu Jing, that's too much!

369
00:30:32,552 --> 00:30:34,592
Okay, then stop talking about love.

370
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,520
Let's talk about dreams.

371
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,160
Bye.

372
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,440
Come, let's go home.

373
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,040
He's too arrogant.

374
00:30:50,488 --> 00:30:53,128
Flaunting about love and ideals.

375
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,120
As if he is the only one
who is experienced.

376
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,600
Deep inside the inferno,

377
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,680
I'm waiting in the ceaseless night.

378
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,880
I'm petrified.

379
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,520
In the starless night,

380
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,040
I lost my direction.

381
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,920
In the beginning, I waited.

382
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,800
Then I discovered

383
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,280
that waiting

384
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,320
has become habitual.

385
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,120
What can't ruin us,

386
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,720
will eventually make us stronger.

387
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,745
Profits aside,

388
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,360
the annual cash flow will be secured.

389
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,599
I'm not accepting this offer.

390
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,160
Give it to those who are interested.

391
00:31:46,334 --> 00:31:47,894
Isn't it just about financial gain?

392
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,293
With stage plays,

393
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:50,614
you can feed yourself for sure.

394
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,960
But what about others?

395
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,040
Okay, fine.

396
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,400
I'm going on stage soon.

397
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,840
I have to revise and memorize my lines.

398
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,040
Hi, Yu Ke.

399
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,493
I have a great news.

400
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,960
It's almost full house today.

401
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:15,544
The boss had mentioned that

402
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,880
if there's a further
increase in ticket sales,

403
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,320
I might become the male lead!

404
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,429
[Taro.]

405
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,480
[I think we should break up.]

406
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,040
Why?

407
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,468
[You can put the blame on me,]

408
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,640
[but I don't want my parents to worry.]

409
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,960
[I'm under great pressure.]

410
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,040
Okay.

411
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:44,640
I got it.

412
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:47,481
Oh, yes. You have an early flight

413
00:32:47,562 --> 00:32:49,682
tomorrow morning, right?

414
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,360
Remember to take your breakfast.

415
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,386
Don't upset your stomach.

416
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,360
Also, try not to stay up too late.

417
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,738
Understand?

418
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,480
[Taro, I...]

419
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,640
There you are again.

420
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,400
You've become the prince
of commercial performance?

421
00:33:26,742 --> 00:33:29,422
How about your dream
of going to Renyi Theatre?

422
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,240
Dreams are not edible.

423
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,960
Put food on the table comes first.

424
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:44,773
*[The Knowley Night]

425
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,040
Now, let's invite our
dream guest to the stage.

426
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,840
Hey, beauty.

427
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,560
Why not you go up first.

428
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,520
I'm having chest tightness.

429
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,880
Shan Shan.

430
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,439
I heard you come from a musical family.

431
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,760
You know various kinds
of music instruments.

432
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,600
You even won a big award
for playing jazz drum.

433
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,080
Why didn't you pursue music

434
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,670
but became an actress instead?

435
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,760
I've been studying music
for more than a decade.

436
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,920
If it wasn't my own persistence,

437
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,360
you couldn't possibly insist that I did.

438
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,040
Come on, let's play for all of us.

439
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:59,400
Play the drums!

440
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,520
Play the drums!

441
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,800
Play the drums!

442
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,480
Miss, you were really cool just now!

443
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,680
So cool!

444
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,879
Thank you.

445
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,320
Do you have performances lined up?

446
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,680
I mean musical performances.

447
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,719
Do let me know if there's any.

448
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,160
I will be there to support you.

449
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,760
This is my last musical performance.

450
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,720
You play so well. Why stop?

451
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,960
That's none of your business.

452
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,400
'Life without music'

453
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,840
'is pretty much meaningless.'

454
00:36:26,054 --> 00:36:27,174
Is that your motto?

455
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:29,495
It sounds familiar. Who said it?

456
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,523
Nietzsche.
*[Same pronounciation as guess who?]

457
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,160
Not you? Who then?

458
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,760
You left me out to dry?

459
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,640
You haven't told me who said it.

460
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,083
Miss!

461
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,560
She really stopped playing music.

462
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,600
She then became famous as a comedian.

463
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,580
("Twilight of the Idols")

464
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,720
Thank you.

465
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,360
Ms Liang, you follow this program too?

466
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,880
I've been watching a
few episodes in a row.

467
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,839
Is it very popular?

468
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,480
Yes, it is immensely popular.

469
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,480
There are a lot of great musicians there.

470
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,280
It's really a musical feast.

471
00:37:59,622 --> 00:38:02,062
If I take part,

472
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,600
would I win?

473
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,880
I think it'd be tough.

474
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,080
You aren't really thinking
to take part, right?

475
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,120
Please don't. If you screwed up,

476
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,960
you'd ruin your hard-earned reputation.

477
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,880
I need to go to the wash room.

482
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,978
This is the latest work schedule.

483
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,160
Have a look.

484
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,720
Is that all I've got?

485
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,120
You voice hasn't fully recovered yet.

486
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,720
These jobs won't use your voice a lot.

487
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:07,679
But I'm not interested in these.

488
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,320
All I want is music-related work.

489
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,520
What's on your mind?

490
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,234
Are you aware of a program

491
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,520
called 'Journey of Music Lovers'?

492
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,640
You want to try it out?

493
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,440
The agency is well aware of this program.

494
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,519
In this program,

495
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,920
every singer

496
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,720
has their own distinctive style.

497
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,040
Lisa is representing the pop genre.

498
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,920
I want to attempt rock music.

499
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,200
Do you still remember

500
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,920
the rehearsal video in Shanghai

501
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,880
that was leaked?

502
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,520
[Is that Liang Chen?]

503
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,200
[Why is her style so different?]

504
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,919
[The agency should take the blame.]

505
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,600
[Don't they know her positioning?]

506
00:39:47,681 --> 00:39:49,961
[It doesn't suit Liang Chen at all.]

507
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,880
First of all,

508
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,120
your voice has yet to fully recover.

509
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,120
Secondly,

510
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,990
the agency does not recommend
an abrupt change in style.

511
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,033
As for me,

512
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,159
I hope you can be more discerning

513
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,840
and think about it thoroughly.

514
00:40:07,887 --> 00:40:09,047
I've made up my mind.

515
00:40:09,535 --> 00:40:10,855
I'm joining the program.

516
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,720
Sure, I will speak to the agency.

517
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,449
Thanks.
