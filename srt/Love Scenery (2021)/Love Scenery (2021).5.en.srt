*[Episode 5]

3
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:04,841
That was scary.

4
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:06,960
I thought we'd turn into boxes.

5
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,800
It was so dangerous.

6
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:11,081
Why didn't you hide?

7
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:12,641
We sink or swim together.

8
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:27,401
Why do I feel

9
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:30,001
there's something wrong with Jing today.

10
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:31,481
What's wrong?

11
00:02:32,081 --> 00:02:33,801
You were like this

12
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,279
when you chased me back then.

13
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:37,431
Did your brain short-circuited?

14
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:38,641
Who chased who?

15
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:40,641
I chased you.

16
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:42,481
I chased you, yes I did.

17
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,208
It's so high. I can't get up there.

18
00:02:58,967 --> 00:03:00,607
You're so weak. You can't do it for sure.

19
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:02,961
I... I'm not weak.

20
00:03:03,735 --> 00:03:05,894
Let me show you.

21
00:03:06,007 --> 00:03:07,632
I'll go up first and you follow me.

22
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:21,345
That was a misstep.

23
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:36,681
I know, a misstep.

24
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:37,681
No need to tell me.

25
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:47,441
Good luck.

26
00:04:03,121 --> 00:04:04,641
Something is wrong
with the programming.

27
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:06,281
There seems

28
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,521
to be an air wall up there.

29
00:04:10,936 --> 00:04:11,736
I've come over.

30
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,800
There is a hole here.

31
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,808
Quickly get in here.

32
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:21,751
You think I'll crawl
into the hole like a dog?

33
00:04:24,201 --> 00:04:25,001
Yup.

34
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,640
Don't mind me. I'll try again.

35
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:54,961
Didn't you say you wanted to
climb over the wall?

36
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:00,761
If you

37
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:03,361
had crawled into that hole
with me earlier,

38
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:05,481
we would have finished
the task long ago.

39
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:08,641
There must be a bug in the new copy.

40
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:10,161
What?

41
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:12,551
A bug.

42
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:20,384
I thought

43
00:05:20,465 --> 00:05:22,865
I've found something new.

44
00:05:43,872 --> 00:05:45,752
I'll go offline first.
I have class tomorrow.

45
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:47,601
Good night.

46
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:49,495
Good night.

47
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:37,840
Alright, get ready.

48
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,880
Action!

49
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:03,081
Cut!

50
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,295
Is this your first kiss on screen?

51
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:10,529
Are... Are you kidding me?

52
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:13,601
My kisses are textbook.

53
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:15,264
One more time.

54
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:17,687
Clapper.

55
00:09:19,447 --> 00:09:20,687
Alright, ready?

56
00:09:20,888 --> 00:09:21,733
Action!

57
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:41,521
What?

58
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,880
Well...

59
00:10:01,497 --> 00:10:02,366
That's enough.

60
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,201
I... I'm sorry, Ms Ma.

61
00:10:05,321 --> 00:10:06,561
I really couldn't help it.

62
00:10:06,641 --> 00:10:08,751
No, no, no. I didn't mean it.

63
00:10:08,831 --> 00:10:09,951
Ms Ma...

64
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:12,231
I... I'm sorry.

65
00:10:16,455 --> 00:10:18,095
You! What were you doing?

66
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:19,336
Didn't I tell you to fake it?

67
00:10:19,681 --> 00:10:20,681
No, Director He...

68
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:23,401
I... I really didn't mean it.

69
00:10:23,601 --> 00:10:24,401
No need to explain.

70
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,830
I know you.

71
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:27,441
Director...

72
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:30,719
You know I'm not that kind of person.

73
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:33,801
Is your intimate scene with Ms Ma

74
00:10:34,121 --> 00:10:34,921
enough?

75
00:10:35,623 --> 00:10:37,983
Enough!

76
00:10:38,182 --> 00:10:38,982
Enough?

77
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:40,321
I was going to add more for you.

78
00:10:40,402 --> 00:10:41,202
Forget it.

79
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:44,241
Do it. Do it.

80
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:47,041
Okay.

81
00:10:49,184 --> 00:10:50,061
Thank you, sir.

82
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:00,888
Lu Jing.

83
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
Lu Jing, do you have class in the morning?

84
00:11:05,761 --> 00:11:06,561
Yes.

85
00:11:09,281 --> 00:11:11,721
We're going to celebrate
the university anniversary.

86
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,560
Are you going to perform?

87
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,400
I heard you play good violin.

88
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:17,007
I'm not attending.

89
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:19,881
But I heard that Liang Chen will come.

90
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:22,081
Really?

91
00:11:22,841 --> 00:11:23,641
Who told you?

92
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:24,978
My friend.

93
00:11:25,062 --> 00:11:26,462
She is the Student Council president.

94
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,280
*[Famous Alumni]

95
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,240
Lu Jing, I'll go on stage
to present flowers on that day.

96
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:33,239
Would you like to be my escort?

97
00:11:34,112 --> 00:11:35,312
No, thanks.

98
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,822
Lu Jing,

99
00:11:36,903 --> 00:11:38,703
don't you like Liang Chen?

100
00:11:38,784 --> 00:11:40,104
Why do you not want to come?

101
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:43,671
How do you know I like her?

102
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:46,902
I heard from other people.

103
00:11:46,983 --> 00:11:49,583
They said you have
many Liang Chen's albums.

104
00:11:51,863 --> 00:11:53,223
I also like Tesla.

105
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:56,009
What are you guys talking about?

106
00:11:59,401 --> 00:12:01,241
I'll go to class first.

107
00:12:09,631 --> 00:12:10,831
What were you talking about?

108
00:12:11,641 --> 00:12:12,638
University anniversary celebration.

109
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:13,999
She asked if I want to go on stage.

110
00:12:15,489 --> 00:12:16,400
What for?

111
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,390
Perform?

112
00:12:17,494 --> 00:12:19,414
Yeah, I'll sign up tomorrow.

113
00:12:24,783 --> 00:12:25,783
Really?

114
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,251
What are you going to perform?

115
00:12:27,601 --> 00:12:28,480
Playing violin?

116
00:12:28,561 --> 00:12:29,900
Crushing boulder on my chest.

117
00:12:32,391 --> 00:12:33,311
Are you serious?

118
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:36,352
Will lying to you do me good?

119
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:40,561
It's surprising.

120
00:12:41,521 --> 00:12:43,361
A delicate-featured man like you

121
00:12:43,671 --> 00:12:45,151
has such a special skill.

122
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:56,087
Students, let's start the class.

123
00:12:59,878 --> 00:13:01,518
Can I leave now?

124
00:13:06,601 --> 00:13:07,681
Do you know who he is?

125
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:11,992
"Three-Nos" Professor Liu.

126
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,240
The head of department
who tolerates no tardiness,

127
00:13:14,486 --> 00:13:16,686
no early dismissal and no phones.

128
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:21,072
But I'm supposed to be
at my department head's class now.

129
00:13:27,471 --> 00:13:28,831
The student at the back.

130
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,361
The one in black.

131
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:37,961
Don't look at others. I'm talking to you.

132
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,480
Right, it's you.

133
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,240
I have never seen you before.

134
00:13:43,183 --> 00:13:44,583
Are you from our department?

135
00:13:46,801 --> 00:13:48,601
No... No.

136
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,556
Then why are you attending this class?

137
00:13:51,637 --> 00:13:52,637
I...

138
00:13:55,441 --> 00:13:56,532
I'm keeping him company.

139
00:14:38,241 --> 00:14:40,032
[I've come over. There is a hole here.]

140
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,062
[Quickly get in here.]

141
00:14:41,143 --> 00:14:42,623
[You think I'll crawl into
that hole like a dog?]

142
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:46,001
[I thought]

143
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:48,521
[I've found something new.]

144
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:56,761
Liang Chen,

145
00:14:56,857 --> 00:14:58,497
what are you thinking?

146
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,560
Let's try something different today.

147
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:02,599
Like what?

148
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:04,941
I wrote this on a whim last night.

149
00:15:05,022 --> 00:15:06,382
It is different
from our previous genres.

150
00:15:06,463 --> 00:15:07,983
I've incorporated electronic music.

151
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:09,841
Let's try it.

152
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,150
-Well?
-It's upbeat and fun.

153
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,879
Let's give it a go?

154
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:24,879
Sure.

155
00:16:10,281 --> 00:16:12,041
It's the first time
they're trying this genre.

156
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:13,599
It's quite interesting.

157
00:16:39,095 --> 00:16:40,695
Is this a new song you wrote?

158
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,121
-What do you think?
-Very nice.

159
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,779
It's different from your previous genres.

160
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,400
I want to try something new.

161
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,560
But I'm still figuring things out.

162
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:50,801
By the way,

163
00:16:51,391 --> 00:16:53,551
there'll be
a private music party tomorrow.

164
00:16:53,807 --> 00:16:55,767
Many famous bands will be there.

165
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,920
Would you like to come?

166
00:16:57,348 --> 00:16:59,308
Will Salted Fish Band be there?

167
00:17:00,342 --> 00:17:02,284
I guess so.

168
00:17:03,721 --> 00:17:05,041
So are you coming?

169
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,241
Okay.

170
00:17:06,616 --> 00:17:07,576
That's settled then.

171
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,160
Call the manager of Salted Fish Band
for me.

172
00:17:36,773 --> 00:17:37,789
*[Liu Shun]

173
00:17:38,997 --> 00:17:39,859
Hello, Da Shun.

174
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:41,601
What's up?

175
00:17:41,689 --> 00:17:43,089
[Can you go to a place with me tonight?]

176
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:44,761
[My colleague gave me two tickets]

177
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:45,881
[of a private music party.]

178
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,520
[There'll be many hot girls.]

179
00:17:48,207 --> 00:17:49,219
A party?

180
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:51,001
Do you think I dance?

181
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:53,041
[Just go to have some fun.]

182
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:54,681
[I don't want to go alone.]

183
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,519
-No.
-[Come on.]

184
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,680
[Last time, I gave you]

185
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,320
[Liang Chen's special edition gift.]

186
00:18:00,401 --> 00:18:02,201
[Can you do me a favour this time?]

187
00:18:04,161 --> 00:18:04,961
Okay.

188
00:18:28,721 --> 00:18:29,521
What's wrong?

189
00:18:30,281 --> 00:18:31,551
I'm allergic to pollen.

190
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:34,966
I'm sorry.

191
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:36,111
It's fine.

192
00:18:37,361 --> 00:18:38,441
Please wait a second.

193
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:40,170
Are you cold?

194
00:18:40,551 --> 00:18:41,351
No.

195
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:44,321
Hello.

196
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,761
Can I give the kid a bouquet of flowers?

197
00:18:47,144 --> 00:18:47,944
Yes.

198
00:18:52,601 --> 00:18:53,401
Do you like it?

199
00:18:53,521 --> 00:18:54,321
Yes, I do.

200
00:18:54,402 --> 00:18:55,485
Say thank you.

201
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,280
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

202
00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:01,454
-Bye bye.
-Bye bye.

203
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:04,601
Let's go.

204
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:40,321
Are you going to sell insurance?

205
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:43,159
Okay, my bad.

206
00:19:43,241 --> 00:19:44,041
Let's go in.

207
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:46,759
Few people know about this party.

208
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,520
Only those in the industry were invited.

209
00:19:48,671 --> 00:19:50,351
Maybe we'll get to meet some bands

210
00:19:50,432 --> 00:19:51,912
that you know.

211
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,001
Let's go.

212
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:21,281
A masquerade party?

213
00:20:21,401 --> 00:20:22,521
It's interesting.

214
00:20:23,241 --> 00:20:24,201
Pick a mask.

215
00:20:31,712 --> 00:20:32,512
Jia Yun,

216
00:20:32,696 --> 00:20:33,937
you can wear this.

217
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:34,921
Okay.

218
00:20:36,056 --> 00:20:37,656
And I'll wear this.

219
00:20:39,641 --> 00:20:40,441
How do I look?

220
00:20:40,881 --> 00:20:41,681
You look handsome.

221
00:20:42,681 --> 00:20:43,961
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

222
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:02,961
It's very different from what I thought.

223
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:03,841
Really?

224
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,576
Hi, would you like something to drink?

225
00:21:07,902 --> 00:21:09,182
Would you like some wine?

226
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,366
Can I?

227
00:21:10,481 --> 00:21:11,921
Forget it. You can have orange juice.

228
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:13,081
Let me try it.

229
00:21:13,161 --> 00:21:13,961
Really?

230
00:21:14,704 --> 00:21:15,744
Enjoy yourselves.

231
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,399
I have to pick up a call.

232
00:21:20,444 --> 00:21:21,920
-Are you fine to be alone?
-Yes.

233
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:23,616
Alright, I'll be right back.

234
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Sorry. Sorry.

235
00:21:29,846 --> 00:21:31,006
It's okay.

236
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:37,201
Can you give me a napkin?

237
00:21:37,281 --> 00:21:38,081
Thank you.

238
00:21:40,361 --> 00:21:41,241
Thank you.

239
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,440
Go ahead.

240
00:21:59,521 --> 00:22:01,281
No, no. I need more time.

241
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:05,401
I'll get you another drink.

242
00:22:05,623 --> 00:22:06,423
Okay.

243
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:10,385
One more.

244
00:22:20,504 --> 00:22:22,253
Give me a glass of the strongest liquor.

245
00:22:23,361 --> 00:22:24,361
You're back.

246
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:30,120
Is this for me?

247
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,160
Thank you.

248
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,840
Jia Yun, this is so strong.

249
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:40,969
One more of this. Thank you.

250
00:22:49,024 --> 00:22:49,824
Drink it.

251
00:22:53,161 --> 00:22:54,801
Hello, everyone. We're Salted Fish.

252
00:22:56,521 --> 00:22:59,601
Salted Fish! Salted Fish! Salted Fish!

253
00:22:59,848 --> 00:23:03,568
Salted Fish! Salted Fish! Salted Fish!

254
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,926
I mistook someone else for you.

255
00:25:29,997 --> 00:25:31,877
I know you wouldn't give me wine.

256
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:33,318
It's impossible. But...

257
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:34,238
I'll take you home.

258
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:36,559
But the Salted Fish Band is so...

259
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,120
Let me tell you. They're so...

260
00:25:39,641 --> 00:25:40,441
Watch out.

261
00:25:44,536 --> 00:25:45,416
You're drunk.

262
00:25:46,606 --> 00:25:47,526
Listen.

263
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,302
I won't be helping you up

264
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:51,983
every time you fall down.

265
00:25:53,903 --> 00:25:55,023
I might hold you in my arms

266
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,567
if you fall again.

267
00:25:58,641 --> 00:25:59,441
Let's go.

268
00:26:26,481 --> 00:26:27,281
Ms Liang.

269
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:29,223
Is this really a great movie?

270
00:26:29,401 --> 00:26:31,281
I don't know any of the actors.

271
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,280
There's barely anyone here.

272
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:36,358
Trust me. It's really good.

273
00:26:36,485 --> 00:26:38,245
This is the second time I'm watching it.

274
00:26:58,801 --> 00:27:01,681
His life is so miserable.
Why is he smiling?

275
00:27:01,872 --> 00:27:06,032
Who doesn't have
a lonely and difficult life?

276
00:27:06,735 --> 00:27:08,695
We're born to be alone.

277
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:11,954
No one can save you except yourself.

278
00:27:13,921 --> 00:27:15,561
He smiled in the end

279
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:17,998
because he has let it go.

280
00:27:22,071 --> 00:27:23,360
May I have a tissue?

281
00:27:23,841 --> 00:27:24,641
There's no more.

282
00:27:24,722 --> 00:27:26,162
I gave you the last piece.

283
00:27:30,641 --> 00:27:31,721
Thank you.

284
00:28:27,721 --> 00:28:28,721
Lu Jing is back.

285
00:28:33,824 --> 00:28:36,925
Lu Jing, did you go to sell insurance?

286
00:28:37,161 --> 00:28:38,481
Don't... Don't look at me.

287
00:28:38,569 --> 00:28:39,649
I have no money.

288
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:44,281
What's the smell? Did you drink?

289
00:28:49,601 --> 00:28:50,441
Just a little.

290
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,280
I thought you didn't drink?

291
00:28:54,469 --> 00:28:56,189
Why didn't you invite us?

292
00:29:01,921 --> 00:29:02,721
Let's drink now?

293
00:29:06,935 --> 00:29:08,255
Everyone.

294
00:29:08,481 --> 00:29:10,201
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

295
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:19,571

299
00:34:08,721 --> 00:34:10,401
Did I see wrongly?

300
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:24,688
Ms Liang,

301
00:34:24,841 --> 00:34:26,370
why did you delete the photo?

302
00:34:26,535 --> 00:34:27,495
You looked great!

303
00:34:28,003 --> 00:34:28,961
I posted it while I was drunk.

304
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:30,261
I forgot to set the group.

305
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,280
Didn't you know
we're going outstation today?

306
00:34:33,454 --> 00:34:34,503
What did you do yesterday?

307
00:34:35,921 --> 00:34:37,161
I went to a party.

308
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:39,401
With whom?

309
00:34:40,095 --> 00:34:41,015
Jia Yun.

310
00:34:42,141 --> 00:34:45,675
You went out alone with Jia Yun?

311
00:34:46,015 --> 00:34:47,135
Are you two dating?

312
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:49,639
No.

313
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:51,446
I went to see Salted Fish Band.

314
00:34:52,738 --> 00:34:55,276
In fact, he is not bad.

315
00:34:56,055 --> 00:34:57,935
He is tall and good-looking.

316
00:34:58,166 --> 00:35:00,606
He's also such a gentleman.

317
00:35:01,879 --> 00:35:03,199
Why don't you consider him?

318
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,240
Consider what?

319
00:35:04,464 --> 00:35:06,013
It's a conflict of interest.

320
00:35:06,094 --> 00:35:07,974
We're just friends.

321
00:35:32,537 --> 00:35:33,803
What are you thinking?

322
00:35:34,191 --> 00:35:35,071
It's definitely not her.

323
00:35:37,161 --> 00:35:38,936
What are you looking at so seriously?

324
00:35:40,161 --> 00:35:40,961
Nothing.

325
00:35:42,281 --> 00:35:44,481
Beautiful Soul has launched
a reward programme.

326
00:35:44,681 --> 00:35:47,201
Players can use points to redeem weapons.

327
00:35:47,421 --> 00:35:49,079
Let's play to earn some points tonight.

328
00:36:01,248 --> 00:36:03,168
We'll see. I might not be free.

329
00:36:04,382 --> 00:36:05,942
What have you been up to lately?

330
00:36:06,437 --> 00:36:07,917
Are you going to earn points with others?

331
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,770
Am I still your friend?

332
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,400
You have never been.

333
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:17,761
Fine, I will leave you alone.

334
00:36:18,158 --> 00:36:19,438
I can face the future on my own.

335
00:36:30,961 --> 00:36:32,881
The sponsor will send the outfits over
in the afternoon.

336
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,240
Remember to check it.

337
00:36:34,743 --> 00:36:36,823
And ask them for the rundown tomorrow.

338
00:36:39,129 --> 00:36:39,929
Wait.

339
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:41,622
-What's wrong?
-What's wrong?

340
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:43,343
I just want to take a picture.

341
00:36:50,761 --> 00:36:51,561
Let's go.

342
00:37:02,201 --> 00:37:03,079

What are you laughing about?

347
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:16,801
A crazy Box Spirit.

348
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,940
*[Box Spirit]

349
00:37:19,401 --> 00:37:21,041
Isn't this

350
00:37:21,334 --> 00:37:23,174
the Box Spirit which exploded herself?

351
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:24,241
It's her.

352
00:37:25,401 --> 00:37:26,550
Why do you still team up with her?

353
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,720
I'm doing it for a friend.

354
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:31,361
You seem to like playing
with her every night.

355
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,430
Teaming up with her

356
00:37:34,815 --> 00:37:36,695
makes the game more interesting.

357
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:38,496
and challenging.

358
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,270
It's quite fun.

359
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:44,801
You're so nerdy.

360
00:37:45,085 --> 00:37:46,645
No wonder you don't have a girlfriend.

361
00:37:47,415 --> 00:37:48,335
You're not nerdy.

362
00:37:48,711 --> 00:37:50,151
Do you have a girlfriend?

363
00:37:51,761 --> 00:37:52,761
Fine, Lu Jing.

364
00:37:53,001 --> 00:37:54,041
You're fantastic.

365
00:37:55,543 --> 00:37:58,223
Why don't you give me her gamer ID?

366
00:37:58,422 --> 00:37:59,862
Let me team up with her too.

367
00:38:00,881 --> 00:38:03,361
No, I can do it myself.

368
00:38:04,001 --> 00:38:05,081
You can't handle it.

369
00:38:06,782 --> 00:38:07,702
Lu Jing!

370
00:38:08,759 --> 00:38:11,279
Sounds more like
you couldn't bear to let her go.

371

00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:55,792
You go find a seat first.

378
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:13,735
I was asking

379
00:39:14,491 --> 00:39:15,439
where you are now.

380
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,166
*[Supreme Master]

381
00:39:18,863 --> 00:39:21,303
[I was asking where you are now.]

382
00:39:30,481 --> 00:39:32,721
Ms Liang, are you feeling stuffy?

383
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:34,601
Your face is so red.

384
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:43,281
Oh my goodness.

385
00:39:44,095 --> 00:39:45,601
It's so hot in here.

386
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:48,408
Isn't there ventilation in the lift?

387
00:39:49,126 --> 00:39:49,926
Is it hot?

388
00:39:50,007 --> 00:39:50,807
Yes.

389
00:39:53,245 --> 00:39:57,111
*[I'm in Shanghai]

390
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:54,556
[I'm in Shanghai.]

391
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,383
[What are you doing there?]

392
00:39:57,191 --> 00:39:59,870
*[For work]

393
00:39:58,159 --> 00:39:59,479
[Working.]

394
00:40:00,392 --> 00:40:01,192
[Okay.]

395
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:05,631
[I may not have time
to use the computer these few days.]

396
00:40:08,111 --> 00:40:10,431
[Focus on your work, Little Box.]
