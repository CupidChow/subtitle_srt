00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,660
♫When I've chosen a path
There's no going back♫

2
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,140
♫Just ignore the rumours

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,420
♫Even though there may be more rain
Than sunshine on this path♫

4
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,580
♫I don't care if I'd be reduced to ashes♫

5
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,180
♫All I want is to be on the stage♫

6
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,500
♫The light shining from my back
Is full of hope♫

7
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,660
♫Swim through the sea of mediocre
To reach a brand new future♫

8
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,660
♫And once I held my breath♫

9
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,260
♫Let our youth blossom
On the sea of conviction for our dreams♫

10
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,921
♫I still stubbornly believe in it
At every moment♫

11
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:05,380
♫Refusing to back down♫

12
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,740
♫Never stop
We don't need to♫

13
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,220
♫Never stop
Enjoy the solitude♫

14
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,940
♫Never stop

15
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,220
♫I'll walk my own path♫

00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,320
Orange.

22
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,780
Were you thinking...?

23
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,640
What?

24
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,140
What did you say?

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,940
Nothing.

26
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,220
I'm here to report to you
about my schedule moving forward.

27
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,000
Tell me.

28
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,480
Next week, I'll be preparing
for the big data competition.

29
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,200
I may not be able
to come and see you often.

30
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,200
As such, for the time being,
you'll have to put up with it.

31
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,260
Try not to miss me too much.

32
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,440
I have a competition in the coming week.
Focus on your studies.

33
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,180
I don't have time to miss you.

34
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,920
Are you sure you won't miss me?

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,200
-What is so difficult about that?
-You're right.

36
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,020
After all, you've come to see me
at school numerous times before.

37
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,800
Let's make a bet.

38
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,720
How?

39
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,120
Well...

40
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,920
In the coming week,

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,040
the person who can't help
but see the other person...

42
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,080
will lose the bet.

43
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,000
-Are we allowed to call each other?
-No.

44
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,440
-What about WeChat messages?
-No.

45
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,500
Video calls are okay, right?

46
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,420
Of course not.

47
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,760
If I win the bet, what will I get?

48
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,360
Why are you so sure that you'll win?
Who knows? I might be the winner.

49
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,040
If you win, I'll go on a trip with you.

50
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,140
What if I lose?

51
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,220
Then you'll go on a trip with me.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,280
Something is not right.
Either way, you're the winner.

53
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,580
Don't you want that to happen?

54
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,880
I... I'll win for sure.

55
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,580
I'll have the final say.

56
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,320
Okay.

57
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,280
Let's have a toast
with some Doubendou soy milk.

58
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,780
See you next week.

59
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,600
I'm leaving.

60
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,640
Don't push yourself too hard
when you miss me.

61
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,140
It's okay to admit defeat.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,940
I'm leaving for real.

63
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,200
You can go now.

64
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,340
You need to let go of me first.

65
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,800
The bet hasn't started yet.

66
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,420
Let me hug you a little longer.

67
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,400
Director Ma said
that you changed the original song.

68
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,320
What happened?

69
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,440
Unti and I chose the same song.

70
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,160
Her schedule is packed.
She doesn't have time for rehearsal.

71
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,280
That's why I let her have the song.

72
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,260
You gave up the song so easily.

73
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,760
You have only three days left,

74
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,200
and you're changing your song
at the last minute?

75
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,600
Do you really have to be so kind?

76
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,560
She doesn't have time for rehearsal,
but you do?

77
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,920
I was hesitant when I picked the song.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,060
I've always wanted
to adapt "First Dance of Winter."

79
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,920
But the competition is in three days.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,280
You don't have the time
to adapt the song.

81
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,980
You're running out of time.

82
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,400
Ms Qing.

83
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,820
I want to give it a shot.

84
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,080
♫The disappointment♫

85
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,420
♫The pain of turning and jumping around♫

86
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,660
♫Leave behind the sensation♫

87
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,340
♫Dance♫

88
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,560
The emotion of the song unfolds
according to the rhythm.

89
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,140
If we change it, it will not be better
than the original version.

90
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,320
The composition of the song is layered.

91
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,580
It's difficult to compose.

92
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,040
Now, we have to adapt the song
on top of the composition.

93
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,300
It's too difficult.

94
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,940
It's because it's difficult
that I want to give it a try.

95
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,900
Try it. Turn a bicycle into a motorcycle.

96
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,480
No. The rhythm is too flat.

97
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,040
It can't get the crowd going.

98
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,040
Let's remove the last part.

99
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
We can redo the composition.

100
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,200
No way. It'll ruin the layering.

101
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,680
My request is simple.

102
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,840
I just want to take the vocals
to a whole new level...

103
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,960
without changing the nature of the song.

104
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,000
We should make good use
of rock and roll elements...

105
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,400
to bring the song to its full potential
on stage.

106
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,200
Everyone knows that.

107
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,500
But the problem is,
we don't know if we can do it.

108
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,560
Don't be nervous.

109
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,480
To us, this is something new.

110
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,480
Let's give it another try.

111
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,500
I believe we can do it.

112
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,500
It's not working at all!
What should we do?

113
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,780
You need to use
the random forest algorithm.

114
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,441
The algorithm is extremely complicated.

115
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:29,580
I suggest you spend some time
to understand it in detail.

116
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,800
We're running out of time.

117
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,120
Don't I need to eat and sleep?

118
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,880
You're learning big data on your own.

119
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,880
You don't even understand the most
basic things like linear regression...

120
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:39,360
and support vector machines.

121
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,700
How can you take part in the competition?

122
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,360
Work on the basic calculations.

123
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,760
Change the pseudocode.

124
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,620
You'll understand it
if you spend more time on it.

125
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,780
It's easy for you to say.

126
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,200
I'm trying to solve the problem.

127
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,440
You expect me to master the basics
and change the pseudocode?

128
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,080
We're preparing for a competition,
not conducting research.

129
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,260
Can't you just tell me the solution?

130
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,200
Forget it.

131
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,640
Just leave it.

132
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,800
I'll finish the rest.

133
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,320
Fine, I'll learn it all over again.

134
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,700
I'll start from the beginning.

135
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,260
I'll learn it.
I'll start from the beginning.

136
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,220
-Zhou Zhou.
-Leave me alone!

137
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,480
Ms Ma.

138
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,640
I bought a new car.

139
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,560
Isn't it nice?

140
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,340
Hop in. I'll give you a ride.

141
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,400
It's okay. Thanks.

142
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,320
Ms Ma.

143
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,820
Ms Ma, if you don't get in the car,
I'll send food to your place every day.

144
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,480
Come on.

145
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,640
Come on.

146
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,560
Come on.

147
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,700
I heard Orange ran into some difficulties
at her rehearsal yesterday.

148
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,660
You know everything.

149
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,820
What difficulties?

150
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,540
It's about her choice of song.

151
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,100
What song did she choose?

152
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,660
That song...

153
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,120
has something to do with winter and dance.

154
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,400
-You mean "First Dance of Winter?"
-Yes.

155
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,620
You're indeed a professional.

156
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,780
Why did she choose that song?

157
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,740
What's wrong with the song?

158
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,040
Ms Ma?

159
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,460
Say something.

160
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,320
What's wrong with the song?

161
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,860
I'm intrigued.

162
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,960
Be it the performance or the adaptation,

163
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,440
this song is extremely challenging.

164
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,260
What should she do?

165
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,320
Ms Zhou.

166
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,200
I know. You have a lot of projects
on your plate right now.

167
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,440
However, we're really running out of time.

168
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,380
I don't have time to get a new composer
to mesh with Chen Chen.

169
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,120
I'm at my wit's end. I need your help.

170
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,740
If you help me, first,
you'll be helping Chen Chen...

171
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,720
Sure, got it.

172
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,940
Sorry to bother you, Ms Zhou.

173
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,120
I've been making calls all day.

174
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,220
On such a short notice, I can't find
any composers who can adapt the song.

175
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,840
I'm at my wit's end.

176
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,060
Tell me, what should I do?

177
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,000
Ms Qing, you should go back first.

178
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,960
Take a rest.

179
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,960
I'll figure it out.

180
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,520
You'll figure it out? How?

181
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,220
Are you going to perform
the incomplete version?

182
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,400
Ms Chen, since it's impossible
to complete the song,

183
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,960
why don't we switch to another song?

184
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,520
I think we can choose a song
that is safer.

185
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,860
That's right, Ms Chen.

186
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,480
Let's make sure you get through
to the next round first.

187
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,840
When we have sufficient time,

188
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,200
we'll let you choose the song.

189
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,120
Okay?

190
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,180
If we choose a safe song,

191
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,060
I'd have failed myself,

192
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,940
let alone the audience.

193
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,340
The reason I'm participating in this show
is to push my limits.

194
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,300
Otherwise, why would I be here?

195
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,220
Chen Chen.

196
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,320
You'll get what you want in the future.

197
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,380
Let's deal with the problem
at hand first, okay?

198
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,200
Please understand that
if you fail in the coming performance,

199
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,060
it may very well be the end
of your entire singing career.

200
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,180
Can we consider the consequences
before making a decision?

201
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,060
When I decided to join the show,

202
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,820
I thought it through.

203
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,160
Whatever the consequences are,

204
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,240
I'll bear it on my own.

205
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,000
You think you're the only one
who has to bear it?

206
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,440
Have you thought about your company
and your team?

207
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,980
Are you aware that your success
is the blood and sweat of many people?

208
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,620
If you're ruined,
everyone's effort will go down the drain.

209
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,740
Have you thought of my feelings?

210
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,280
Have you?

211
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,120
You haven't, have you?

212
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,020
All these years,

213
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,060
I've been living according to your plans.

214
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,480
But this time,

215
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,240
I just want to follow my heart.

216
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,060
I want to do it my way.

217
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,260
Am I wrong?

218
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,760
Ms Qing.

219
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,060
You're my manager.

220
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,100
I hope you can respect me.

221
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,560
Fine.

222
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,780
It seems I can't interfere
in your business, so I won't.

223
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,300
Ms Qing. Ms Qing, don't be mad.

224
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,260
Where are we going?

225
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,480
Ms Ma.

226
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,780
Do you know what this is?

227
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,720
It's a building.

228
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,780
Ms Ma, you're so humorous.

229
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,580
This is Liang Chen's
newly-renovated studio.

230
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,300
When I become rich, I'll buy a Martin D28.

231
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,380
When I become rich,
I'll buy a set of Yamaha PHX.

232
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,700
I will also build a studio
for the both of us.

233
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,720
We should live in the studio.

234
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,640
Sure!

235
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,720
Since we're already here,

236
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,580
why don't we check out the studio?

237
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,410
Let's take it from the top.

238
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,680
Ms Shan Shan.

239
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,800
How did you recognise me?

240
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,160
Chen Chen doesn't have many friends.

241
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,600
You're the one she mentions
the most often.

242
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,340
She always tells me
how you two used to make music together.

243
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,760
Are you coming or leaving?

244
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,800
I'm leaving.

245
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,040
She's been quite busy lately.
I don't want to bother her.

246
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,240
Be safe.

247
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,220
Ms Ma, let's go inside.

248
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,180
Come on. This way.

249
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,120
It's time for soup.

250
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,620
Thank you, Ms Chen.

251
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,700
This is for you.

252
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,120
Who's the caring angel?

253
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,880
The soup is a godsend.

254
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
Drink up and stop talking.

255
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,880
Sure.

256
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,000
Save some for me.

257
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,200
No persistence will go wasted.

258
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,700
All the best! I love you.

259
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,460
I didn't violate the rules.

260
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,500
Shan Shan, what brings you here?

261
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,280
I'm here too.

262
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,440
Can't you see me?

263
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,680
We were passing by
and decided to check out the studio.

264
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,660
Come and have a seat.

265
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,560
Take a seat.

266
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,240
Do you want some soup?

267
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,300
You bet we do.

268
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,640
It's chicken soup.

269
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,960
Ms Ma, have some soup.

270
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,160
I've eaten.

271
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,420
It's okay, there are two bowls of soup.
I'll put it here.

272
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,460
How's the song adaptation going?

273
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,380
I can't seem to find any better ideas.

274
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,140
Why don't you take a look?

275
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,060
Just a small part of it.

276
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,860
I think it's lacking something.

277
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,380
Shan Shan, what do you think?

278
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,760
I...

279
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,720
I...

280
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,020
I have no idea.

281
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,460
Shan Shan, what's wrong?

282
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,500
I have to go.

283
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,220
Ms Ma, wait for me.

284
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,460
I have to go.

285
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,100
Lu Jing, you're back.

286
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,600
I have many questions to ask you.

287
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,840
Can you please teach me?

288
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,760
What questions?

289
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,080
I'm drafting the calculations
for a support vector machine.

290
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,800
The programme is working
but the error rate is very high.

291
00:20:59,881 --> 00:21:00,820
What should I do?

292
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,420
Something is wrong
with line 54 of the code.

293
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,440
The dot product should be placed here.

294
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,560
Now I get it.

295
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,960
You're indeed a genius.

296
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,640
You can solve any problem at one glance.

297
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,660
Let me run the code.

298
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,960
Don't look at me.

299
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,280
I feel nervous when you look at me.

300
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,820
If you're so free,
why don't you get me some drinks?

301
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,680
Sure.

302
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,760
I want them cold.

303
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,900
I know.

304
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,840
Ms Ma.

305
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,620
What should we have for dinner?

306
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,460
How does hotpot sound?

307
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,560
What did you say?

308
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,580
I said, what should we have for dinner?

309
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,800
Aren't you full from the chicken soup?

310
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,560
It's so little.

311
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,620
I can eat more if I loosen my belt.

312
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,420
Orange is doing her best.

313
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,100
I heard they're working around the clock
and not getting any rest.

314
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,120
If Orange flops during the competition,

315
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,540
does that mean she can retire early
and get some rest?

316
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,180
Ms Ma, you're so quiet.

317
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,800
Are you down with a flu and sore throat?

318
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,160
Should I send you to the hospital?

319
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,460
I haven't had enough fun with my new car.

320
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,740
Ms Ma! Ms...

321
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,820
Ms Ma! Where are you going?

322
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,020
Aren't you going to say goodbye?

323
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,840
Ma...

324
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,900
She's quick.

325
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,680
No matter how I change it,
I still feel that something is missing.

326
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,840
Ms Chen,
let's just switch to another song.

327
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,840
We can't go on like this.

328
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,500
Tomorrow is the last day. Can we do it?

329
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,800
No, I must perform this song.

330
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,780
Let's do it again.

331
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,760
Why are you giving up on your dream?

332
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,840
I can't do music anymore.

333
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,960
I can't do it.

334
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,720
Is it because of Lin Qi?

335
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,220
Is that why you give up?

336
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,880
You have no idea.

337
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,560
You have no idea! You know nothing!

338
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,380
You don't understand me at all!

339
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,420
Do you know how much pain I'm in?

340
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,320
I can't even listen to music.

341
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,120
Even a note or a bar,
I just can't listen to anything!

342
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:17,900
It reminds me of him.

343
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,620
This place...

344
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,600
Every day, every minute and every second,

345
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,560
this place is full of notes and music.

346
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,840
It's full of memories of him!

347
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,640
I can't take it anymore.

348
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,880
Are you just going to give up
on our dream?

349
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,300
Because of that jerk?

350
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,940
I don't know how to calculate it.

351
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,300
You're still practising?

352
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,060
Why don't you try this?

353
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,120
We're pressed for time.
That's the best I could do.

354
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,340
Take a look.

355
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,740
My goodness. Ms Ma, you're something else.

356
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,040
Just cut to the chase.

357
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,060
It's okay.

358
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,400
The second part of the song
is in a high key.

359
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,280
And it's quite long.

360
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,560
It requires
not only excellent vocal control,

361
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,560
but continuous, explosive power.

362
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,340
If the singer is out of breath,

363
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,060
the whole song will be a disaster.

364
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,940
But I believe...

365
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,380
Orange can do it.

366
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,000
Is that it?

367
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,320
We did it!

368
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,620
You can sleep now.

369
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,400
Ms Chen, just give up if you can't do it.

370
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,800
Don't hurt your throat.

371
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,380
Can't we lower the key?
That way, it'll be less challenging.

372
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,200
If we lower the key,

373
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,360
Shan Shan's composition
won't be as fantastic.

374
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,340
Orange.

375
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,420
Why don't you adjust the key?

376
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,400
The composition is fine.

377
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,360
I made a mistake when I sang.

378
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,380
I'll try again.

379
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,780
Let's try again.

380
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,280
Ms Chen has been singing all day.

381
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,220
If she keeps singing,
I wonder if her throat can take it.

382
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,120
(SOMERSET)

383
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:00,359
Ke Ke.

384
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,500
You should go home first.

385
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,260
Rest early.

386
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,500
Perhaps everything will get better
when you wake up.

387
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,940
Don't worry.

388
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,020
Sorry, the subscriber you've dialled
is powered off.

389
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,960
Sorry, the subscriber you've dialled
is powered off.

390
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,180
Hello.

391
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,780
Ms Ke Ke.

392
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,280
Didn't you say that Chen Chen is home?

393
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,940
She went home a while ago.

394
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,200
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

395
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,300
I sent her home myself. What's the matter?

396
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,860
Sorry, the subscriber you've dialled
is powered off.

397
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,960
Sorry...

398
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,460
Chen Chen!

399
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,740
Chen Chen!

400
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,140
Sorry, the subscriber you've dialled
is powered off.

401
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:26,000
Sorry, the subscriber you've dialled
is powered off.

402
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,340
Where did she go?

403
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,840
Watch the time, everyone.

404
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,680
Check the equipment again.

405
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,960
Go through the equipment thoroughly.

406
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,280
Don't forget the lights.

407
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,680
Pay attention to the details.
Don't make any mistakes.

408
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,020
Stay on top of everything!

409
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,320
-Is Liang Chen here?
-Not yet.

410
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,440
Tell her to hurry up!
The show's about to start.

411
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,360
Yes.

412
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,940
Let's welcome Liang Chen to the stage.

413
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,960
-Liang Chen!
-Liang Chen is the best!

414
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,160
Liang Chen!

415
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,400
Liang Chen!

416
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,600
Liang Chen!

417
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,520
Liang Chen!

418
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,420
I love you, Liang Chen!

419
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,740
