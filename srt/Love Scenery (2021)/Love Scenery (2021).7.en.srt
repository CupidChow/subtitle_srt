Even a pro like me would throw
a game for your sake.

193
00:19:38,602 --> 00:19:39,902
What are you complaining about?

194
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:43,902
Are you saying I'm too weak?

195
00:19:46,642 --> 00:19:49,822
I might've eaten too much
crayfish tonight.

196
00:19:54,762 --> 00:19:55,662
Was it delicious?

197
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:56,662
Not bad.

198
00:19:57,042 --> 00:19:58,362
Where did you eat?

199
00:19:58,442 --> 00:19:59,422
Nanyang University, East Gate.

200
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:04,542
I can treat you to a meal

201
00:20:05,602 --> 00:20:06,622
when you're free.

202
00:20:12,882 --> 00:20:14,422
We'll talk about it later.

203
00:20:16,002 --> 00:20:18,782
Crayfish is a hassle to eat.

204
00:20:23,842 --> 00:20:26,642
It's getting late now. Do get some rest.

205
00:20:26,722 --> 00:20:27,622
Goodnight.

206
00:20:28,002 --> 00:20:28,902
Goodnight.

209
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:37,262
Leave me alone.

210
00:22:03,402 --> 00:22:04,302
Action!

211
00:22:10,402 --> 00:22:11,302
Let's go.

212
00:22:19,602 --> 00:22:20,482
What do you want?

213
00:22:20,562 --> 00:22:21,702
Who is she?

214
00:22:22,082 --> 00:22:23,162
Is she from our school?

215
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:24,142
Which year is she in?

216
00:22:24,362 --> 00:22:26,122
How did you meet her?

217
00:22:26,202 --> 00:22:27,242
Is there a picture?

218
00:22:27,322 --> 00:22:28,262
Is she beautiful?

219
00:22:28,962 --> 00:22:30,382
What are you talking about?

220
00:22:32,082 --> 00:22:34,862
You left without finishing the crayfish.

221
00:22:35,362 --> 00:22:37,122
What could be more enticing than that?

222
00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:38,582
It couldn't be programming.

223
00:22:38,722 --> 00:22:40,662
It could only be girls.

224
00:22:41,242 --> 00:22:42,762
We promised to stay single together,

225
00:22:42,842 --> 00:22:44,902
but you secretly hooked up with a girl?

226
00:22:45,002 --> 00:22:46,182
Come on.

227
00:22:47,802 --> 00:22:49,782
Teach us how to get a girlfriend.

228
00:22:52,242 --> 00:22:53,702
You think too much.

229
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:56,342
The author Mark Twain once said,

230
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:59,122
"Candor is the product of
honesty and bravery."

231
00:22:59,202 --> 00:23:00,522
Why so poetic?

232
00:23:00,602 --> 00:23:02,782
I think we need to force the
truth out of him.

233
00:23:06,788 --> 00:23:07,601
That's right.

234
00:23:07,681 --> 00:23:08,882
If I lied,

235
00:23:08,962 --> 00:23:11,862
may the head of department himself
set the exam paper.

236
00:23:18,042 --> 00:23:20,042
Don't be so cruel.

237
00:23:20,122 --> 00:23:21,542
We're innocent.

Hello, Jia Yun?

248
00:25:05,882 --> 00:25:06,782
Boss.

249
00:25:06,882 --> 00:25:08,702
Ms Lan Yao invites you to dinner.

250
00:25:09,602 --> 00:25:11,542
Tell her I'm occupied.

251
00:25:13,962 --> 00:25:15,242
You wouldn't say that if it were

252
00:25:15,322 --> 00:25:16,582
Ms Liang who invited you.

253
00:25:22,442 --> 00:25:23,902
What's with her?

254
00:25:24,282 --> 00:25:25,582
It's so obvious to me.

255
00:25:25,762 --> 00:25:27,182
Why didn't she know?

256
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,622
Perhaps she refused to know.

257
00:25:39,962 --> 00:25:40,902
Here.

258
00:25:43,682 --> 00:25:45,142
Fresh off the grill.

259
00:25:49,402 --> 00:25:50,982
Cola with barbeque.

260
00:25:51,282 --> 00:25:52,862
What a nice day!

261
00:25:53,162 --> 00:25:55,042
We should have barbeque parties every day!

262
00:25:55,122 --> 00:25:56,262
Dream on!

263
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,342
Don't you know we're tight on expenses?

264
00:25:59,722 --> 00:26:01,642
I'm buying you this meal

265
00:26:01,722 --> 00:26:03,102
to mend your broken back.

266
00:26:03,402 --> 00:26:04,282
Really?

267
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:05,342
Thanks, Director.

268
00:26:06,282 --> 00:26:07,722
The pork knuckles are ready.

269
00:26:07,802 --> 00:26:09,242
Do help yourselves.

270
00:26:09,322 --> 00:26:10,162
Okay!

271
00:26:10,242 --> 00:26:11,182
Coming.

272
00:26:13,882 --> 00:26:16,582
Here's a pork knuckle for you.

273
00:26:17,322 --> 00:26:19,022
Nice work today, kid.

274
00:26:19,322 --> 00:26:20,822
This is your reward.

275
00:26:21,882 --> 00:26:22,922
Thanks, Director!

276
00:26:23,002 --> 00:26:25,942
It's the least I can do as an actor.

277
00:26:26,202 --> 00:26:27,322
I never thought

278
00:26:27,402 --> 00:26:29,782
I would be so compatible with Ms Ma.

279
00:26:31,162 --> 00:26:32,062
By the way,

280
00:26:33,442 --> 00:26:34,582
where's Ms Ma?

281
00:26:34,922 --> 00:26:35,762
Why isn't she here?

282
00:26:35,842 --> 00:26:37,642
Ms Ma sprained her foot today.

283
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:39,222
She must be in her room now.

284
00:26:39,402 --> 00:26:40,982
Let her have some rest.

285
00:26:55,722 --> 00:26:57,102
Ms Ma?

286
00:27:01,722 --> 00:27:03,142
Ms Ma, are you in there?

287
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:05,222
It's me, Sun Bin Yu.

288
00:27:07,162 --> 00:27:08,142
Ms Ma?

289
00:27:15,602 --> 00:27:17,022
Ms Ma?

290
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:19,262
Ms Ma?

291
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:28,662
There you are, Ms Ma.

292
00:27:28,842 --> 00:27:29,742
What is it?

293
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:31,262
Here.

294
00:27:31,882 --> 00:27:33,082
You may be missing out on the party

295
00:27:33,162 --> 00:27:34,242
due to your foot,

296
00:27:34,322 --> 00:27:36,002
but we didn't forget about you.

297
00:27:36,082 --> 00:27:38,422
So I came here to send our regards.

298
00:27:39,682 --> 00:27:41,462
I'm fine, thank you.

299
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:44,562
No, Ms Ma! Don't close the door!

300
00:27:44,642 --> 00:27:46,442
Eat it while it's hot.

301
00:27:46,522 --> 00:27:47,822
It's good for your foot.

302
00:27:48,002 --> 00:27:50,062
No, thank you.

304
00:28:16,202 --> 00:28:18,482
Why did you pack so many dresses for me?

305
00:28:18,562 --> 00:28:20,022
I'm not going on a vacation.

306
00:28:20,642 --> 00:28:23,142
What if you meet a hot guy in Guangzhou?

307
00:28:24,762 --> 00:28:26,702
Are hot guys more important
than writing songs?

308
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:29,242
Are relationships
more fulfilling than work?

309
00:28:29,322 --> 00:28:30,882
Stop pretending.

310
00:28:30,962 --> 00:28:32,622
You think I don't know you?

311
00:28:32,762 --> 00:28:34,282
If you were in a relationship,

312
00:28:34,362 --> 00:28:35,762
you'd have so much inspiration

313
00:28:35,842 --> 00:28:38,142
that songs would practically pour
out of you.

314
00:28:39,282 --> 00:28:41,302
Who could I possibly date?

315
00:28:44,882 --> 00:28:46,862
A pair of pants.

316
00:28:47,922 --> 00:28:49,782
A piece of hoodie.

317
00:28:54,002 --> 00:28:55,462
Five pairs of socks.

318
00:28:56,682 --> 00:28:57,942
A pair of underwear.

319
00:28:58,122 --> 00:28:59,022

Your documents?

322
00:29:02,122 --> 00:29:03,881
Entry form, charger and data cables.

323
00:29:03,961 --> 00:29:04,861
Did you bring them?

324
00:29:04,962 --> 00:29:07,422
What? I can't hear you.

325
00:29:08,362 --> 00:29:10,462
Why don't you do it for me?

326
00:29:54,562 --> 00:29:57,062

-Okay.

The pieces are here.

346
00:31:02,602 --> 00:31:04,162
What does Mrs Lu usually like?

347
00:31:04,242 --> 00:31:06,202
There's a gold one inlaid with jade,

348
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:08,482
one that's pure gold,

349
00:31:08,562 --> 00:31:09,522
and a small ornament.

350
00:31:09,602 --> 00:31:10,622
They're all beautiful.

351
00:31:10,922 --> 00:31:11,922
I really don't know.

352
00:31:12,002 --> 00:31:13,222
Please choose one for me.

353
00:31:14,602 --> 00:31:17,402
I think jade complements Mrs Lu's look,

354
00:31:17,482 --> 00:31:18,542
and it's beneficial to health.

355
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,700

-Okay.

Yes, I'm petty when it comes to love.

370

with Shan Shan

00:32:21,962 --> 00:32:24,102
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"
with Shan Shan?

381
00:32:25,162 --> 00:32:26,902
What do you mean?

382
00:32:27,082 --> 00:32:28,962
I'm a versatile actor.

383
00:32:29,042 --> 00:32:30,442
My only restriction

384
00:32:30,522 --> 00:32:31,622
is my handsome face.

385
00:32:31,722 --> 00:32:34,082
Then why do you want to collaborate
with Shan Shan?

386
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:36,502
You two don't seem compatible.

387
00:32:36,842 --> 00:32:38,142
Because

388
00:32:38,402 --> 00:32:40,702
she's my "hard disk goddess."

389
00:32:41,482 --> 00:32:42,782
Ten terabytes.

390
00:32:47,162 --> 00:32:48,782
You're awake, Ms Ma.

391
00:32:51,282 --> 00:32:52,342
No, I...

392
00:32:53,802 --> 00:32:56,342
I can explain, Ms Ma!

393
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,360
*[Taro's Drive]

394
00:33:20,562 --> 00:33:21,922
I'm right.

395
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:23,782
I have another nine terabytes back home.

396
00:33:36,722 --> 00:33:38,622
Wait for me!

397
00:33:39,882 --> 00:33:41,122
We're only going for two days.

398
00:33:41,202 --> 00:33:42,362
Why carry such a big suitcase

399
00:33:42,442 --> 00:33:43,782
for five pairs of socks?

400
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:46,702
You don't know what it's like
to a man of refinement.

401
00:34:02,322 --> 00:34:03,200
Hello?

402
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,082
[Hello.]

403
00:34:04,162 --> 00:34:05,442
[Are you the passenger]

404
00:34:05,522 --> 00:34:08,462
[of flight DA1718 to Guangzhou?]

405
00:34:09,122 --> 00:34:10,002
Yes, I am.

406
00:34:10,082 --> 00:34:10,882
[I'm sorry.]

407
00:34:10,962 --> 00:34:12,802
[There's only one seat left]

408
00:34:12,882 --> 00:34:15,262
[in the economy cabin.]

409
00:34:15,362 --> 00:34:16,162
[We can upgrade]

410
00:34:16,242 --> 00:34:18,202
[one of your seats to first class.]

411
00:34:18,282 --> 00:34:20,022
[Which one of you will take the upgrade?]

412
00:34:23,322 --> 00:34:26,182
Lu Jing, have you been in
a first class cabin?

413
00:34:46,362 --> 00:34:48,182
What time is the flight, Ke Ke?

414
00:34:48,602 --> 00:34:49,742
7:50.

415
00:34:54,562 --> 00:34:56,282
In the past, at this time of year,

416
00:34:56,362 --> 00:34:58,382
my new album would've begun selling.

417
00:34:59,562 --> 00:35:00,542
But this year,

418
00:35:00,842 --> 00:35:02,222
there's nothing.

419
00:35:06,442 --> 00:35:08,782
Don't pressure yourself.

420
00:35:58,672 --> 00:36:00,212
I'm going over, Chen.

421
00:36:04,322 --> 00:36:05,762
[I'll be busy in the morning.]

422
00:36:05,842 --> 00:36:07,202
[Hit me up tonight if you want]

423
00:36:07,282 --> 00:36:08,212
[to play Beautiful Soul.]

424
00:36:14,592 --> 00:36:16,942
Was that Liang Chen?

425
00:36:17,022 --> 00:36:17,832
Yes.

426
00:36:17,912 --> 00:36:19,572
But don't tell anyone.

427
00:36:34,922 --> 00:36:37,422
[Guess who I saw
in the first class cabin?]

428
00:36:52,882 --> 00:36:54,582
Are my earphones with you?

429
00:37:10,882 --> 00:37:11,862
Thank you.

430
00:37:38,762 --> 00:37:39,662
Thank you.

431
00:37:59,122 --> 00:38:00,502
Why are you standing there?

432
00:38:06,922 --> 00:38:07,822
I...

433
00:38:08,162 --> 00:38:09,502
Are my earphones here?

434
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,322
[I'll be busy during the morning.]

435
00:38:12,402 --> 00:38:13,762
[Hit me up tonight if you want]

436
00:38:13,842 --> 00:38:14,822
[to pay Beautiful Soul.]

437
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:19,382
I'll look for it.

438
00:38:23,122 --> 00:38:24,002
[I'm on a business trip.]

439
00:38:24,082 --> 00:38:25,022
[I'm not free.]

440
00:38:26,242 --> 00:38:27,142
[Where?]

441
00:38:35,362 --> 00:38:36,262
[Guangzhou.]

442
00:38:41,105 --> 00:38:42,355
*[Okay.]

443
00:38:50,802 --> 00:38:52,102
Who are you texting?

444
00:38:55,828 --> 00:38:56,672
My mother.

445
00:38:56,752 --> 00:38:58,252
I'm selecting some dresses for her.

446
00:39:00,082 --> 00:39:01,102
This looks nice.

447
00:39:04,882 --> 00:39:05,782
Your earphones.

448
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,040
*[1]

449
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:19,822
Hello, sir.
Please return to your seat, thank you.

450
00:39:35,802 --> 00:39:37,702
-Little Box?
-[Ladies and gentlemen.]

451
00:39:37,882 --> 00:39:39,942
[Our plane will be taking off soon.]

452
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,042
[The cabin crew]

453
00:39:41,122 --> 00:39:42,942
[will begin their security check.]

454
00:39:43,722 --> 00:39:45,562
[Please fasten your seat belts]

455
00:39:45,642 --> 00:39:47,782
[and put up the trays.]

456
00:39:47,922 --> 00:39:50,242
[Keep the window shades open.]

457
00:39:50,322 --> 00:39:51,782
[Thank you for your cooperation.]

458
00:40:08,122 --> 00:40:09,342
How could it be?

459
00:40:18,722 --> 00:40:19,782
What are you looking at?

460
00:40:22,042 --> 00:40:22,942
Nothing.
