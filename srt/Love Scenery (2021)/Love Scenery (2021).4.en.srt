Sleep early, Little Box.

00:01:41,994 --> 00:01:43,114
Who are you referring as Little Box?

5
00:01:43,272 --> 00:01:44,312
It couldn't be me, right?

6
00:01:46,602 --> 00:01:47,642
Bye.

7
00:01:51,314 --> 00:01:53,240
God knows what is playing on his mind.

8
00:01:53,394 --> 00:01:54,800
He is such a cool guy,

9
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:57,514
but why did he choose such
a vulgar nickname?

Chen, get ready now.

19
00:03:12,638 --> 00:03:13,680
Ms Zhang will be here soon.

20
00:03:13,808 --> 00:03:14,688
Why is she coming?

21
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,680
You have to film for a show, right?

22
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,920
The make up is usually done
at the scene, right?

23
00:03:19,594 --> 00:03:21,960
Meng Lan Zhi will be there too.

24
00:03:22,274 --> 00:03:23,154
So what?

25
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,160
No doubt it is not in the same room,

26
00:03:25,294 --> 00:03:27,294
but what if you guys
bump into each other...

27
00:03:27,376 --> 00:03:28,536
before entering the make up room?

28
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:30,554
You must not lose to her.

29
00:03:33,794 --> 00:03:34,834
What are you doing?

30
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,400

00:03:49,265 --> 00:03:50,945
Liu'er, I can't hold it back anymore.

34
00:03:51,034 --> 00:03:51,914
Liu'er!

35
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
Liu'er!

36
00:03:53,294 --> 00:03:55,494
Open the door! Hurry up. Get out.

37
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,920
Did you know that Liang Chen
is our senior?

38
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:08,312
I thought the students of
the music academy were talking nonsense.

39
00:04:10,794 --> 00:04:11,874
Now you know you are ignorant.

40
00:04:12,122 --> 00:04:13,162
I am telling you.

41
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:16,656
This building used to be
the girls' dorm of the music academy.

42
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,210
I didn't know that.

43
00:04:19,832 --> 00:04:22,192
I am going to sleep on each and every bed.

44
00:04:22,273 --> 00:04:24,593
Perhaps Liang Chen
slept on one of the beds.

45
00:04:25,074 --> 00:04:27,194
I need to get some of
her magical aura.

46
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,600
Get some of her magical aura?

47
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,670
You think you can
get a girlfriend with the aura?

48
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,720
You can dream!

49
00:04:49,394 --> 00:04:51,474
Everyone will put on weight.

50
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:53,634
This is interesting.

51
00:04:57,883 --> 00:04:58,867
What are you doing?

52
00:05:00,936 --> 00:05:01,896
Zhou Zhou.

53
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,960
Chill.

54
00:05:04,048 --> 00:05:05,768
Sometimes, one can

55
00:05:06,047 --> 00:05:07,527
find someone at any time.

56
00:05:13,594 --> 00:05:14,674
Will you please

57
00:05:14,754 --> 00:05:16,360
behave like a modern university student?

58
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:19,184
I do behave like one.

59
00:05:24,714 --> 00:05:25,679
It's done, Jia Yun.

60
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,720
Okay, thank you.

61
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,120
Liang Chen, have you arrived?

62
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
[I am almost there.]

63
00:05:45,114 --> 00:05:45,954
Okay.

64
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,680
[Do you concede?]

65
00:06:23,826 --> 00:06:25,586
[Yes, bring me along tonight.]

66
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,040
[I will be busy tonight. Now I am free.]

67
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,560
[I am working now.]

68
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,660
[I am surprised that you are working.]

69
00:06:31,952 --> 00:06:33,552
[Are you working in factory
that produces boxes?]

70
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,480
We've signed the contract.
How could you change it?

71
00:06:35,536 --> 00:06:37,216
-You don't have to say anything.
-We have suffered too much of loss.

72
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:38,657
Just read the last part.

73
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:39,795
The agreement is cancelled.

74
00:06:39,863 --> 00:06:40,783
Mr Wang.

75
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:45,474
I forgot to check the forecast on calender
before coming out.

76
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:46,689

77
00:06:53,354 --> 00:06:54,274
Chen Chen.

78
00:06:55,203 --> 00:06:56,403
Will you please help me?

79
00:06:57,514 --> 00:06:59,074
My show has been cancelled.

80
00:06:59,474 --> 00:07:00,674
I have prepared for a long time.

81
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,080
I don't have a choice.

82
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:03,881
Please speak for me.

83
00:07:05,015 --> 00:07:06,015
Yue Yu Xun.

84
00:07:06,096 --> 00:07:08,320
I wonder why scientists
didn't use your skin

85
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,760
to make a flak jacket.

86
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:11,754
-I don't have any other choice.
-Don't touch me.

87
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:26,326
Chen Chen.

88
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:28,120
It's not like what you think.

89
00:07:28,238 --> 00:07:29,760
Will you let me explain?

90
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:33,641
Okay, go ahead.

91
00:07:35,794 --> 00:07:37,154
It's her.

92
00:07:38,544 --> 00:07:40,384
Meng Lan Zhi seduced me.

93
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,674
I was drunk. I don't know what happened.

94
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:43,874
I don't remember a thing.

95
00:07:44,128 --> 00:07:45,694
She kept clinging onto me.

96
00:07:46,154 --> 00:07:47,074
I am not lying.

97
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:48,834
I have you.

98
00:07:48,914 --> 00:07:50,514
No way I would do anything with her.

99
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,395
Don't touch me.

100
00:07:58,369 --> 00:07:59,369
Enough, stop talking.

101
00:07:59,585 --> 00:08:01,065
I am not lying.

102
00:08:01,201 --> 00:08:02,361
You should know

103
00:08:02,473 --> 00:08:03,633
what kind of person Meng Lan Zhi is.

104
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,160
Her private life is a mess.
Why would I like a girl like her?

105
00:08:07,535 --> 00:08:08,615
Yue Yu Xun!

106
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,754
-Boss, have some coffee.
-Why is it so noisy out there?

107
00:08:24,735 --> 00:08:26,695
Meng Lan Zhi and Yue Yu Xun are fighting.

108
00:08:29,194 --> 00:08:30,834
Let them fight each other.

109
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,320
Liang Chen is there too.

110
00:08:48,204 --> 00:08:49,444
What did you just say?

111
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:51,594
I...

112
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,960
Chen Chen!

113
00:08:56,629 --> 00:08:58,269
Please give me another chance.

114
00:08:59,065 --> 00:09:00,105
I swear.

115
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,600
I won't betray you again.

116
00:09:08,376 --> 00:09:09,402
Yue Yu Xun.

117
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,960
It is over.

118
00:09:13,434 --> 00:09:14,234
Chen Chen!

119
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,760
-Chen Chen!
-Yue Yu Xun.

120
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,679
What did you say?

121
00:09:19,244 --> 00:09:20,511
Repeat it!

122
00:09:20,592 --> 00:09:22,152
-Please calm down.
-Do you think I am deaf?

123
00:09:22,348 --> 00:09:23,754
-You better say it again!
-Calm down please.

124
00:09:23,793 --> 00:09:24,840
Say it again!

125
00:09:25,622 --> 00:09:26,862
-What did you say?
-She is too impulsive.

126
00:09:26,911 --> 00:09:27,791
Say it again!

127
00:09:27,895 --> 00:09:30,135
-Say it again! You think that I'm deaf?
-Please calm down, okay?

128
00:09:30,184 --> 00:09:31,384
Do you think that I am deaf?

129
00:09:31,465 --> 00:09:32,425
Please don't behave like this.

130
00:09:32,481 --> 00:09:33,321
Let go of me!

131
00:09:33,395 --> 00:09:34,395
Calm down, please.

132
00:09:34,753 --> 00:09:35,753
Let go of me!

134
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:41,234
You wait and see.

135
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:06,034
It seems that cancelling all your jobs

136
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,966
didn't make you behave better.

137
00:10:09,937 --> 00:10:11,257
It's you.

138
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,680
Don't let me see you disturb
Liang Chen again.

139
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,280
If you don't know
how to disappear silently,

140
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,120
I don't mind doing another favour for you.

141
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:23,192
You!

142
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,080
Herman is so cool.

143
00:11:06,926 --> 00:11:07,806
Goodness.

144
00:11:11,577 --> 00:11:13,057
I didn't mean to give you a shock.

145
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:14,695
I like to watch his live stream.

146
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,695
I am sorry.

147
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,720
Please go on.

148
00:11:21,218 --> 00:11:23,978
-Ms Liang!
-Liang Chen.

149
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,705
Do you know that
a pretty lady talked to me?

150
00:11:36,307 --> 00:11:38,320
[She told me that she likes
to watch your live stream.]

151
00:11:41,673 --> 00:11:43,353
Will you give me some reactions?

152
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:44,834
[Liang Chen talked to me.]

153
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:49,957
You must be lying.

154
00:11:50,462 --> 00:11:51,542
[If I lie,]

155
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:54,103
the price of the vegetables will hike up
whenever my mum goes to shop.

156
00:11:55,794 --> 00:11:57,954
[It has never crossed my mind that]

157
00:11:58,035 --> 00:12:00,235
[Liang Chen would watch your live stream.]

158
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,440
[I am going to live stream
with you from now on.]

159
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,580
No.

160
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,860
Don't do that to me.

161
00:12:06,554 --> 00:12:07,634
Can we do it tonight?

162
00:12:07,954 --> 00:12:08,794
I have something to do tonight.

163
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,395
[I will wait for you.]

164
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,760
Just one round.

165
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,360
*[Beautiful Earth]

166
00:12:24,514 --> 00:12:25,874
The second take of the fifth scene.

167
00:12:33,994 --> 00:12:36,040
Le Yang, make the boy stands further.

168
00:12:36,242 --> 00:12:37,842
To the left. Further.

169
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,000
Pay attention!

170
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,760
[Security Hall?]

171
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:45,681
[Yes, Security Hall.]

172
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,560
[Does that mean I am secured?]

173
00:12:57,474 --> 00:12:58,634
[Young man.]

174
00:12:59,004 --> 00:12:59,924
[From where do you come from?]

175
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:00,845
[I didn't mean that.]

176
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:02,039
[Who are you?]

177
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,834
The difference is huge.

178
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,305
Ms Ma.

179
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
Ms Ma.

180
00:13:29,962 --> 00:13:31,002
Good day, Ms Ma.

181
00:13:33,394 --> 00:13:34,474
Well...

182
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,040
The weather is not bad.

183
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:46,074
No.

184
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:47,154
I didn't mean that.

185
00:13:47,223 --> 00:13:48,480
I mean,

186
00:13:49,354 --> 00:13:51,634
should we rehearse our lines?

187
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,480

00:28:29,128 --> 00:28:30,920
I graduated from the same university.

377
00:28:31,185 --> 00:28:32,185
Were you

378
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,100
in Batch 2013?

379
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,920
How did you know?

380
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,680
That year, Nanze University

381
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,800
[unexpectedly accepted a huge batch
of students.]

382
00:28:45,314 --> 00:28:47,714
Let me show you the latest script.

383
00:28:47,795 --> 00:28:48,635
Sure.

384
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:03,154
What is the new script?

385
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:04,120
Why do I feel like

386
00:30:04,312 --> 00:30:06,152
I am a scientist?

387
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:09,938
Our mission is to escape
the chamber of secret.

388
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,760
Why am I given a spoon?

389
00:30:12,885 --> 00:30:14,205
Am I required to learn from the movie

390
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,606
'The Shawshank Redemption'
and dig a tunnel?

391
00:30:17,552 --> 00:30:18,472
It could be.

392
00:30:18,664 --> 00:30:19,624
You can try it.

393
00:30:23,312 --> 00:30:25,152
Why do I feel that
you are fooling me around?

394
00:30:25,796 --> 00:30:26,676
Not bad.

395
00:30:26,757 --> 00:30:28,077
At least you didn't fall into the trap.

396
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,200
At least I have a spoon.

397
00:30:32,268 --> 00:30:33,988
What do you have? You have nothing.

398
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,120
I only need my brain.

399
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:42,154
I only need my brain.

400
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,240
Come here.

401
00:30:50,637 --> 00:30:51,717
What are you doing?

402
00:30:52,569 --> 00:30:53,929
Let me check

403
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,880
if you have a map tattooed on your body.

404
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,160
That is how it works in movies.

405
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:03,751
Check it for me.

406
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:05,279
-I can't see.
-Sure.

407
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:31,194
What are you doing?

408
00:31:31,315 --> 00:31:33,515
What are you doing?

409
00:31:33,596 --> 00:31:35,040
Tidy up yourself.

410
00:31:35,121 --> 00:31:37,241
What is wrong? You said
you wanted to check my body, right?

411
00:32:03,034 --> 00:32:04,874
What are we looking for?

412
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,480
You have no idea
what the spoon is for, right?

413
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,840
Lend it to me.

414
00:32:31,234 --> 00:32:32,234
Is this a chip?

415
00:32:32,685 --> 00:32:33,805
Did we win?

416
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,120
If I am not mistaken,

417
00:32:36,191 --> 00:32:37,111
the moment you open the door,

418
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,680
you will see many robots.

419
00:32:45,674 --> 00:32:47,754
We shall just stay here.

420
00:32:49,608 --> 00:32:50,528
Don't be scared.

421
00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:52,689
Are you here to accept challenge
or to enjoy?

422
00:32:53,154 --> 00:32:54,154
If you don't take the risk,

423
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,760
how would you know you'd lose?

424
00:33:02,354 --> 00:33:03,434
What is this?

425
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,520
There are so many zeros and ones.

426
00:33:07,714 --> 00:33:09,154
This is Binary Addition.

427
00:33:09,213 --> 00:33:11,533
It shares the same concept
with the usual addition method.

428
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,979
Start from the ones.

429
00:33:13,065 --> 00:33:15,185
Add each digit according to the sequence.

430
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,480
Zero plus zero equals to zero.

431
00:33:16,557 --> 00:33:17,717
Zero plus one equals to one.

432
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,400
One plus one equals to one zero.

433
00:33:19,674 --> 00:33:20,954
The additional digit on the left

434
00:33:21,035 --> 00:33:22,915
has to be carried over.

435
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,129
What are you talking about?

436
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,000
I don't get it.

437
00:33:27,081 --> 00:33:27,961
Don't count on me.

438
00:33:54,154 --> 00:33:55,714
However, there is no robot.

439
00:34:19,412 --> 00:34:22,360
It is full of robots.

440
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:23,434
Be patient.

441
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:25,247
Observe how the robots move around.

442
00:34:25,499 --> 00:34:26,739
There is a regular pattern.

443
00:34:27,411 --> 00:34:28,451
Follow me.

444
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,959
This is their blind spot.

445
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,160
They can't see us.

446
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
Let's go.

447
00:35:08,234 --> 00:35:10,194
Let me show you a military drill.

448
00:35:34,558 --> 00:35:35,638
Did you see that?

449
00:35:35,831 --> 00:35:37,751
These robots are no match for me
in shooting.

450
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,484
They are also bad at close combat.

451
00:35:43,584 --> 00:35:44,504
Where is she?

452
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,800
I found a Level Three Helmet.

453
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:55,094
It is so cool, isn't it?

454
00:35:59,474 --> 00:36:00,434
Fine.

455
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,840
I performed for nothing.

456
00:36:04,514 --> 00:36:05,554
Jump with me.

457
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,920
Come down.

458
00:36:13,103 --> 00:36:14,960
No, it's so high!

459
00:36:18,994 --> 00:36:20,218
I will shoot you
if you don't come down.

460
00:36:20,299 --> 00:36:21,539
Don't!

461
00:36:29,577 --> 00:36:31,137
Why didn't you hold me?

462
00:36:31,343 --> 00:36:32,503
My blood level will decrease
if you hit me.

463
00:36:36,874 --> 00:36:37,754
Let's go.

464
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,840
*[DO NOT CROSS]

465
00:36:49,016 --> 00:36:49,976
Run!

466
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,080
No!

467
00:37:39,502 --> 00:37:42,382
Help! Help me, Lu Jing!

468
00:37:42,471 --> 00:37:44,656
[Lu Jing, help me!]

469
00:37:44,737 --> 00:37:47,577
-[Help!]
-You can run in zig-zag quite well.

470
00:37:47,714 --> 00:37:49,714
I will die really soon
if you don't save me.

471
00:37:49,795 --> 00:37:50,955
Help!

472
00:38:08,508 --> 00:38:09,468
Jing.

473
00:38:09,549 --> 00:38:11,109
I am coming in.

474
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,240
Thank you, grandma.

475
00:38:19,127 --> 00:38:21,087
Jing, what are you doing?

476
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,720
I am watching a movie.

477
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:26,841
Lu Jing.

478
00:38:28,385 --> 00:38:29,625
Let's go.

479
00:38:30,634 --> 00:38:31,434
What?

480
00:38:35,594 --> 00:38:36,474
Lu Jing.

481
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,640
Lu Jing.

482
00:38:37,704 --> 00:38:38,544
[Lu Jing.]

483
00:38:38,635 --> 00:38:39,515
[Lu Jing.]

484
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,560
[Wake up, Lu Jing.]

485
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,720
[Lu Jing, why aren't you moving?]

486
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,240
*[Volume]

487
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,320
I seem to hear a girl talking.

488
00:38:47,914 --> 00:38:49,754
Grandma, you must have heard it wrong.

489
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,560
They are killing a pig in the movie.

490
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,440
Enjoy the movie.

491
00:39:04,412 --> 00:39:05,252
*[Soymilk]

492
00:39:44,794 --> 00:39:45,914
I am scared to death.

493
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,040
We were almost turned into boxes.

494
00:39:49,295 --> 00:39:50,575
It was so dangerous.

495
00:39:50,879 --> 00:39:52,079
Why didn't you hide?

496
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,160
[We live and die together.]

497
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,720
What were you doing?

498
00:40:00,879 --> 00:40:02,194
I recorded a video.

499
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,240
Do you want to see?

500
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,560
What video?

501
00:40:08,474 --> 00:40:09,954
[Help!]

502
00:40:10,097 --> 00:40:11,057
[Lu Jing!]

503
00:40:11,113 --> 00:40:13,120
[I will die really soon
if you don't save me.]

504
00:40:13,264 --> 00:40:15,904
[I have added the video of you walking
in zig-zag in my collection.]

505
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,840
What a jerk.
