00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,660
♫When I've chosen a path
There's no going back♫

2
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,140
♫Just ignore the rumours

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,420
♫Even though there may be more rain
Than sunshine on this path♫

4
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,580
♫I don't care if I'd be reduced to ashes♫

5
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,180
♫All I want is to be on the stage♫

6
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,500
♫The light shining from my back
Is full of hope♫

7
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,660
♫Swim through the sea of mediocre
To reach a brand new future♫

8
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,660
♫And once I held my breath♫

9
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,260
♫Let our youth blossom
On the sea of conviction for our dreams♫

10
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,921
♫I still stubbornly believe in it
At every moment♫

11
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:05,380
♫Refusing to back down♫

12
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,740
♫Never stop
We don't need to♫

13
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,220
♫Never stop
Enjoy the solitude♫

14
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,940
♫Never stop
Till the sun sets♫

15
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,220
♫I'll walk my own path♫

16
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,620
♫Till the end of time♫

17
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,220
♫On this path of dream♫

21
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,180
There were only three left...

22
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,000
with mincemeat filling.

23
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,740
So I bought the ones with shrimp.

24
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,820
Why are you standing there? Take it.

25
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,820
Eat it while it's hot.

26
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,220
Eat it while it's hot.

27
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,860
Sorry.

28
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,820
Sorry.

29
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,140
He's a thief.

30
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,060
He stole things.

31
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,380
He stole my dream...

32
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,300
and my love.

33
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,740
I know.

34
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,380
I told you.

35
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,500
I know your story.

36
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,420
What are you doing?

37
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,460
Why aren't you replying to my message?

38
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,020
Let's see what you're up to.

39
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,740
I knew you were online.

40
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,300
Hello? Why aren't you talking?

41
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,540
You...

42
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,300
Why are you here?

43
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,580
Because I miss you.

44
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,540
Why do I get the feeling
you don't welcome me?

45
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,520
No.

46
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,100
But I can't feel your enthusiasm.

47
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,520
Come on, fellow crayfishes.

48
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,940
Let her feel your enthusiasm.

49
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,700
Since you're here, don't go.

50
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,600
You're right.

51
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,140
That was Liang Chen.

52
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,280
Did I say anything that I shouldn't have?

53
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,780
It was all normal stuff, right?

54
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,940
Why didn't you tell me
you were on a live stream?

55
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,500
You didn't ask.

56
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,500
What do I do now?

57
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,340
What do you think?

58
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,340
Hi, I'm Liang Chen.

59
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,400
I get to hear two of
my favourite people hitting on each other.

60
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,400
Herman, Liang Chen said she missed you.

61
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
Any comment? I'm so envious.

62
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,900
This content is making me uncomfortable.
I'm reporting this.

63
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,860
Why are you laughing?

64
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,580
I... I'm not laughing.

65
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,600
Well...

66
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,660
Well...

67
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,560
I'm off to bed.

68
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,680
Didn't you say you missed me?

69
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,680
Why are you going to bed
after hearing my voice?

70
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,600
I...

71
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,160
Knock it off.

72
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,660
You're embarrassing me.

73
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,560
Stop typing.

74
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,620
Everyone can see the screen on my end.

75
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,800
There are so many commenters.

76
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,940
I bet they're of the same ilk as Lu Jing.

77
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,440
Come online. I'll keep you company.

78
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,650
I don't need your company.

79
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,740
Didn't you say you didn't need my company?

80
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,700
I pressed the wrong button.
You got a problem with that?

81
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,080
Feeling sleepy?

82
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm a little tired.
I want to get some rest.

83
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,660
Well, enjoy yourselves.

84
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,280
Goodnight, guys.

85
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,900
Before you go to bed,
remember to give me a call.

86
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,420
All right.

87
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,020
Keep your blanket on. Don't kick it off.

88
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,780
There's no one there tonight
to put a blanket over you.

89
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,520
Got it.

90
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,400
Forget it. I know
you'll still kick your blanket off.

91
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,000
I'll take care of you.

92
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,220
Bye, everyone. I'm signing off.

93
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,180
Please. Please work.

94
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,740
Yes!

95
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,460
Ma Hua.

96
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,340
Easy.

97
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,880
-Hey, beautiful.
-Why are you here?

98
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,220
Can't I come?

99
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,760
Did something burn?

100
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,420
Shan Shan, your house has a burning smell.

101
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,860
I'm here to check up on you
and bring you a small gift.

102
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,980
What is it?

103
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:44,600
♫You're my love♫

104
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,460
♫My decisions are all for you♫

105
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,720
♫No more doubts♫

106
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,540
♫The only certainty is you♫

107
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,761
♫You're my love♫

108
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:03,960
♫I want to keep searching♫

109
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,680
♫I want you to believe♫

110
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,580
♫The world is in my hands♫

111
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,720
Your song...

112
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,240
is exactly the same as the hit song
that Lin Qi released three months later.

113
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,740
This is not a coincidence,
it's plagiarism.

114
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,020
I've given you the evidence.

115
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,060
It's up to you to decide
what to do next.

116
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,700
Shan Shan.

117
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,100
That person is in the past now.

118
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,460
But your life has just begun.

119
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,100
Walk out of it.

120
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,980
Taro.

121
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,020
Teach me how to cook.

122
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,300
I don't want to order takeout anymore.

123
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,660
My cooking is awful.

124
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,880
I'll teach you.

125
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,080
I'll teach you
how to make anything you want.

126
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,780
Look, this is for you.

127
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,520
Grandma.

128
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,280
Take a seat over here.

129
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,920
-All right.
-Easy.

130
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,480
My grandson is the best.

131
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,840
You feel sorry for your grandma.

132
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,360
-Come on.
-Have a seat.

133
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,440
-All right.
-Give me the order, and I'll do it.

134
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,460
Okay, go ahead.

135
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,620
What did you buy?

136
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,280
Loquat tea.

137
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,960
American ginseng.

138
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,720
Yartsa gunbu.

139
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,480
Donkey-hide gelatin.

140
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,500
Are you making Ten Herbs Soup?

141
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,480
This is all for my grandson's wife.

142
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,400
What do you think?

143
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,280
That's a little too much.

144
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,820
Aren't you worried that she might suffer
from excessive internal heat?

145
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,500
No.

146
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,120
But it's okay.

147
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,540
I'm here for her.

148
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,360
Lu Jing, take these into your room.

149
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,300
All right.

150
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,800
Here's a chance for you to pick a song.

151
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,700
What songs would you like to hear me sing?

152
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,560
Lu Jing, why don't I help you?

153
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,440
No, it's fine. Grandma, stay there.

154
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,360
I'll do it.

155
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,580
Let's go with "You Have Me".

156
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,520
-I'll take them.
-You can't take it all in one trip.

157
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,080
-Make another trip. Take your time.
-All right.

158
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,020
All right now.

159
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,460
Sure.

160
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,500
Have you decided on your song
for the final round?

161
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,820
What? You actually chose "You Have Me"?

162
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,720
Come on.
Even if you're not trying to compete,

163
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,320
you shouldn't be so self-indulgent.

164
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,600
Even my nephew in elementary school
can sing this.

165
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,220
There's no difficulty at all.

166
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,920
I'm going to sing this song.
Why do you care?

167
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,880
I look forward
to Liang Chen's performance today.

168
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,560
-Unti is not bad, either.
-Hurry up.

169
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,240
Good thing we made it in time.

170
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,580
What a crowd.

171
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,340
Dad, let's take a seat.

172
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,000
When will Liang Chen be performing?

173
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,940
It's still early.
Let's watch the show first.

174
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,800
Chop chop, guys.

175
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,040
Seats in order!

176
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,080
Our next show
will start in a few minutes. Okay?

177
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,880
You'll be on stage soon.

178
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,380
How do you feel?

179
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,980
Not bad. Quite relaxed.

180
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,600
Right.

181
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,300
You picked such an ordinary song.

182
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,260
This is not an ordinary song.

183
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,520
To me,

184
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,420
this song has a different meaning.

185
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,000
My goodness.

186
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,560
Look at how big the stage is.

187
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,840
What a huge crowd.

188
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,560
-We'll get to see Liang Chen soon.
-I'm so excited.

189
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,040
Girls, are you Liang Chen's fans?

190
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,140
Yes, sir. Are you?

191
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,140
I'm not.

192
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,520
We need to lift it up high.

193
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,620
Are you... not?

194
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,820
Am I?

195
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,900
Next, let's welcome Liang Chen on stage.

196
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,780
Come on. Clap.

197
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,500
Why this song?

198
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,420
What's wrong with it?

199
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,550
♫I stand on the stage♫

200
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,140
♫Quietly humming♫

201
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:47,880
♫The voice illuminates the ocean♫

202
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,730
♫I look at the strange♫

203
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:55,480
♫Yet familiar face♫

204
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,700
♫Lights reflected in the eyes♫

205
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,940
♫Who has put on half the make-up?♫

206
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,240
♫Who is yearning for adoration?♫

207
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:13,940
♫If I hadn't sung the love song
So passionately♫

208
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,210
♫Sneaking a glimpse of you♫

209
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:23,280
♫As the breeze ruffled your clothing♫

210
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,950
♫Unforgettable♫

211
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,090
♫Your cheerfulness♫

212
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:37,270
♫Melts away my inhibitions♫

213
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,150
♫Your warm hands♫

214
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:44,030
♫Give me the reassurance I need♫

215
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,880
♫From now on♫

216
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:53,010
♫You are my everything♫

217
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:58,980
♫My love, you are my only world♫

218
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,730
♫Woo♫

219
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,090
♫My love♫

220
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:09,750
♫Woo♫

221
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:14,000
♫No need to put on disguises♫

222
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,230
♫No need for others' admiration♫

223
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:23,640
♫I finally understand why love songs
Should be sung passionately♫

224
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,380
♫Sneaking a glimpse of you♫

225
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:33,150
♫As the breeze blows, I look for♫

226
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:37,360
♫The shape of happiness♫

227
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,760
♫Your cheerfulness♫

228
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,020
♫Melts away my inhibitions♫

229
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,820
♫Your warm hands♫

230
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,660
♫Give me the reassurance I need♫

231
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,260
♫From now on♫

232
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:59,830
♫You are my everything♫

233
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:05,200
♫My love you are my only world♫

234
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,930
♫The most wonderful accident♫

235
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,000
♫So lucky to have you holding my hand♫

236
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,390
♫Occupying the rest of my days♫

237
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,980
♫Your cheerfulness♫

238
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,970
♫Melts away my inhibitions♫

239
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,810
♫Your warm hands♫

240
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:30,610
♫Give me the reassurance I need♫

241
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,430
♫From now on♫

242
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:39,810
♫You are my everything♫

243
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:45,630
♫My love you are the only world♫

244
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,550
♫My love♫

245
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,520
♫My love♫

246
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,110
♫My love♫

247
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,900
From now on,

248
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,860
you have me.

249
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,360
Liang Chen!

250
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
Liang Chen!

251
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,400
-Liang Chen!
-Liang Chen!

252
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,920
Liang Chen!

253
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,380
Liang Chen!

254
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,420
Liang Chen!

255
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,900
May I know the reason
you picked this song?

256
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,060
I want to dedicate this song...

257
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,140
to that special someone...

258
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,540
in my life.

259
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,120
Lu Jing loves this song.

260
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,980
So I'm singing it for him.

261
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,620
That's why.

262
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,400
Congratulations to Liang Chen...

263
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,220
on being the first runner-up
of The Journey of Music Lovers.

264
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,320
I miss you so much.

265
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,280
I love you so much.

266
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,500
I love you too.

267
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,380
Who are you?

268
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,540
He's my dad.

269
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,360
Dad?

270
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,920
Nice to meet you, Mr Lu.

271
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,340
I'm Liang Chen.

272
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,280
Mr Lu?

273
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,700
Didn't you call me "Dad" just now?

274
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,780
How should I address him?

275
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,140
My daughter-in-law.

276
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,420
Look.
My daughter-in-law is so honest and frank.

277
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,760
I seem to recall someone saying...

278
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,900
he wasn't a fan of Liang Chen.

279
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,520
That's right. I'm not.

280
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,820
I'm...

281
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,920
her father-in-law.

282
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,840
Right?

283
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,380
Let me wipe it off.

284
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,200
Don't move.

285
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,620
This is exactly what I'm looking for.

286
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,760
Look. I will send some photos to your mum.

287
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,200
In case she says I haven't done anything
useful since I came back from abroad.

288
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,120
Here.

289
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,020
Come on.

290
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,020
Okay. Good boy.

291
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,980
Lu Jing.
Come on. The two of you together.

292
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,780
Nice.

293
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,240
Perfect.

294
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,300
Here. A different angle.

295
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,640
Okay.

296
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,820
Nice.

297
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,420
Look.

298
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,220
This is what we called an ideal couple.

299
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,240
Ms Liang, this is...

300
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,580
Ke Ke, where have you been?

301
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
I was having a chat with the crew.

302
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,000
By the way, you should get changed.

303
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,340
Mr Liu is here.

304
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,560
Well, I'll leave you to it.

305
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,100
I'm going out for a stroll.

306
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,020
I'll leave you to it.

307
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,280
Why didn't you give me a heads-up?

308
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,540
I wasn't ready. It gave me a shock.

309
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,280
Didn't I tell you?
I was afraid you would be nervous.

310
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,320
I wasn't.

311
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,380
I've held concerts with 10,000 people.

312
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,020
That's right.

313
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,300
Next time, I'll ask my mum to come along.

314
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,340
When will that be?

315
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,900
Did my behaviour scare your dad away?

316
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,760
Look at him.

317
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,340
Did he look like he was scared?

318
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,440
Compared to my mum,

319
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,180
you're a lot more well-behaved.

320
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,780
What about your mum?

321
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,720
I won't tell you.

322
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,620
Next time, you can experience it yourself.

323
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,800
Ms Lu, look.

324
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,600
I've met our daughter-in-law.

325
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,640
Who's Ms Lu?

326
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,580
My mum.

327
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,640
Is that how your dad addresses her?

328
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,920
What's wrong with it?

329
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,180
My grandpa even calls my granny Ms Jun.

330
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,380
If that's the case,
are you going to call me Ms Liang then?

331
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,780
That's right.

332
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,260
That's our family tradition.

333
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,020
I don't mean that.

334
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,940
What do you mean, then?

335
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,140
When we get married,

336
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,420
I'll call you Ms Liang forever.

337
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,840
Watch what you say. Your dad is here.

338
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,920
My dad can't hear us.

339
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,380
Right, Dad?

340
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,380
That's right. I didn't hear anything.

341
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,740
I've sent it to you.

342
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,280
Mr Lu, are you going back?

343
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,660
I'll ask Ke Ke to give you a ride.

344
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,120
What about you?

345
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,660
I can go back myself.

346
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,480
That's not such a good idea.

347
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,820
It's all right.

348
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,340
I'll send you.

349
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,780
Sir, hop in.

350
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,340
All right.

351
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,160
Send Chen home.

352
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,420
Be safe.

353
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,260
-Bye, Mr Lu.
-Okay. Bye.

354
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,500
Let's go.

355
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,640
What's wrong?

356
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,780
I'm a little worried
after meeting your dad.

357
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,360
I'm afraid a family of educated elites
like yours...

358
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,500
might think we're not suitable together.

359
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,760
How is that possible?

360
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,880
I know I'm good.

361
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,880
But I'm afraid your dad might say,
"I'll give you money."

362
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,200
"Leave my son."

363
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,580
"Or would you like..."

364
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,000
"a set of Advanced Mathematics questions?"

365
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,760
"If you can't get a full score,
you must leave him."

366
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,320
I can't do Advanced Mathematics.

367
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,300
You have quite an imagination.

368
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,620
Isn't that how the story usually goes
in dramas?

369
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,480
Then again,

370
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,220
your dad is quite a nice person.

371
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,500
Isn't it because I have good taste
in women?

372
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,540
Besides,
even if my parents give you a hard time,

373
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,500
can't I help you cheat?

374
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,480
Fine. I know you're good at math.

375
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,760
Don't worry. You're pretty
and you have a beautiful voice.

376
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,980
You'll win over my parents
with your own talent.

377
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,060
-Come on.
-Let's go.

378
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,900
What are you doing?

379
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,420
I'm preparing a celebratory meal for you.

380
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,500
I only got second place.
What's there to celebrate?

381
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,480
What's wrong with second place?

382
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,000
You've only been in this industry
for a few years.

383
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,320
You lost to Zhang Yi and Zhong Hong.

384
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,680
This is something that one can brag about
for a lifetime.

385
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,500
This sounds like one of those cheers
high school students make on sports day.

386
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,140
"Number two, the world's number two!"

387
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,180
How did you know I would come in second?

388
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,340
Well, it's not that hard to guess.

389
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,720
With those two veterans,

390
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,600
you coming in second is a sign
of respect to them.

391
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,280
Besides, if they were the same age as you,

392
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,260
you'd have crushed them
and won first place.

393
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,760
Am I that good?

394
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,940
Of course.

395
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,620
I'll get us some drinks.

396
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,820
What is this?

397
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,680
I thought you had great foresight?

398
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,740
Why did you buy so many cakes?

399
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,700
I just wanted
to let you try different flavours.

400
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,820
Why don't we try the number one's cake?

401
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,780
Aren't they all cream-flavoured?

402
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,660
They're different.

403
00:32:40,645 --> 00:32:42,445
(Number one, the world's number one)

404
00:32:42,945 --> 00:32:44,905
(Number two, the world's number two)

405
00:32:44,985 --> 00:32:46,545
(Number three, the world's number three)

406
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,820
I think the number one's cake
tastes better.

407
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,320
How about the number three's cake?

408
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,340
Equally good.

409
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,540
Look at the details on the certificate.

410
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,630
"Extreme-Scale Big Data."

411
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,150
"International Competition
Award Certificate."

412
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,280
"First prize." "Winner, Lu Jing."

413
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,200
(Extreme-Scale Big Data International
Competition. First Prize: Lu Jing)

414
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,520
-He has brought glory to the country.
-Of course.

415
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,840
Our grandson is really something.

416
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,320
Of course he is.

417
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,760
Whose genes does he carry?

418
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,020
The Lu family's.

419
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,660
Such a brag.

420
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,590
-Make him braised pork tonight.
-Sure.

421
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,420
And dumplings, too.
With three-ingredient stuffing.

422
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,480
Good evening.

423
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,360
Ladies and gentlemen,

424
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,120
the crew members have the pleasure
of you coming aboard.

425
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,320
Would you please put your seats
in the upright position?

426
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,080
Fasten your seatbelts
and lock your table in place.

427
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,760
We will be taking off in a few minutes.

428
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,120
You are reminded
that smoking and telephone operation...

429
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,360
are not permitted.

430
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,400
Happy New Year.

431
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,340
Happy New Year.

432
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,360
I watched the live broadcast
of your competition.

433
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,120
Congrats!

434
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,740
My boyfriend is so cool.

435
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,040
Thank you, my little fairy.

436
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,400
When will you be back?

437
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,100
I'm on the plane now.

438
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,640
Do you want me to pick you up?

439
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,440
No, it's too early.

440
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,340
Ke Ke is with me, anyway.

441
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,580
All right then.

442
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,040
The plane is about to take off.
That's all for now.

443
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,700
I'll let you know when I arrive. Bye.

444
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,980
Seventeen more hours to go.

445
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,020
Why does time seem to move so slowly?

446
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,180
Do you miss me that much?

447
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,120
Did you send me money?

448
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,720
It's what I got from the competition.

449
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,240
That much?

450
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,560
The amount isn't the point.

451
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,980
What matters is that all my income
has to be given to you.

452
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,320
Should I do something in return?

453
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,240
Sure.

454
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,260
Close your eyes.

455
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,880
Now?

456
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,540
It's done.

457
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,020
This is your pocket money.

458
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,580
So I'm a guy who gets pocket money
from an older woman.

459
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,880
Behave well.

460
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,340
That way, you'll get more pocket money.

461
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,100
The plane is taking off.
That's all for now. Bye.

462
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,400
Bye.

463
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,420
Ms Liang.

464
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,520
You're always so happy.

465
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,540
To me, it hurts a lot.

466
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,700
Sorry for hurting you.

467
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,880
You keep acting
like you want to bear his children.

468
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,780
Can you show some restraint?

469
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,400
No.

470
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,100
We're finally back to the motherland.

471
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,960
You said you didn't want him
to pick you up.

472
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,100
But deep down,
you're hoping to see Lu Jing here.

473
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,300
That's impossible.

474
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,940
What?

475
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,740
I have to go.
See you in the office tomorrow.

476
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,560
Ms Liang!

477
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,340
Lu Jing!

478
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,780
I miss you so much!

479
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,980
Didn't you say you weren't coming?
Why are you here?

480
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,300
You lied to me.

481
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,440
-What's your deal?
-Dad.

482
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,020
What a coincidence.

483
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,280
Hi, Mr Lu.

484
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,220
Hi.

485
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,560
You are...

486
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,960
We're here to pick my mum up.

487
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,160
What a coincidence.
Your mum is back today?

488
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,080
That's right.

489
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,300
Well, me being here...

490
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,900
How about this?

491
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,480
You can go back first.

492
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,840
Ms Lu's flight
will only arrive in an hour.

493
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,100
I'll wait for her.

494
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,040
Mr Lu, that's not right.
Why don't we keep you company?

495
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:37,980
It's fine.

496
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,920
You can head back first.

497
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,940
Go on.

498
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,660
Why are you so eager to meet my mum?

499
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,380
Knock it off.

500
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,560
It's all right.

501
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,020
You'll have many opportunities
to meet her.

502
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,460
Many, huh?

503
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,520
-Eat up. The food is good.
-Here.

504
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,440
It's good.

505
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,260
Here. Drink up.

506
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,940
I told you the atmosphere
would be very harmonious.

507
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,700
Three on three. Perfect.

508
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,720
But judging by the situation,

509
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,740
it will become six on two very soon.

510
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,460
