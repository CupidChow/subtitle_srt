00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,660
♫When I've chosen a path
There's no going back♫

2
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,140
♫Just ignore the rumours

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,420
♫Even though there may be more rain
Than sunshine on this path♫

4
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,580
♫I don't care if I'd be reduced to ashes♫

5
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,180
♫All I want is to be on the stage♫

6
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,500
♫The light shining from my back
Is full of hope♫

7
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,660
♫Swim through the sea of mediocre
To reach a brand new future♫

8
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,660
♫And once I held my breath♫

9
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,260
♫Let our youth blossom
On the sea of conviction for our dreams♫

10
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,921
♫I still stubbornly believe in it
At every moment♫

11
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:05,380
♫Refusing to back down♫

12
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,740
♫Never stop
We don't need to♫

13
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,220
♫Never stop
Enjoy the solitude♫

14
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,940
♫Never stop
Till the sun sets♫

15
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,220
♫I'll walk my own path♫

16
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,620
♫Till the end of time♫

17
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,220
♫On this path of dream♫

The scenery is pretty nice today.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,400
Are you hungry, Ms Ma?
You didn't eat anything tonight.

23
00:02:07,313 --> 00:02:08,768
Ms Ma, let's go to eat hot pot.

24
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:09,688
Ms Ma!

25
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,440
Senior, do you have water?

26
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,031
I'm thirsty.

27
00:02:33,218 --> 00:02:35,190
I'll boil some water for you.

28
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,240
♫You look at me like I'm crazy♫

29
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,080
♫When I shut my feelings out♫

30
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,960
♫Look at me like I'm different♫

31
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,840
♫Still, you stay for something real♫

32
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,840
♫I get so lost in my moment♫

33
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,160
♫Doesn't mean I don't need you♫

34
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,400
♫I♫

35
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,120
♫Fell in love with the colors♫

36
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,161
♫The kinda that tell me what I'm thinking♫

37
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:37,520
♫I fell in love with the way we are♫

38
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,840
♫And the way we lose it♫

39
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,920
♫There's something different about us♫

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,760
♫And the reason why we stay♫

41
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,160
♫Stay♫

42
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,920
♫We fly around like paper planes♫

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,280
♫They never know where we will fall♫

44
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,561
♫Nobody can see us♫

45
00:03:58,641 --> 00:04:01,760
♫Still, they want to tear us apart♫

46
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,480

♫We're pulling cup after cup
After cup♫

52
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,600
♫Yeah, it's just the way we do it♫

53
00:04:45,601 --> 00:04:46,441
Senior.

54
00:04:49,924 --> 00:04:50,791
I want...

55
00:04:53,432 --> 00:04:54,311
What?

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,880
♫Even if what we're doing is bad♫

57
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,680
♫I still want the emotions♫

58
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,960
♫Sharing stories
That we never had yet♫

59
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,440
♫None is real♫

60
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,520
♫I think we're searching for reasons♫

61
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:17,951
I can't today.

62
00:05:20,223 --> 00:05:21,063
What's wrong?

63
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,400
I'm not feeling well.

64
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,760
♫They never know where we will fall♫

00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,041

69
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,951
Go back.

70
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,661
Do your revision and stop overthinking.

71
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,903
Can't I stay with you?

72
00:05:49,972 --> 00:05:50,812
You can't.

73
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:06,271
Goodnight.

74
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,590
Goodnight.

75
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,090
You came back.

76
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,690
We thought
you were not coming back tonight.

77
00:06:37,154 --> 00:06:38,217
It's exam week.

78
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:39,651
Don't you guys do revisions?

79
00:06:41,504 --> 00:06:43,721
Have a sit.

80
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:49,008
Jing, can you do us a favour?

81
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:53,791
-Say it.
-Can you teach us?

82
00:06:56,552 --> 00:06:57,408
Teach what?

83
00:06:58,191 --> 00:07:00,711
I've liked Di Li Re Ba for so long.

84
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,391
Can you teach me how I can pursue her?

85
00:07:02,471 --> 00:07:05,719
Jing, actually,
I've liked Jia Ling for so long.

86
00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:11,831
Jing...

87
00:07:13,323 --> 00:07:16,511
I already have a girlfriend,
but my brother likes Yang Mi.

88
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:19,391
Can you help them?

89
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:27,390
Fellow students,

90
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,791
work hard and make yourself a better man.

91
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:32,391
You have to fight for a happy life.

92
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:34,069
Keep it up.

93
00:07:35,104 --> 00:07:36,097
You...

94
00:07:36,177 --> 00:07:37,191
What?

95
00:07:37,271 --> 00:07:38,231
What does he mean?

96
00:07:47,956 --> 00:07:49,199
Lin Qi?

97
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,231
Why is it always him?

98
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,704
Hello, what's wrong?

99
00:08:08,784 --> 00:08:11,871
Hello, Orange.
I just came back from dinner.

100
00:08:12,948 --> 00:08:13,788
Then,

101
00:08:14,191 --> 00:08:15,391
why did you call me?

102
00:08:15,897 --> 00:08:17,589
What's with you?

103
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:20,081
I just want to have a talk.

104
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:23,471
Okay, you have 10 minutes.
Tell me, what's going on?

105
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,431
Okay, calm down.

106
00:08:25,511 --> 00:08:27,191
I just want to ask you...

107
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:29,471
about Ma Shan Shan and her ex-boyfriend.

108
00:08:30,071 --> 00:08:31,285
What happened with them?

109
00:08:31,365 --> 00:08:33,031
Why? Do you like her?

110
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:34,141
I...

111
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,141
We are good friends.

112
00:08:38,191 --> 00:08:41,391
I saw her drunk before.

113
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,440
I'm a bit worried.

114
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,479
Just checking up on her.

115
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:51,512
It's nothing. Just that, they broke up
after a few years being together.

116
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:52,592
Nothing special.

117
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:00,111
What about you and Lu Jing?

118
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:02,911
Pretty good.

119
00:09:03,488 --> 00:09:04,385
All right then.

120
00:09:05,032 --> 00:09:05,952
Get some rest.

121
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:20,776
I'm doomed.

122
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:23,088
What's wrong?

123
00:09:23,168 --> 00:09:24,791
Lu Jing, I have a question.

124
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:26,471
I hope you could kindly answer me.

125
00:09:27,128 --> 00:09:28,471
Was the exam difficult?

126
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,479
Be kind, be kind.

127
00:09:36,304 --> 00:09:37,704
Moderate?

128
00:09:39,143 --> 00:09:41,775
Was the difficulty
of the earlier exam moderate?

129
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:43,815
Please be humane.

130
00:09:54,264 --> 00:09:55,111
Lu Jing,

131
00:09:55,905 --> 00:09:56,917
can I have a word?

132
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:03,111
Hold this.

133
00:10:07,071 --> 00:10:09,191
Let's go.

134
00:10:11,513 --> 00:10:14,760
Brother, when you help others,
help them till the end.

135
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,311
-Why?
-I can't do it any longer.

136
00:10:17,391 --> 00:10:19,111
Qi Qi wants me to help her
with missions everyday.

137
00:10:19,191 --> 00:10:20,606
I'll get caught soon.

138
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:21,591
So?

139
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:23,391
Play two rounds for me tomorrow night.

140
00:10:24,565 --> 00:10:25,405
No.

141
00:10:26,136 --> 00:10:27,268
Why?

142
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:29,190
I don't help other girls.

143
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:31,018
My girlfriend will be upset.

144
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:37,631
Okay.

145
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:40,496
I, Gu Fei Ming,
swear that I will never tell anyone.

146
00:10:40,576 --> 00:10:41,837
Your girlfriend will never know.

147
00:10:41,917 --> 00:10:42,757
Okay?

148
00:10:43,271 --> 00:10:44,111
Boring.

149
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:45,534
Why don't you cheat then?

150
00:10:47,151 --> 00:10:49,111
This is a good way.

151
00:10:53,631 --> 00:10:54,951
Are you really not going to tell her?

152
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:57,071
How could I tell her?

153
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,591
This is not a big deal.

154
00:10:58,671 --> 00:11:01,351
But I've lied a lot to keep this lie.

155
00:11:01,431 --> 00:11:04,071
If I told her, I'll have a terrible death.

156
00:11:07,431 --> 00:11:08,726
So you promise me?

157
00:11:08,806 --> 00:11:09,720
No.

158
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,768
Then what is it?

159
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:15,034
I'm afraid I would punch you
if this conversation continues.

160
00:11:18,431 --> 00:11:19,487
Listen to my advise.

161
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:21,870
Admit your mistake sooner.
Just confess.

162
00:11:30,046 --> 00:11:31,034
After all that,

163
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:32,815
only one word is helpful.

164
00:11:35,914 --> 00:11:37,909
It's more reliable to be a cheater.

165
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:46,120
Gu Fei Ming came to Lu Jing again.

166
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,031
What do you think they talked about?

167
00:11:48,111 --> 00:11:51,602
Does Gu Fei Ming think that
Lu Jing's girlfriend is better than his...

168
00:11:51,682 --> 00:11:52,671
and feels regretful?

169
00:11:52,751 --> 00:11:54,031
What are you thinking about?

170
00:11:54,111 --> 00:11:59,431
You made us think that Lu Jing
was with Gu Fei Ming back then.

171
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,384
It appears that you're toxic.

172
00:12:03,471 --> 00:12:05,471
I wasn't in my right mind,

173
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:07,511
so I thought Gu Fei Ming was Box Spirit.

174
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:10,463
It became my reflex as time went by.

175
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:12,040
My mind is still stuck on that idea.

176
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,720
Why are you two making that face?

177
00:12:16,081 --> 00:12:18,881
What do you mean you thought
Gu Fei Ming was Box Spirit?

178
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:22,471
It's a misunderstanding,
definitely a misunderstanding.

179
00:12:22,551 --> 00:12:24,311
You two are merely friends.

180
00:12:24,871 --> 00:12:26,560
The simplest of friendships.

181
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,671
You will explain everything to me
right now.

182
00:12:33,946 --> 00:12:35,993
That's just how it is.

183
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:38,511
About this matter,

184
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,151
you have to reflect on your actions.

185
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:50,671
Lu Jing,

186
00:12:50,751 --> 00:12:53,312
you force us
to keep early hours everyday...

187
00:12:53,392 --> 00:12:55,184
to get up and exercise before daybreak.

188
00:12:55,264 --> 00:12:56,584
We have had enough!

189
00:12:57,431 --> 00:13:00,391
You want us to have four hours
of self-study everyday...

190
00:13:00,471 --> 00:13:01,871
and have unscheduled quizzes.

191
00:13:01,951 --> 00:13:03,631
We are more tired
than being in senior year.

192
00:13:04,311 --> 00:13:07,231
You don't allow us to play mobile
for over an hour in a day.

193
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:08,631
You're even stricter than my mum!

194
00:13:10,401 --> 00:13:12,641
We've had enough of your repression.

195
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:14,840
We are going to fight you today!

196
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,713
Do you guys like to be degraded?

197
00:13:16,793 --> 00:13:18,677
Stop lecturing us
with your authoritarian speech.

198
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:21,417
We have leverage on you.

199
00:13:21,849 --> 00:13:22,729
It's impossible.

200
00:13:23,911 --> 00:13:25,551
Zhou Zhou, go!

201
00:13:32,503 --> 00:13:34,703
Lu Jing. Lu Jing!

202
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,652
Look here.

203
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:39,351
See what this is.

204
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:41,888
What is this?

205
00:13:44,097 --> 00:13:46,377
If you dare to do that to us again,

206
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:50,071
we'll expose your photo with Liang Chen.

207
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:51,683
How is it?

208
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:09,533
Why are you here?

209
00:14:12,738 --> 00:14:13,588
Senior,

210
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:15,311
you have to help me.

211
00:14:17,784 --> 00:14:18,902
What's wrong?

212
00:14:24,794 --> 00:14:26,300
What is this? It's really smelly.

213
00:14:29,915 --> 00:14:32,230
No, it won't do.
Take your roommates' socks away.

214
00:14:32,631 --> 00:14:35,336
Senior, I really can't hand wash them.
Can you lend me your washing machine?

215
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,183
No, the washing machine will be broken.

216
00:14:37,263 --> 00:14:39,003
It's either the washing machine or me.

217
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:39,923
No.

218
00:14:40,705 --> 00:14:41,574
Senior!

219
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,048
Chen Chen!

220
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,658
Chen Chen.

221
00:14:45,738 --> 00:14:46,751
Your pleas won't work.

222
00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:49,072
Senior.

223
00:14:53,737 --> 00:14:55,449
How many are there left to wash?

224
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:57,307
Sister, you are the best.

225
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:14,757
Ke Ke.

226
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,280
Hi.

227
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,591
You're here.

228
00:15:17,671 --> 00:15:19,581
Ms Liang asked me
to wait here for you guys.

229
00:15:19,661 --> 00:15:21,301
Who is this lady?

230
00:15:22,183 --> 00:15:24,424
My name is Yuan Ke Ke,
I'm Liang Chen's assistant.

231
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:28,976
Miss assistant, you're great.

232
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:30,680
I've heard so much about you.

233
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,844
Pleasure to meet you.

234
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,111
We met on the airplane before.

235
00:15:37,617 --> 00:15:38,557
Follow me.

236
00:15:41,928 --> 00:15:43,008
Take a sit here.

237
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:50,711
It's such a nice seat.

238
00:15:51,528 --> 00:15:53,479
It's simply facing the singer.

239
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:55,265
Perhaps we could shake hands with them.

240
00:15:55,345 --> 00:15:58,165
If this was a concert, the ticket price
would be thousands of dollars.

241
00:16:01,012 --> 00:16:03,508
Long live the friendship!

242
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,871
Wash a half-year's worth of our socks.

243
00:16:15,532 --> 00:16:16,372
Hold on.

244
00:16:19,657 --> 00:16:20,497
And these.

245
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,271
And we want to watch
Liang Chen's live competition.

246
00:16:26,351 --> 00:16:27,751
I want her autograph as well.

247
00:16:46,151 --> 00:16:48,031
I'll go back to Ms Liang first.

248
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:54,711
Don't act like a caveman.

249
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,312
We represent Lu Jing.

250
00:16:56,392 --> 00:16:57,473
Do not embarrass him.

251
00:16:57,553 --> 00:16:58,753
I got it.

252
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:00,552
You too.

253
00:17:00,632 --> 00:17:01,592
I got it.

254
00:17:14,469 --> 00:17:15,309
Done.

255
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:16,543
Thank you.

256
00:17:22,734 --> 00:17:23,574
Are they here?

257
00:17:24,112 --> 00:17:25,952
Rest assured, everything is arranged.

258
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:30,344
Ms Liang, those little boys are so cute.

259
00:17:30,993 --> 00:17:33,231
-Why?
-They are so naive.

260
00:17:33,311 --> 00:17:35,351
Their thoughts are written
all over their face.

261
00:17:35,431 --> 00:17:37,737
They're already excited by just seeing me.

262
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:40,680
They will freeze for sure
if they see you later.

263
00:17:41,672 --> 00:17:43,352
Ke Ke, come closer.

264
00:17:44,098 --> 00:17:45,297
I want to tell you a secret.

265
00:18:02,196 --> 00:18:04,311
Stop acting. Come, let's take photo.

266
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:06,431
Lu Jing!

267
00:18:06,511 --> 00:18:07,952
-Hurry up!
-Stop acting.

268
00:18:08,032 --> 00:18:09,040
Come, ready.

269
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,360
One, two, three, cheese!

270
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:13,871
Let's see how it is.

271
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:15,111
That's it.

272
00:18:15,191 --> 00:18:16,271
It's not bad.

273
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:18,559
Look.

274
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:25,192
Ke Ke, you're here again.

275
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:27,833
Is it because Liang Chen
has something to tell us?

276
00:18:29,463 --> 00:18:31,223
Lu Jing,

277
00:18:32,825 --> 00:18:34,172
are you Herman?

278
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:37,168
Yes, I am.

279
00:18:39,592 --> 00:18:42,232
Hello, Herman.

280
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:45,048
I've liked you for so long.

281
00:18:45,128 --> 00:18:46,151
I'm a big fan.

282
00:18:46,231 --> 00:18:48,311
Can I have your autograph?

283
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:53,994
No problem.

284
00:19:00,495 --> 00:19:02,056
Do you need me
to write good luck messages?

285
00:19:02,136 --> 00:19:02,976
Sure.

286
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:06,593
You are really nice.

287
00:19:06,673 --> 00:19:08,393
Ms Liang is really lucky.

288
00:19:08,473 --> 00:19:10,376
How did she get you?

289
00:19:10,456 --> 00:19:12,336
I really envy her.

290
00:19:14,515 --> 00:19:15,355
Done.

291
00:19:20,111 --> 00:19:21,751
Then I'll go back first.

292
00:19:25,991 --> 00:19:27,031
Ms. Ke Ke.

293
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:34,351
They want senior's autograph.

294
00:19:34,431 --> 00:19:35,991
Can you help them?

295
00:19:36,071 --> 00:19:38,312
No problem. Autograph, right?

296
00:19:38,392 --> 00:19:39,513
As much as you want!

297
00:19:39,593 --> 00:19:40,633
I'll tell Ms Liang.

298
00:19:42,092 --> 00:19:42,951
What else do you want?

299
00:19:43,608 --> 00:19:45,537
Do you want a photo with her?

300
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:46,544
Sure.

301
00:19:46,624 --> 00:19:47,568
Yes, we do.

302
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:49,696
Thank you, Ms Ke Ke!

303
00:19:50,351 --> 00:19:51,311
You're welcome.

304
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:52,952
We are family from now on.

305
00:19:53,032 --> 00:19:54,305
I should do that.

306
00:19:54,385 --> 00:19:57,570
Why don't we add each other on WeChat?

307
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,494
Sure. We should add you.

308
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,085
Come on.

309
00:20:01,165 --> 00:20:02,156
The phone, phone!

310
00:20:02,236 --> 00:20:03,162
What about I add you?

311
00:20:03,242 --> 00:20:04,282
I'll add you.

312
00:20:06,671 --> 00:20:07,757
Why?

313
00:20:07,837 --> 00:20:08,729
Why?

314
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:10,071
My sister-in-law sang very well.

315
00:20:10,151 --> 00:20:11,697
Why couldn't she get the first place?

316
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,952
It's a conspiracy for sure.

317
00:20:14,032 --> 00:20:15,257
Calm down.

318
00:20:15,337 --> 00:20:17,063
There are a few more episodes to go.

319
00:20:17,143 --> 00:20:18,903
Liang Chen can't win every battle, right?

320
00:20:19,816 --> 00:20:22,185
This is so-called laying low in wait
for the right moment...

321
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:23,572
and to win the champion at last.

322
00:20:25,551 --> 00:20:26,591
Makes sense.

323
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,111
I see.

324
00:20:28,191 --> 00:20:29,471
Jing is smart.

325
00:20:37,383 --> 00:20:38,243
You guys,

326
00:20:38,951 --> 00:20:39,900
get in the car.

327
00:20:46,026 --> 00:20:47,543
Why isn't my sister-in-law here?

328
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:48,932
She doesn't ride with us.

329
00:20:49,012 --> 00:20:51,901
She is afraid of being blocked by her fans
and left early.

330
00:20:51,981 --> 00:20:53,141
Then where are we going?

331
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:56,305
Taking you guys
to get the autograph and the photo.

332
00:20:59,111 --> 00:20:59,951
Let's go!

333
00:21:04,151 --> 00:21:04,991
Hurry up!

334
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:08,497
This way, please.

335
00:21:10,681 --> 00:21:12,242
You're here. Take a sit.

336
00:21:12,322 --> 00:21:13,162
Have a sit, please.

337
00:21:18,384 --> 00:21:19,272
What are you doing?

338
00:21:19,352 --> 00:21:21,099
-Come on over.
-Sit down.

339
00:21:22,126 --> 00:21:22,966
Let's sit.

340
00:21:26,511 --> 00:21:27,511
Let me help you.

341
00:21:39,087 --> 00:21:40,071
Have some water.

342
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,187
Thank you for coming to my competition.

343
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:48,951
I heard that you guys want my autograph.

344
00:21:56,712 --> 00:21:57,831
What are you doing?

345
00:22:01,511 --> 00:22:03,304
Please sign on my shirt

346
00:22:03,384 --> 00:22:05,548
and write
"Zhou Zhou is the most handsome man."

347
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:08,220
Zhou Zhou, aren't you ashamed?

348
00:22:08,624 --> 00:22:09,478
Okay.

349
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:11,993
I want it too.

350
00:22:12,073 --> 00:22:14,205
Write "I'm more handsome
than Zhou Zhou" for me.

351
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:16,231
For me,

352
00:22:16,311 --> 00:22:18,511
I'm more handsome
than Liu'er and Zhou Zhou.

353
00:22:19,951 --> 00:22:21,311
Don't force me.

354
00:22:24,151 --> 00:22:25,710
Who is the most handsome man?

355
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,734
Figure it out yourself.

356
00:22:30,221 --> 00:22:31,471
Cheers! Cheers!
(Zhou Zhou's the most handsome.)

357
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:32,751
Senior, here.
(Liang Chen)

358
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:37,271
(More handsome than Zhou Zhou.
Liang Chen)

359
00:22:37,351 --> 00:22:38,431
Let's continue to eat.

360
00:22:38,511 --> 00:22:39,951
Here, Ke Ke.
Eat some vegetables.

361
00:22:40,031 --> 00:22:43,901
([Even more handsome than Liu'er
and Zhou Zhou. Liang Chen)

362
00:22:45,881 --> 00:22:47,736
(The most handsome of all. Liang Chen)

363
00:22:47,816 --> 00:22:49,296
Ke Ke, eat some meat.

364
00:22:52,443 --> 00:22:53,471
Are you guys cold?

365
00:22:53,551 --> 00:22:55,391
Do you want to turn up
the air conditioner?

366
00:22:55,471 --> 00:22:56,311
We're not cold.

367
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,311
We're not cold!

368
00:23:05,031 --> 00:23:06,191
It's mine! It's mine!

369
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:08,471
Don't steal it from me!

370
00:23:19,248 --> 00:23:20,511
Leave some for us!

371
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:24,345
Senior, what else do you want to eat?

372
00:23:24,425 --> 00:23:25,472
Let me cook it for you.

373
00:23:25,552 --> 00:23:27,240
Actually I can't eat this much.

374
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,441
I usually don't eat meat.

375
00:23:29,521 --> 00:23:30,721
I mostly eat vegetables.

376
00:23:33,232 --> 00:23:35,512
Ms Liang, are you serious?

377
00:23:35,927 --> 00:23:37,991
Just eat, speak less.

378
00:23:38,071 --> 00:23:40,591
-But you usually...
-Why don't we take a photo?

379
00:23:41,072 --> 00:23:42,352
Sure, a photo!

380
00:23:43,097 --> 00:23:44,420
Take the phone out! Go go go!

381
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,431
Can I take a photo with you first?

382
00:23:46,511 --> 00:23:47,711
Save me a nice place.

383
00:23:49,256 --> 00:23:51,111
-You don't have to.
-Help us take the photo.

384
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:53,521
Get closer.

385
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:01,112
Three, two, one.

386
00:24:25,513 --> 00:24:28,040
Ms. Ma, it's my fault.

387
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,514
Don't ignore me, okay?

388
00:24:40,751 --> 00:24:42,389
Hello, your delivery is here.

389
00:24:42,469 --> 00:24:43,309
Thank you.

390
00:24:44,827 --> 00:24:46,668
Hold on! It's me, Ms. Ma.

391
00:24:46,748 --> 00:24:47,588
It's me.

392
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,461
What do you want?

393
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,641
Stage play is not a good job these days.

394
00:24:54,721 --> 00:24:57,761
So I work as a part-time delivery man.

395
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,321
It really isn't easy to work
as a delivery man.

396
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,593
I'm freezing and starving.

397
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,451
And couldn't even get a glass
of warm water from the customer.

398
00:25:37,664 --> 00:25:39,529
What did you do to the delivery man?

399
00:25:41,512 --> 00:25:43,000
You have no idea...

400
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,121
how hard I tried
just to get the uniform off of him.

401
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,057
You eat this much by yourself?

402
00:25:51,137 --> 00:25:52,171
Isn't it too much?

403
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:53,115
I can finish them.

404
00:25:53,657 --> 00:25:55,057
Really?

405
00:25:58,825 --> 00:26:00,123
What else do you want to eat?

406
00:26:03,673 --> 00:26:05,514
There's a bun shop at the entrance
to the neighbourhood.

407
00:26:08,842 --> 00:26:10,281
You can't have meant the one
that has many...

408
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:11,201
That's the one.

409
00:26:16,711 --> 00:26:17,991
How many would you like to eat?

410
00:26:18,071 --> 00:26:18,911
Six.

411
00:26:30,111 --> 00:26:31,231
I'll go buy them for you.

412
00:26:43,986 --> 00:26:45,046
He finally left.

413
00:26:47,464 --> 00:26:49,241
Mate, what is this?

414
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:50,588
It's International Data Competition.

415
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:56,979
"Everest Big Data
International Competition."

416
00:26:57,711 --> 00:26:59,969
Many geniuses of computer science
will be there.

417
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:01,391
Should I sign up too?

418
00:27:02,337 --> 00:27:03,753
This is a world-class competition.

419
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:05,111
You're just an undergraduate.

420
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:06,031
Stop kidding.

421
00:27:06,744 --> 00:27:08,191
I'm an undergraduate, so what?

422
00:27:08,271 --> 00:27:09,312
It is rightly said,

423
00:27:09,392 --> 00:27:11,741
nothing in the world is difficult
for one who sets his mind to it.

424
00:27:11,821 --> 00:27:13,861
Right, you're quite optimistic.

425
00:27:16,963 --> 00:27:17,940
I already signed up.

426
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,564
That fast?

427
00:27:20,871 --> 00:27:21,831
I want to give it a try.

428
00:27:22,952 --> 00:27:24,871
You are indeed a genius.

429
00:27:24,951 --> 00:27:28,208
An international competition like Everest
is beyond our capabilities.

430
00:27:29,784 --> 00:27:32,185
Jing even dared to pursue Liang Chen.

431
00:27:32,265 --> 00:27:33,665
What else is there to be afraid of?

432
00:27:34,271 --> 00:27:35,711
Jing, keep it up.

433
00:27:36,136 --> 00:27:38,128
Challenge yourself,
win honour for the country.

434
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:39,408
You've got this.

435
00:27:40,991 --> 00:27:42,471
I signed you up as well...

436
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:44,357
when I registered just now.

437
00:27:48,545 --> 00:27:49,685
Here you go again.

438
00:27:51,232 --> 00:27:53,536
I think you never give up
until you face the grim reality.

439
00:27:59,271 --> 00:28:00,178
Stop looking.

440
00:28:00,258 --> 00:28:02,018
I already reformatted your photo album.

441
00:28:05,739 --> 00:28:06,652
No back up?

442
00:28:07,396 --> 00:28:08,560
I forgot.

443
00:28:09,473 --> 00:28:10,713
Are you dumb?

444
00:28:12,495 --> 00:28:13,677
You didn't have a back up for this?

445
00:28:14,096 --> 00:28:15,365
Are you a fool?

446
00:28:17,327 --> 00:28:20,727
From this day on,
let's work hard together.

447
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,991
Hello.

448
00:28:51,071 --> 00:28:55,031
Hello, do you want meat bun
or shrimp bun?

449
00:28:57,696 --> 00:28:59,616
Hello, say something.

450
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:02,991
Which do you want, meat bun or shrimp bun?

451
00:29:05,497 --> 00:29:06,435
Meat bun.

452
00:29:07,568 --> 00:29:08,568
Okay.

453
00:29:09,584 --> 00:29:10,755
Six meat buns, please.

454
00:29:32,168 --> 00:29:33,929
Are these buns that delicious?

455
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:35,169
There are so many people in line.

456
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:40,439
Why are you just standing there? Take it.

457
00:30:01,482 --> 00:30:03,152
How is it? Is it delicious?

458
00:30:07,496 --> 00:30:10,400
Are you getting close to me
just to know my story?

459
00:30:12,128 --> 00:30:13,264
I know drama actors...

460
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,000
like to obtain materials around them
for a story.

461
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:24,021
No.

462
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,231
I know all of your story.

463
00:30:33,091 --> 00:30:35,872
From now on,
don't talk to me, just ignore me.

464
00:30:36,304 --> 00:30:37,504
I'm very mad.

465
00:30:39,257 --> 00:30:41,593
I truly regret taking you to this concert.

466
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,831
It's such an elegant art,
but you slept through it.

467
00:30:44,431 --> 00:30:45,807
It was so boring.

468
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:47,591
It's not my cup of tea.

469
00:30:47,671 --> 00:30:49,431
You even smacked your lips while sleeping.

470
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:52,791
I was thinking
of eating hot pot with you later.

471
00:30:52,871 --> 00:30:54,111
Let me search for a nice hot pot shop.

472
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,946
I think I left my phone on the seat.

473
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:00,251
I'll go find it. Wait for me.

474
00:31:01,711 --> 00:31:02,591
Search carefully.

475
00:31:02,671 --> 00:31:04,511
The seat with drool is yours.

476
00:32:08,911 --> 00:32:12,312
♫The sight of love is you♫

477
00:32:12,392 --> 00:32:15,992
♫My decisions are all for you♫

478
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:22,471
♫No more doubts
The only certainty is you♫

479
00:32:23,831 --> 00:32:27,631
♫You're my love♫

480
00:32:27,711 --> 00:32:31,951
♫I want to keep searching♫

481
00:32:32,031 --> 00:32:34,671
♫I want you to believe♫

482
00:32:34,751 --> 00:32:39,951
♫The world is in my hands♫

483
00:32:48,191 --> 00:32:50,241
Last night, famous musician, Lin Qi,

484
00:32:50,321 --> 00:32:52,871
posted his wedding photo
with his fiance on the Internet,

485
00:32:52,951 --> 00:32:55,129
and announced that their wedding
will be held soon.

486
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:56,423
Lin Qi?

487
00:32:56,503 --> 00:32:58,103
Sir, your coffee is done.

488
00:32:59,003 --> 00:32:59,843
Thank you.

489
00:33:03,841 --> 00:33:04,851
(Ma Shan Shan)

490
00:33:05,497 --> 00:33:06,634
Hello, Ms Ma.

491
00:33:06,714 --> 00:33:09,481
Hello, sir.
The owner of this phone is drunk.

492
00:33:09,561 --> 00:33:11,873
Can you come over to pick her up?
The address is...

493
00:33:11,953 --> 00:33:12,793
Sir!

494
00:33:18,034 --> 00:33:18,874
Cheers!

495
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,363
The eldest,

496
00:33:29,362 --> 00:33:30,271
be happy.

497
00:33:33,391 --> 00:33:34,276
The second eldest,

498
00:33:37,698 --> 00:33:39,111
laugh often.

499
00:33:42,447 --> 00:33:43,557
The third eldest...

500
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,191
Miss Ma!

501
00:33:52,271 --> 00:33:53,711
Stop drinking!

502
00:33:54,751 --> 00:33:55,831
Stop drinking, Ms Ma!

503
00:33:57,231 --> 00:33:58,705
Why are you drinking so much?

504
00:33:58,785 --> 00:33:59,785
You have to stop!

505
00:34:00,377 --> 00:34:02,712
-Cheers.
-Take a sip.

506
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:04,832
-Let's go. Let's go home.
-Have a sip.

507
00:34:04,912 --> 00:34:06,231
Who are you?

508
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:07,471
I'm...

509
00:34:07,551 --> 00:34:09,701
Stand up! Stand up!

510
00:34:11,911 --> 00:34:12,781
Step back.

511
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:17,411
What are you doing?

512
00:34:18,653 --> 00:34:19,506
Smile.

513
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,061
Stop messing around, Ms Ma.

514
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:22,141
Smile!

515
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,911
Have you guys seen it?

516
00:34:28,871 --> 00:34:29,925
He can smile.

517
00:34:31,117 --> 00:34:33,287
Do you see his smile?

518
00:34:35,951 --> 00:34:37,786
I really envy you for being able to smile.

519
00:34:39,527 --> 00:34:41,297
I envy you that you can smile.

520
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:45,031
Why can't I do that?

521
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,961
I've tried so hard.

522
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:54,041
Did you know? I've tried so hard.

523
00:34:56,769 --> 00:35:02,097
Do you know how long
those sleepless nights were?

524
00:35:04,529 --> 00:35:06,754
Do you know why I have cats as pets?

525
00:35:07,697 --> 00:35:11,457
Do...? Do you have any idea
how many diaries I've written?

526
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:15,921
Do you know why I do comedy?

527
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,720
Do you guys know?

528
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:26,551
I wish to laugh out loud
when I listen to jokes...

529
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,762
like you guys do.

530
00:35:29,649 --> 00:35:32,914
I wish I could clap
when I watch the skit.

531
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,271
I'm clearly doing comedy...

532
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:39,231
that follows the script
which can make everyone laugh.

533
00:35:39,311 --> 00:35:43,471
I can make everyone laugh!

534
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:45,871
But my heart...

535
00:35:47,624 --> 00:35:49,425
My heart still feels numb.

536
00:35:49,505 --> 00:35:50,906
I have no feelings.

537
00:35:50,986 --> 00:35:52,706
I have no feelings.

538
00:35:53,841 --> 00:35:55,426
I can't smile.

539
00:35:55,506 --> 00:35:57,186
I still can't smile.

540
00:36:02,475 --> 00:36:05,289
I've tried really hard.

541
00:36:10,305 --> 00:36:13,665
I even lived my life like a joke.

542
00:36:16,015 --> 00:36:18,095
I lost my dream.

543
00:36:18,881 --> 00:36:22,522
I even... I even lost...

544
00:36:22,602 --> 00:36:24,742
my best friend!

545
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:30,959
I know everyone is making fun of me.

546
00:36:31,993 --> 00:36:33,313
Everyone is laughing...

547
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,440
Laughing...

548
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,640
Laughing...

549
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,880
Laughing...

550
00:36:42,391 --> 00:36:43,365
And you...

551
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:47,351
You want to laugh at me too, right?

552
00:36:48,954 --> 00:36:50,160
Just laugh.

553
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,791
Do as you wish.

554
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:54,977
Am I not funny?

555
00:36:56,391 --> 00:37:00,002
Laugh, just laugh!

556
00:37:00,082 --> 00:37:03,461
Just laugh! Just laugh! Just laugh!

557
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:05,200
Laugh at me!

558
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:09,701
Ms Ma,

559
00:37:12,603 --> 00:37:13,604
let's go home.

560
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:18,854
Come on, let's go home.

561
00:37:24,135 --> 00:37:25,041
Let's go.

562
00:37:32,589 --> 00:37:36,391
Do you think I'm a joke too?

563
00:37:51,628 --> 00:37:52,798
You know everything?

564
00:37:56,097 --> 00:37:57,448
What do you know?

565
00:37:59,831 --> 00:38:01,391
And you believed it?

566
00:38:01,471 --> 00:38:03,031
No, I was just kidding.

567
00:38:05,351 --> 00:38:07,311
I had lined up for over two hours
to buy these buns.

568
00:38:07,391 --> 00:38:08,359
Why don't you eat them?

569
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:09,519
Eat more.

570
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:20,073
From now on, just call me
if you want to eat anything.

571
00:38:20,153 --> 00:38:21,266
Stop ordering delivery.

572
00:38:21,346 --> 00:38:22,745
I'm more reliable than delivery.

573
00:38:22,825 --> 00:38:25,602
And the most important thing is,
I'm at your beck and call.

574
00:38:25,682 --> 00:38:27,123
Ms. Ma, consider it.

575
00:38:27,203 --> 00:38:28,125
You should leave.

576
00:38:37,664 --> 00:38:40,304
All right, you're ditching me.

577
00:38:42,248 --> 00:38:43,968
This is what women do.

578
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:52,363
Stop ignoring my calls.

579
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,791
Stop ignoring me.

580
00:39:13,871 --> 00:39:15,168
Why are you here so late?

581
00:39:15,248 --> 00:39:16,571
I'm here to give you warmth.

582
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,204
Give me warmth?

583
00:39:22,457 --> 00:39:25,297
Drink it while it's still warm.
It's nutritious and healthy.

584
00:39:30,774 --> 00:39:31,668
Thank you.

585
00:39:41,271 --> 00:39:45,471
Senior, did you think that...?

586
00:39:47,422 --> 00:39:48,364
What?

587
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:50,962
What did you thought of?

588
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:54,631
Nothing.

589
00:39:58,551 --> 00:40:00,951
I'm here to report my following schedule.

590
00:40:02,509 --> 00:40:03,428
Tell me.

591
00:40:04,136 --> 00:40:06,256
I'm going to prepare
for a Big Data competition next week.

592
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:09,104
I might not able to see you frequently.

593
00:40:09,184 --> 00:40:11,064
So you have to bear with it
for the time being.

594
00:40:11,584 --> 00:40:12,591
