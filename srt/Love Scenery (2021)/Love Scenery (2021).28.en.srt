00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,660
♫When I've chosen a path
There's no going back♫

2
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,140
♫Just ignore the rumours

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,420
♫Even though there may be more rain
Than sunshine on this path♫

4
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,580
♫I don't care if I'd be reduced to ashes♫

5
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,180
♫All I want is to be on the stage♫

6
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,500
♫The light shining from my back
Is full of hope♫

7
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,660
♫Swim through the sea of mediocre
To reach a brand new future♫

8
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,660
♫And once I held my breath♫

9
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,260
♫Let our youth blossom
On the sea of conviction for our dreams♫

10
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,921
♫I still stubbornly believe in it
At every moment♫

11
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:05,380
♫Refusing to back down♫

12
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,740
♫Never stop
We don't need to♫

13
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,220
♫Never stop
Enjoy the solitude♫

14
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,940
♫Never stop
Till the sun sets♫

15
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,220
♫I'll walk my own path♫

16
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,620
♫Till the end of time♫

17
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,220
♫On this path of dream♫

I'm done.

22
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,620
Liang Chen,

23
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,460
you...

24
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,440
I'm... I'm done.

25
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,600
I'm done.

26
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,700
All done.

27
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,660
What was I doing?

28
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,740
But his Adam's Apple...

29
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,220
is just too sexy.

30
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,220
What am I thinking?

31
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,580
You had a long day.

32
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,490
Go to sleep.

33
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,540
Good night.

34
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,900
He left?

35
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,980
Why?

36
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,020
Why did he leave?

37
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,340
Am I not sexy enough?

38
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,860
It can't be.

39
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,060
Why?

40
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,680
I knew it.

41
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,980
I shouldn't have trusted Yuan Ke Ke
to choose outfits for me.

42
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,520
Sorry!

43
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,460
It's okay.

44
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,240
Aren't you that singer?

45
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,620
No, you got the wrong person.

46
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,920
Hello.

47
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,640
Ms Ma, you're finally here.

48
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,900
Come on in.

49
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,080
Ms Ma, any food or drinks for you?

50
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,140
No, I'm good.

51
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,480
Thank you so much for coming over.

52
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,820
I'm actually...

53
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,380
I'm actually fine.

54
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,680
You're feverish.

55
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,020
Have you taken medicine?

56
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,380
No.

57
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,900
Have you eaten?

58
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,820
My appetite's working against me.

59
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,640
If that's the case, I'll be off, then.

60
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,560
No, don't... Ms Ma.

61
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,160
I'm actually a little hungry.

62
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,100
I think some porridge would do me good.

63
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,720
Wait here.

64
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,280
Okay.

65
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,660
The porridge is ready. Dig in.

66
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,500
Thank you, Ms Ma.

67
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,560
Hot!

68
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,600
Be careful.

69
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,000
It's hot. Blow on it.

70
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,920
Are you all right?

71
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,640
I'm fine.

72
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,650
Ms Ma, you're really thoughtful.

73
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,760
Here.

74
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,200
Eat up.

75
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,560
I forgot that you have a cold...

76
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,200
and not a broken arm.

77
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,680
Ms Ma, I'm ill.

78
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,580
My limbs are weak.

79
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,480
Can you do it like just now...?

80
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,460
Nope.

81
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,120
Eat up.

82
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,040
If your condition worsens, just call me.

83
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,200
Please, please. Please don't go.

84
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,580
I still feel unwell.

85
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,720
Please?

86
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,120
Eat up.

87
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,140
After that, go to bed.

88
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,040
Okay.

89
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,840
When did you prepare these?

90
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,080
I called the hotel yesterday
and pulled some strings.

91
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,160
We can see the sunset from here.

92
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,080
Do you like it?

93
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,840
Yes.

94
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,020
Thank you.

95
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,600
But because of me,

96
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,980
you're stuck in this hotel.

97
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,640
It's convenient here in the hotel.

98
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,740
I like it.

99
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,480
Drink slowly.
Nobody's going to take your share.

100
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,060
I didn't say...

101
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,680
So it was just my imagination?

102
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,740
No.

103
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,220
Eat up.

104
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,960
Is it delicious?

105
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,760
Yes.

106
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,320
♫Somebody, catch me
Lord♫

107
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,200
♫Before I fall too far♫

108
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,480
♫Save for these memories, Lord♫

109
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,400
♫I've given up all you are♫

110
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:31,400
♫I need some loving, Lord♫

111
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,600
♫It's a need within me♫

112
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,680
♫Only need to love him more♫

113
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,960
♫For me to be free♫

114
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,400
♫She's scared to be lonely, Lord♫

115
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,920
♫She pushes everyone away♫

116
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:08,360
♫She's asking the universe♫

117
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,040
♫But knows what it will say♫

118
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,000
♫Don't give up on her♫

119
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,720
♫She'll give up on herself♫

120
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,920
♫Only needs to be adored♫

121
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:35,800
♫And told there is no one else♫

122
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:41,280
♫So, somebody, hold me down♫

123
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,200
♫Before I fall to the cracks♫

124
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:52,520
♫I've been acting stupid, Lord♫

125
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,080
♫And I need to come back♫

126
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,280
♫I'll be much better, Lord♫

127
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,680
♫I'll be and let be♫

128
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:14,440
♫'Cause I need a hand here, Lord♫

129
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,400
♫And a way to see♫

130
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,720
♫Fall through the cracks♫

131
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,041

♫I'm sorry I caused you pain♫

138

♫So, somebody, catch me, Lord♫

140

♫Before I hurt someone else♫

141
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,680
Good morning.

142
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,520
Good morning.

143
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,540
What would you like?
I'll order it for you.

144
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,300
Sandwich and fruit juice.

145
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,980
Got it. At your service, Liang Chen.

146
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,780
Morning kiss.

147
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,900
I don't think
this is how a morning kiss should be.

148
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,160
Then how should it be?

149
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,560
It should leave
an unforgettable impression...

150
00:18:17,641 --> 00:18:19,220
for the whole day.

151
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,500
Give me a minute.

152
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,680
Hello.

153
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,600
Chen Chen, you finally picked up my call.

154
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,520
What's up?

155
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,100
Someone got a shot of you holding hands
with Lu Jing on the streets.

156
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,800
When was that?

157
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,800
Just yesterday.

158
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,860
But we're keeping it under wraps
for the time being.

159
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,760
I'll send the picture to you.

160
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,020
We'll talk more when you're back.

161
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,060
Or why don't you just head back now?

162
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,760
I know that you're head over heels
in love right now.

163
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,280
But I do not hope
for any problems to arise...

164
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,520
during the transition of your career.

165
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,780
This would greatly affect your future.

166
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,180
Understood.

167
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,960
Let's eat.

168
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,640
I checked if there were any tickets.

169
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,100
There's a ride back later today.

170
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,660
Why are we going home?

171
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,100
Didn't Ms Qing just call you about work?

172
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,120
How did you know?

173
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,320
If I couldn't even get such
a small thing right,

174
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,860
how can I be your boyfriend?

175
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,600
But I've put in so much effort
and planning...

176
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,000
in the preparation of this trip.

177
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,160
If I sacrifice this trip
just because of my job...

178
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,360
It's all right.

179
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,240
There'll be plenty of time for us
in the future anyway.

180
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,160
Isn't that right?

181
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,220
Ever since I found out
that you were Little Box,

182
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,420
I've prepared myself for this.

183
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,540
No matter what happens,
I'll be by your side.

184
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,300
Thank you.

185
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,480
Hello.

186
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,780
Are you home safe and sound?

187
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,920
I've just come home.

188
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,060
-What about you?
-I've just showered.

189
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,480
Rest early.

190
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,680
Clear your mind and have a restful sleep.

191
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,320
I bet you're worn out by the trip
we had the last two days.

192
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,180
I wish I could hug you.

193
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,180
I wish I could do the same.

194
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,480
Lu Jing?

195
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,480
I'm here.

196
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,460
Why are you silent?

197
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,920
Nothing.

198
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,620
The sound of your breathing relieves me.

199
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,080
Okay.

200
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,500
I'll hang up after you're asleep.

201
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
Ms Liang, look. Something's happened!

202
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,020
What's up?

203
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,520
The photo of you and Lu Jing
has been leaked.

204
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,240
They even dug out Lu Jing's identity.

205
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,280
Some netizens commented that you
and Lu Jing are staying in the same area.

206
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,960
Everyone's asking about the address.

207
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,980
Be quiet.

208
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,000
Hello.

209
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,960
Jia Yun, what brings you here?

210
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,000
I've come to see her.

211
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,960
And see if there's any help I could offer.

212
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,900
Come on in.

213
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,680
The current situation
is quite complicated.

214
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,880
If you choose not to respond,

215
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,200
the photos will serve
as concrete evidence.

216
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,720
The rumours
will only spiral out of control.

217
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,220
The consequences will be unthinkable.

218
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,280
(Sun Bin Yu)

219
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,840
A call.

220
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,800
-Hello.
-Hello, Orange.

221
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,720
What's up?

222
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,320
Lu Jing's grandma is hurt.
Why don't you come down to the hospital?

223
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
Okay.

224
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,320
What's up?

225
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,840
Lu Jing's grandma is hurt.
I need to go to the hospital to visit her.

226
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,900
I'll give you a ride.

227
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,160
Okay.

228
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,760
(Inpatient Department)

229
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,320
I owe you big time for today, buddy.

230
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,380
No problem. It was only a meal.

231
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,020
Lu Jing.

232
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,720
Why are you here?

233
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,660
Taro told me that your grandma is hurt.

234
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,220
Jia Yun drove me here.

235
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,320
Hurry in and pay Grandma a visit.

236
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,000
Ding's about to give me a lift home.

237
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,040
Go on.

238
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,520
-Let's go.
-See you.

239
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,440
Let's go.

240
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,800
Let's go.

241
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,720
Okay.

242
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,240
What a surprise.

243
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,960
Grandpa, please sit down.

244
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,680
How are you feeling, Grandma?

245
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,860
I'm fine.

246
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,680
It's no big deal.

247
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,220
The doctor said
it's just a minor ankle sprain.

248
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,800
She was about to check out,
but Jing was worried.

249
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,380
He insisted on having Grandma
under observation for two more days.

250
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,640
So did the doctor say
when Grandma can go home?

251
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,080
Should we hire a care worker?

252
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,440
It's all right. It's just a sprained ankle.

253
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,160
I don't need a care worker for that.
Grandpa can take care of me.

254
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,660
Yeah, I can take care of her.

255
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,340
Don't worry, Grandma's fine.

256
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,140
Grandma, did you see
who it was that hit you?

257
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,760
That's not really important.

258
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,240
It was just a few young punks
who wanted to ask Grandma a few questions.

259
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,240
They were loud and rude.

260
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,720
It scared her so much
that she stepped back,

261
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,200
causing the sprain.

262
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,420
-Yeah.
-Grandma, Grandpa.

263
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,080
I'm sorry.

264
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,820
It was because of me
that Grandma was hurt.

265
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,240
This has nothing to do with you.

266
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,480
Yeah. It's not your fault. Right?

267
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,960
Besides, child,

268
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:37,600
I'm telling you, don't believe those
non-sensical rumours and scandals.

269
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,000
Don't listen to their claptrap.

270
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,520
Just because people are talking
doesn't mean it's the end of the world.

271
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,560
That's right.

272
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,640
Don't let it get to you.

273
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,560
Yeah! You can't let it get to you.

274
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,920
Haven't you heard?

275
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,600
"Let them be upset, but not me."

276
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,880
"Anger wastes away health
that no one can give."

277
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,800
Right?

278
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,220
Exactly.

279
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,960
Thank you, Grandpa and Grandma.

280
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,180
You're too polite.

281
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,160
We're a family.

282
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,240
Yeah.

283
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,560
You're my grandson's girlfriend.

284
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,800
Grandma's right.

285
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,940
We're a family.

286
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,560
Jing, you've got to take good care
of Liang Chen.

287
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,780
Yes, Grandma.

288
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,460
Are you trying to say something?

289
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,480
Not really.

290
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,680
I just wanted to ask...

291
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,940
if you've really let go of Orange.

292
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,980
As of now, I'm her best friend.

293
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,780
But when she needs me,
I'll still be there.

294
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,080
Really?

295
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,000
As long as she's happy,

296
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,160
it doesn't matter who I am to her.

297
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,240
Right?

298
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,120
Enough. Say no more, Ding.

299
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,720
If you keep this up,
I'm afraid I might fall for you...

300
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,260
and marry you right here and now.

301
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,780
Are all modern drama actors so flamboyant?

302
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,020
We're finally home.

303
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,440
You look like a grandma.

304
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,560
You look like a grandpa.

305
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,180
That makes us an old couple.

306
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,360
Look.

307
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,981
Don't you think
we'll look perfect together...

308
00:28:28,061 --> 00:28:29,401

I think Ms Qing and the rest
are more nervous than we are.

344
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,040
Isn't this too messy? I can't read it.

345
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,300
It's too late.

346
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,160
It's fine.

347
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,000
Ms Liang, Lu Jing, here are your scripts.

348
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,260
Take a look.
Just read them out later.

349
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,460
Well? We'll begin whenever you're ready.

350
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,300
Three, two, one.

351
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,860
Hi, everyone. I'm Liang Chen.

352
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,600
Hi, everyone.

353
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,900
I'm Liang Chen.

354
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,540
I mean, I'm Liang Chen's Lu Jing.
Hi, everyone.

355
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,300
What did you say?

356
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,620
Did I say something wrong?

357
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,260
He's right.

358
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,780
He's Lu Jing.

359
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,260
He's younger than me.

360
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,140
But...

361
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,140
he's warm...

362
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,860
and talented.

363
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,220
He's someone I'd like to cherish
as family...

364
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,820
and spend my life with.

365
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,020
So, I hope you'll like my other half.

366
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,660
Liang Chen and I...

367
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,700
came from different worlds.

368
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,700
But then, we met...

369
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,540
and fell in love.

370
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,580
I'm just a university student.

371
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,340
I know I'm lacking in many areas.

372
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,800
But for Liang Chen,
I'll try my best to learn...

373
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,220
and improve myself.

374
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,180
I'll do the best that I can...

375
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,500
to cherish and protect her,

376
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,700
and be her bastion.

377
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,640
As expected of our Jing,

378
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,620
beating the sea of junior fanboys
and winning the ultimate prize!

379
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,320
From now on, Jing is my idol!

380
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,000
Mine too. Mine too.

381
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,520
Lu Jing's the best!

382
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,140
Lu Jing, well done!

383
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,580
Ma Hua,

384
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,060
don't you feel like getting
into a relationship too?

385
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,260
Well?

386
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,380
It's a little...

387
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,180
How's the response?

388
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,880
Will it affect Liang Chen's career?

389
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,840
To be honest, I think...

390
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,730
you two went a little too far
during the live broadcast.

391
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,630
Don't worry too much.

392
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:16,320
We can't control the fans' reaction.

393
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,760
We've done all that we can.

394
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,330
Everything else is out of our control.

395
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,070
No worries.

396
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,100
Worst case, I'll work backstage.

397
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,760
You girls tricked me.

398
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,590
Blame yourselves
for deviating from the script.

399
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,200
-You scared us half to death.
-Yeah.

400
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,330
Now we're even.

401
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,480
But what did you mean when you said
we "went too far?"

402
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,000
Ms Liang, relax.

403
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,200
I meant, when you were live,

404
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,100
your public display of affection
during working hours was too much.

405
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,400
I apologise.

406
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,110
I've failed to control my emotions.

407
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,800
During the live broadcast,
we were reading the comments.

408
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,080
Most people gave their blessings.

409
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,621
In general, there weren't any
negative comments like we expected.

410
00:35:00,701 --> 00:35:01,881
Please let me see it.

411
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,760
I was geared up for a tough battle.

412
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,480
Turns out, the fans took it quite well.

413
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,120
Ms Qing, we worried for nothing.

414
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,680
We didn't worry for nothing.

415
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,780
We were just preparing for the worst.

416
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,120
I'm just a university student.

417
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,040
I know I'm lacking in many areas.

418
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,520
But for Liang Chen,

419
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,740
I'll try my best to learn
and improve myself.

420
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,900
I'll do the best that I can...

421
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,020
to cherish and protect her,

422
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,460
and be her bastion.

423
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,260
So, they've gone public now.

424
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,900
Lu Jing, you make me so jealous.

425
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,420
I haven't even gotten myself a girlfriend.

426
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,940
(Thunderstorm)

427
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,220
I'm going for it!

428
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,840
Liang Chen, look.

429
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,960
No one bashed me.

430
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,560
Everyone said that I look handsome.

431
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,760
Does every girl
who watches your live stream...

432
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,180
wish they could marry you?

433
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,560
I don't think so. Not that I'm aware of.

434
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,480
Lies. I've seen your live streams.

435
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,300
The girls were calling you "hubby."

436
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,920
I seldom read the comments when I stream.

437
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,120
Lies!

438
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,300
One time, I saw you teasing me
in the comment section.

439
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,540
That's because I knew you were watching.

440
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,960
Excuses! I know you read the comments.

441
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,720
-No, I don't.
-Impossible.

442
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,700
Come here.

443
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,220
He's right.

444
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,500
He's Lu Jing.

445
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,140
He's younger than me.

446
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,620
But he's warm...

447
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,060
and talented.

448
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,640
He's someone I'd like to cherish
as family...

449
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,100
and spend my life with.

450
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,840
Why did you ask me out?

451
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,280
I told you, I don't want to see you.

452
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,240
Qi Qi...

453
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,300
Not another word.

454
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,720
Don't think I'll forgive you...

455
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,120
just because
of a few apology texts and calls.

456
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,280
Qi Qi, look!

457
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,140
Lu Jing and Liang Chen
are really together.

458
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,140
But then, we met...

459
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,780
and fell in love.

460
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,740
Watch it on your own!

461
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,880
I wasn't lying to you.
I was telling the truth last time.

462
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,400
I really saw them together.

463
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,080
Lu Jing really went public
with his relationship.

464
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,180
Gu Fei Ming!

465
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,760
Handsome.

466
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,800
There's no need to be nervous, Taro.

467
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,500
It's just a confession.
How big of a deal can it be?

468
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,300
You can do it.

469
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,640
What do you want?

470
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,320
I...

471
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,220
What brings you here at this hour?

472
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,340
Well...

473
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,660
Have you seen the live stream Lu Jing
and Liang Chen made?

474
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,360
They are showing off their affection
for each other openly.

475
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,620
It's so sickening.

476
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,780
So,

477
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,900
I've decided...

478
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,940
that today, I'll...

479
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,300
What are you saying?

480
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,080
I...

481
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,080
I want to say that...

482
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,540
I am really, really, really...

483
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,220
Really thankful to you.

484
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,000
That's right. Thank you.

485
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,480
The other day, I was sick.

486
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,800
It was because of your care...

487
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,540
that I recovered so quickly.

488
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,480
So you came here just to thank me?

489
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,320
No, no.

490
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,120
You see, there's a flu outbreak right now.

491
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,220
So I've come here to see
if you're all right.

492
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,940
Why...?

493
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,500
Why are you so concerned about me?

494
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,600
Because...

495
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,660
Because I want to be nice to you.
