00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:41,880
to complete the task.

378
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,660
It was a new record.

379
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:45,440
On the day you won the awards.

380
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,800
After the live stream,

381
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,540
he played Downwind.

382
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,820
Is that why this song is popular now?

383
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:56,618
It's not only because of this reason.

384
00:33:57,162 --> 00:34:00,502
Don't you think this song
fits the game pretty well?

385
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,174
After the task is completed,

386
00:34:02,254 --> 00:34:04,244
celebrate with the song Downwind.

387
00:34:04,324 --> 00:34:05,728
If you fail the mission,

388
00:34:05,808 --> 00:34:07,868
the song is a blessing.

389
00:34:07,949 --> 00:34:09,282
That's how everyone plays.

390
00:34:09,362 --> 00:34:10,994
So, should I thank him?

391
00:34:11,074 --> 00:34:12,401
I think

392
00:34:12,481 --> 00:34:13,736
you should

393
00:34:13,816 --> 00:34:15,560
check out Herman's live stream.

394
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,300
He's so handsome, I love him.

395
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,072
Of all the people,

396
00:34:20,152 --> 00:34:21,751
you choose to like an online friend.

397
00:34:21,831 --> 00:34:24,251
Do you know what he looks like?

398
00:34:24,656 --> 00:34:26,440
I am worried for your love life.

399
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,500
You don't understand.

400
00:34:27,776 --> 00:34:30,716
In my heart, he's always a great man.

401
00:34:32,376 --> 00:34:33,228
Found it.

402
00:34:33,308 --> 00:34:34,136
Look,

403
00:34:34,216 --> 00:34:35,494
he does it so well.

404
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:36,896
Ke Ke, watch it outside.

405
00:34:36,976 --> 00:34:38,457
-I'm composing.
-Look at this.

406
00:34:38,537 --> 00:34:39,837
Yuan Ke Ke.

407
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,500
Get out.

408
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,120
This is a proposal

409
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,916
from Core Technology.

410
00:34:57,996 --> 00:35:00,256
They would like you
to be their ambassador.

411
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,280
*[Beautiful Soul Proposal]

412
00:35:00,336 --> 00:35:01,660
Take a look at the proposal.

413
00:35:02,011 --> 00:35:03,551
Beautiful Soul.

414
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:06,016
Ke Ke, is this the game

415
00:35:06,096 --> 00:35:08,516
that made Downwind a hot search?

416
00:35:09,251 --> 00:35:10,920
Downwind is very popular now.

417
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,160
The world ladder esports tournament

418
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,856
has attracted many great gamers.

419
00:35:13,936 --> 00:35:16,876
I should thank the broadcaster then.

420
00:35:17,137 --> 00:35:19,136
Then again, Beautiful Soul
is quite popular right now.

421
00:35:19,216 --> 00:35:20,936
I've spoken to the Project Manager.

422
00:35:21,016 --> 00:35:22,425
He said his original intention

423
00:35:22,505 --> 00:35:24,560
was to create a novel

424
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,660
and revolutionary way of gaming.

425
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,160
Sounds pretty awesome.

426
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,768
What do I need to do?

427
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:31,480
This game is aimed at

428
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,320
promoting the domestic esports industry.

429
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,000
Not just the various competitions
in the country,

430
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,400
but also international ladder tournaments.

431
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,776
What you need to do is

432
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,380
use your influece to promote
healthy games.

433
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,501
You also need to collaborate
with gaming broadcasters

434
00:35:42,581 --> 00:35:43,830
and work with the playing teams.

435
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:44,731
I've never played it before.

436
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:46,271
I don't know if I can do it.

437
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,416
Your friend, Sun Bin Yu, he knows.

438
00:35:51,496 --> 00:35:52,620
Let him teach you.

439
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,000
*[Accept privacy terms? Agree. Disagree.]

440
00:36:08,977 --> 00:36:10,797
Hi Orange, can you hear me?

441
00:36:11,195 --> 00:36:12,175
I can hear you.

442
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,360
Come with me later,

443
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,220
we'll light up the fireworks.

444
00:36:16,353 --> 00:36:17,340
Okay.

445
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,721
Orange.

446
00:36:19,801 --> 00:36:21,282
Orange, don't go that way.

447
00:36:21,362 --> 00:36:22,723
You walked into the robots.

448
00:36:22,803 --> 00:36:25,063
Don't come back to find me.

449
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,160
*[Fail.]

450
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,980
Again.

451
00:36:36,874 --> 00:36:38,134
I can do it.

452
00:36:38,892 --> 00:36:40,472
I can do it.

453
00:36:41,001 --> 00:36:43,442
I can do it.

454
00:36:43,522 --> 00:36:44,360
I can do it.

455
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,880
What are you doing?

456
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,140
The bomb will blow up.

457
00:36:49,177 --> 00:36:51,040
I am almost there.

458
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,540
Just a bit more and
I can complete the task.

459
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,722
Taro, quick.

460
00:37:02,802 --> 00:37:04,462
I lured the robots over.

461
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:09,780
Shoot them quickly, don't stand still.

462
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,340
Why did you let the robots kill you?

463
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,100
Taro.

464
00:37:20,881 --> 00:37:22,501
Are you offline?

465
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,549
I was thinking,

466
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:31,741
what should I do with you?

467
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:33,800
So?

468
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,820
Minimise the window.

469
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,150
To do what?

470
00:37:38,265 --> 00:37:40,765
Open the music player.

471
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,971
There's such a function?

472
00:37:43,051 --> 00:37:44,153
Don't ask questions.

473
00:37:44,233 --> 00:37:45,333
Just follow my instructions.

474
00:37:45,616 --> 00:37:46,556
Okay.

475
00:37:48,247 --> 00:37:49,427
And?

476
00:37:50,921 --> 00:37:52,980
Search for Liang Chen.

477
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,100
Do you see it?

478
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,016
Liang Chen the singer,

479
00:38:03,096 --> 00:38:05,440

480
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,780

482
00:38:09,056 --> 00:38:10,276
Rascal.

483
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:28,555
You ask me to come out late at night,

484
00:38:28,635 --> 00:38:29,895
just to play with fireworks?

485
00:38:30,556 --> 00:38:31,960
Let me have fun.

486
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,540
I am bored.

487
00:38:38,296 --> 00:38:39,316
That's fun.

488
00:38:41,181 --> 00:38:42,446
What's wrong with you?

489
00:38:42,526 --> 00:38:43,666
You didn't sleep well?

490
00:38:46,035 --> 00:38:47,335
Ding,

491
00:38:47,721 --> 00:38:49,101
to tell you the truth,

492
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:52,000
I am desperate.

493
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,509
If you're my friend,

494
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:55,140
can you help me?

495
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:56,684
What's the matter?

496
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,200
It's He Jia.

497
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,841
He asked me to do
a movie in the jungle,

498
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,100
I rejected him.

499
00:39:02,776 --> 00:39:05,460
I am regretting it now.

500
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,180
He always listens to you.

501
00:39:08,417 --> 00:39:11,077
Can you put in a good word for me?

502
00:39:12,234 --> 00:39:13,260
Just this?

503
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,180
Just this.

504
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,020
Okay.

505
00:39:21,137 --> 00:39:22,437

Really.

512

515
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,270
Take it.

516
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,780

WeChat number today.

522

Stop giving out my WeChat number.

523
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,620
Don't worry, I won't do that.

524

525
00:40:32,345 --> 00:40:34,177
I have an idea.

526
00:40:34,257 --> 00:40:37,237
It'll make the girls stop
adding you on WeChat.

527
00:40:41,985 --> 00:40:43,180
Don't you believe me?

528
00:40:43,729 --> 00:40:44,869

I was joking.

535

536

Why do you look like you've seen a ghost?

567
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:19,470
Did you do something guilty?

568
00:43:26,721 --> 00:43:27,776
Not even a superstar like you

569
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:29,640
feels guilty about barging
into a man's house.

570
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,140
Why should I feel guilty?

571
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,410
Because you went missing for two days,

572
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:35,550
I've come to see you personally.

573
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:39,710
Orange.

574
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:40,961
I have some good news

575
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:41,841
and some bad news.

576
00:43:41,921 --> 00:43:43,021
Which one first?

577
00:43:45,121 --> 00:43:46,221
Bad news.

578
00:43:46,705 --> 00:43:48,320
The bad news is,

579
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,700
I'm going to a faraway place for shooting.

580
00:43:51,257 --> 00:43:52,437
You?

581
00:43:53,217 --> 00:43:54,357
Shooting?

582
00:43:55,464 --> 00:43:56,400
You...

583
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,740
Even a washed up actor like you
has a movie?

584
00:43:59,628 --> 00:44:01,829
I don't like your tone.

585
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:03,929
What do you mean by "washed up actor?"

586
00:44:04,073 --> 00:44:06,013
Was I a famous actor before?

587
00:44:07,314 --> 00:44:08,374
You're right.

588
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,830
This can't be counted as bad news.

589
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:14,050
I can't bring you to play
with fireworks anymore.

590
00:44:15,777 --> 00:44:17,340
What's the good news?

591
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,300
That's the good news.

592
00:44:21,215 --> 00:44:22,600
Taro, how could you do this?

593
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,100
What should I do?

594
00:44:27,585 --> 00:44:29,360
I am such a kind person,

595
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,140
I can't sit around doing nothing.

596
00:44:31,425 --> 00:44:32,560
Why don't we do this?

597
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,420
I'll get a good player to guide you.

598
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,040
He's the dark horse of the
world ladder tournament.

599
00:44:38,291 --> 00:44:40,991
I can't go back empty handed today.

600
00:44:41,976 --> 00:44:44,980
Jeez, I haven't packed yet.

601
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,020
Okay.

602
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,080
I'll wait for your news.

603
00:44:55,513 --> 00:44:56,613
Okay.

604
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,990
What is it again?

605
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,670
Don't tell him who I am.

606
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:01,911
I know.

607
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:03,451
I know you are famous.

608
00:45:03,562 --> 00:45:04,568
Here.

609
00:45:04,648 --> 00:45:06,228
Let's go.

610
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,620
My dear.

611
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,640
Over here, please leave.

612
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,580
I didn't even have a sip of water.

613
00:45:12,765 --> 00:45:14,435
You'll soon have it,

614
00:45:14,515 --> 00:45:15,716
your house is two minutes away.

615
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:16,771
You'll drink at home.

616
00:45:16,851 --> 00:45:19,340
-You'll be happy.
-We don't live on the same street.

617
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:20,980
Safe journey home.
