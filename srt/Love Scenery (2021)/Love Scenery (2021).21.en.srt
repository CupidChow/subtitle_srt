00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,660
♫When I've chosen a path
There's no going back♫

2
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,140
♫Just ignore the rumours

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,420
♫Even though there may be more rain
Than sunshine on this path♫

4
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,580
♫I don't care if I'd be reduced to ashes♫

5
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,180
♫All I want is to be on the stage♫

6
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,500
♫The light shining from my back
Is full of hope♫

7
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,660
♫Swim through the sea of mediocre
To reach a brand new future♫

8
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,660
♫And once I held my breath♫

9
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,260
♫Let our youth blossom
On the sea of conviction for our dreams♫

10
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,921
♫I still stubbornly believe in it
At every moment♫

11
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:05,380
♫Refusing to back down♫

12
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,740
♫Never stop
We don't need to♫

13
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,220
♫Never stop
Enjoy the solitude♫

14
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,940
♫Never stop
Till the sun sets♫

15
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,220
♫I'll walk my own path♫

16
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,620
♫Till the end of time♫

17
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,220
♫On this path of dream♫

21
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,480
Lu Jing.

22
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,400
You're here.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,140
You're early.

24
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,780
I rushed back
knowing that you would be here.

25
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,560
Don't forget about me.

26
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,780
What's going on with you two?

27
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,560
Taro.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,140
Are you done cooking?

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,120
Liang Chen has been starving all day.

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,401
Go on.

31
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:03,740
-Get cooking.
-This is my house. I'm not your chef.

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,820
What were you two talking about?

33
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,040
Jia Yun's birthday is in two days.

34
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,060
Taro and I were discussing
what to give him.

35
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,360
When is his birthday?

36
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,580
It's on the 24th of December.

37
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,700
That's Christmas Eve.

38
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,580
What a coincidence.

39
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,900
Christmas Eve? I forgot about that.

40
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,440
It'll be the first festival
we celebrate as a couple.

41
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,680
But I shouldn't skip
Jia Yun's birthday celebration.

42
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,980
I've promised him.

43
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,420
It's okay. Let me choose the present.

44
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,120
Don't you mind?

45
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,620
We should buy him a present.

46
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,880
Here.

47
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,980
Look at this.

48
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,520
How about this?

49
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,360
That's not suitable.

50
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,280
Let's browse some more.

51
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,520
How about a necktie?

52
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,260
I'm sure he has many ties.

53
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,240
How about cufflinks?

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,840
Not good.

55
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,660
What should we get him?

56
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,120
How about this?

57
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,860
A little tortoise.
It has good connotations.

58
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,940
It symbolises health and prosperity.

59
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,260
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

60
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,160
It's quite nice. Look, it's so cute.

61
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,160
Scrap that.

62
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,100
How about this?

63
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,740
I think it's fine.

64
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,660
What are you doing?

65
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,780
What is going on?

66
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,160
Can't you tell?

67
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,300
Any hints?

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,100
Is it obvious enough?

69
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,080
My goodness!

70
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,680
Am I seeing things?

71
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,480
You two are holding hands!

72
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,580
You're not seeing things.
It's exactly what you think it is.

73
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,660
Don't you have any questions for us?

74
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,980
What should I ask?

75
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,220
You could ask how happy we are.

76
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,600
Taro.

77
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,020
Go and be happy outside.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,840
What should we do?

79
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,760
Do you want to watch a movie?

80
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,680
Sure, it's been a while
since I've watched a movie.

81
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,100
I happen to have a cap in my car.

82
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,340
Let's go watch a movie.

83
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,280
Give it to me!

84
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,520
-No way.
-Give it to me!

85
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,940
No way!

86
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,500
I'm a little nervous
with all these people around us.

87
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,880
You're so cute.

88
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,240
What?

89
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,160
Nothing.

90
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,140
The movie has started. Pay attention.

91
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,940
Why don't I dance for you?

92
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,640
Do you like it?

93
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,760
Yes.

94
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,080
Stop crying, okay?

95
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,460
Okay, I'll stop crying.

96
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,900
Is it funny?

97
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,100
Liu Mao Yan is so cute.

98
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,260
I'm cute too.

99
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,220
Who's complimenting you?

100
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,040
Didn't you say
that I look like Liu Mao Yan?

101
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,500
When you compliment him,
you compliment me.

102
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,780
I'm not complimenting you.

103
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,260
Hello.

104
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,160
Shan Shan.

105
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,460
Can you please persuade Liang Chen...

106
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,380
to choose my song?

107
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,180
Ms Ma.

108
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,660
What happened to Liang Chen?

109
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,420
Ms Ma, see what I brought?

110
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,720
Ms Ma, stop ordering takeout.

111
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,760
It's bad for your health.

112
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,420
Here, try the home-cooked meal
I made for you.

113
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,340
It looks much more appetising
than takeout.

114
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,580
Not only am I angel in person,
I'm also a devil in the kitchen.

115
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,060
Look, the colour is so nice.

116
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,680
Enjoy the food.

117
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,440
You said you wanted to talk
about Liang Chen.

118
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,540
What happened to her?

119
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,600
Eat up.

120
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,360
I'll tell you while you eat.

121
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,000
It's a long story.

122
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,380
Then make it short.

123
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,540
Liang Chen is in love.

124
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,620
The love birds are so in love.

125
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,760
I can't take it anymore.

126
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,440
I skipped dinner
because I was so mad at them.

127
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,060
Then, I came to your place.

128
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,700
Is it Jia Yun?

129
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,540
Jia Yun is not Liang Chen's type.

130
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,540
You know Liang Chen so well, Ms Ma.
It must be because you were her classmate.

131
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,820
Ms Ma, actually...

132
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,860
I've been single for a long time.

133
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,900
Ms Ma.

134
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,080
Be honest with me.

135
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,900
What do you think of my appearance?

136
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,880
-You're quite...
-Quite good-looking, right?

137
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,220
What are you trying to say?

138
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,100
Look, Ms Ma.

139
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,240
I'm quite good-looking.

140
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,280
I can cook.

141
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,520
I have a successful career.

142
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,320
More importantly,

143
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,440
I'm single.

144
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,300
I'm a rare gift.

145
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,140
Ms Ma, don't you have...

146
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,020
any special feelings for me?

147
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,940
Are you done?

148
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,280
If you're done, please leave.

149
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,200
I...

150
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,400
Please.

151
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,840
Eat more.

152
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,460
If you think that the dishes...

153
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,920
Liu Mao Yan is quite handsome.

154
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,760
I met him once at an event.

155
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,320
He held my skirt
and helped me step down the stage.

156
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,201
I didn't know he was such
a good actor, too.

157
00:13:16,281 --> 00:13:17,121
Do you think...?

158
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,060
Are you unhappy?

159
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,140
You didn't enjoy the movie?

160
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,340
I'm not happy.

161
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,700
You complimented another man's looks.

162
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,500
You're good-looking too.

163
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,100
He held your skirt
and helped you step down the stage.

164
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,700
But it's your hand I'm holding right now.

165
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,640
Are you happier now?

166
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,620
I'm happier now.

167
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,280
But I'm still a little sore.

168
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,700
Every other couple will be spending time
together on Christmas Eve,

169
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,660
but I'll be celebrating alone.

170
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,140
It'll be so lonely.

171
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,040
On that day,

172
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,220
I'll leave the party early.

173
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,840
Don't force yourself.

174
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,280
It's your friend's birthday party.

175
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,500
How can you leave early?

176
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,440
Fine.

177
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,920
I'll pick you up.

178
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,820
Let me know when you're done.

179
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,060
You don't have to change your schedule
because of me.

180
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,380
No matter how late it will be,
I don't mind waiting for you.

181
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,540
Sleep early. Good night.

182
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,560
Jia Yun.

183
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,920
Happy birthday.

184
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,840
Thank you.

185
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,120
Here's my present for you.

186
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,040
Do you like it?

187
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,360
I like it.

188
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,200
I'm glad that you came.
You didn't have to bring a present.

189
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,020
Where are Taro and the gang?

190
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,260
Take a seat.

191
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,600
Sure.

192
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,460
Are you hungry? Let's eat first.

193
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,700
Taro and the others are not here yet.
We shouldn't start without them.

194
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,060
Let's eat while waiting for them.

195
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,640
Waiter.

196
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,500
Are you going on a date?

197
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,680
Of course I have to be with my girlfriend
on Christmas Eve.

198
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,020
Are you serious?

199
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,800
He Ye and Liu'er went out
early in the morning.

200
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,040
God knows when those two fools
got girlfriends.

201
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,240
Now, even you're heading out.

202
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,700
This is why you don't have a girlfriend.

203
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,400
Lu Jing.

204
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,480
You're heartless.

205
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,160
Do you know that in order
to give you a surprise,

206
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,440
I almost got into a fight
with the Student Council?

207
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,460
Surprise?

208
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,580
What surprise?

209
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,160
It's...

210
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,540
Just wait for it.

211
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,620
Fine, go meet with your girlfriend.

212
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,980
Where did he get a girlfriend?

213
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,560
I don't get it.

214
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,180
Why do all of them have girlfriends?

215
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,220
Am I not handsome?

216
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,160
(Sun Bin Yu)

217
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,060
-What's up?
-What else?

218
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,240
It's Christmas Eve.

219
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,680
Of course I have to discuss
something meaningful with you.

220
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,360
For example,
how did you win Liang Chen's heart?

221
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,760
Do you have any techniques...

222
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,820
you can share with me?

223
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,480
Lu Jing!

224
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,560
Have a heart, will you?

225
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,260
I'm sincerely asking for guidance here.

226
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,760
Aren't you at Ding Jia Yun's
birthday party?

227
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,160
-Why are you so free?
-I didn't go to the party.

228
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,300
Don't you know that the party
was cancelled at the last minute?

229
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,920
We're almost done eating,
but Taro is not even here yet.

230
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,060
He's not punctual at all.

231
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,060
Let's have some cake.

232
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,380
I don't think they'll come.

233
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,700
Please enjoy.

234
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,520
Thank you.

235
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,020
Let me cut the cake for you.

236
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,580
What's wrong? Is it not tasty?

237
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,940
No, it's because...

238
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,160
I'm on diet.

239
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,660
That's why I can't eat too much.

240
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,320
It's okay. The cake is custom ordered.

241
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,140
It's low sugar. It's not fattening.

242
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,400
Luckily, you came today.

243
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,580
Otherwise,

244
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,020
I'd have to celebrate alone.

245
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,780
The view here is not bad.

246
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,500
It's quite beautiful.

247
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,500
It reminds me of a phrase.

248
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,780
"Be it the moon or its reflection,
it's far beyond reach."

249
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,740
The person in front of me
is the person I desire.

250
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,900
Liang Chen.

251
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,340
I have something to tell you.

252
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,260
Actually, I've known you for a long time.

253
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,100
It's longer than you think.

254
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,440
I've been observing you in secret.

255
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,460
When I saw you working hard
to pursue a career in music,

256
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,620
I had a strong urge to approach you.

257
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,380
But I was worried
that if I go too close to you,

258
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,620
I may lose you.

259
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,780
I want to tell you something
that I've been keeping inside my heart.

260
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,220
Liang Chen, I love you.

261
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,780
Jia Yun.

262
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,540
I'm grateful for your love.

263
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,300
However,

264
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,260
I'm already in love with someone else.

265
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,020
I respect your choice.

266
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,440
You're here.

267
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,960
I'm here to pick you up.

268
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,880
Let's go.

269
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,560
Let's go.

270
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,540
Look down there.

271
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,520
The company is huge.

272
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,460
Yes. In the future...

273
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,120
Jia Yun.

274
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,560
Let me introduce someone to you.

275
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,120
She's the singer we've just signed.
Her name is Liang Chen.

276
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
He's Jia Yun.

277
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,180
Hello, Jia Yun.

278
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,000
Please take care of her.

279
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,920
You're too polite.

280
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,360
-Hello.
-Hello.

281
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,800
Congratulations.
You've finally moved into a new place.

282
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,800
Ding, let me introduce someone to you.

283
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,640
-This is my friend, Liang Chen.
-Hello.

284
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,260
Orange, let me introduce someone to you.

285
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,240
This is my good pal, Ding Jia Yun.

286
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,360
We know each other.

287
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,280
Hello.

288
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,280
We're friends.
You don't have to be so polite.

289
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,440
What a coincidence.

290
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,460
Take a seat.

291
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,980
-Do you want any drinks?
-Let me help you.

292
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,940
We didn't break up back then,
but now we've broken up.

293
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,520
Liang Chen.

294
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,420
Although...

295
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,700
we couldn't have dinner together,

296
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,860
I want to be the first person
to give you an apple.

297
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,840
So, despite the cold weather,

298
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,120
you came to pick me up ahead of time...

299
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,380
because of this?

300
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,260
Thank you.

301
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,480
Where do you want to go?

302
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,300
I just want to take a stroll...

303
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,100
together with you.

304
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,120
Sure.

305
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,320

I can sing my favourite song

324

Come with me.

325
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,840
Hello.

326
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,400
-How can I help you?
-My girlfriend would like to sing a song.

327
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,840
Can we borrow your guitar?

328
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,960
Sure.

329
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,880

Her singing was so beautiful!

348
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,920
Don't you think her voice is familiar?

349
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,840
Is it?

350
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,160
Liang Chen!
Doesn't she look like Liang Chen?

351
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,080
Are you serious?

352
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:57,380

359
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,420
Look, Thousand Years Box Spirit
is singing.

360
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:25,920
Is it nice?

361
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,660
How do you make it sing?

362
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,700
I gave it a mechanical heart.

363
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,660
Your singing...

364
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,500
is awful.

365
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,860
But I really like the present.

366
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,480
Thank you.

367
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,540
Can you thank me in a different way?

368
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,720
How?

369
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,360
♫Jingle bells, jingle bells♫

370
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,480
♫Jingle all the way♫

371
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,520
♫Oh, what fun it is to ride♫

372
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,700
♫In a one-horse open sleigh♫

373
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,280
♫Jingle bells, jingle bells♫

374
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,520
♫Jingle all the way♫

375
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,480
♫Oh, what fun it is to ride♫

376
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,620
-his plush toy...
-♫In a one-horse open sleigh♫

377
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,120
Ms Liang, whose singing is that?

378
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,240
He's literally tone-deaf.

379
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,240
His singing is awful.

380
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,500
I think it's quite nice.

381
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,800
It's nice.

382
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,760
Ms Liang, you haven't even chosen
the first song for the competition.

383
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,650
Listening to this kind of voice
will affect your judgement.

384
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,690
Pull yourself together.

385
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:20,940
Don't worry, I've found the song.

386
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,480
The youngest contestant...
("The Journey of Music Lovers")

387
00:34:47,561 --> 00:34:48,800
in the competition is Unti.

388
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,200
She's one of the trainees
selected by the show.

389
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,070
She has her own fanbase,
and she's good at singing and dancing.

390
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,840
Tong Shi Qin and Li Sha
need no introduction.

391
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,320
They're the evergreen singers
of the industry.

392
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,880
Yes, during the rehearsal,
they didn't perform at their best levels.

393
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,300
You're up against some fierce competition.

394
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,160
They're really good at singing.

395
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,660
You have to perform at your best level.

396
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,280
Liang Chen.

397
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,180
I've just listened to
your improvised version of "Unstoppable."

398
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,820
Although it's risky,

399
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,980
rock and roll
is what we lack at the moment.

400
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,720
It's quite fresh.

401
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,700
It's worth a try.

402
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,200
Sure.

403
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,160
You should communicate with the producer
with regards to improvisation.

404
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,660
I'll tell him to work with you.

405
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,080
-Thank you, Director Ma.
-Thank you, Director Ma.

406
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,640
-Goodbye.
-Thank you for your help.

407
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,200
Ms Liang, the crew has announced
your choice of song.

408
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,740
The reviews on the internet
are making me so angry.

409
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,560
Let me see.

410
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,140
Chen Chen, see for yourself.

411
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,540
I'm looking at it.

412
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,260
The rock and roll version of Unstoppable.

413
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,340
Liang Chen, please take it seriously.

414
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,780
Liang Chen is such a girl-next-door.

415
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,060
No one thinks highly of me.

416
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,160
Your fans are calling you
a girl-next-door.

417
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,840
You're competing in a show
full of talented singers,

418
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,820
and changing your style
to rock and roll?

419
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,740
Oh, no.

420
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,360
My liver hurts.

421
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,460
That's enough. Drop the act.

422
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,080
Think of the bright side.

423
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,920
The reviews can't get any worse.

424
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,800
If I perform as usual,

425
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,460
they'll be pleasantly surprised.

426
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,500
You're so optimistic.

427
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,420
But honestly...

428
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,080
Ms Liang, why did you choose this song?

429
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,340
You've sung this song so many times.

430
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,940
And it never worked out for you.

431
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,060
Now,

432
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,140
I just want to sing what I want to sing.

433
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,840
Look at this, it's so funny.

434
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,820
-Who did it?
-Yeah. It's brilliant.

435
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,640
(Congratulations on escaping 23 years
of singlehood, Lu Jing.)

436
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,560
There he is.

437
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,980
What are you looking at?
Why are you so laughing so hard?

438
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,920
Ms Liang, Nanze University
is indeed full of talented students.

439
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,840
I wonder who did this.

440
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,560
To celebrate his departure from singledom,

441
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,780
a fourth-year student
has put up a huge banner.

442
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,600
-I almost died laughing.
-It's my idea.

443
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,080
I put up the banner.

444
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,280
Hello, my name is He Ye.

445
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,960
I typed the words on the banner.

446
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,480
It says "Congratulations
on escaping singlehood, Lu Jing."

447
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,500
That's so funny.

448
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
It's true.

449
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,940
Lu Jing is popular in the school.

450
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,460
Here is his photo.

451
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,780
Everyone is expressing jealousy
for the girlfriend in the comment section.

452
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,900
Hold on, this guy...

453
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,020
He's your junior!

454
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,020
Ms Liang.

455
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,180
Please don't tell me...

456
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,780
his girlfriend is you?

457
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,040
Hello, Taro.

458
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,960
Hello, Orange.

459
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,640
I saw the banner.

460
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,120
What's going on?
You've made quite a splash.

461
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,480
Should I celebrate your union
with some fireworks?

462
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,660
I just saw it.

463
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,020
Can't youngsters be a little more discreet
about their relationships?

464
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,700
I'm busy. That's all for now.

465
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,860
Are you trying to brush me off?

466
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,920
I'm not done talking.

467
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,820
What else do you want to say? Hurry up.

468
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,280
I'm a little hard up lately.

469
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,740
Can I have a million Yuan?

470
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,160
Bye.

471
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,120
Don't do that. I'm just kidding.

472
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,400
As the matchmaker
who brought you two together,

473
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,660
is a meal too much to ask for?

474
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,240
Sure, I'll buy you a meal, okay?

475
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,840
-Bye.
-Wait.

476
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,400
When are you going to buy me the meal?

477
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,160
You can't just pay lip service.

478
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,420
I'll buy you a meal tonight, okay?

479
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,040
Bye.

480
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,480
Ms Qing.

481
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,580
There's something I need to tell you.

482
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,160
Say it.

483
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,860
I'm in a relationship.

484
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,880
Is it the young man on the banner?

485
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,800
Your junior?

486
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,400
That's so cool.

487
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,540
As expected of you, Ms Liang.

488
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,980
Ms Qing, will I get into trouble...

489
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,700
