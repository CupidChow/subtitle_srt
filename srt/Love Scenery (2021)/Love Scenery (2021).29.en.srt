00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,660
♫When I've chosen a path
There's no going back♫

2
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,140
♫Just ignore the rumours

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,420
♫Even though there may be more rain
Than sunshine on this path♫

4
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,580
♫I don't care if I'd be reduced to ashes♫

5
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,180
♫All I want is to be on the stage♫

6
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,500
♫The light shining from my back
Is full of hope♫

7
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,660
♫Swim through the sea of mediocre
To reach a brand new future♫

8
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,660
♫And once I held my breath♫

9
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,260
♫Let our youth blossom
On the sea of conviction for our dreams♫

10
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,921
♫I still stubbornly believe in it
At every moment♫

11
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:05,380
♫Refusing to back down♫

12
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,740
♫Never stop
We don't need to♫

13
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,220
♫Never stop
Enjoy the solitude♫

14
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,940
♫Never stop
Till the sun sets♫

15
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,220
♫I'll walk my own path♫

16
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,620
♫Till the end of time♫

17
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,220
♫On this path of dream♫

21
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,840
You came just to thank me?

22
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,760
No, no, no.

23
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,120
Well, the flu bug has been flying around.

24
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,560
So, I came here
just to see if you're okay.

25
00:01:48,797 --> 00:01:49,637
Oh.

26
00:01:54,192 --> 00:01:55,232
You...

27
00:01:57,153 --> 00:01:58,833
Why do you care so much about me?

28
00:02:09,078 --> 00:02:09,941
Because...

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,717
Because I wish to treat you well.

30
00:02:12,797 --> 00:02:13,640
Ms Ma,

31
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,760
actually, I...

32
00:02:16,692 --> 00:02:17,532
I...

33
00:02:21,692 --> 00:02:22,541
Actually...

34
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,200
Actually, I'd...

35
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,520
I'd like to invite you to watch a play.

36
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,440
I'll be performing tomorrow night.

37
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,960
Would you be free to come?

38
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:56,497
I have an event to attend tomorrow.

39
00:02:58,161 --> 00:02:59,071
It's okay.

40
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,440
Just come when you are free.

41
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,680
Anyhow, I'll leave the ticket with you.

42
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,960
Anything else?

43
00:03:22,722 --> 00:03:24,602
Nothing else.

44
00:03:31,394 --> 00:03:32,674
Okay.

45
00:03:33,153 --> 00:03:34,313
Then leave.

46
00:03:34,888 --> 00:03:35,728
I...

47
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:03,160
Actually, Ms Ma...

48
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,400
Actually, I really...

49
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,560
Fool!

50
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,760
I'm Liang Chen's Lu Jing.
Hi, everyone.

51
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,240
He's right.

52
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:40,424
He's Lu Jing.

53
00:04:40,892 --> 00:04:42,000
He's younger than me.

54
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,160
Hey, Liang Chen.

55
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,760
Why are you smiling at everything?

56
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,040
Is being in love that good?

57
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,825
Oh, yeah, it is. In fact, it's very good.

58
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,320
But you won't understand...

59
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,480
this feeling.

60
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,680
Well, it's just a relationship.

61
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,280
Could it be that sweet?

62
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,920
Of course! It's Lu Jing I'm with.

63
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,560
You were given an inch.
Now, you take a mile.

64
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,680
We know,

65
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,480
your boyfriend's the best.

66
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,120
But let me tell you,

67
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,280
from today onwards,
you've got to concentrate on the task.

68
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,760
Although today's job is just to redo
some shots for the trailer,

69
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,320
you better not mess it up.

70
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,992
Concentrate on the task.

71
00:05:27,072 --> 00:05:29,315
From now onwards,
I'll not speak about Lu Jing.

72
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,330
That's right.

73
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,040
Concentrate on the task
and get the job done.

74
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,160
Right! Focus on the job.

75
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,560
Lu Jing even told me to focus on my job.

76
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,360
Ms Liang,
didn't you say not to mention him?

77
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,640
Sun, the play's about to start.

78
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,880
Why are you peeping here?

79
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,480
Nothing.

80
00:06:12,225 --> 00:06:13,985
It's a full house again today.

81
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,441
You don't need to worry
about the box office.

82
00:06:17,521 --> 00:06:18,361
Just play your part well.

83
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,799
Don't worry.

84
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,432
I'm a seasoned actor.
I'll do my best for sure.

85
00:06:21,512 --> 00:06:22,352
Okay.

86
00:06:29,618 --> 00:06:32,520
Guo, am I done with today's job?

87
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:34,320
Hold on.

88
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,298
Let me just check.

89
00:06:35,947 --> 00:06:36,800
Yup, you're free.

90
00:06:38,237 --> 00:06:42,881
Ms Ma, why did you rush to get
so many things done during the day today?

91
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,120
I have something to do later on.

92
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,680
You're free to get off work now.

93
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,720
I'll be fine on my own.

94
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,480
Ms Ma, your earphones.

95
00:06:51,055 --> 00:06:51,895
It's okay.

96
00:06:56,305 --> 00:06:57,905
You don't need them?

97
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,873
Really?

98
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:04,713
Really. I'm telling the truth.

99
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,680
Okay, then.

100
00:07:07,337 --> 00:07:08,697
Just let it be.

101
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:10,880
You're leaving?

102
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,800
Yes.

103
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,920
He left!

104
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:18,249
He left!

105
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,920
What should I do?

106
00:07:21,617 --> 00:07:22,577
It's so hot!

107
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:26,874
You...

108
00:07:26,954 --> 00:07:28,794
You can't get rid of me this time.

109
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,880
Look, am I not in here now?

110
00:07:34,876 --> 00:07:36,578
Aren't you Ma Shan Shan?

111
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:41,400
That Taro, he's a huge fan of yours.

112
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,200
He'd be stoked to know
that you came to watch his play.

113
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,640
You know Sun Bin Yu too?

114
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:47,342
I'm his ex-girlfriend.

115
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,360
Do the both of you know each other too?

116
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,243
But I knew that you had little to no time.

117
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,160
Why did you hide
instead of coming to see me?

118
00:07:58,384 --> 00:07:59,320
Your face!

119
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,120
What happened to your face?

120
00:08:02,873 --> 00:08:04,753
I fell on the way here.

121
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:11,191
Okay.

122
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,440
I did switch off the lights when I left.

123
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:21,173
Mum?

124
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,040
Dad?

125
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,240
What brings you here?

126
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,240
What do you mean?

127
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,760
Can't we come?

128
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,680
Look at you, having a boyfriend
without keeping us informed...

129
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,800
and being so gutsy to go public with it.

130
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,320
How daring!

131
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:37,160
Mum, isn't this...?

132
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,760
Isn't this such a rush?

133
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,000
I didn't have the time
to talk to you about it.

134
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,336
Didn't have the time?

135
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:46,480
You and your boyfriend had been
a hot search topic for a while now,

136
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,221
and you tell me you
"didn't have the time"?

137
00:08:48,301 --> 00:08:52,266
If your dad and I came any later,
this news might shake the heavens.

138
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,640
I...

139
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,480
What are you trying to say? What?

140
00:08:57,793 --> 00:09:00,233
Why don't we watch some TV programmes?

141
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,600
Look. Who is it?

142
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,240
Isn't this that Liu Mao Yan
that you adore so much?

143
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,280
How handsome.

144
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,480
Are you asking for a beating, huh?

145
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,280
Think you're so clever
to change the topic?

146
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,041
Mum, I just came back from work.
I'm exhausted.

147
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,048
Let me get changed.

148
00:09:16,128 --> 00:09:17,634
Just watch Liu Mao Yan.

149
00:09:17,714 --> 00:09:18,602
Okay?

150
00:09:18,682 --> 00:09:21,002
What? Just where are you going?

151
00:09:22,504 --> 00:09:23,825
I'm not finished yet.

152
00:09:23,905 --> 00:09:25,105
Just look at her.

153
00:09:28,113 --> 00:09:30,233
Shouldn't you be saying something?

154
00:09:30,727 --> 00:09:31,567
I...

155
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,960
You only know how to cook!
Is cooking that important?

156
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,040
Come on, Lu Jing,
pick up the phone already!

157
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,170
(Lu Jing)

158
00:10:13,758 --> 00:10:17,120
Liang Chen,
better get out here after changing!

159
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,960
Don't think you can hide in there!

160
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,520
Get out here and explain yourself
to your dad and I!

161
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,440
Now!

162
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,120
Okay. Right away.

163
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,161
Lu Jing, apply Level 1 Precaution.

164
00:10:32,241 --> 00:10:33,161
My parents are here.

165
00:10:39,874 --> 00:10:41,274
Gosh, look at you.

166
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,520
We didn't even know that our own daughter
is in a relationship.

167
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,640
You know, the neighbours congratulated
your dad and I...

168
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,488
about our daughter finding a boyfriend.

169
00:10:48,568 --> 00:10:51,121
Do you know how embarrassed
your dad and I were?

170
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:52,241
Yeah, yeah.

171
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,560
How long have you been
with this boyfriend of yours?

172
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,880
Why do you keep playing with your phone?

173
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,240
What?

174
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,880
I was asking you, how long have
you been with this boyfriend of yours?

175
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,720
What did your dad tell you?

176
00:11:08,128 --> 00:11:09,520
He advised you to not choose
based on one's looks.

177
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,880
You can't just consider looks.

178
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,600
You need to find someone older.

179
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,800
Someone older would take good care of you.

180
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,720
Just like your dad.

181
00:11:21,352 --> 00:11:23,353
Older partner wouldn't necessarily
be more mature.

182
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,160
I can take care of myself.

183
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,080
Furthermore,
didn't you choose Dad based on looks?

184
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,160
You little...

185
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,960
Who is it?

186
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,920
I'll get it.

187
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,520
You sit. Sit!

188
00:11:36,773 --> 00:11:37,701
You go.

189
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,360
Let me.

190
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,305
-I'm...
-Go.

191
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,240
Let me tell you,
your dad and I will not agree...

192
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
for you to have a boyfriend
who's younger than you.

193
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,040
Moreover, how many younger guys out there
are dependable?

194
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,743
Who are you looking for?

195
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,320
You must be Uncle.

196
00:12:10,915 --> 00:12:11,960
I'm Lu Jing.

197
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,000
I didn't know you'll be coming.

198
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,520
I brought some stuff too.

199
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,920
You must be cooking.

200
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,080
Leave the stuff and go.

201
00:12:29,611 --> 00:12:32,080
What's taking you so long? Who is it?

202
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,120
Who is it?

203
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,360
This is Lu Jing.

204
00:12:38,505 --> 00:12:40,399
This is my dad and my mum.

205
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,200
Hi, Aunty. Hi, Uncle. I'm Lu Jing.

206
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,080
Hello, hello.

207
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,720
Get back to the kitchen.

208
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,360
Go back and cook.

209
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,120
Did you buy these ingredients...

210
00:12:56,851 --> 00:12:58,120
for us?

211
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,160
Yes, Uncle.

212
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,233
Let me take them.

213
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:02,081
Do you need my help, Uncle?

214
00:13:02,161 --> 00:13:03,001
No.

215
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,013
It's okay.

216
00:13:15,313 --> 00:13:17,241
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

217
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:18,805
Oh, right.

218
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
Liu...

219
00:13:21,058 --> 00:13:22,118
It's Lu Jing.

220
00:13:23,465 --> 00:13:25,545
Oh, Lu Jing. Come on in.

221
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,960
So, this is your boyfriend
who's on the hot search?

222
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,080
He's kind of cute.

223
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,920
You do look similar.

224
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,954
What are you chopping?

225
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,560
Aunty, perhaps, I could go take a look
in the kitchen?

226
00:13:55,289 --> 00:13:57,169
It's okay, it's okay.

227
00:13:58,968 --> 00:14:00,408
Hope we didn't scare you.

228
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,360
Actually, that's how Uncle is.

229
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,920
When he sees something not to his liking,
he'll chop things...

230
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:09,219
to give it a clean finish.

231
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,441
Don't worry, Aunty.

232
00:14:11,521 --> 00:14:15,961
I won't let Uncle has the chance
to "chop" me up on the spot.

233
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,922
Good, good. That's good.

234
00:14:19,634 --> 00:14:20,794
So...

235
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:22,797
Xiao Lu,

236
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,920
where are you studying at?

237
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,077
I major in E-sports at Nanze University.

238
00:14:28,157 --> 00:14:29,040
Nanze?

239
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,760
Yes. And just call me Xiao Jing.

240
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,960
Both of you are from the same university.

241
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,537
How old are you?

242
00:14:37,617 --> 00:14:39,337
Mum, are you taking census?

243
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,160
Gosh, you...

244
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,160
What? Can't I ask?

245
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,442
-How old are you?
-Aunty, I'm 22 this year.

246
00:14:46,522 --> 00:14:48,402
I'm at a legal age for marriage.

247
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:51,692
Legal age for marriage...

248
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,480
How many relationships have you had?

249
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,680
I mean, how many girlfriends have you had
before our Chen Chen?

250
00:15:01,729 --> 00:15:03,569
Aunty, Chen Chen is my first love.

251
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,200
Your first love?

252
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,160
You're his first love!

253
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,161
Unbelievable!

254
00:15:12,241 --> 00:15:13,081
Impossible.

255
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,200
You're good-looking and handsome.

256
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,520
I'm sure many girls pursue you.

257
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,800
My gosh. First love!

258
00:15:22,305 --> 00:15:24,065
I'm usually busy with studies.

259
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,040
I don't think too much about things
besides studying.

260
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,240
And, I'm just ordinary-looking,

261
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,240
unlike Chen Chen.

262
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,840
Today, I get to see
why Chen Chen looks so good.

263
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:35,360
She inherited it from you, Aunty.

264
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,400
Yes, yes.

265
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,840
You can see it? Yeah, she takes after me.

266
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,080
And I thought I look like Dad.

267
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,600
Must you take away my moment?

268
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,960
I should go and take a look
if Uncle needs help in the kitchen.

269
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,880
Sure, sure.

270
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,160
My goodness.

271
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,360
He does look similar.

272
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,040
The point is, he's handsome too.

273
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,000
And he's also so pleasant.

274
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,600
Mum, weren't you against us dating
a second ago?

275
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,080
What? Nonsense!

276
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,520
Uncle, is there anything I can help with?

277
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,520
Yes, you're right.
I'm all for the both of you now.

278
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,560
Your boyfriend's here.

279
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,000
And what are you wearing?

280
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,160
Gosh, what is this?

281
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,360
Holes everywhere?

282
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
There's fur everywhere too!

283
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,760
This is fashion.

284
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,200
Fashion my foot!

285
00:16:39,842 --> 00:16:41,042
Get changed immediately.

286
00:16:41,776 --> 00:16:44,800
Wear something beautiful
and lady-like.

287
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,240
Up your fashion game.

288
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,240
-But this is fashion.
-Hurry already.

289
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,880
Take off this "holey" outfit.

290
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,560
Your hair too!

291
00:16:59,322 --> 00:17:01,202
This kid is perfect.

292
00:17:27,473 --> 00:17:28,393
Wash your hands.

293
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:07,560
The blue one.

294
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:28,649
What are you doing?

295
00:18:30,697 --> 00:18:33,097
Chen Chen always mentioned
that your Braised Pork Belly is delicious.

296
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,721
So, I'd like to learn from you
and make it for her next time.

297
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,720
If jotting notes in a tiny notebook
does the trick,

298
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,329
then there are hundreds of ways to
cook this dish available on the Internet.

299
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:46,450
They are all delicious.

300
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,530
Nonsense!

301
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:50,457
I'll tell you,
this Braised Pork Belly of mine...

302
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,120
is a special secret recipe.

303
00:18:56,224 --> 00:18:59,000
Whether it's how ingredients are selected,

304
00:18:59,081 --> 00:19:01,537
the ingredients and the heat,

305
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,280
they are all very detailed.

306
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,800
Especially the heat I cook on.

307
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,720
If the heat's too high,
the meat gets tough.

308
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,152
If the heat's too low,
the meat gets mushy.

309
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:10,360
It should be just nice.

310
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,929
It should simmer on gentle heat.

311
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,720
That's just nice.

312
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,040
And let me tell you a secret.

313
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,160
Our emotions affect how the dish tastes.

314
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,960
Do you know how I make delicious dishes?

315
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,880
It's because I think of Chen Chen...

316
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,720
and her mum each time I cook.

317
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:32,161
Because it's for them.

318
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,960
So it gets my heart full.

319
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,720
That's how the dishes taste good.

320
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,720
Got that? It's called love.

321
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,400
Got it.

322
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:45,120
Si Feng, you've changed.

323
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,240
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.

324
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,560
You lied to me.

325
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,249
You lied to me and wanted me
to see you again tomorrow morning.

326
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:57,360
But I only have such little time
to see you.

327
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,360
Why must you hide
instead of coming to see me?

328
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,760
Your face!

329
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,120
It's bleeding.

330
00:20:06,785 --> 00:20:07,945
I fell on the way here.

331
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,960
I beg you, please leave!

332
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,760
No, I won't.

333
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,040
Let me take a proper look at you.

334
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:19,506
I'm afraid of you.

335
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I am afraid.

336
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,240
What are you afraid of?

337
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,520
I'm afraid of you.

338
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,240
You're ugly. You have blood all over.

339
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,041
It's almost impossible to recognise you.

340
00:20:29,121 --> 00:20:29,961
Who are you?

341
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,520
Who do you think am I?

342
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:47,320
-Who's that?
-Quiet.

343
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,281
Have you returned, Da Hai?

344
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:51,600
-Elder Brother's home!
-You've got to go, now!

345
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,761
Even the house has collapsed?

346
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:53,842
That's weird!

347
00:20:53,922 --> 00:20:55,968
-What's wrong?
-The windows can't open!

348
00:20:56,961 --> 00:20:58,760
They are at the door. Don't make a sound.

349
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
Where's the plank?

350
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,240
-In Si Feng's house.
-They're close.

351
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,080
Go, find yourself a place to hide!

352
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:10,576
Soup is ready!

353
00:21:12,942 --> 00:21:14,769
-Be careful not to burn yourself.
-Come, Xiao Jing.

354
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:16,330
Thank you for the hard work.
Have a seat.

355
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,040
-Yeah. Thank you for the hard work.
-Thank you, Uncle Liang.

356
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,680
I did nothing. It was all Uncle's effort.

357
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,729
-I was just an assistant.
-Look at this kid.

358
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:24,049
Come, sit.

359
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,200
Fashion.

360
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,840
Come on now, time to eat.

361
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,360
Xiao Jing, sit. Come.

362
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:49,520
-Today's main dish...
-Thank you so much.

363
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,960
The Braised Pork Belly I made.

364
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,120
Thank you, Uncle.

365
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,920
-Come, have a chicken wing.
-Thank you, Aunty.

366
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,080
This chicken wing takes much effort
and time to marinate.

367
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,617
Uncle does nothing better
than to cook dishes.

368
00:22:05,697 --> 00:22:06,657
Nonsense!

369
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,680
Besides dishes, my soup is good too, okay?

370
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,880
Are you asking for a...?

371
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,080
An analogy?

372
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,400
Uncle is good at everything, even soup.

373
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,280
Aunty loves to joke.

374
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,040
Yeah, yeah.

375
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,600
-Come, come.
-You have some too.

376
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,920
-Get our guest some more dishes.
-Oh, there are short ribs too.

377
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,200
It's delicious, Uncle's signature dish.

378
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,760
Thank you, Aunty. Thank you, Uncle.

379
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,120
This Tomato Fried Egg I made
tastes different from the others.

380
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,080
Have some.

381
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,440
-You should.
-Have some.

382
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,903
The bowl is clean.

383
00:23:25,368 --> 00:23:27,826
See? Xiao Jing loves my cooking.

384
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,906
Yes, yes, you cook well.

385
00:23:30,681 --> 00:23:32,561
Youngsters have such good appetites.

386
00:23:33,513 --> 00:23:35,153
They can eat. I like that!

387
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,120
I like that!

388
00:23:39,481 --> 00:23:40,801
Are you okay?

389
00:23:46,122 --> 00:23:48,842
Well, I'm still alive.

390
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,681
That's okay. You don't need to see us off.

391
00:23:53,761 --> 00:23:54,642
Let's go. Come.

392
00:23:54,722 --> 00:23:56,520
-Be safe.
-We will.

393
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,840
-Let's get going already.
-Bye, Uncle and Aunty.

394
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,000
We're leaving. Bye!

395
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,120
Let me know when you're home.

396
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,592
We will!

397
00:24:01,672 --> 00:24:03,673
Mum, put on your jacket
and don't catch a cold.

398
00:24:03,753 --> 00:24:04,833
I will. Go back in already.

399
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,033
-Bye!
-Bye, Aunty!

400
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,520
Bye-bye.

401
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,520
Bye.

402
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,200
Come on.

403
00:24:30,172 --> 00:24:31,550
Probiotics digestive tablets for you?

404
00:24:36,257 --> 00:24:38,801
Uncle and Aunty
were constantly filling my plate.

405
00:24:38,881 --> 00:24:40,121
They must like me a lot.

406
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,520
What a show-off!
Weren't you a sweetheart a while ago?

407
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,480
All that, "I'm just ordinary-looking,"
"unlike Chen Chen."

408
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,440
"I see that Chen Chen
inherited her looks from Aunty."

409
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,761
Didn't you praise me in front of Aunty?

410
00:24:50,841 --> 00:24:52,885
It was my mistake.
You must be proud of yourself, huh?

411
00:24:52,965 --> 00:24:55,065
They gave you all the dishes.
I wasn't even full.

412
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,360
Then, I'll eat some more with you.

413
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,440
You still can eat?

414
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,560
I can't let you go hungry, can I?

415
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,440
Three, two, one.

416
00:25:12,784 --> 00:25:14,344
This is the end of the performance.

417
00:25:14,424 --> 00:25:16,609
We thank you for coming out
to watch our play.

418
00:25:16,689 --> 00:25:17,529
Good night.

419
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,920
Taro!

420
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,040
You're here!

421
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,200
Aren't you getting married?

422
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,280
Yes.

423
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,960
I came today to pass you
the invitation card.

424
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,920
I'm counting you in.
The wedding's next month.

425
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,440
Congratulations.

426
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,240
Guess who I met just now.

427
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,040
-Who?
-Ma Shan Shan.

428
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,241
-Ma Shan Shan?
-Yes.

429
00:25:53,322 --> 00:25:54,360
She came?

430
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,945
She was just there.

431
00:25:57,025 --> 00:25:58,105
Where did she go?

432
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,120
Ms Ma! Ms Ma!

433
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,720
You really came!

434
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,840
Since you're here,
why didn't you wait for me?

435
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,800
Don't you have someone waiting for you?

436
00:26:18,314 --> 00:26:19,154
You...

437
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,880
Don't tell me you're upset
because of Yu Ke?

438
00:26:23,737 --> 00:26:25,242
But you have to believe me.

439
00:26:25,322 --> 00:26:28,920
I wasn't expecting anyone today
but you alone.

440
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,800
Really! I'm a pure and upright single man.

441
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,800
There's nothing you need to worry about.

442
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,360
I'm not upset.

443
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,880
Neither am I worried.

444
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,600
I swear, Ms Ma.

445
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,080
Yu Ke and I are no longer a thing.

446
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,619
It's now the past.

447
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,481
Ms Ma, didn't you agree
to leave with me yesterday?

448
00:26:51,937 --> 00:26:53,200
Who agreed?

449
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,000
Well, you didn't say no.
So, I took it as a yes.

450
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,640
Ms Ma, are you hungry?

451
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,960
I'm extremely hungry right now.

452
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,840
I know of a good kebab place.
I'll bring you there.

453
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,040
Please, Ms Ma.

454
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,520
Please say yes?

455
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,861
-Ten minutes.
-Okay!

456
00:27:12,941 --> 00:27:14,922
I'll get changed
and I'll be back in a blink!

457
00:27:15,002 --> 00:27:15,842
I'll be quick!

458
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,440
Wait for me!

459
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,600
♫He lights one cigarette after another♫

460
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,047
♫He drinks one cup of alcohol
After another♫

461
00:27:33,127 --> 00:27:33,967
♫Please♫

462
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:39,825
You're adding that much chilli?

463
00:27:39,905 --> 00:27:40,745
I...

464
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,480
Spicy food is my thing.

465
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,800
Even Szechuanese or Hunanese
can't beat me.

466
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,480
Eat, Ms Ma.

467
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,640
Ms Ma,

468
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,560
do you like me...?

469
00:28:18,553 --> 00:28:21,433
I mean, my performance tonight?

470
00:28:25,311 --> 00:28:26,592
I...

471
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:28,240
Don't get me wrong, Ms Ma.

472
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,600
I just want to know your opinion
about my performance.

473
00:28:35,618 --> 00:28:37,258
I think I liked it.

474
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:39,560
Really, Ms Ma?

475
00:28:40,773 --> 00:28:42,760
-Be careful.
-Did it get on you?

476
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,680
I'm fine.

477
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,000
Then, Ms Ma,

478
00:28:49,522 --> 00:28:51,920
can I also...

479
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,960
take it as...

480
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,920
you liking me too?

481
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,720
Eat some more, Ms Ma.

482
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
Come, come.

483
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,240
You too.

484
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,680
Can you towel-dry my hair for me?

485
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,160
Your hair's so short.

486
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,920
Just do it yourself. Spoiled brat.

487
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,160
Can you keep longer hair?

488
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,160
Why? Isn't my hair long already?

489
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,840
Because I'd like to fall in love with you
a little more.

490
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,920
Since you like me that much,

491
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,760
I'd just try even though it troubles me.

492
00:30:43,698 --> 00:30:44,651
Senior,

493
00:30:46,034 --> 00:30:47,760
could you blow-dry my hair for me
next time?

494
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,640
Did you know?

495
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,480
When I was little, I had a puppy.

496
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,480
Each time after bathing it,
I'd blow-dry its fur.

497
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,301
Are you trying to say that I'm a puppy?

498
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,200
Your hair feels like fur.

499
00:31:06,487 --> 00:31:07,361
What are you doing?

500
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,400
Pleasing my master.

501
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:13,839
Let go of me.

502
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:23,920
Go away!

503
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:33,400
Are you hungry?

504
00:31:40,027 --> 00:31:41,840
-Hello, Guo.
-Shan Shan.

505
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,465
Check out the email I sent you.

506
00:31:43,545 --> 00:31:46,225
Lin Qi mentioned you in an interview.

507
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,720
Okay.

508
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,185
Recently, Ma Shan Shan had a comeback
and wrote songs for a show.

509
00:32:05,265 --> 00:32:07,025
We heard that you two
were university mates.

510
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,920
We were not just university mates.

511
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,680
We were also close comrade-in-arms.

512
00:32:13,352 --> 00:32:16,280
During our university days,
we often worked together.

513
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,720
She's extremely talented.

514
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,880
Sometimes, I'd give her some guidance.

515
00:32:20,873 --> 00:32:23,273
Her inspiration
always brought me new ideas.

516
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,040
My debut song "Hold On Me"
was written and inspired by her.

517
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,760
As we know, the both of you
were still a couple at that time.

518
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,840
What caused the break up?

519
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,880
All in all,
first loves are always wonderful.

520
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,120
But it's inevitable to leave some regrets.

521
00:32:43,192 --> 00:32:45,080
I can only say, we weren't mature enough.

522
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,360
Then, is there anything you'd like
to tell her now?

523
00:32:50,122 --> 00:32:52,323
-Can I say it while facing the camera?
-Sure.

524
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,842
I hope Shan Shan
can revive her dream for music.

525
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,745
After all, the songs you've written...

526
00:33:02,825 --> 00:33:04,465
are loved by many.

527
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,370
Do not let your talent go to waste.

528
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,360
(Lin Qi talks about his first girlfriend
in an interview)

529
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,680
[Go for it, Shan Shan.]

530
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,800
Is she not home?

531
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,760
Ms Ma, are you home?

532
00:34:20,336 --> 00:34:22,380
It's me. Open up.

533
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,520
Ms Ma!

534
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,800
Oh, you're home, Mi Ma.

535
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,079
You...

536
00:34:39,512 --> 00:34:41,712
What's wrong, Ms Ma?

537
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,800
Leave.

538
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,710
I said leave.

539
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,280
Don't pester me ever again.

540
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,550
What?

541
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,309
What happened?

542
