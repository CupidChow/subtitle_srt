♫When I've chosen a path
There's no going back♫

♫Just ignore the rumours

♫Even though there may be more rain

20
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,040
Ms Qing.

21
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,160
I need to tell you something.

22
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,680
Go ahead.

23
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,400
I'm in a relationship.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,440
With that young guy on the banner?

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,360
Your junior.

26
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,960
Impressive.

27
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,200
You're indeed amazing, Ms Liang.

28
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,520
Ms Qing.

29
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,240
Would this trending topic be a problem?

30
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,720
Show me.

31
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:30,318
"Absurd Campus Anecdote."

32
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:33,751
For now,

33
00:02:34,623 --> 00:02:38,183
you two should be fine.

34
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,022
But I must remind you.

35
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,520
What is it?

36
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,320
When are you going
to officially introduce him to us?

37
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,080
You gave me a real scare.

38
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,320
Thanks.

39
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,800
Jing.

40
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,400
Please forgive us.

41
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,720
We only wanted to uphold your dignity
in front of Gu Fei Ming.

42
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,760
Look at that fellow.

43
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,640
It was like a carnival
when he's in a relationship.

44
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,600
-But you?
-That's right.

45
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,120
If we hadn't put you on that banner,
you'd have lost out.

46
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,960
Jing, this time, it's no doubt our fault.

47
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,080
But just think about it.

48
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,360
Gu Fei Ming is always showing off
in front of you.

49
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,200
We really can't stand it.

50
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,480
Hence,
please consider our good intentions.

51
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,790
-Forgive us, will you?
-Forgive you?

52
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,560
Unless my girlfriend agrees.

53
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,151
What girlfriend?

54
00:03:33,231 --> 00:03:35,280
You... You're lying to us too?

55
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,320
Stop it, you guys. He's still hurt.

56
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:51,798
Hello?

57
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,160
Did you see what happened on the Internet?

58
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:56,991
Your room-mates are really cute.

59
00:03:57,422 --> 00:03:58,382
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:01,360
This must have troubled you.

61
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,360
I'm fine.

62
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,480
The trending topic
has nothing to do with me.

63
00:04:07,236 --> 00:04:08,280
Oh, right.

64
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,160
After Sun Bin Yu knew about us,
he insisted that we treat him to dinner.

65
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,440
When?

66
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,360
Tonight.

67
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,880
I'll head there now.

68
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,200
Are you done with this nonsense?

69
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,360
Yes, yes. We are so done.

70
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,923
Jing, don't be mad anymore.

71
00:04:37,003 --> 00:04:38,240
It doesn't look good on you.

72
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,960
Your girlfriend won't like it.

73
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,960
-Do you think I'm all about my looks?
-Obviously.

74
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:45,463
No, no. You're not.

75
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,660
Fine. I'm letting you off this time.

76
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,600
Jing, you're really like an angel.

77
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,190
No, not like an angel.

78
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,759
You are an angel.

79
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,840
Jing, you need to head out now.

80
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,400
Don't keep your girlfriend waiting.

81
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,600
Go now. Quick.

82
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,480
Oh, it's you.

83
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,400
Come in.

84
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,343
What's with that tone and the long face?

85
00:05:34,003 --> 00:05:37,040
Orange,
I'm getting a feeling that you dislike me.

86
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,080
What is it? You regret inviting me over?

87
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,398
Stop overreacting.

88
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:45,199
Look at that mess.

89
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,959
It doesn't look
like you're having people over.

90
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,000
Lu Jing is not here yet.

91
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,920
Lu Jing?

92
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,039
Friendship takes the backseat now.

93
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:58,534
Fine. I'll forgive you this time.

94
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,750
Since he's not here yet,

95
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,640
let's kill time with something fun.

96
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,960
What do you suggest?

97
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,440
Let's go down memory lane.

98
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,560
Take out your classmate records
from university...

99
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,880
and graduation photos.

100
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,880
We can look through them.

101
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,080
Is this what you are here for?

102
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,600
All right.

103
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:25,240
I admit I came today because I wanted
to know a little more about Ms Ma.

104
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,845
Orange, we're close friends, right?

105
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:30,582
Don't you want to help your best friend?

106
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,280
Orange.

107
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:37,018
Please, Orange.

108
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,040
Last Christmas eve, I waited
in front of her house the whole night.

109
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,560
She didn't come out to see me at all.

110
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,360
I should at least know the reason.

111
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,878
In that case,
we'll just look at the photos.

112
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,758
Strictly no questions, all right?

113
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,240
What's wrong with you?

114
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,630
You invited me over for take-out?

115
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,545
Yes.

116
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,990
Forget it. I'm not eating with you two.

117
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,360
I'm going home.

118
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,480
What happened to him?

119
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,005
He wanted to ask about Shan Shan
and got mad after looking at the photos.

120
00:07:46,496 --> 00:07:48,776
What photos got him so mad?

121
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,560
That kid is just a wannabe.

122
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,960
Maybe he has aged badly.

123
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,280
A hundred and eighty-seven centimetres?

124
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,360
Impossible.

125
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,000
That's even taller
than what I usually write.

126
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,040
You thick face.

127
00:08:32,902 --> 00:08:35,862
Face? That face...

128
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,350
Fine, fine. He wins.

129
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,120
Wait a minute.

130
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:49,639
Ms Ma is not superficial.

131
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:54,360
She definitely likes a talented
and sophisticated man like me.

132
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:58,103
If that's the case,

133
00:08:58,183 --> 00:09:00,143
I think I won.

134
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,160
Sir, you really don't want
to order some grilled meat?

135
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,400
Don't you see these?

136
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,520
I can't finish them all.

137
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,440
I'm not ordering food.

138
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,120
Ms Liang.

139
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,630
At your age now,
you should take the advice given.

140
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,340
Why do you insist on doing a rock song?

141
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,901
Are you trying to turn this
into your farewell show?

142
00:10:02,495 --> 00:10:06,100
Well,
you've worked so hard to get on stage.

143
00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:08,711
You should appreciate the opportunity.

144
00:10:09,311 --> 00:10:11,991
Focus on your singing.

145
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,480
Are you nervous?

146
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,360
No. Why should I be?

147
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,960
But I am.

148
00:11:05,928 --> 00:11:07,160
It's just a small matter.

149
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,287
You've surely been around
to be as cool as a cucumber.

150
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:15,687
Truly my idol.

151
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,680
I'm feeling nervous.

152
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,880
This is the first time I see Orange
do a rock song.

153
00:11:28,295 --> 00:11:30,855
Relax. It's just a small matter.

154
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,920
It's about time to draw lots.

155
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:45,000
Hope it goes well
so you can perform later.

156
00:11:46,183 --> 00:11:47,743
Don't be the first to go.

157
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,720
What's so bad about going first?

158
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
You tend to get more nervous.

159
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,438
Even if you've done your best,
you might not leave a strong impression.

160
00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:57,759
But if you go later,

161
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,360
you'll have time
to observe the other singers...

162
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,800
and give the audience
the strongest possible impression.

163
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,520
-That's true.
-Challengers, please come to the studio.

164
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,920
Don't be nervous.

165
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,800
Break a leg, Ms Liang.

166
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,080
Hello, everybody.

167
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,160
Welcome to the fourth season
of The Journey of Music Lovers.

168
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,600
Welcome, everyone.

169
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,600
Thank you for your great energy.

170
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,960
Let me tell you.
The format this season is different.

171
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,137
We have two challengers today
so the competition is very fierce.

172
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:41,760
This first challenger to come on stage...

173
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,720
is an incredible singer.

174
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,720
She's the queen of reinvention.

175
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,480
Voted five times as the best female singer
of Top Chinese Music.

176
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,160
Ladies and gentlemen, Meng Lan Zhi.

177
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,965
Welcome, Lan Zhi.

178
00:13:08,045 --> 00:13:12,640
All right. The second challenger
to join us is also equally phenomenal.

179
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,560
Not long ago,

180
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,400
she won the Best Female Artiste
and Artiste of the Year...

181
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,960
in the Golden Cicada Awards.

182
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,440
I'm sure you already know who she is.

183
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,760
Ladies and gentlemen, Liang Chen is here.

184
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,880
Welcome, Liang Chen.

185
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,720
-Liang Chen.
-Liang Chen.

186
00:13:38,428 --> 00:13:39,519
Orange takes off to the sky!

187
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:41,280
We are with you all the way!

188
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,640
Why are you shouting?

189
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,040
You think she can hear you?

190
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,479
Where did your chill go?

191
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,920
Sit down. Sit down.

192
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,840
Quick.

193
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,200
We now invite the challengers to pick
an envelope to decide who will go first.

194
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,840
But according to our program rules,

195
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,320
the current contenders
have finished drawing lots.

196
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,800
We're now left with number one
and number seven.

197
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,880
You can now pick an envelope.

198
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,840
You're hurting me. Let go.

199
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,886
She's just picking lots.
Why are you so anxious?

200
00:14:08,966 --> 00:14:10,886
It will be a disadvantage...

201
00:14:11,572 --> 00:14:12,972
if Liang Chen goes first.

202
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:33,440
Now we ask both challengers
to announce the number they picked.

203
00:14:34,368 --> 00:14:35,768
Wait.

204
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,000
Ms Liang, can we change envelopes?

205
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,200
My heart is about to burst.

206
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,000
I can't even hold the microphone steadily.

207
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,120
Change the order?

208
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,524
This has never happened in our show.

209
00:14:59,604 --> 00:15:02,284
Let's check
if the Director of the Team agrees.

210
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,400
All right. The Director Team agrees.

211
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,040
Now we have to check with Liang Chen.
Do you agree to change?

212
00:15:24,301 --> 00:15:25,560
Yes, why not?

213
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,280
Whether going first or last,

214
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,760
it's all the same to me.

215
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,960
Thanks, Ms Liang.

216
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,360
All right. We invite the challengers
to announce their number.

217
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,880
I ended up with number one,

218
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,400
though I was supposed to go last...

219
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,639
But never mind.

220
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,520
The world is always unpredictable.

221
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,022
In the next segment, let's look forward...

222
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:20,302
to the amazing performances
from the two challengers.

223
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,000
That was nerve-racking.

224
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,240
My Orange has luck on her side.

225
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,640
Your Orange?

226
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,440
She's mine.

227
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,441
Fine. Whatever. Unbelievable.

228
00:16:35,521 --> 00:16:37,280
What a narrow mind for a grown man.

229
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,430
Green monster. Shameful.

230
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,970

I think she's pretty good.

266

Stage Design Team, look again.

267
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,720
Is your backdrop secure?

268
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,520
Make no mistakes.

269
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,320
Check the lighting.

270
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,480
Yes, show me the lights.

271
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,000
All right, I got it.

272
00:19:11,887 --> 00:19:12,887
Calm your mind.

273
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,520
You have put in 200 percent for this.

274
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,360
Don't let the nerve beat you.

275
00:19:18,238 --> 00:19:19,878
Good luck. I have faith in you.

276
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,840
Good luck, Ms Liang.

277
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,760
Ms Liang.

278
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,120
Good luck.

279
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,840
Guo, are we done for today?

280
00:19:43,878 --> 00:19:46,398
Yes, the director has called it a wrap.

281
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,120
Next up is Liang Chen.

282
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:51,840
I trust many of you share our sentiment.

283
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,600
Liang Chen and rock music.

284
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,721
Say what? But today, Liang Chen is...

285
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:57,920
Orange really has big guts.

286
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,960
She's really going to do a rock song?

287
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,566
Has she no fear of failure?

288
00:20:01,646 --> 00:20:02,566
Taro.

-Ms Liang...
-That was nerve-racking.

349
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,040
I was way more tense
than my first time on stage.

350
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,000
Ms Liang, that performance was awesome.

351
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,461
The audience was stunned.

352
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:55,422
Stop it.

353
00:24:55,502 --> 00:24:56,742
All right. Let's sit.

354
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,890
But I must say.
That guitar solo was really something.

355
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,210
You're so cool.

356
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,600
Ms Qing, can I have my phone?

357
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,640
Here you go.
You can't part with it for too long.

358
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,880
Hello?

359
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,080
Hello? Lu Jing.

360
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,280
How did I do just now?

361
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,647
Perfect all the way.

362
00:25:22,727 --> 00:25:23,567
Really?

363
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,256
I was? All right.

364
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:41,463
The most nerve-racking moment has come.

365
00:25:42,357 --> 00:25:46,480
Tonight,
between Liang Chen and Meng Lan Zhi,

366
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,760
who will stay and who will go?

367
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,480
Please look at the screen.

368
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,640
-Liang Chen.
-Lan Zhi.

369
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,680
-She won.
-She won!

370
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,600
Liang Chen won.

371
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,800
-She won.
-She won.

372
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,360
She won!

373
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,440
Congratulations, Liang Chen.

374
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,240
Sadly, tonight,

375
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,440
the singer we have to bid farewell to
is Meng Lan Zhi.

376
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,678
You put up a good fight.

377
00:26:58,151 --> 00:26:59,680
You performed well tonight.

378
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,280
I know you're better than me,

379
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,240
but I will beat you one day.

380
00:27:08,054 --> 00:27:08,894
Keep up the fight.

381
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,040
Life is full of ups and downs.

382
00:27:17,647 --> 00:27:20,328
But there will be no success
without failure.

383
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,320
I'll continue to work hard.

384
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,200
I hope you'll continue to support me.
Will you?

385
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,520
We will!

386
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,840
Thank you, everyone.

387
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,880
I love you.

388
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,575
Let's thank Meng Lan Zhi again
for the great performance today.

389
00:27:33,655 --> 00:27:35,895
Please give a big hand to Meng Lan Zhi.

390
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,080
-Keep fighting, Lan Zhi.
-Keep fighting.

391
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,320
All the best.

392
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,920
All the best.

393
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,720
We want to congratulate Liang Chen
for advancing to the next round.

394
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,160
The Journey of Music Lovers welcomes you.

395
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:55,080
Thank you.

396
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,640
-Liang Chen.
-Liang Chen.

397
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,720
A big hand to Liang Chen.

398
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:05,800
-Liang Chen.
-Liang Chen.

399
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,000
Amazing.

400
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,120
Epic.

401
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,840
I knew she can do it.

402
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,640
She didn't let us down.

403
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,280
Do you think we should throw her
a celebration party?

404
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,080
Of course. It's on me.

405
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,520
Good.

406
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,800
It's on you.

407
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,240
Ms Liang,
you're on the top trending topic now.

408
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,280
Everything is about you and The Journey.

409
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,320
"The most underestimated rock singer
in history."

410
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,160
"Liang Chen's massive music makeover.
She is unstoppable."

411
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,560
"Liang Chen rocks.
Liang Chen is so cool."

412
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,480
I want to see it.

413
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,480
Liang Chen.

414
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,160
Director Ma.

415
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,480
Your performance was spectacular.

416
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,240
The response was incredible.

417
00:29:00,837 --> 00:29:03,680
I can't wait to see your next performance.

418
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,719
Thanks, Director Ma.
I'll continue to work hard.

419
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:06,761
Good luck.

420
00:29:06,841 --> 00:29:08,481
Director Ma, I am really curious, though.

421
00:29:09,758 --> 00:29:14,007
Why did you agree
to let me do a rock song?

422
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:16,767
Everyone was against it at that time.

423
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,720
Actually, I saw a video...

424
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,760
of you doing a rock song in university.

425
00:29:23,797 --> 00:29:26,640
How did you get that video?

426
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,960
My niece sent it to me.

427
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,920
Ma Shan Shan.
You should know her.

428
00:29:34,135 --> 00:29:35,615
I see.

429
00:29:37,014 --> 00:29:39,400
Get yourself ready for the next show.
See you next week.

430
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,480
Oh, right.

431
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,960
About Shan Shan,

432
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,120
I need a favour from you.

433
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,400
Please go ahead.

434
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,143
All these years,

435
00:29:56,223 --> 00:29:57,983
Shan Shan's temperament has changed.

436
00:29:58,574 --> 00:30:00,294
You were her classmate.

437
00:30:00,374 --> 00:30:03,015
If possible, please talk to her.

438
00:30:07,023 --> 00:30:08,743
Don't worry. I will.

439
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,400
Good morning. Time for breakfast.

440
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,800
Can I come in?

441
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,600
Yes, please.

442
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,440
What brings you here out of the blue?

443
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,600
I want to personally invite you
for dinner.

444
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,920
Taro's place. Let's go.

445
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
Can I not go?

446
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,160
You can't say no.
It's my celebration party.

447
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,520
How can you miss it?

448
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,560
Finish your breakfast.
We need to go after this.

449
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,400
All right.

450
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:04,813
-Eat with me.
-I've eaten.

451
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,360
Typical female celebrity.

452
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,000
Ms Ma, you are here.

453
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,320
Come in.

454
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,840
Come.

455
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,560
Have some peanuts.

456
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,318
Ms Ma, orange juice, Coke, lemon tea.

457
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:45,999
Chips, cookies, pistachios.

458
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,240
What do you want?

459
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,160
It feels like spring outing in here.

460
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,640
I'm just worried Ms Ma will be bored.

461
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,040
Stop talking.

462
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,762
Let's watch television.

463
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,480
Look. What a constructive suggestion.

464
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,800
Ms Ma, what do you want to watch?

465
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,880
Movie?

466
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,160
Drama, romantic, art film or...?

467
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,543
The rerun of yesterday's competition.

468
00:32:07,623 --> 00:32:09,663
Look. What a constructive suggestion.

469
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,960
You managed to invite Ms Ma over.

470
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,360
I'll let you off today.

471
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,840
Ms Ma, please make yourself comfortable.

472
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,320
I'll make you something nice to eat.

473
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,720
Ding, where are you?

474
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,920
Why aren't you here yet?

475
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,560
Are you planning
to let me do all the cooking?

476
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,200
You're here.

477
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,760
Jia Yun.

478
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,320
Your show was a success yesterday.

479
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,240
Congratulations.

480
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,480
Thanks. Come in.

481
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,071
Long time no see, Jia Yun.

482
00:34:02,151 --> 00:34:03,311
It's so rare to see you these days.

483
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,200
You are...

484
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,159
-I'm...
-He's my boyfriend, Lu Jing.

485
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,320
Hello, Ms Ma.

486
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,398
I'm Lu Jing.

487
00:34:19,478 --> 00:34:20,398
Hello.

488
00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:23,880
Chef Ding, you're finally here.

489
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,620
The kitchen is waiting for you.

490
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,270
Come, come.

491
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,680
Very professional.

492
00:35:04,696 --> 00:35:07,016
Taro, do you have a colander?

493
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,440
You know how to wash vegetables?

494
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,080
If you're not doing anything,
can you not stand in the way?

495
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,520
What? It's my kitchen.

496
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,680
Why can't I stay here?

497
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,840
Shan Shan.

498
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,520
Thanks for showing Director Ma
my old video.

499
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,600
It happened by chance.

500
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,600
Do you want to come watch
my performance live?

501
00:35:57,316 --> 00:35:59,717
No worries. I'll reserve the tickets.

502
00:35:59,797 --> 00:36:01,877
Just come when you can.

503
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,760
Taro, I need sesame for the braised fish.

504
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,040
Go buy me some.

505
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,400
Sesame in braised fish?

506
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,960
You can take over. I'll go instead.

507
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,840
No, no. All right, fine.

508
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,920
I'll go.

509
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,720
Wash those vegetables properly.

510
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,440
What's wrong? Are you going out?

511
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,680
It's all for the perfection
of Chef Ding's culinary masterpiece.

512
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,200
Don't start eating before I'm back.

513
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,901
Just go.

514
00:36:42,981 --> 00:36:45,120
It's you who I'm talking to.

515
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,720
Ms Ma is nothing like you.

516
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,440
I'm going now, Ms Ma.

517
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,720
See you later.

518
00:37:21,647 --> 00:37:23,207
If you cook in future,

519
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,120
don't use parsley.

520
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,040
She doesn't like it.

521
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,560
Don't make the food too spicy.

522
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,600
It's not good for her throat.

523
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,520
Thanks.

524
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,200
Don't worry. I'll take good care of her.

525
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,040
Good.

526
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,040
Coming.

527
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,160
Hello, grandma.

528
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,000
Hello, Sun. Come in.

529
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,440
-Hello, grandpa.
-It's you.

530
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,480
You're reading?

531
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,920
Grandma, do you have white sesame?
I need to borrow some.

532
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,600
Yes, I have.
Wait here. I'll get it for you.

533
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,640
Great.

534
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,280
Sun, is Jing at your place again?

535
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,400
Yes, he is.

536
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,320
-He always troubles you.
-No, it's fine.

537
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,040
I happen to be free today
so I invited some friends over.

538
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,080
-Is that so?
-Here you go, son.

539
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,361
-Thanks, grandma.
-You're welcome.

540
00:39:13,441 --> 00:39:14,440
Oh, right.

541
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,000
Your granddaughter-in-law is at my place.

542
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,720
What? What did you say?

543
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,160
Granddaughter-in-law.

544
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,200
The wife of your grandson.

545
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,544
-She's at my place for dinner.
-Really?

546
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,160
You're not kidding me?

547
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,160
No, I'm not.

548
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,080
Didn't Lu Jing tell you?

549
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:34,120
He told us he has a girlfriend,
but we thought he was joking.

550
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,920
What? It's for real this time.

551
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,231
That boy...

552
00:39:37,311 --> 00:39:39,031
He finally came to his senses.

553
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,040
I've been worried about him for so long.

554
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,560
Everybody already has a girlfriend.

555
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,760
But that boy is just a nerd.

556
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,360
All he does is studying and reading.

557
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,160
This is good news.

558
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,680
-He has a girlfriend now.
-Yes, yes.

559
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,560
I need to get back to my friends now.

560
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,840
All right, go on.

561
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,640
All right. Bye, grandpa.

562
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,720
-Bye, grandma.
-Bye.

563
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,280
-Bye.
-All right, bye.

564
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,680
Old man, our grandson has a girlfriend.

565
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,840
Did you hear that?

566
00:40:11,646 --> 00:40:13,406
What's the use of hearing about it?

567
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,880
Go change. We'll go have a look.

568
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,200
