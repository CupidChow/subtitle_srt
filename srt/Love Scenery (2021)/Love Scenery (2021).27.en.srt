♫When I've chosen a path
There's no going back♫

2
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,140
♫Just ignore the rumours

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,420
♫Even though there may be more rain
Than sunshine on this path♫

4
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,580
♫I don't care if I'd be reduced to ashes♫

5
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,180
♫All I want is to be on the stage♫

6
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,500
♫The light shining from my back
Is full of hope♫

7
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,660
♫Swim through the sea of mediocre
To reach a brand new future♫

8
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,660
♫And once I held my breath♫

9
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,260
♫Let our youth blossom
On the sea of conviction for our dreams♫

10
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,921
♫I still stubbornly believe in it
At every moment♫

11
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:05,380
♫Refusing to back down♫

12
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,740
♫Never stop
We don't need to♫

13
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,220
♫Never stop
Enjoy the solitude♫

14
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,940
♫Never stop
Till the sun sets♫

15
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,220
♫I'll walk my own path♫

16
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,620

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,760
You are awesome, Ms Liang.

22
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,760
Really awesome!

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,440
I am speechless.

24
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,000
I don't know
how to describe my feelings now.

25
00:01:51,024 --> 00:01:51,904
Ke Ke.

26
00:01:52,873 --> 00:01:55,320
Thank you.
Thank you for staying with me.

27
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,160
Ms Qing.

28
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,630
Thanks for believing in me.

29
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,280
Congratulations.

30
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,200
Your dream came true.

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,800
Thank you.

32
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:45,015
I hope I didn't let you down.

33
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,400
It was perfect.

34
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,440
You completed our song perfectly.

35
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,040
I am sorry, Shan Shan.

36
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,400
I am truly sorry.

37
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,200
I regret giving up on you so easily.

38
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,800
I gave up on myself.

39
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,680
No, if I had held on a little longer,

40
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,320
the result might not have been
what it is now.

41
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,881
I gave up on our dreams.

42
00:03:21,961 --> 00:03:23,801
You were on your own for so long.

43
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,920
I should have worked as hard as you...

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,440
instead of wasting my time
on the wrong path.

45
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,160
Let bygones be bygones.

46
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,640
You are doing great now.

47
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,600
Shan Shan.

48
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,920
If you are willing,

49
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,360
we can start all over again.

50
00:03:55,845 --> 00:03:56,720
Thank you.

51
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:01,049
Thank you.

52
00:04:17,617 --> 00:04:19,207
Everything will be better now.

53
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,480
I am so touched.

(The Journey of Music Lovers)

55
00:04:59,408 --> 00:05:00,688
You shouldn't look.

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,280
Let's go.

57
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,240
Senior.

58
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,360
Senior!

59
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,840
The number you called
is currently unavailable.

00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,400
Lu Jing.

61
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,200
What are you doing, Lu Jing?

62
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,920
Get out of there, Lu Jing.

63
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,960
Lu Jing.

64
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,680
These aren't just a few sheets of paper.

65
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,800
It's your dreams.
Your prospect, your future.

66
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,960
How could you give up just like that?

67
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,400
I have done my best.

68
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:36,217
I really have.

69
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,640
Not because of the lack of time...

70
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,480
or the inability to write a song.

71
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,840
But I just can't do it.

72
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,320
I can't hit the high notes.

73
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,480
Did you know?

74
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,240
When I first met you,

75
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,800
for the first time, I knew one can reboot
six times in half an hour...

76
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,080
without uninstalling.

77
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,320
In my knowledge,

78
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,040
only Edison's
more than 1600 light bulb experiments...

79
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,320
could compare to you.

80
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,360
You shouldn't give up
before the final moment.

81
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,760
Uninstalled software...

82
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,200
can be reinstalled.

83
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,880
But if you give up now,

84
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,680
you won't have another chance.

85
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,160
I am sorry.

86
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,440
I lied to you.

87
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,280
What?

88
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,040
I rebooted eight times...

89
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:18,360
in half an hour.

90
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,400
Never give up.

91
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:31,607
Never compromise.

92
00:09:33,263 --> 00:09:34,663
You can always reboot.

93
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,800
You will get through this.

94
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,000
Thank you.

95
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,160
If it weren't for you,

96
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,120
I might have given up.

97
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,240
But you didn't give up.

98
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,560
You won instead.

99
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,000
Yes, you lost.

100
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,480
We said never to meet again.

101
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,520
You knew very well I would lose to you.

102
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,560
Ms Ma.

103
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,295
How come I feel
you are slightly different today?

104
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,374
-Am I?
-Yes, you seem very relaxed today.

105
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,801
Orange won. I am happy.

106
00:10:51,881 --> 00:10:53,520
It's good to be happy.

107
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,113
Ms Ma, can I send you home?

108
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,760
Okay.

109
00:11:05,385 --> 00:11:08,505
She didn't reject me today.

110
00:11:09,304 --> 00:11:10,224
Yes!

111
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,544
Congratulations.

112
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,280
You won everything you wanted
with your capability.

113
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,911
Thanks.

114
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,464
Ms Liang, for your trip tomorrow,

115
00:11:54,544 --> 00:11:58,320
there's something very important
that you mustn't forget.

116
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,840
What is it?

117
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,200
A date with the boyfriend...

118
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,440
must be completed with the sexiest dress.

119
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,120
This is not bad.

120
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,720
It's just nice.

121
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,080
What are you...?

122
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,600
What are you thinking?
Our relationship is...

123
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,880
Is pure.

124
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,800
Go out, I will pack myself.

125
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,160
Fine.

126
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,560
Fine, I won't disturb you.

127
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,640
This isn't sexy.

128
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,840
No.

129
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,760
This one is not bad, classy.

130
00:12:53,384 --> 00:12:54,504
What am I thinking?

131
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,040
What are you doing now?

132
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,120
Thinking of you.

133
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,920
Want to see me?

134
00:13:23,257 --> 00:13:24,097
Now?

135
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,540

Okay.

152
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,910
I'll go anywhere you want to go.

Nutritional supplement.

161
00:15:19,248 --> 00:15:20,088
Thanks.

162
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,840
I used to take "An Introduction to Art"
in this classroom.

163
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,161
This was my designated seat.

164
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:28,294
Shan Shan always reserved the seat for me.

165
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,600
You must have secretly slept in this seat.

166
00:15:33,396 --> 00:15:34,400
How did you know?

167
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,680
This seat is at the back.

168
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,920
Your classmates in front
blocked the lecturer's view.

169
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,080
The lecturer for An Introduction to Art
was a very nice person.

170
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,000
During that time,
I was writing songs every night.

171
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,440
I was so tired during the day.

172
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,920
You know, introduction to art class
can be very hypnotic.

173
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,160
I slept soundly
every time I slept in class.

174
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,120
I envy your classmate seated next to you.

175
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,760
He could see you whenever he turned.

176
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,920
I envy your current roommates too.

177
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,960
They can see you every morning...

178
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,560
when they open their eyes.

179
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,777
Did they lock the door?

180
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,600
We can jump from the window.

181
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,560
Let's go.

182
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:50,850
Let's go.

183
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,040
What's wrong?

184
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,160
We are walking in the woods by the lake.

185
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,134
It feels like we're having
an indecent affair.

186
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,819
We can walk on the main road.

187
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:11,739
Let's go.

188
00:18:14,486 --> 00:18:15,391
Forget it.

189
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,840
Is that indecent too?

190
00:18:20,552 --> 00:18:22,268
I am sorry, Qi Qi.

191
00:18:22,348 --> 00:18:24,709
Please don't be angry, Qi Qi.

192
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:25,840
I am truly sorry.

193
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,360
Don't be angry, all right?

194
00:18:28,337 --> 00:18:29,177
Come with me.

195
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,065
Tell me, what's your mistake?

196
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:34,760
I... I don't know.

197
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,200
Tell me what was wrong.

198
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,520
I will change it.

199
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,119
How will you change?

200
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:41,520
I like Beethoven. You like folk song.

201
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,360
I like Van Gogh.
You like Shin Chan.

202
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,215
I like Sanmao.
You said "Life in the Army" is good.

203
00:18:46,295 --> 00:18:47,535
How are you going to change?

204
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,200
Fine.

205
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,320
I will listen to Beethoven.

206
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,680
I will see Van Gogh and Sanmao.

207
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,120
Don't be angry, okay?

208
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,480
The distance between us is too great.

209
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,960
We are very close now.

210
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,440
You said you liked with me when you were
in your first year.

211
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,640
But like... That doesn't mean
we are suitable as a couple.

212
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,680
I like you, you like me too.

213
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,040
Why can't we be a couple?

214
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,760
Lu Jing likes Liang Chen.

215
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,440
Can they become a couple?

216
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,960
Are you joking?

217
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,600
Not in his dream.

218
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:36,204
Qi Qi.

219
00:19:36,903 --> 00:19:39,423
Did Lu Jing tell you something?

220
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,640
Don't you know what he had told me?

221
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,920
Believe me, Qi Qi.

222
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,160
I only asked Lu Jing to play for me once.

223
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,640
He pulled my leg.
He played well purposely.

224
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,240
I... If not for him, I wouldn't
have pretended to be sick so long.

225
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,080
How dare you lie to me, Gu Fei Ming?

226
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,560
Please hear me out, Qi Qi.

227
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:07,939
Let's go.

228
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,080
Liang... Liang Chen?

229
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,200
Liang Chen?

230
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,760
I didn't see her.

231
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,680
She's here.

232
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,640
Are you seeing things?

233
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,000
What?

234
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,800
You friend is quite cute.

235
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:58,961
He's stupid, not cute.

236
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,440
You can see me now?

237
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,280
Really.

238
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,120
It's true.

239
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,520
I saw them.
Liang Chen was with Lu Jing.

240
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,640
It wasn't a hallucination.

241
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,960
I really saw them.

242
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,680
Xiao Ming, don't take it so hard.

243
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,040
Don't give up on yourself
because of Qi Qi.

244
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,601
We know it's been hard for you.

245
00:21:24,681 --> 00:21:26,081
That's right, Xiao Ming.

246
00:21:26,639 --> 00:21:28,920
By the way, I don't have class tomorrow.

247
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,520
I'll accompany you to the hospital.

248
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,720
Listen to Da Ming.
We'll go to the hospital tomorrow.

249
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,400
It's hard to be human.

250
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,600
The view is excellent.

251
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,465
The bed is so soft and comfortable.

252
00:22:20,154 --> 00:22:21,151
It does feel good.

253
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,760
But it's not as good as you.

254
00:22:30,936 --> 00:22:32,136
What did you say?

255
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,800
You didn't hear me clearly?

256
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,440
You want me to repeat it again?

257
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,080
Repeat it again then.

258
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,880
It's not as good as you.

259
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:25,840
Why don't...

260
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,849
we eat first?

261
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,381
Let's go.

262
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,880
Ms Ma,
you seem to be in a good mood today.

263
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,608
Today is my first time seeing you
with makeup.

264
00:24:23,858 --> 00:24:25,898
Please don't rub it off, Ms Ma.

265
00:24:26,585 --> 00:24:27,665
You look nice.

266
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,680
I...

267
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,112
I didn't put on makeup for you.

268
00:24:33,192 --> 00:24:34,272
Don't think too much of it.

269
00:24:40,033 --> 00:24:42,073
Do you want to listen to the radio, Ms Ma?

270
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,360
It's this button. If you want to listen,
just press it once.

271
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,061
Ladies and gentlemen, Lady Ma...

272
00:24:49,141 --> 00:24:51,021
No. This is not the radio station.

273
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,920
My hand slipped.

274
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,680
My hand is slippery.

275
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,480
Do you usually listen to this?

276
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,360
I always listen to it.

277
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,800
Actually, I am a fan of yours.

278
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,778
I've liked you for many years.

279
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,960
I can't forget you wherever I go.

280
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,720
I mean your programme.

281
00:25:24,177 --> 00:25:25,657
Silly guy.

282
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,640
Did you say something, Ms Ma?

283
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,240
No.
I said today's weather is not so good.

284
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,440
Rest assured.

285
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,911
I've checked the weather forecast.

286
00:25:40,991 --> 00:25:43,751
Today is a sunny day.

287
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,600
I made this just for you, Ms Ma.

288
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,760
It's your favourite.

289
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,680
Here.

290
00:27:36,852 --> 00:27:37,807
Honeydew.

291
00:27:37,887 --> 00:27:38,727
Look.

292
00:27:39,221 --> 00:27:40,622
Salad.

293
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:42,302
Fruits.

294
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,480
The coffee is still brewing.

295
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,440
Ms Ma.

296
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,680
Try this.

297
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,120
I made this smiley face specially for you.

298
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,360
How is it? Is it nice?

299
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,960
Don't just praise me in your heart, Ms Ma.

300
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,102
If you think I am great,
you must say it out loud.

301
00:28:40,609 --> 00:28:42,009
I have no intentions of praising you.

302
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,560
Why are you so shy, Ms Ma?

303
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,840
Looks like it's going to rain.

304
00:29:00,812 --> 00:29:01,960
Don't worry, Ms Ma.

305
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,360
I've checked the weather report.

306
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,446
It's forecasted to be a sunny day today.

307
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,640
It's... It's raining!

308
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,800
What are you waiting for?

309
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,920
Pack this up.

310
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,840
Okay.

311
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,560
Ms Ma, leave it to me.

312
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,820
Get in the car.

313
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,929
Hurry up.

314
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:21,849
Go.

315
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,160
Forget it.

316
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,680
Let it be.

317
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,360
Get in the car quickly.

318
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,560
It's all right, Ms Ma.

319
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,600
You get in the car.

320
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,240
All these can be our snack later.

321
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,280
Go. Don't catch a cold, hurry up.

322
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,840
Go now.

323
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,520
Get in the car.

324
00:30:31,518 --> 00:30:33,120
I am sorry, Ms Ma.

325
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,640
You got caught in the rain.

326
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,368
I am all right, but look at you.

327
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:37,760
Wipe yourself dry.

328
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,680
I am fine.

329
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,200
Ms Ma, are you concerned about me?

330
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,720
I am fine, Ms Ma.

331
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,520
My body can take it.

332
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,374
It's just a sneeze, it's nothing.

333
00:31:08,454 --> 00:31:10,014
I am a man after all.

334
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,440
It's still all right if I catch a cold.
Isn't it?

335
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,560
Ms Ma, look, I have muscles.

336
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:18,080
It's hard.

337
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,160
Squeeze it.

338
00:31:19,566 --> 00:31:21,640
You can squeeze it. Yes, you can.

339
00:31:22,758 --> 00:31:24,568
Touch it, really.

340
00:31:24,648 --> 00:31:26,168
It's hard.

341
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,880
What's the matter?

342
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,541
It's...

343
00:31:55,621 --> 00:31:56,800
It's nothing.

344
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,440
Ms Ma.

345
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:09,040
Did you touch my hair just now?

346
00:32:10,593 --> 00:32:12,680
There was a paper scrap on your head.

347
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,860
I helped you remove it.

348
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,280
You are so sweet, Ms Ma.

349
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,480
Let's go.

350
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,880
The rain is getting heavier.

351
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,760
Okay.

352
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,720
Your seat belt.

353
00:32:41,198 --> 00:32:42,375
Yes.

354
00:32:42,455 --> 00:32:43,322
Seat belt.

355
00:32:43,402 --> 00:32:44,482
Safety first.

356
00:32:46,922 --> 00:32:47,762
This...

357
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,305
This...

358
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,960
Let's go.

359
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,160
Draw me nicely.

360
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,950
What is it?

361
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,560
I think I am lacking some...

362
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,280
motivation.

363
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,240
What motivation?

364
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,560
If you give me a kiss,

365
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,000
my energy will increase greatly.

366
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,542
If you kiss me twice,

367
00:33:24,622 --> 00:33:26,263
I will be invincible.

368
00:33:26,343 --> 00:33:28,320
If you kiss me three times,

369
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,760
I will become mighty
and draw as good as Van Gogh.

370
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,200
Three times.

371
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,760
Great, I am inspired.

372
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,360
Wait for my great drawing.

373
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,057
Let me see.

374
00:35:45,137 --> 00:35:46,057
Let me see.

375
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,520
What is this?

376
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,280
My face looks square.

377
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,520
You can't draw like Van Gogh.

378
00:35:54,982 --> 00:35:56,160
It's impressionism.

379
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,160
It looks like you.

380
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,080
No, it doesn't.

381
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,080
Let me see your drawing.

382
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,321
Don't look. Don't.

383
00:36:03,401 --> 00:36:05,400
-It's not good.
-I want to see.

384
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,960
I did the same as you. Impressionism.

385
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,920
A deep impression.

386
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,295
Do you like it?

387
00:36:22,073 --> 00:36:23,273
I do.

388
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,920
I think what I drew...

389
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,600
was pretty good.

390
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,400
It's not. My face was so big and square.

391
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,680
No. It was only this big.

392
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,600
I am sorry.

393
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,520
It's all right.

394
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,760
-You... You are the singer.
-You got the wrong person.

395
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,400
-You friend has gone ahead.
-No?

396
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,000
-Don't fall behind.
-Let's go.

397
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,840
-Wait for me.
-I didn't expect it to be so crowded here.

398
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,280
Let's stay away
from crowded places tomorrow.

399
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,160
All your plans will be wasted.

400
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,800
It's all right.

401
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,246
As long as I am with you, I am happy.

402
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,160
Can I trust Ke Ke's taste?

403
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,920
Pure look?

404
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,400
Or...

405
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,040
my secret weapon?

406
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,920
Sexy dress.

407
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,840
What does he like?

408
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,160
The secret weapon?

409
00:37:53,566 --> 00:37:54,406
The pure look?

410
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,360
It's hard.

411
00:38:01,002 --> 00:38:02,002
It's too hard.

412
00:38:34,241 --> 00:38:35,081
Come in.

413
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,680
I'll go out after I brush my teeth.

414
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,113
I'm also brushing my teeth.

415
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,280
Smells good.

416
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
