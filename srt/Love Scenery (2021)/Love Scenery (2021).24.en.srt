♫When I've chosen a path
There's no going back♫

2
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,140
♫Just ignore the rumours

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,420
♫Even though there may be more rain
Than sunshine on this path♫

4
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,580
♫I don't care if I'd be reduced to ashes♫

5
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,180
♫All I want is to be on the stage♫

6
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,500
♫The light shining from my back
Is full of hope♫

7
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,660
♫Swim through the sea of mediocre
To reach a brand new future♫

8
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,660
♫And once I held my breath♫

9
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,260
♫Let our youth blossom
On the sea of conviction for our dreams♫

10
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,921
♫I still stubbornly believe in it

21
00:01:47,681 --> 00:01:49,921
Ms Liang, what happened?
You changed your clothes so early.

22
00:01:54,538 --> 00:01:55,778
Are you all right?

23
00:01:56,242 --> 00:01:57,082
I'm fine.

24
00:01:57,841 --> 00:01:58,881
I didn't sleep well.

25
00:01:59,547 --> 00:02:00,787
Has something happened?

26
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:04,881
Then get up and wash up.

27
00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:06,881
You have a rehearsal with the band,
don't you?

28
00:02:10,665 --> 00:02:12,841
Put on more clothes.
It got colder last night.

29
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:14,761
I almost died from the cold
on my way here.

30
00:02:15,696 --> 00:02:16,571
Sure.

31
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:37,881
It's so cold.

32
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,681
Let's go. It's freezing.

33
00:02:59,361 --> 00:03:00,360
Senior!

34
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,440
Senior!

35
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:10,689
Senior!

36
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:14,593
Senior!

37
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,796
Ke Ke, please charge my phone.

38
00:03:52,213 --> 00:03:53,053
Sure.

39
00:04:17,481 --> 00:04:21,281
♫The pouring rain
Did not dampen my spirits♫

40
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:25,451
♫I've always preferred this suit of armour♫

00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:30,181
♫The thing lacking in this world
Is courage♫

00:04:30,261 --> 00:04:33,821
♫An unstoppable pride

43
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:40,929
Ms Liang,
why did you make a mistake again?

44
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:44,186
Let's take a break.

45
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:49,569
High tea is here!

46
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:55,961
Ms Liang,
I feel like you didn't have a good rest.

47
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:57,801
You seem out of sorts.

48
00:05:00,427 --> 00:05:01,427
I'm sorry.

49
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:17,001
Ms Liang,

50
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,370
that...

51
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:21,921
That junior is out there.

52
00:05:46,192 --> 00:05:47,761
He's been waiting outside for some time.

53
00:05:47,841 --> 00:05:50,401
Should we ask him to come in?

54
00:05:56,921 --> 00:05:58,001
I have to work.

55
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:00,201
Did you two have a fight?

56
00:06:58,997 --> 00:07:00,090
One more time.

57
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:07,241
♫Come along with me
Together, we shall make our names known♫

58
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,371
♫Our future♫

59
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:18,031
♫Is unafraid of failures♫

60
00:07:18,111 --> 00:07:21,861
♫It feels good to forge ahead♫

61
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,791
♫Rain of blades and sea of fire♫

62
00:07:46,498 --> 00:07:50,338
Senior, I won't disturb you any more.

63
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:19,418
-Hello, Taro.
-You finally switched on your phone!

64
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:21,058
Is Lu Jing with you now?

65
00:08:22,014 --> 00:08:23,201
No. What's the matter?

66
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:24,841
Just now Lu Jing's grandma came to see me.

67
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,081
She said Lu Jing hasn't gone home
since last night.

68
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:29,858
She couldn't reach him by phone.
She asked me if I know where he is.

69
00:08:29,938 --> 00:08:31,025
He didn't go home?

70
00:08:31,105 --> 00:08:32,121
No.

71
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:34,161
He's getting on my nerves.

72
00:08:34,577 --> 00:08:36,577
Stay calm. I'll go find him.

73
00:08:38,481 --> 00:08:39,591
Where are you going to find him?

74
00:08:39,671 --> 00:08:41,591
I have no idea, but I'll look around.

75
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:42,521
I'll hang up now.

76
00:08:43,258 --> 00:08:45,081
-Don't hang up first!
-What?

77
00:08:45,161 --> 00:08:48,321
Did Lu Jing tell you...

78
00:08:48,401 --> 00:08:49,585
about studying abroad?

79
00:08:49,665 --> 00:08:50,561
What happened?

80
00:08:51,682 --> 00:08:55,123
As a matter of fact,
Lu Jing has decided not to study abroad.

81
00:08:55,203 --> 00:08:56,364
He thought
it wasn't necessary to tell you,

82
00:08:56,444 --> 00:08:58,284
he didn't mean to keep it from you.

83
00:08:58,761 --> 00:09:00,041
Don't be mad at him.

84
00:09:36,081 --> 00:09:37,585
Why didn't you answer your phone?

85
00:09:37,665 --> 00:09:39,745
Do you know that your family
is worried sick about you?

86
00:09:50,544 --> 00:09:51,408
My phone died.

87
00:09:58,018 --> 00:09:59,041
Hello, Taro.

88
00:09:59,121 --> 00:10:00,321
I found him.

89
00:10:01,521 --> 00:10:03,001
He's fine. Don't worry.

90
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:40,346
Are you still mad at me?

91
00:11:25,474 --> 00:11:26,954
Taro told me everything.

92
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:30,961
I misunderstood you.

93
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:33,601
I shouldn't give you the cold shoulder.

94
00:11:57,548 --> 00:11:59,108
I've been reflecting on myself
these two days.

95
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:03,801
I wasn't good enough.

96
00:12:05,763 --> 00:12:06,643
I'm sorry.

97
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,841
You should've told me earlier.

98
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,250
We can fix it together.

99
00:12:14,538 --> 00:12:16,378
I didn't want to make you upset...

100
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:19,178
because of me studying abroad.

101
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:33,121
Why would I be upset?

102
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:35,721
If I study abroad,

103
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:38,241
won't you feel upset?

104
00:12:42,481 --> 00:12:43,921
I'm afraid we'll be apart.

105
00:12:54,475 --> 00:12:56,166
The transportation system
is developed now.

106
00:12:58,121 --> 00:12:59,601
I can go to see you anytime.

107
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:03,001
I don't think distance will separate us.

108
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,753
So, you don't have...

109
00:13:13,234 --> 00:13:14,434
any faith...

110
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:19,441
in our relationship?

111
00:13:32,721 --> 00:13:34,001
Go home and rest early.

112
00:13:58,321 --> 00:14:00,503
He's been running for almost an hour.

113
00:14:01,201 --> 00:14:02,801
He won't die all of a sudden, will he?

114
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:04,841
I don't think so.

115
00:14:04,921 --> 00:14:07,121
But I'm afraid he won't be able
to get out of bed tomorrow.

116
00:14:10,801 --> 00:14:12,001
It's all because of Gu Fei Ming.

117
00:14:12,081 --> 00:14:13,121
He's a jerk.

118
00:14:13,611 --> 00:14:14,628
What do you think, guys?

119
00:14:15,307 --> 00:14:16,673
-Get him.
-Get him.

120
00:14:16,753 --> 00:14:18,321
-Get him!
-Let's go!

121
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,130
Gu Fei Ming!

122
00:14:36,891 --> 00:14:39,371
You still have the mood to put on make up?

123
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:41,961
Do you know that you're killing Lu Jing?

124
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:44,880
Say it. Do you choose Qi Qi or Lu Jing?

125
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,601
What are you talking about?

126
00:14:46,681 --> 00:14:48,601
Be honest. Answer us now!

127
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,490
Of course I choose Qi Qi.

128
00:14:53,996 --> 00:14:54,836
Charge!

129
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:57,691
What are you doing?

130
00:15:07,369 --> 00:15:09,954
What exactly do you want from me?

131
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,554
I'll choose Lu Jing, all right?

132
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:16,404
If you had made the right choice earlier,
you'd be fine.

133
00:15:16,484 --> 00:15:17,451
Tell us.

134
00:15:17,531 --> 00:15:19,291
What did you do to Lu Jing?

135
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:20,691
I have no idea.

136
00:15:21,266 --> 00:15:24,027
He hasn't contacted me for a long time.

137
00:15:24,107 --> 00:15:25,027
Are you not telling us?

138
00:15:25,107 --> 00:15:25,947
Hold on.

139
00:15:26,538 --> 00:15:29,258
Are you Little Box or not?

140
00:15:29,338 --> 00:15:31,618
What's with the Big Box and Little Box?

141
00:15:32,281 --> 00:15:34,042
My gaming skill is bad,

142
00:15:34,122 --> 00:15:35,802
but you shouldn't insult me.

143
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,930
Untie me!

144
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,300
Shan Shan, what are you doing here?

145
00:16:06,146 --> 00:16:08,787
I caused you trouble yesterday.

146
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:09,707
Thank you.

147
00:16:10,522 --> 00:16:11,482
Come on in.

148
00:16:31,171 --> 00:16:32,212
Here, have some water.

149
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,132
Thanks.

150
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:35,370
How are you? Feeling better?

151
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,330
I'm fine now.

152
00:16:37,732 --> 00:16:39,252
We have to thank Taro for last night.

153
00:16:45,356 --> 00:16:48,676
I will thank him when I have time.

154
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:53,641
But why did you drink so much?

155
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:57,753
Don't just talk about me.

156
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:58,873
What about you?

157
00:16:59,321 --> 00:17:01,001
I heard you guys had an argument.

158
00:17:08,378 --> 00:17:09,898
So this is what happened.

159
00:17:11,715 --> 00:17:12,555
So?

160
00:17:13,137 --> 00:17:14,657
Are you breaking up with him?

161
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:18,881
I won't break up with him.

162
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:26,478
I think
you might have a little hard time...

163
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:27,842
dating him.

164
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:31,241
He's younger and not mature enough.

165
00:17:31,321 --> 00:17:33,041
This kind of incident...

166
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:34,801
where he makes a decision
without discussing with you...

167
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:36,561
might happen again in the future.

168
00:17:36,977 --> 00:17:41,786
Why don't you get a more mature boyfriend?

169
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:43,506
Just like Jia Yun.

170
00:17:44,201 --> 00:17:46,881
If you're dating a man like Jia Yun,

171
00:17:46,961 --> 00:17:49,241
you might not face this issue now.

172
00:17:50,121 --> 00:17:53,401
Before you run into trouble,

173
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:55,321
he would've solved all of them already.

174
00:17:55,401 --> 00:17:57,041
You'll be living the life of a princess.

175
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:58,081
Isn't that nice?

176
00:17:59,841 --> 00:18:01,281
But I think...

177
00:18:01,826 --> 00:18:03,346
there's no relationship...

178
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:06,073
which requires effort from only one party.

179
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:10,001
If I had a mature boyfriend,

180
00:18:10,081 --> 00:18:12,321
when I am enjoying this comfort,

181
00:18:12,401 --> 00:18:14,601
I'd definitely face other issues as well.

182
00:18:15,201 --> 00:18:16,801
To a man like him,

183
00:18:16,881 --> 00:18:19,881
love is just a part of his life.

184
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:23,481
His career and future...

185
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:25,721
mean the most to him.

186
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:28,281
Since I chose him,

187
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:31,561
I have to accept everything
that comes with him.

188
00:18:31,641 --> 00:18:34,241
All I can do is to be considerate,

189
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,081
understanding,

190
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:38,760
and survive in this relationship...

191
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,081
with a rational mind.

192
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:48,200
However, if I date...

193
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,721
an immature boy...

194
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:55,401
I love that when he looks at me,

195
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:57,401
his eyes are full of affection.

196
00:18:57,481 --> 00:18:59,841
I love that he's full of vitality...

197
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:02,721
and how he crashed into my life,

198
00:19:02,801 --> 00:19:04,601
wanting to give me...

199
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:07,361
all the nice and beautiful stuff.

200
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:12,681
So you already have the answer.

201
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:16,665
If he wants to grow,

202
00:19:17,201 --> 00:19:19,001
why can't I do it with him?

203
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,290
How long has it been?

204
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:57,121
Almost two hours.

205
00:19:58,081 --> 00:19:59,601
I'm freezing.

206
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:14,241
No, no. Don't take it.

207
00:20:14,321 --> 00:20:16,121
-Just share with me.
-Stop taking it from me.

208
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:17,321
Hold on.

209
00:20:23,841 --> 00:20:26,201
If Gu Fei Ming is not Little Box,

210
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:28,321
we can call the real Little Box.

211
00:20:30,281 --> 00:20:33,662
But we don't know
who Little Box really is.

212
00:20:33,742 --> 00:20:34,902
That's a piece of cake.

213
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:43,481
It ran out of battery now of all times?

214
00:20:48,201 --> 00:20:49,801
I have a portable charger.

215
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:52,881
Plug it in.

216
00:20:58,772 --> 00:21:01,292
Give it to me. I know his password.

217
00:21:02,641 --> 00:21:04,513
This must be the Box Spirit.

218
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:07,001
Jing, we have no choice.

219
00:21:07,081 --> 00:21:08,241
Please don't be mad at us.

220
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:09,441
Come on, call the number.

221
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:23,961
No one is answering.

222
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,281
Did they break up?

223
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:27,761
Be careful on your way home.

224
00:21:27,841 --> 00:21:28,681
Bye.

225
00:21:45,081 --> 00:21:48,561
Are you Lu Jing's girlfriend?

226
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,121
You are...?

227
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:52,481
We are Lu Jing's room-mates.

228
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,121
I know that both of you are fighting.

229
00:21:55,201 --> 00:21:58,681
He's been running on the basketball court
for almost two hours.

230
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:02,001
If he doesn't stop, he might break
the long-distance running record in China.

231
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:06,201
Won't you come and check on him?

232
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:08,361
-If you don't come, Lu Jing might die.
-Exactly.

233
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:10,641
-Where is he?
-The basketball court of Nanze University.

234
00:22:10,721 --> 00:22:12,506
Just make a left turn
after you come in from the north gate.

235
00:22:12,586 --> 00:22:14,239
Got it. I'll be right there.

236
00:22:16,081 --> 00:22:17,281
What does that mean?

237
00:22:17,361 --> 00:22:20,521
I think it's done.

238
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:30,321
Lu Jing, that's all we can do for you.

239
00:22:51,241 --> 00:22:52,841
Why is she not here yet?

240
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:54,161
Is she not coming?

241
00:22:54,969 --> 00:22:55,850
How about this?

242
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,755
Let's knock him out and take him back.

243
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,161
Good idea.

244
00:22:59,241 --> 00:23:00,081
You should do it.

245
00:23:00,554 --> 00:23:01,994
Heck no!

246
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,146
She's here!

247
00:23:08,961 --> 00:23:10,561
Are you Lu Jing's classmates?

248
00:23:14,521 --> 00:23:15,921
Holy Moly!

249
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:21,761
I...I haven't changed my glasses
for too long, have I?

250
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:25,866
Is...? Is she real?

251
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:28,881
Even the girl Jing's dating
is extraordinary.

252
00:23:32,081 --> 00:23:33,241
Lu Jing!

253
00:23:51,761 --> 00:23:52,641
Come here.

254
00:23:58,921 --> 00:24:00,201
Why are you wearing so little?

255
00:24:04,978 --> 00:24:07,786
Lu Jing, we called her here.

256
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:10,394
But it was Liu'er
who called her with your phone.

257
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:15,331
I just took out your phone,

258
00:24:15,411 --> 00:24:17,291
but I swear
I didn't read your conversation.

259
00:24:34,978 --> 00:24:37,307
It's so cold.
Why didn't you put on more clothes?

260
00:24:55,241 --> 00:24:56,081
You...

261
00:25:07,616 --> 00:25:08,867
I'm glad that you're fine.

262
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:11,634
I'll leave now.

263
00:25:18,123 --> 00:25:19,041
Why are you still here?

264
00:25:23,401 --> 00:25:25,161
Go on, go on.

265
00:25:41,195 --> 00:25:42,756
Is there anything that you want to say?

266
00:25:43,761 --> 00:25:45,041
I want to explain something to you.

267
00:25:45,873 --> 00:25:48,994
I didn't change my life
without second thought because of you.

268
00:25:49,763 --> 00:25:50,873
Not going to study abroad...

269
00:25:51,601 --> 00:25:53,601
is a decision I made
after careful consideration.

270
00:25:54,426 --> 00:25:55,546
What do you mean?

271
00:25:56,394 --> 00:25:59,554
First of all,
my parents are abroad all-year round.

272
00:26:00,401 --> 00:26:01,961
My grandparents are old.

273
00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:03,929
I'm the only person they have.

274
00:26:05,281 --> 00:26:06,521
I don't want to leave them.

275
00:26:09,754 --> 00:26:14,595
Besides, the big data research environment
in our country is mature.

276
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:16,121
If I stay,

277
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:19,081
I'll have more opportunities to grow.

278
00:26:19,961 --> 00:26:20,801
Is that true?

279
00:26:21,281 --> 00:26:22,970
The academic environment here...

280
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,570
is no worse than that
in foreign countries.

281
00:26:28,074 --> 00:26:30,058
Besides, my friends are here too.

282
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:31,178
You met them too.

283
00:26:31,905 --> 00:26:33,145
They're not bright.

284
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,201
If I leave,
I don't know what would become of them.

285
00:26:38,881 --> 00:26:39,761
Anything else?

286
00:26:41,241 --> 00:26:44,601
The food here is delicious too.

287
00:26:44,681 --> 00:26:45,961
Everything is very convenient.

288
00:26:46,841 --> 00:26:48,681
Why must I go abroad?

289
00:26:49,601 --> 00:26:51,281
Why do you have so many reasons?

290
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:52,681
There's the most important one.

291
00:26:53,474 --> 00:26:54,314
What is it?

292
00:26:54,841 --> 00:26:55,681
You.

293
00:27:05,881 --> 00:27:09,441
Lu Jing, I was mad at you...

294
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:12,721
because I'm your girlfriend,

295
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:17,033
but I was the last to know
such an important matter...

296
00:27:17,601 --> 00:27:19,384
which involves your life planning.

297
00:27:20,818 --> 00:27:25,209
I also don't want to be the person
who disrupts your original life planning.

298
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:28,569
You're very smart and outstanding.

299
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:32,601
You should choose what is best for you.

300
00:27:34,918 --> 00:27:35,841
Senior.

301
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:39,041
From the day we met,

302
00:27:40,321 --> 00:27:42,121
our lives have changed.

303
00:27:44,001 --> 00:27:45,721
Since we are in a relationship,

304
00:27:46,441 --> 00:27:49,441
then we should walk into the future,
hand-in-hand.

305
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:56,441
Since you are so confident in our future,

306
00:27:57,001 --> 00:27:58,561
then you have to believe...

307
00:27:58,641 --> 00:28:00,841
that our relationship will be able
to stand the test.

308
00:28:10,641 --> 00:28:11,601
Senior,

309
00:28:13,361 --> 00:28:14,481
I was wrong.

310
00:28:15,881 --> 00:28:17,165
I was not mature enough.

311
00:28:19,185 --> 00:28:20,305
Will you forgive me?

312
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:24,407
I was wrong too.

313
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:27,370
I should've let you finished your words.

314
00:28:38,121 --> 00:28:39,761
You didn't talk to me
for two days straight.

315
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,547
Don't you do this again.

316
00:28:44,961 --> 00:28:45,961
Whatever you say.

317
00:28:56,081 --> 00:28:58,281
I did a lot of thinking these two days.

318
00:28:59,481 --> 00:29:00,841
When two people are in a relationship,

319
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:02,801
they have to adjust to each other.

320
00:29:05,121 --> 00:29:06,641
I'll work hard to adjust to you,

321
00:29:07,481 --> 00:29:10,001
so I hope that you'll also work hard
to adjust to me.

322
00:29:13,601 --> 00:29:15,274
Sometimes,

323
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:16,681
I have a lot of work to do,

324
00:29:16,761 --> 00:29:18,441
I have to travel
to all sides of the world.

325
00:29:19,001 --> 00:29:21,801
When I'm not at home,
my plants will wither.

326
00:29:23,321 --> 00:29:24,481
Then I'll water your plants.

327
00:29:25,001 --> 00:29:26,442
Besides, during festive season,

328
00:29:26,522 --> 00:29:28,402
that's the time
when I have the most packed schedule.

329
00:29:29,841 --> 00:29:32,361
Chinese New Year, New Year's Eve,

330
00:29:33,281 --> 00:29:34,521
and Valentine's Day,

331
00:29:35,161 --> 00:29:37,361
I might not be able to celebrate with you.

332
00:29:38,681 --> 00:29:40,201
I will watch you on the television.

333
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:46,081
The most important thing is,

334
00:29:48,194 --> 00:29:49,994
you should know that I'm a public figure.

335
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:53,057
So I will be taunted by public opinion
all the time.

336
00:29:53,841 --> 00:29:56,841
The people around me
are very likely to be affected.

337
00:29:57,481 --> 00:29:59,081
I'm afraid that you'll be affected.

338
00:30:01,602 --> 00:30:03,602
These are the things you have to face...

339
00:30:04,281 --> 00:30:05,841
if we're together.

340
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:14,782
I'm not afraid.

341
00:30:21,201 --> 00:30:22,641
In that case,

342
00:30:23,361 --> 00:30:25,481
let's protect
this relationship together...

343
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,401
and face the hardships together.

344
00:30:29,401 --> 00:30:30,561
We'll face them together.

345
00:30:38,881 --> 00:30:40,001
You're colder.

346
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:06,241
Did you guys make up?

347
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:16,588
Ms Liang! Senior!

348
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:17,709
Don't leave first.

349
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:19,521
We can talk things out.

350
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:21,761
If Lu Jing has done anything wrong,
I'll beat him up for you.

351
00:31:21,841 --> 00:31:24,961
Ms Liang, Jing really likes you a lot.

352
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:26,517
He's a treasure.

353
00:31:26,597 --> 00:31:28,237
If I were a girl,
he'd be the only man I'd marry.

354
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:31,921
Come, come. Come over here.

355
00:31:32,001 --> 00:31:32,881
Come here.

356
00:31:34,241 --> 00:31:37,841
Senior, look at this face
and this figure.

357
00:31:37,921 --> 00:31:41,001
The most important thing
is that he has the most sincere heart.

358
00:31:41,794 --> 00:31:43,000
Oh, God.

359
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,481
He's one in a million.

360
00:31:44,561 --> 00:31:46,201
Senior, stop scolding him.

361
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:47,401
You can scold me if you want to!

362
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:48,361
Do you know?

363
00:31:48,441 --> 00:31:50,481
When you were attacked on the Internet,

364
00:31:50,561 --> 00:31:52,441
he stayed up a few nights
just to help you.

365
00:31:52,521 --> 00:31:54,001
It broke my heart!

366
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:59,481
Are you guys always like this?

367
00:31:59,561 --> 00:32:02,041
-No, no!
-Not at all!

368
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:03,961
Lu Jing is totally different from us.

369
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:07,321
He only eats, studies and works out.

370
00:32:07,401 --> 00:32:08,841
He doesn't have any bad habits.

371
00:32:08,921 --> 00:32:11,281
Exactly. He gets first place every year.

372
00:32:11,361 --> 00:32:13,601
He also gets the first place
in all sports.

373
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,281
And, and...

374
00:32:15,361 --> 00:32:18,161
He passed CET-6,
and he got the highest score in our class.

375
00:32:18,241 --> 00:32:21,321
He'd give up his seat to pregnant woman
on the bus,

376
00:32:21,401 --> 00:32:22,881
help old lady cross the road.

377
00:32:22,961 --> 00:32:24,521
He's an outstanding young man.

378
00:32:28,771 --> 00:32:29,611
Right.

379
00:32:30,945 --> 00:32:33,577
Since you've given Lu Jing
so many compliments,

380
00:32:33,657 --> 00:32:34,738
how about this, Ms Liang?

381
00:32:34,818 --> 00:32:37,801
I'll show you a special trick
that Lu Jing taught me.

382
00:32:37,881 --> 00:32:39,361
The fist-swallowing trick.

383
00:32:53,746 --> 00:32:55,746
You were lying to us.

384
00:32:59,881 --> 00:33:00,761
Thank you.

385
00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:05,681
Can...? Can I sell this?

386
00:33:05,761 --> 00:33:06,841
I want to wear it.

387
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:08,761
It's mine! Give it to me!
I want to wear it.

388
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,651
Come here, come here.

389
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:11,611
Come here!

390
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:15,481
I'll leave now.

391
00:33:27,601 --> 00:33:29,121
Let me send you home.

392
00:33:32,108 --> 00:33:33,741
I cant' bear watching you leave alone.

393
00:33:38,538 --> 00:33:39,441
Let's go.

394
00:33:48,701 --> 00:33:52,141
♫The chosen path is a one-way street♫

395
00:33:52,221 --> 00:33:55,331
♫Disregard the hearsay♫

396
00:33:55,411 --> 00:33:59,681
♫The journey may be more bumpy
Than beautiful♫

397
00:33:59,761 --> 00:34:01,891
♫Oh♫

398
00:34:01,971 --> 00:34:05,041
♫Even if I turn into ashes
It's alright♫

399
00:34:05,121 --> 00:34:08,381
♫I pursue my dream on the stage♫

400
00:34:08,461 --> 00:34:12,341
♫The glory on my back reflecting my hopes♫

401
00:34:12,961 --> 00:34:15,521
♫Oh♫

402
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:18,041
♫Passing through the seas of mediocrity♫

403
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:21,501
♫Diving into new beginnings♫

404
00:34:22,231 --> 00:34:26,641
♫Holding my breath for the future♫

405
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:31,581
♫Let my youth bloom♫

406
00:34:31,661 --> 00:34:34,471
♫In an ocean of dreams and promises♫

407
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:40,661
♫Woo♫

408
00:34:41,261 --> 00:34:44,461
♫Every second, I stand firm♫

409
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,291
♫Never learning to be obedient♫

410
00:34:47,371 --> 00:34:53,891
♫Woo♫

411
00:34:53,971 --> 00:34:56,981
♫Never stop
We don't need to♫

412
00:34:57,061 --> 00:35:00,181
♫Never stop
Basking in loneliness♫

413
00:35:00,261 --> 00:35:03,591
♫Never stop
Until the lights go out♫

414
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:06,831
♫I will make my own path♫

415
00:36:35,881 --> 00:36:38,831
(Sun Bin Yu)

416
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:43,305
Is this even possible?

417
00:36:43,385 --> 00:36:45,225
Are you crazy?

418
00:36:47,411 --> 00:36:48,811
(Ma Shan Shan)

419
00:36:56,354 --> 00:36:57,234
Hello, Ms Ma.

420
00:36:58,809 --> 00:37:00,090
Have you had dinner?

421
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,240
Yes...

422
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,650
No.

423
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,401
Have you had dinner or not?

424
00:37:05,481 --> 00:37:06,601
No, no.

425
00:37:07,043 --> 00:37:08,881
Are you buying me dinner, Ms Ma?

426
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:10,281
Sure! No problem!

427
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,241
What do you want to eat?
I'll make a reservation now.

428
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,201
Anything is fine. You choose.

429
00:37:15,281 --> 00:37:16,961
Sure. Wait for me.

430
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:18,241
I'll pick you up right away.

431
00:37:35,561 --> 00:37:37,001
It tastes great!

432
00:37:37,561 --> 00:37:38,961
It tastes really authentic.

433
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,825
Eat up, Ms Ma.

434
00:37:41,961 --> 00:37:43,401
Here, I'll get it for you.

435
00:37:43,481 --> 00:37:47,361
Sautéed potato, green pepper and eggplant.
Stewed chicken with mushroom.

436
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:49,178
Eat more, Ms Ma.

437
00:37:50,163 --> 00:37:51,400
You...

438
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,563
Why are you dressed up...?

439
00:37:55,361 --> 00:37:57,321
What is wrong with it?

440
00:37:58,361 --> 00:38:00,001
I still look handsome as ever, don't I?

441
00:38:12,601 --> 00:38:13,641
Eat up, Ms Ma.

442
00:38:14,866 --> 00:38:15,842
I've taken some for you.

443
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:17,801
Eat more. We have a lot of food here.

444
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,220
Okay.

445
00:38:37,561 --> 00:38:39,201
It's really authentic!

446
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:40,601
Try one, Ms Ma.

447
00:38:43,538 --> 00:38:45,218
What...? What's wrong?

448
00:38:46,274 --> 00:38:48,435
I don't feel like eating today.

449
00:38:48,515 --> 00:38:49,515
You eat.

450
00:38:52,896 --> 00:38:54,161
I get it now.

451
00:38:54,241 --> 00:38:57,161
Is it because you don't like the
food that I ordered?

452
00:38:57,241 --> 00:38:58,441
It's fine, Ms Ma.

453
00:38:58,521 --> 00:38:59,618
Just tell me.

454
00:38:59,698 --> 00:39:01,121
I'll order some...

455
00:39:01,201 --> 00:39:02,962
No, no. You can eat it.

456
00:39:03,042 --> 00:39:04,563
If you're done, I'll get the bill.

457
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:05,483
No!

458
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:10,699
Have you ever tried dine and dash?

459
00:39:11,465 --> 00:39:12,305
No.

460
00:39:15,866 --> 00:39:17,186
What are you doing?

461
00:39:33,701 --> 00:39:34,601
Hurry!

462
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,241
They're catching up with us!

463
00:39:38,755 --> 00:39:40,595
Are you out of your mind?

464
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:43,401
How was that, Ms Ma?

465
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,321
Wasn't that exciting?

466
00:39:46,938 --> 00:39:48,298
Ms Ma, where are you going?

467
00:39:50,149 --> 00:39:51,681
All right, all right!

468
00:39:51,761 --> 00:39:52,882
I won't mess with you any more.

469
00:39:52,962 --> 00:39:54,442
Stop, stop!

470
00:39:58,361 --> 00:40:00,681
I paid the bill
when I went to the wash room.

471
00:40:12,682 --> 00:40:14,011
A gentleman uses his words
but not his fists.

472
00:40:14,091 --> 00:40:15,665
Force can't solve any problem.

473
00:40:15,745 --> 00:40:16,721
If you lose,
you'll be sent into a hospital.

474
00:40:16,801 --> 00:40:19,521
If you win, you'll be put into a jail.
It's not worth it.

475
00:40:44,321 --> 00:40:46,481
The view today is great.

476
00:40:49,641 --> 00:40:52,161
Are you hungry, Ms Ma?
You haven't eaten anything this evening.

477
00:40:57,881 --> 00:40:59,401
Let's eat hotpot, Ms Ma.

478
00:40:59,481 --> 00:41:00,321
