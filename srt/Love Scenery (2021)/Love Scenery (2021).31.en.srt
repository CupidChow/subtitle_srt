00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,660
♫When I've chosen a path
There's no going back♫

2
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,140
♫Just ignore the rumours

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,420
♫Even though there may be more rain
Than sunshine on this path♫

4
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,580
♫I don't care if I'd be reduced to ashes♫

5
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,180
♫All I want is to be on the stage♫

6
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,500
♫The light shining from my back
Is full of hope♫

7
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,660
♫Swim through the sea of mediocre
To reach a brand new future♫

8
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,660
♫And once I held my breath♫

9
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,260
♫Let our youth blossom
On the sea of conviction for our dreams♫

10
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,921
♫I still stubbornly believe in it
At every moment♫

11
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:05,380
♫Refusing to back down♫

12
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,740
♫Never stop
We don't need to♫

13
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,220
♫Never stop
Enjoy the solitude♫

14
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,940
♫Never stop
Till the sun sets♫

15
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,220
♫I'll walk my own path♫

16
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,620
♫Till the end of time♫

17
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,220
♫On this path of dream♫

=Episode 31=

21
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,480
Eat up. The food is good.

22
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,400
It's good.

23
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,440
Here. Cheers.

24
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:48,000
Eat more.

25
00:01:51,714 --> 00:01:53,954
Like I said, there'll be
a very harmonious atmosphere.

26
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,880
Three to three. Perfect.

27
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,832
But judging by the situation,

28
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,120
it will soon become six-on-two.

29
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,600
We're in danger.

30
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:16,640
Chen Chen, Lu Jing is younger than you.

31
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,560
You need to make concessions.

32
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,480
There's no need for that.

33
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,360
Kids these days are...

34
00:02:27,594 --> 00:02:29,240
Chen Chen, your mum is right.

35
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,560
Listen to her.

36
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,000
Don't worry. I will.

37
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,920
Lu Jing,
although Chen Chen is older than you,

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,800
she's still a girl, you see.

39
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,840
You need to look after her.

40
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:41,168
That's right.

41
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:42,169
That's what men do.

42
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:43,409
It's a must.

43
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,120
Don't worry. I will.

44
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,400
I'm only worried that my daughter
will give him a hard time.

45
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,480
She won't.

46
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,320
You were right.

47
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,840
Excuse me. I'll go to the ladies' room.

48
00:03:00,256 --> 00:03:01,216
Me too.

49
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,480
All right.

50
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:05,760
Look, no matter the age,

51
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,600
women will always go
to the restroom together.

52
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,640
Chen Chen.

53
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,600
Yes, Aunty.

54
00:03:22,281 --> 00:03:23,521
This is for you.

55
00:03:24,394 --> 00:03:25,874
This is...

56
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,840
I know. I've given you one earlier.

57
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,520
But that was just a courtesy gift.

58
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,880
This is a little gift from me.

59
00:03:41,953 --> 00:03:43,113
Thank you, Aunty.

60
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,760
Lu Jing was raised by his grandparents.

61
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,240
So the elders tend to spoil the kids.

62
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,120
So he has many weaknesses, big or small.

63
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,600
You'll have to bear with it.

64
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,280
Not at all. Lu Jing is great.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,600
But...

66
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,280
it's not easy to meet someone you love
who loves you back.

67
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,760
So both of you must cherish each other.

68
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,600
Don't easily give up on each other.

69
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,480
Don't worry, Aunty.

70
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,240
Lu Jing and I will be good together.

71
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,200
If Lu Jing gives you a hard time,
be sure to tell me about it.

72
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,040
We can both take care of him together.

73
00:04:28,465 --> 00:04:29,360
Let's go.

74
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,920
I feel satiated.

75
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,920
Hold on, guys.

76
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,480
I have a suggestion.

77
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,160
It's such a happy occasion today.

78
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,040
Since our families are gathered together,

79
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,640
let's take some pictures as a keepsake.

80
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,280
-Sure.
-You're right.

81
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,960
This is a historic meeting.

82
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,040
It's worth remembering.

83
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,800
Let's start with these two youngsters.

84
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,960
They are busy.

85
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,080
When we can't see them,

86
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,640
we can look at their pictures.

87
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,040
-All right.
-That's right.

88
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,960
-Come on.
-Here. Look here.

89
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,520
That's not right.

90
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,320
Why are you two acting like strangers?

91
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,080
Stand closer.

92
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,200
That's right. Be more intimate.

93
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,720
Yes, more intimate.

94
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,841
It looks like we need to set an example.

95
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:12,761
Ms Lu.

96
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,080
Let's show them.

97
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,280
-Come on.
-Let's do it.

98
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,777
-Why are you just standing there?
-You should do this.

99
00:05:20,857 --> 00:05:22,898
That's the way. Come on.

100
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:23,898
Come on.

101
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,840
That's right. Nice.

102
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,360
Look here. Say cheese.

103
00:05:35,841 --> 00:05:37,961
What did my mum say to you earlier?

104
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,280
What's the matter?

105
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,400
Are you worried Aunty
was talking behind your back...

106
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,600
so you got nervous?

107
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,000
What's there to be nervous about?

108
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,680
Since you're not,
I don't have to tell you.

109
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:52,880
I know.

110
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,880
My mum must have secretly given you
something behind my back.

111
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,320
How did you know?

112
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,160
She's my mum. How would I not know?

113
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,320
From the looks of it,

114
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,360
you used to take girls home...

115
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,640
and your mum gave them gifts too?

116
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,240
No, that was when I was a kid.

117
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Back then,
a girl insisted to come home with me.

118
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,920
You're quite something.

119
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,640
She insisted to come with me.
I can't just kick her out, right?

120
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,840
What did your mum give her then?

121
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,280
A set of primary school
Mathematical Olympiad.

122
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
Really?

123
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,840
After that, she never spoke to me again.

124
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,360
So I have to give your mum credit
for you staying single all this time.

125
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,840
She deserves all the credit.

126
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,760
Are you graduating in another few months?

127
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,520
So...

128
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,200
are you coming to my graduation?

129
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,520
I'll think about it.

130
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,320
Come, please.

131
00:07:10,785 --> 00:07:11,705
What?

132
00:07:12,177 --> 00:07:13,280
Come.

133
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,440
I can't hear you.

134
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,480
(Happy Graduation)

135
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,520
All good things must come to an end.

136
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,760
We have come to the moment of graduation.

137
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,280
Thank you, Nanze University,
my teachers and fellow mates.

138
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,880
All the best for a bright future.

139
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,440
Three, two, one! Cheese!

140
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,960
Ms Liang, over here!

141
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,880
Why did you ask me here?

142
00:07:50,322 --> 00:07:52,600
Let's take pictures together.

143
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,720
Sure.

144
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,200
But why are you acting all squirmy?

145
00:07:56,081 --> 00:08:00,360
Ms Liang, Jing wants to take pictures
with you at Lover's Leap.

146
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,880
All couples that graduated
from Nanze University...

147
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,040
will express their gratitude
for the fate that brought them together.

148
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sure you know
this unwritten rule, right?

149
00:08:22,394 --> 00:08:23,234
Let's go.

150
00:08:25,015 --> 00:08:27,040
-Come on.
-Take pictures!

151
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,400
Are you ready?

152
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,520
Smile!

153
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,640
-One, two, three. Cheese!
-This is nice.

154
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,990
-Another pose.
-Another pose.

155
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,440
Another pose.

156
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,320
Yes, this is nice.

157
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,920
Why go through all this trouble?

158
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,000
Developed photos add to the emotion.

159
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,480
After some time, when we dig them out,

160
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,960
the photos would have turned yellow.

161
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,600
How sentimental is that?

162
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,800
But...

163
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,640
what should I write?

164
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,080
Just stick the photos on the album.

165
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,600
That's what you don't understand.

166
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,480
I once read this novel.

167
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,240
In the story,
the male protagonist wrote...

168
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,400
"You're my sunshine"
at the back of the photo.

169
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,480
Look.

170
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,880
How romantic and touching is that?

171
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,480
Okay, I'll write one for you too.

172
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,840
"Lover's tree at the Lover's Leap."

173
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,720
"You and me under the lover's tree."

174
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,080
"A photo together in front of the tree."

175
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,960
"Oh, how much joy it brings."

176
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,440
Don't you think I'm so talented?

177
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,680
Good thing
you weren't studying literature.

178
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,760
Otherwise, you'll never graduate.

179
00:10:17,062 --> 00:10:18,969
Isn't it written well?

180
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,720
I'll stick it on.

181
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,223
Congrats, Lu Jing.

182
00:10:32,303 --> 00:10:33,880
You've finally graduated.

183
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,600
There wasn't an ounce of sincerity
in your words.

184
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,400
But I'll accept it, anyway.

185
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,320
Fine. I'll show my sincerity.

186
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,360
Where are you?

187
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,456
Liang Chen's house.

188
00:10:42,536 --> 00:10:45,600
Well, how about a hotpot?

189
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,120
No fatty cuts of beef and mutton.

190
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,800
I want all kinds of vegetables
and mushrooms.

191
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,240
Don't forget, beers and drinks.

192
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,560
Also, Liang Chen doesn't eat spicy food.

193
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,120
Yes, sir.

194
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,480
Let's have a hotpot at Orange's house
this afternoon.

195
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,400
Not free.

196
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,360
Taro, how are you holding up?

197
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,680
You're running out of chess pieces.

198
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,000
You... Shush!

199
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,697
He's being fierce to me.

200
00:11:27,777 --> 00:11:28,737
Watch me.

201
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,360
No!

202
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:40,520
You lost. Go and cook.

203
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,560
Let's play.

204
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:44,280
Fake friends!

205
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,320
After you two got back together,
you burned the bridges and abandoned me?

206
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,640
When were you ever in our world?

207
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,080
This is...

208
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,400
You're right.

209
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,960
Everything you say is right.

210
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,440
It's just me.

211
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,841
All alone, and no one loves me.

212
00:11:58,921 --> 00:12:00,121
Off I go to cook.

213
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,840
I'll get the door.

214
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,480
Lu Jing, are you really just going
to sit there?

215
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,800
You ruthless man!

216
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,280
Coming.

217
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,920
I'll leave Ma Hua with you.

218
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,800
Don't worry. You can leave her with me.

219
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,320
I'm going to fatten it up.

220
00:12:29,954 --> 00:12:32,515
She can't put on any more weight.
She's not an orange cat.

221
00:12:32,595 --> 00:12:34,156
She'll fall sick
if she puts on more weight.

222
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,200
These are all cat food.

223
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,400
It's all in English.

224
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,080
Feed her this during the day.

225
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,560
And this, during the night.

226
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,920
This is the calcium tablet.

227
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,148
-And these, to wash her eyes and ears...
-Hold it right there.

228
00:12:47,228 --> 00:12:49,203
I can't remember everything. Slow down.

229
00:12:50,088 --> 00:12:52,168
Do you have a pen?
I'll write it down for you.

230
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,571
I'll get one.

231
00:12:54,651 --> 00:12:55,491
Here we go.

232
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,160
Shan Shan, it's really you.

233
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,640
I knew it was you when I heard the voice.

234
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,440
Aren't you busy?

235
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,880
It's a surprise, right?

236
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,400
You're getting more naughty lately.

237
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,280
Let's go. Come on in. Let's have a hotpot.

238
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,880
Taro, I'm busy. I mean it.

239
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,200
Orange, have you found the pen?

240
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,920
Pen?

241
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I have one.

242
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,640
You bring a marker pen with you
all the time?

243
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,800
I'm a famous guy now.

244
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,120
A stage actor.

245
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,840
People ask for my signature
whenever I walk on the streets.

246
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,200
I have to be prepared, right?

247
00:13:31,498 --> 00:13:32,392
Fine.

248
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,040
-What are you writing?
-Done.

249
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,000
Orange, I've written it down!

250
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,280
I'll leave Ma Hua with you!

251
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,000
Ma Hua, mummy loves you.

252
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,120
You! Don't steal the cat food!

253
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,040
What?

254
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,720
Shan Shan, where are you going?

255
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,840
Shan Shan!

256
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,080
Ma Hua.

257
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,640
Why are you being so lazy?

258
00:13:52,969 --> 00:13:55,129
Ma Hua.

259
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,640
Why did Shan Shan leave her cat with you?

260
00:14:04,352 --> 00:14:05,833
It's a gift from Shan Shan.

261
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:06,960
A gift?

262
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,721
How would she possibly give away
her precious baby?

263
00:14:09,801 --> 00:14:11,760
That's because she's going to immigrate.

264
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,160
She can't bring her cat with her.

265
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,640
That's why she gave it to us.

266
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,960
Yes, the application failed.
So she gave it to us.

267
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,363
What?

268
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:21,800
What did you just say?

269
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,240
What?

270
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,320
Don't you understand?

271
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,605
She's moving abroad.
She's not coming back.

272
00:14:26,685 --> 00:14:27,966
No, that can't be.

273
00:14:28,046 --> 00:14:29,160
When was this?

274
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,161
How am I not aware of it?

275
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:31,760
She... She didn't tell me!

276
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
I'm not sure.

277
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,720
Her flight is tonight.

278
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,080
So she dropped off her cat
and left to go to the airport.

279
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,360
Shan Shan!

280
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,720
Shan Shan!

281
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:38,401
Shan Shan!

282
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,720
If you came to see me
just to stare into space,

283
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,640
sorry, I don't have time.

284
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,680
No, well...

285
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,160
Are you leaving?

286
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,680
What do you think?
Waiting for a cab for fun?

287
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,120
What's going on?

288
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,680
Well... You...

289
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,360
You took something of mine.

290
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,040
I took something of yours?

291
00:16:06,729 --> 00:16:07,969
What is it?

292
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,960
My... My marker pen.

293
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,000
It's just a marker pen.
Aren't you overacting?

294
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,640
Can you not go?

295
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,240
-No.
-Tell me!

296
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,240
Why must you go?

297
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,120
Why won't you say it then?

298
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,120
Say... Say what?

299
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,400
That you like me.

300
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,685
I...

301
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:49,320
I...

302
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,160
Hurry up! I'm leaving if you won't say it!

303
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,360
I like you! Don't go!

304
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,560
My goodness.

305
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,360
I must be blushing.

306
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,281
I'll be back in a week.

307
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,120
I'll wait for you!

308
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,510
I'll pick you up!

309
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:35,360
I love you!

310
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,360
I'm going abroad
for a student exchange program...

311
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,800
and will be back after half a year.

312
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,400
Take good care of yourself.

313
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,760
Don't stay up late to study.

314
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,960
♫Go where the wind blows♫

315
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,290
♫It brought me to you♫

316
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:26,650
♫You shot me with the arrow of love♫

317
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,180
♫Breaking my defences♫

318
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,720

♫So let's go just with the wind♫

320
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,870
♫You said flying free♫

321
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,100
♫Is the way to make it far♫

322
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:47,420
♫Do you know how long I've waited?♫

323
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,140
♫I wait and wait
But you're nowhere to be seen♫

324
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,340
♫Even my wings have grown weary♫

325
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,350
♫The shimmering lights on the journey♫

326
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,510
♫That I've picked up along the way♫

327
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,230
♫Piece together a profile of you♫

328
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,810
♫Yeah♫

329
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,010
♫Just go on walking♫

330
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,510
♫Keep on looking♫

331
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,560
♫For the shape of you in the wind♫

332
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,760
♫Go where the wind blows♫

333
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,960
♫It brought me to you♫

00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,740

♫So let's go just with the wind♫

339

♫It brought me to you♫

340
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,400
♫Wandering freely
To a far away place with you♫

341
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,810
♫In that moment, let me♫

342
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:48,290
♫Just go with the wind♫

343
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
It's snowing.

344
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,600
The weather forecast is so accurate.

345
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,640
Last year's first snow
was around this time too, right?

346
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,720
It's been a year.

347
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,720
Is today your birthday?

348
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,240
I'm 22 this year.

349
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,920
Happy Birthday!

350
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,560
Have you received the birthday present
that I sent you?

351
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:54,320
Not yet.

352
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,800
What's with the express delivery?

353
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,200
I have planned ahead.

354
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,600
Will it not reach in time
for your birthday?

355
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:05,080
Perhaps it has arrived.

356
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,680
But I'm not at home.

357
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,440
Where did you go?

358
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,520
Preparing to go out
to celebrate my birthday.

359
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,280
But there are two more days to go.

360
00:21:19,897 --> 00:21:21,218
I couldn't wait.

361
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,600
I want to celebrate it with you.

362
00:21:26,514 --> 00:21:27,634
What is it?

363
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,680
He's coming back!

364
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,920
No.

365
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,880
I need to get changed
and pick him up from the airport.

366
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,080
Ms Liang, control yourself.

367
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,400
It takes more than 10 hours
to fly from there.

368
00:21:36,858 --> 00:21:37,818
You're right.

369
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,280
Jia Yun.

370
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:00,226
Hi.

371
00:22:01,937 --> 00:22:03,817
Aren't you in school?

372
00:22:04,321 --> 00:22:05,754
I'm taking time out to go home.

373
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:06,674
All right.

374
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,680
I will be in the UK for a while.

375
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,640
If you're coming back,
you can call me if you need anything.

376
00:22:17,193 --> 00:22:18,073
Thank you.

377
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,000
Hi, sir.
I'll put away your jacket for you.

378
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,840
Hold on.

379
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,600
-Okay. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

380
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,626
Is anyone coming to pick you up?

381
00:24:09,706 --> 00:24:11,706
I can give you a ride.

382
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,600
It's fine. Liang Chen will pick me up.

383
00:24:17,434 --> 00:24:18,634
Thank you.

384
00:24:18,714 --> 00:24:19,754
You're welcome.

385
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,760
Ladies and gentlemen.

386
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,361
We will be passing through turbulence.

387
00:24:31,441 --> 00:24:32,722
For your safety,

388
00:24:32,802 --> 00:24:35,924
please remain seated
and fasten your seat belt.

389
00:24:36,004 --> 00:24:37,244
Thank you.

390
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,560
What happened to BC851?

391
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,400
The aircraft encountered severe turbulence
and cannot be detected by radar.

392
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,840
Come on. Let's find out what happened.

393
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,234
What's going on?
It's half an hour late already.

394
00:24:47,314 --> 00:24:48,760
Why hasn't the plane landed?

395
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,200
It's been so long.

396
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,850
(BC851 London 08:35 Delayed)

397
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:03,480
Sorry.

398
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,440
The number you dialled
cannot be reached at the moment.

399
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,720
Sorry.

400
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,960
The number you dialled
cannot be reached at the moment.

401
00:25:40,474 --> 00:25:41,474
Jia Yun.

402
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,960
If we can land safely this time,

403
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,320
I'll give her happiness.

404
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,370
Don't worry. We'll be fine.

405
00:26:03,072 --> 00:26:04,072
But...

406
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,760
if I'm not lucky...

407
00:26:11,408 --> 00:26:13,409
please help me tell her...

408
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,369
No.

409
00:26:14,977 --> 00:26:16,217
You...

410
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,840
have to tell her this yourself.

411
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,880
-It has landed.
-It has landed!

412
00:28:29,964 --> 00:28:31,684
That scared the crap out of me.

413
00:28:42,707 --> 00:28:44,067
I'm glad you're back.

414
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,920
♫I stand on the stage♫

415
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,260

Back on the plane,

451
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,600
were you scared?

452
00:32:44,448 --> 00:32:45,528
No.

453
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,290
I was as calm as a cat.

454
00:32:51,912 --> 00:32:53,312
What's on your mind?

455
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,760
Nothing.

456
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:00,313
Don't let your imagination run wild.

457
00:33:01,921 --> 00:33:03,521
I'm all good, aren't I?

458
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,960
I have the devil's own luck.
Nothing will happen to me.

459
00:34:18,313 --> 00:34:20,473
If this is my life journey's end,

460
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:25,910
I only wish you peace and joy
throughout your life.

461
00:34:26,785 --> 00:34:28,295
There's a cycle of life.

462
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,720
And there's love in another life.

463
00:34:33,225 --> 00:34:34,375
My dear,

464
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,640
I love you.

465
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,640
See you in the next life.

466
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,440
I'm honoured to receive this award.

467
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,841
Thanks to the production company,

468
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:23,161
Star Lotus Film and TV,

469
00:35:24,002 --> 00:35:25,170
my producer,

470
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,130
Mr Wang,

471
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,505
and my director,

472
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:30,986
for giving me this opportunity.

473
00:35:31,066 --> 00:35:32,400
Here. Don't catch a cold.

474
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,080
Also, thanks to the audience
for your support.

475
00:35:35,721 --> 00:35:38,537
Lastly, thanks to the organizing committee
for your recognition.

476
00:35:38,617 --> 00:35:41,057
If it were me, I would be upset too.

477
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,600
For the sake of this film,

478
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,720
you laid on the snow
and waded in the river.

479
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,880
You fell off the horse a few times
and almost broke your leg.

480
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,520
After the movie became a hit,

481
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,880
they said
you were just a supporting actress.

482
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,440
What the heck is this?

483
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,720
Do you hear the cheers?

484
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,360
It's Liang Chen's concert.

485
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,280
The award for the best-supporting actress
will be announced soon.

486
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,280
Come on. Let's get back inside.

487
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,561
Let's welcome the presenter,

488
00:36:18,641 --> 00:36:20,880
the famous actor, Hu Rong,
to announce...

489
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,920
China Film Awards's
Best-Supporting Actress award.

490
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,040
The Best-Supporting Actress goes to...

491
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,960
Ma Shan Shan!

492
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,000
Shan Shan, where are you going?

493
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,600
Screw it.

494
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,320
What are you doing?

495
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,800
To fly free!

496
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,920
Okay, I'll come with you!

497
00:37:04,152 --> 00:37:07,088
To all my fans who are here today,
you're in luck.

498
00:37:07,168 --> 00:37:09,233
This is the first time...

499
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:11,360
my best friend will sing on the stage
after all these years.

500
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,600
She's very talented.

501
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,040
But do you want to hear her sing?

502
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,080
Yes!

503
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,600
Let's shout her name out loud!

504
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,840
Ma Shan Shan!

505
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,320
Ma Shan Shan!

506
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,740
(Among the million shining stars,
I cherish only Liang Chen)

507
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:34,420
(Chen Chen has my heart. Always with you)

508
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,560
Liang Chen!

509
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,080
Liang Chen!

510
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,880
