00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,660
♫When I've chosen a path
There's no going back♫

2
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,140
♫Just ignore the rumours

3
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,420
♫Even though there may be more rain
Than sunshine on this path♫

4
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,580
♫I don't care if I'd be reduced to ashes♫

5
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,180
♫All I want is to be on the stage♫

6
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,500
♫The light shining from my back
Is full of hope♫

7
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,660
♫Swim through the sea of mediocre
To reach a brand new future♫

8
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,660
♫And once I held my breath♫

9
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,260
♫Let our youth blossom
On the sea of conviction for our dreams♫

10
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,921
♫I still stubbornly believe in it
At every moment♫

11
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:05,380
♫Refusing to back down♫

12
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,740
♫Never stop
We don't need to♫

13
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,220
♫Never stop
Enjoy the solitude♫

14
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,940
♫Never stop
Till the sun sets♫

15
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,220
♫I'll walk my own path♫

16
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,620
♫Till the end of time♫

17
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,220
♫On this path of dream♫

21
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,020
Our boy has finally grown up.

22
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,240
I've been so worried about him
all these years.

23
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,680
What guy doesn't have a girlfriend
in university?

24
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,880
My boy is nice, but he is a complete nerd.

25
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,420
A bookworm who only reads and studies.

26
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,480
But now, it's great.

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,880
-He's finally found a girlfriend.
-Yes.

28
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,840
I have to go back to my friends.

29
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,960
No problem, go ahead.

30
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,920
Okay. Bye, Grandpa.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,420
-Bye, Grandma.
-Bye-bye.

32
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,400
-Bye.
-Okay, bye.

33
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,800
Dear, our grandson has a girlfriend now.

34
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,980
Do you hear me?

35
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,420
What's the use in hearing about it?

36
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,840
Let's change our clothes and check it out.

37
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,780
Yes, indeed! Let's go.

38
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,020
Food is here.

39
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,120
Here.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,840
Thanks.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,840
Thanks.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,180
You all have not even touched
your chopsticks yet.

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,180
It's just a joke, guys.

44
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,440
You're back so soon.

45
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,900
We have yet to eat.

46
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,060
An immediate emergency calls
for an instant remedy.

47
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,400
Okay.

48
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,400
Ms Ma, quick, taste this.

49
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,460
I've made a great contribution
to this particular dish.

50
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,020
As great as sesame seeds.

51
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,080
Come.

52
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,220
Here you go, Ms Ma.

53
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,160
-Thanks.
-Thanks, Jia Yun.

54
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,200
Liang Chen doesn't drink.

55
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,120
You drink on her behalf.

56
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,400
No problem.

57
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,000
Have some fruit juice.

58
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,840
Can you take alcoholic drinks?

59
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,760
You underestimate me.

60
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,400
Come on. Cheers, everyone.

61
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,760
To celebrate Orange's triumph
in the challenge!

62
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,300
Thanks everyone, cheers!

63
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,900
Let's eat.

64
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,560
Ms Ma.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,260
Try some fish.

66
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,220
I made this. Try it.

67
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,780
I don't eat fish.

68
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,740
Well, that's all right.

69
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,240
Use mine then.

70
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,760
Ms Ma, try the boiled shrimp.

71
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,820
I made this too.

72
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,660
It's so delicious.

73
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,440
Okay.

74
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,560
Ms Ma, you didn't eat the fish,

75
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,940
but why is there a fish bone
on your eyelid?

76
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,940
It's double eyelid sticker.

77
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,460
My dear,

78
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,640
do you think it's a good idea
to just show up like this?

79
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,920
Of course!

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,480
We have to take the initiative.

81
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,060
If not, we'll have to wait a long time
to get a grandchild.

82
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,460
That's true.

83
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,280
Stop hesitating, let's go.

84
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,500
Sure, let's go.

85
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,640
I'll open the door.

86
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,760
Grandpa Lu, Grandma Lu.
What brings you here?

87
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,520
We are here to borrow some rice.

88
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,540
We've finished ours.

89
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,120
Borrow rice? Both of you?

90
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,040
Grandpa is worried
that I might not be able to carry it.

91
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,180
-He's here to help me.
-Yes, to help.

92
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,440
Are you going to take all of our rice?

93
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,480
Of course not.

94
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,880
Just lend us what you can.

95
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,200
Sure, come in.

96
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,680
This way, Grandpa Lu.

97
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,980
-Coming.
-This way, Grandpa Lu.

98
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
There are so many of you here.

99
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,180
Everyone is here.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,560
Please sit down, children.

101
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,580
Sit down.

102
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,540
Okay, okay.

103
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,820
Carry on with your meal.

104
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,900
We're just here to borrow some rice.

105
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,220
This way, Grandpa Lu.

106
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,620
Grandma, why are you here?

107
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,840
I know you're having a gathering.

108
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,620
So I brought a box of Doubendou soy milk
for you to replenish your nutrients.

109
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,580
Grandma, would you look at this rice?

110
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,200
The rice...

111
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
Judging by your attire,

112
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,880
it doesn't look like you're having
a meal at home.

113
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,820
Take a good look with my glasses.

114
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,600
So bright and beautiful.

115
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,860
Yes, indeed.

116
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,920
How come I never noticed...

117
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,320
how attractive our rice is?

118
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,220
You have a vision problem.

119
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,600
Grandma, why don't we continue this
back home?

120
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
Okay, okay.

121
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,160
Kids, enjoy your meal.

122
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,520
If there's not enough food,

123
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,680
we have braised duck
and pork shoulder at home.

124
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,400
Heaps of them. You're welcome to it.

125
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,160
-Don't be shy.
-Let's go, Grandpa.

126
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,720
-You're all welcome to it.
-Let's go.

127
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,640
Okay.

128
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,180
Have a good day.

129
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,660
We'll talk at home, okay?

130
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,680
Sure.

131
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,740
We're off, then,

132
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,280
Here, Orange.

133
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,560
Grandma Lu's Doubendou soy milk.

134
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,480
Enjoy.

135
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,940
Try it, Ms Ma.

136
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,880
Thanks.

137
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,140
Here, Ding.

138
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,700
Should I go over and say hi to them?

139
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,860
No hurry, just give them some time.

140
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,740
What should I prepare?

141
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,760
A greeting gift.

142
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,360
Are you two done texting each other?

143
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,220
Can't we just have a proper meal?

144
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,800
I'm sorry.

145
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,200
I was too loud just now.

146
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,020
Please carry on.

147
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,140
Carry on with your texting.

148
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,520
Here, Ms Ma.

149
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,660
Have a boiled shrimp.

150
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,660
Come, Ding. Cheers.

151
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,380
Dig in, Liang Chen.

152
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,260
Jing, don't just keep drinking water.

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,780
Why did you come back just like that?

154
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,720
What else should I do?

155
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,020
You should send
my granddaughter-in-law back home.

156
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,620
Don't worry, Grandma.
Someone will send her back.

157
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,660
My dear grandson,
how can you be such a fool?

158
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,360
That was such a good opportunity.

159
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,700
It was the time to show your affection.

160
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,320
You're not like me at all.

161
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,660
Back in the day,
when I pursued your grandma...

162
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,140
Stop bragging about the past.

163
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,880
Tell me, Jing.

164
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,700
When will we get to meet
our granddaughter-in-law in person?

165
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,480
This is very important.

166
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,600
When?

167
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
In two days' time?

168
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,600
A day?

169
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,700
-A day?
-You are even more impatient.

170
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,080
You can't keep putting it off.

171
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,400
Not with something like this.

172
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,600
If you keep putting it off,
you'll miss the chance.

173
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,000
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

174
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,320
Anyway, we really like this girl.

175
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,440
She's gorgeous, bright and gentle.
She's perfect.

176
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,520
She is very bright and beautiful.

177
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,960
-I like her a lot.
-You do?

178
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,160
Just two more days.

179
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,240
-Two more days.
-You must seize it.

180
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,640
-Sure.
-No procrastinating.

181
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,180
Come, drink your water.

182
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,520
Thanks, Grandma.

183
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,140
You are not drunk, are you, Ding?

184
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,440
I'm still all right.

185
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,020
Good job with the cooking today.

186
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,220
Look at all the dirty dishes.

187
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,640
Don't you move a muscle.
I'll do the dishes.

188
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,060
Sober up and we'll have a chat later.

189
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,480
You...

190
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,140
What are you implying?

191
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,220
Others may not be aware, but I am.

192
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,860
You may look all right on the surface,

193
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,500
but you haven't let go of Orange.

194
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,460
What's not to let go?

195
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,480
If we're not destined to be together,

196
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,420
what's the point in trying?

197
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,820
You know, destiny is a fascinating thing.

198
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,280
I believe Ms Ma and I are destined
to be together.

199
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,460
-What do you think?
-Then why didn't you send her home?

200
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,600
Orange was here.

201
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,020
I had no chance.

202
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,320
Why don't we have a couple more drinks?

203
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,300
Let's drink to destiny.

204
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,060
It's getting late.

205
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,380
I've got to go.

206
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,080
Let me get you a designated driver.

207
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,260
Zhu Guang is downstairs.

208
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,360
I'll make a move first.

209
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,660
Let me see you off, Ding.

210
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,240
Take it easy.

211
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,600
Bye, Ding.

212
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,100
Keep in touch.

213
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,920
How can I help you?

214
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,780
I heard you have a girlfriend now.

215
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,240
How did you get a girlfriend so suddenly?

216
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,060
Is she your coursemate?

217
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,800
Excuse me.

218
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,540
Carry on.

219
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
We've known each other for so long.

220
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,580
Who am I to you, really?

221
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,680
Lu Jing,
it all begins with Beautiful Soul.

222
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,660
Get Orange to join us.

223
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,340
Brother, let's have fireworks tonight.

224
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,860
Why are you still awake at this hour?

225
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,560
I joined the winter camp.
It's boring at night.

226
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,880
Please play with me.

227
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,800
I beg you, Brother.

228
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,780
You are the best.

229
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,380
Okay, I will get a couple of friends.

230
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
What's wrong?

231
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,080
I miss you.

232
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,360
We've just met earlier, haven't we?

233
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,460
I don't want to be apart from you
even for a second.

234
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,800
Do you want to play Beautiful Soul?
Taro, and my cousin will be joining too.

235
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,060
Your cousin?

236
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,560
It's good for you
to get acquainted with him.

237
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,860
We will be a family soon anyway.

238
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,660
Okay, I'll stop joking.

239
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,960
Are you joining?

240
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,800
Okay.

241
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,700
How did you do in the exam?

242
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,540
Superb. I came in first.

243
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,961
-If you count from the back.
-If you count from the back.

244
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:34,881
Yes, indeed.

245
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,680
Here I am.

246
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,040
Brother, who...?

247
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,960
Who is she?

248
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,500
Is she your girlfriend?

249
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
She's your sister-in-law.

250
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,360
Sister-in-law?

251
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,380
Sister-in-law!

252
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,300
Brother, you're in a relationship.

253
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,380
How are you, kid?

254
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,460
Hi, Sister-in-law.

255
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,700
I need to tell Uncle and Aunt about this.

256
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,720
But, Brother,
when will you take Sister-in-law home?

257
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,140
You have to ask her...

258
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,380
when she will be willing
to go home with me.

259
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,980
Okay, let's proceed with our mission.

260
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,240
What's wrong with Taro?

261
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,500
The host is now the latecomer.

262
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,060
I'm here!

263
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,940
Well, nature's call.

264
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,280
You are here too, Brother.

265
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,240
Who says I'm your brother?

266
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,480
Okay, everyone is here.

267
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,400
Let's go.

268
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,620
Come over here, Chen Chen.

269
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,320
Stop calling me that.

270
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,100
There's a kid here. It's not appropriate.

271
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,460
I was calling my brother.

272
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,740
Sister-in-law, he is calling me.

273
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,460
Chen Chen, this is for you.

274
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,840
Chen Chen.

275
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,680
Chen Chen.

276
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,380
Liang Chen.

277
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,060
Are you calling me?

278
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,940
Chen Chen? Seriously?

279
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,680
Chen Chen.

280
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,920
Would you like a grenade?

281
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,980
Chen Chen.

282
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,320
Why are you coming here?

283
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,560
I didn't ask you to come over,
I just wanted to give....

284
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,680
She hit me.

285
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,020
Do you hear me, Lu Jing?

286
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,280
Ha Ha.

287
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,300
The two of you are so much alike.

288
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,430
Always bullying me.

289
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,670
I saw a Jeep, Brother.

290
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,720
Coming.

291
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,640
Let's go.

292
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:25,830
Thank you.

293
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,540
Since when did you become so observant?

294
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,700
What are you waiting for? Get in the car.

295
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,180
The co-driver's seat is mine.

296
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,440
Sister, you are really possessive.

297
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,180
Look, Lu Jing.

298
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,400
-What are you doing?
-Get in the back, now.

299
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,780
Okay. I'm going.

300
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,440
Showing off your affection online.

301
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,800
Disgusting.

302
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,780
Huh...

303
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,820
Let's get down. The car is broken.

304
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,400
I...

305
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,840
Orange.

306
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,940
After you left,
I witnessed a very interesting thing.

307
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,640
What is that?

308
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,260
A Hunanese girl came to see Lu Jing.

309
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,800
Who?

310
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,820
You have to ask him.

311
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,500
It's nothing. She's just a neighbour.

312
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,720
My foot!

313
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,800
That's not what actually happened.

314
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,760
I saw it with my own eyes.

315
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,940
That girl was questioning him
if he was seeing a girl.

316
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,580
What did you tell her, then?

317
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,040
Me? Nothing.

318
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,540
My foot!

319
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,920
She was really disappointed.

320
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,360
She kept asking him,

321
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,180
"How much do I mean to you?"

322
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,740
-You're so dangerous.
-How did you answer her?

323
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,720
Didn't you see it?

324
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,960
How I answered her?

325
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,160
I missed that part.

326
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,780
You asked me to get inside.

327
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,780
Tell me, what did you say?

328
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,320
We've known each other for so long.

329
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,860
How much do I mean to you?

330
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,220
I'm sorry, you have no place in my heart.

331
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,580
As expected of my brother!

332
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,320
Is that so?

333
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,800
I told you, Lu Jing would never hurt you.

334
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,340
When did you say that?

335
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,460
Just now.
I said it a few times inside my head.

336
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,000
Good job.

337
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,560
Come on.

338
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,580
This is for you.

339
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,760
Such a good boy.

340
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,760
Don't call me that.

341
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,540
It makes me sound like a kid.

342
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,240
Sound like a kid?

343
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,340
You are a kid.

344
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,160
Say it again.

345
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,120
Who is the kid?

346
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,960
It's me, I'm the kid.

347
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,780
The kid at your gunpoint.

348
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,280
Chen Chen, here's a healing salve.

349
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,660
-Who are you calling?
-Who are you calling?

350
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,460
Who do you think I'm calling?

351
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,200
You're awesome.

352
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,300
Have you two had enough?

353
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,280
You taunted this poor bachelor
in real life,

354
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,900
and now you're taunting him online.

355
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,280
Isn't that mean?

356
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,400
I'm mean?

357
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,820
Get your own girlfriend, then.

358
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,280
Are you provoking me?

359
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,240
You...

360
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,380
You never had a girlfriend
after all these years.

361
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,320
Lu Jing, if you keep provoking me,

362
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,920
Believe it or not, I will go after you.

363
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,600
No way, I won't agree
even if he agrees with it.

364
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,660
Are you out of your mind?

365
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,920
Let's go.

366
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,280
By the way, I'm short of a smoke grenade.

367
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,340
Lu Jing, can I have one?

368
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,840
No, because you eavesdropped
on me earlier.

369
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,140
Cheapskate!

370
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,000
Brother, I'm out of smoke grenades.

371
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,080
-Can I have one?
-I gave them all to your sister-in-law.

372
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,080
Ask her.

373
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,140
Sister-in-law, can I have a smoke grenade?

374
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,600
Here you go.

375
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,800
What's wrong with you?

376
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,160
This is bullying.

377
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,040
-Just call me sister-in-law.
-Go on.

378
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,940
Go to hell.

379
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,640
-Come on.
-Let's go.

380
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,340
Chen Chen, when will you be ready
to meet my parents?

381
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,200
What's your problem?
Can you drop it already?

382
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,020
I can't wait to start the next phase
of my life.

383
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,440
I'm tired. I have to go.

384
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,640
What did you say? I can't hear you.
Bye-bye.

385
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,060
-Bye-bye.
-Goodnight.

386
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,400
(Letter of Admission
The University of Thousandisland)

387
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,600
Lu Jing.

388
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,340
How's your plan to study abroad
coming along?

389
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,160
I have the letter of admission.

390
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,580
My admission is next year.

391
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,800
Great.

392
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,280
I know you've been preparing for this
since freshman year.

393
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,420
I never thought you'd be graduating
so soon.

394
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,140
In all my years of teaching,

395
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,320
I've seldom come across a student
as talented and as hard-working as you.

396
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,660
Do your best.

397
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,040
I will.

398
00:23:45,294 --> 00:23:48,320
(Letter of admission)

399
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,640
Have you eaten?

400
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,880
No.

401
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,860
Let me check the fridge.

402
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,540
Do you know how to cook?

403
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,980
Why don't we order takeout?

404
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,280
Okay.

405
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,760
What do you want to eat?

406
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,040
Anything will do.

407
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,220
I will go ahead and order.

408
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,420
I need to answer a call.

409
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,260
Lu Jing, how about pizza?

410
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,160
Thank you.

411
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,500
I was asking, is pizza fine with you?

412
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,400
Yes.

413
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,820
Who were you calling?

414
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,240
The courier.

415
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,580
The courier? Do they speak English?

416
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,860
It's for an overseas parcel.

417
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,680
I see.

418
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,920
I'll order a fruit pizza for you.

419
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,080
Would you like that?

420
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,000
Sounds good.

421
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,520
What about spicy pizza?

422
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,440
Sounds good.

423
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,260
Wasabi pizza?

424
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,200
Sounds good.

425
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,940
Durian pizza?

426
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,460
Sounds good, too.

427
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,620
Why do you like everything?

428
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,420
But I love you the most.

429
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,360
What's going on?

430
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Nothing.

431
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,140
I just want to hug you.

432
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,260
Are you sure you're okay?

433
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,900
The food delivery will take some time.

434
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,580
Why don't we play a game first?

435
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,880
Let's go.

436
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,120
Sit down.

437
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,100
What are you trying to do?

438
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,680
Log in.

439
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,320
Why are you looking at me?

440
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,200
Looks like your handling needs work.

441
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,820
No wonder you are so slow
to pick up items.

442
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,900
Run downstairs. Look alive.

443
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,840
Stop picking those up.

444
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,960
Are you going to sell those garbage
for money or what?

445
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,880
Shut up!

446
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,380
What are you waiting for? Just hit it!

447
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,520
Why are you putting your head down?
You keep mumbling beside me.

448
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,260
I can't hit any of them.

449
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,360
What's wrong?

450
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,300
Don't move.
I have to teach you by grabbing your hand.

451
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,500
Your chair...

452
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,380
is too awkward.

453
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,580
Let me find you another chair.

454
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,000
Never mind.

455
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,180
Isn't this better?

456
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,220
Try to feel it.

457
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,620
This is how you handle recoil.

458
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,860
You didn't hit it, either.

459
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,820
It's a mistake.

460
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,680
Don't move.

461
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,220
I'm nervous too.

462
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,460
The phone is ringing.

463
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,340
Why don't you go and answer it?

464
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,120
Hi.

465
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,740
Why must the phone ring at this moment?

466
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,740
Hello, what would you like?

467
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,040
A latte, please.

468
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,740
Extra coffee, extra milk.

469
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,480
We have a promotion right now.

470
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,200
Half price for the second cup,
do you want it?

471
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,620
Not for me. Two cups is too much.

472
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,300
You can share it with your girlfriend.

473
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,480
No, thanks. She's watching her figure.

474
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,760
She's laying off the stuff.

475
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,980
Okay, please wait for a moment.

476
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,120
Yesterday evening, famous musician,
Lin Qi, shared an engagement photo...

477
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,840
of him and his fiancée online.

478
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,280
He announced that their wedding
is coming soon.

479
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,460
Why does everyone in the world
have a partner...

480
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,600
except me?

481
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,280
It is said that Lin Qi's fiancée
was his manager of many years.

482
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,640
Their relationship
was made public three months ago.

483
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,420
In response to the wedding announcement,
friends and colleagues sent their regards.

484
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,620
Lin Qi.

485
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,600
It is said that Lin Qi's fiancée
was his manager of many years.

486
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,000
Their relationship
was made public three months ago.

487
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,820
In response to the wedding announcement,
friends and colleagues sent their regards.

488
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,380
Why are you laughing?

489
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,560
Nothing.

490
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,200
It's Taro.

491
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,600
(Sun Bin Yu)

492
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,660
So annoying.

493
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,160
Hi, what's up?

494
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,280
Where are you, Orange?

495
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,600
I'm at home.

496
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,040
Come to my place at once.

497
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,500
Ms. Ma's in trouble.

498
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,900
Why is Shan Shan there?

499
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,210
Please come over, Ms Ma is drunk.

500
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,160
I can't handle her by myself.

501
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,240
Hang on. I'll be right there.

502
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,160
Bye.

503
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,910
-What's going on?
-I'll explain on the way.

504
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,480
-Where's Shan Shan?
-She's inside.

505
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,600
Shan Shan.

506
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,870
Shan Shan. Shan Shan.

507
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,600
-What happened? Why did she drink so much?
-I have no idea.

508
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,470
The waiter at the bar called
and asked me to go there.

509
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,240
When I arrived, she was already like this.

510
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,020
She even became sworn brothers
with the bottles.

511
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,650
She must've drank a ton.

512
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,210
She's sweating bullets.

513
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,880
Get a glass of water.

514
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,800
Okay.

515
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,660
Why did she drink excessively?

516
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,020
Sun, the hangover soup is ready.

517
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,780
Where is he?

518
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,280
Jing.

519
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,180
-Grandma.
-What are you doing here?

520
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,540
When did you come back?

521
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,780
Just now, Grandma.

522
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,960
-Hello, Grandma.
-Hello.

523
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,760
Is this kid okay?

524
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,180
She's just drunk.
She'll be fine after a good sleep.

525
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,760
Jing, why didn't you answer my calls?

526
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,600
Your father's been looking for you
all day.

527
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,920
He wants to talk to you...

528
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,860
about the matter
of studying abroad next year.

529
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,720
Let's go back, Grandma.

530
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,360
I will explain to you when we go back.

531
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,420
Okay, let her drink the soup
while it's still hot.

532
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,120
You should return your father's call now.

533
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,320
-Otherwise, he's going to be worried.
-Okay.

534
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,620
Settle the study abroad thing first.

535
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,740
Okay, let's go back.

536
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,380
Are you planning to study overseas?

537
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,320
Why didn't you tell me?

538
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,240
I...

539
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,240
I'm sorry.

540
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,500
What do you mean "sorry?"

541
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,880
Sorry...

542
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,700
for not telling you earlier.

543
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,540
So if Grandma hadn't brought it up,

544
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,660
you would've never told me, is that it?

545
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,300
Here's the water.

546
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,320
Here's the water.

547
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,480
Why don't you two go out?

548
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,280
-Okay, Liang Chen.
-Go out, please.

549
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,020
Let's go. Come on.

550
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,320
Come on.

551
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,180
What's the matter?
Did you two have a fight?

552
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,740
She found out
about my plan to study abroad.

553
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,660
Even I know that. You didn't tell her?

554
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,540
I mean, why didn't you let her know?

555
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,420
-I don't think it's necessary.
-You don't think it's necessary?

556
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,460
So I'm the only one who didn't know?

557
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,520
Liang Chen.

558
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,400
Don't just stand there.

559
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,380
Chase her.

560
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,740
Liang Chen!

561
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,560
Sorry, the subscriber you've dialled
is turned off.

562
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,660
Sorry, the subscriber you've dialled
is turned off.

563
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,640
Sorry, the subscriber you've dialled
is turned off.

564
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,050
Sorry, the subscriber you've dialled
is turned off.

565
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:22,080
(Liang Chen)

566
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,240
What's wrong, Ms Liang?

567
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,580
You've changed your clothes already?

568
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,420
Are you okay?

569
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,840
I'm fine.

570
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,141
I didn't sleep well, that's all.

571
00:40:06,221 --> 00:40:07,561
Is something wrong?

572
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,560
Why don't you get up and freshen up?

573
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,500
You have a rehearsal with the band,
remember?

574
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,480
Wear more clothes.
The temperature came down last night.

575
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,300
