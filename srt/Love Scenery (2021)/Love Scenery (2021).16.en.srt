*[Episode 16]

3
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,400
We're here.

4
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,720
Liang Chen.

5
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,960
Where are your manners?

6
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,080
Liang Chen.

7
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,400
It's 'senior'.

8
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,360
Liang Chen.

9
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,520
It's 'senior'.

10
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:57,529
Chen Chen.

11
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:01,891
Just call me Liang Chen.

12
00:02:02,815 --> 00:02:03,681
Liang Chen.

13
00:02:04,145 --> 00:02:04,985
Yeah?

14
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,425
Nothing.

15
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,880
I just wanted to call you.

16
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,000
Have you caught a cold?

17
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:14,529
It's nothing.

18
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,760
No. At this rate,

19
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,760
you'll get sick.

20
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,520
Let's get you checked
at the hospital, come on.

21
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:22,032
That's not necessary.

22
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,440
It's crowded in the hospital.

23
00:02:23,786 --> 00:02:25,546
You're even shy to be treated?

24
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,600
I'm worried that you'd be recognised.

25
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,320
Grandpa and Grandma are out.

26
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,520
Just take a seat.

27
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,800
Do I need to change into slip-ons?

28
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,200
Nah, you're good.

29
00:03:24,929 --> 00:03:26,369
Here, have some hot water.

30
00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:28,186
Thank you.

31
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,320
Do you have any medicine at home?

32
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,520
I'll get you some.

33
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:38,233
There isn't any.

34
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,080
Perhaps, some ginger tea
would do me good.

35
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:45,065
Is there ginger?
I'll make you some ginger tea.

36
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,560
Coming!

37
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,280
Well, aren't you late?

38
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,480
Here to drink dish detergent water?

39
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,160
Shut up.

40
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,960
Do you have any ginger?

41
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,160
Why do you need ginger?

42
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,960
You...

43
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,200
You have a dog now?

44
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,320
It belongs to the little brother
who's my immediate neighbour.

45
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,080
Liang Chen?

46
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,760
Oh, Jia Yun?

47
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,880
Didn't you receive my message on WeChat?

48
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,280
Let me order you some food.

49
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,430
It's okay. I came to get some ginger

50
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,200
to make ginger tea.

51
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,400
What's wrong? Are you unwell?

52
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,320
No.

53
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,760
It's a...

54
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,200
A friend of mine isn't feeling well.

55
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,440
Sure.

56
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,200
Gosh, could things get
more awkward than this?

57
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,560
Come on, let's go.

58
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:48,666
Off we go!

59
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,080
Let's go home.

60
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:52,161
Come on, let's go.

61
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,560
Let me do it.

62
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,596
It's okay. I can manage.

63
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:02,240
Let me do it.

64
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,680
I won't want you to cut your finger.

65
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,920
Thank you, Jia Yun.

66
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,160
Are you seeing that guy?

67
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,800
No.

68
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,520
He's just my junior.

69
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,760
Liang Chen made this?

70
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,880
I made this.

71
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,200
Aren't you unwell?

72
00:06:08,281 --> 00:06:09,241
Drink up.

73
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,880
Although you're rude,

74
00:06:14,553 --> 00:06:15,793
thanks, anyway.

75
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,960
I'd thank you for

76
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:24,841
not troubling Liang Chen.

77
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,960
You won't get the chance to thank me.

78
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,280
I made a bottle of it.

79
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,120
This should last you the night.

80
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,440
Be careful.

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,880
He'd be just fine after
drinking the ginger tea.

82
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,080
Let's go.

83
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,360
Why am I dizzy suddenly?

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,120
Are you okay?

85
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,240
I'm fine, senior.

86
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,760
Just be about your business.

87
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,240
Are you sure?

88
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,520
Rest well, then.

89
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:07,361
Let's go.

90
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
Gosh, you're coughing.

91
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,920
Jia Yun, you go ahead.

92
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,240
I'll stay to care for him.

93
00:07:19,609 --> 00:07:20,449
Okay.

94
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,480
I'll go then.

95
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,810
Pass that to me. I'll hold it.

96
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,001
Has it turned cold?
Here, add some more.

97
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,720
[Happy birthday, Xiao Jing.]

98
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,520
Hope you find a girlfriend soon.

99
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,560
It's your birthday today?

100
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,120
I've turned 22.

101
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:06,865
Happy birthday.

102
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,680
I feel happy today.

103
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,089
*[Somerset]

104
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
[Senior,]

105
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,520
[catch me.]

106
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,840
[Be careful.]

107
00:10:09,729 --> 00:10:11,729
Goodnight, Lu Jing.

108
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:13,328
Goodnight,

109
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,520
Liang Chen.

110
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,160
Ms Liang,

111
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,760
it's almost noon and you're still asleep?

112
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,240
We have a recording in the afternoon.

113
00:11:08,306 --> 00:11:09,946
Get up already!

114
00:11:11,865 --> 00:11:14,105
You hugged a scarf to sleep?

115
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:15,521
Quit being nosy.

116
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,520
What's with your voice?

117
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,000
I think my voice isn't warmed up yet.

118
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,720
Be quick.

119
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,160
Order's up!

120
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,080
Lu Jing, happy birthday.

121
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,720
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

122
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,200
Do you guys even care
to wish me sincerely?

123
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,040
Come on.

124
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,202
Yeah! How rude of us!

125
00:11:50,283 --> 00:11:52,840
A toast to Lu Jing!

126
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,680
Happy birthday!

127
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,960
Here you go.

128
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,240
Thank you.

129
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,440
Hello, Liu Shun.

130
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,120
What's up?

131
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,920
[Lu Jing,]

132
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,080
[that programme you designed]

133
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,200
[has some problems.]

134
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,120
[I can't open some of my work folders.]

135
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,040
[Can you come over and take a look at it?]

136
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,520
There's no class in the afternoon.

137
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,400
I'll be there in a bit.

138
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,120
[Alright. Please be quick.]

139
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,640
Bye-bye.

140
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,360
It's you.

141
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:48,729
Sorry.

142
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,400
It's okay, senior.

143
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,560
You come here too?

144
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,680
I ordered takeaway for my roommate.

145
00:12:58,784 --> 00:13:00,064
Enjoy your meal, senior.

146
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,320
I'm off.

147
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,880
Was she informed that Lu Jing's here,

148
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,960
and made a trip here on purpose?

149
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,080
Lu Jing,

150
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,520
you went out at the wrong timing.

151
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,680
You went out,

152
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,280
and Qi Qi came.

153
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,280
You missed each other.

154
00:13:15,945 --> 00:13:18,065
I bumped into her at the door.

155
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,120
And?

156
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,760
Nothing.

157
00:13:27,353 --> 00:13:28,113
What?

158
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,640
Qi Qi is such a decent girl.

159
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,080
She's ready for you, but you reject it.

160
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,320
Instead, you're into online dating.

161
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,760
How do you know if it's a guy or girl

162
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,400
on the other side?

163
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,040
That's why you're still single.

164
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,960
Hey, what do you mean?

165
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,720
What made you think you can
openly embarrass me like that?

166
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,640
Quit quarrelling.

167
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,840
Did you guys know

168
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,304
Gu Fei Ming and Qi Qi are
growing closer recently?

169
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,720
Isn't he the one who's

170
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,680
cosying up to Qi Qi?

171
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,840
I'm serious.

172
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,040
Gu Fei Ming's been ill
for the past few days.

173
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,680
Qi Qi's been taking care
of him in the hospital.

174
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,320
Ill?

175
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,400
How?

176
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,120
Why would Qi Qi take care of him?

177
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,240
This is why you guys are still single.

178
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,880
Lu Jing,

179
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,440
you better explain yourself!

180
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,360
What made you think we
deserve to be single?

181
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,800
Calm down already.
Sit down.

182
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,080
Listen to me.

183
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,000
That chubby guy

184
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,200
told me,

185
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,600
Gu Fei Ming took a cold bath

186
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,000
in the bedroom to catch a cold.

187
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,200
Gu Fei Ming is a real man.

188
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,720
Admirable.

189
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,040
Boy,

190
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,880
your girlfriend is here to see you again.

191
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,280
Thermometer, please.

192
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,680
Your fever's gone.

193
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,240
You can check-out today.

194
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,560
But, nurse,

195
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,600
I still feel very weak.

196
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,560
Boy,

197
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,600
how could you be weak
with such a strong grip?

198
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,400
Eat up.

199
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,400
It's mixed rice for today?

200
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,080
I've been having rice with
topped dishes for the past few days.

201
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,520
You got me mixed rice today.

202
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:38,289
Yummy.

203
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,520
You're allowed to
check-out of the hospital today.

204
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,480
Does that mean that we can
play the game together?

205
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,720
[Lu Jing,]

206
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,080
[I hate you.]

207
00:15:58,121 --> 00:15:59,521
Is your throat okay?

208
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:00,951
It's a little dry.

209
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:02,393
It's okay.

210
00:16:44,193 --> 00:16:45,193
What a coincidence.

211
00:17:10,945 --> 00:17:12,545
[Why is he here?]

212
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,310
[Could it be he's here just for me?]

213
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,960
[Junior, oh junior.]

214
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,520
[You're a clingy one.]

215
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,440
Senior.

216
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,280
How did you know I'm here?

217
00:17:43,913 --> 00:17:45,433
Senior, don't you know already?

218
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,320
I'm

219
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,720
waiting for you.

220
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,480
Quit joking!

221
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,880
Ms Liang Chen,

222
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,120
here for a work meeting?

223
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,200
Lu Jing,

224
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,840
you're finally here.

225
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,000
That programme is driving me up the wall.

226
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,560
Well, I'm here
to solve your problem.

227
00:18:24,401 --> 00:18:25,201
Senior,

228
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,800
bye.

229
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,760
Ms Liang Chen,

230
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,000
this way, please.

231
00:18:32,081 --> 00:18:33,241
Let's go.

232
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,680
Ms Liang Chen, please give me a minute

233
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,920
while I prepare the info.

234
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,360
Ms Liang,

235
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,880
did you think

236
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,600
that junior came intentionally for you?

237
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,120
Did I say that?

238
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,840
Well, it felt like that.

239
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,320
Then, why were you playing with your hair

240
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,920
and blushing?

241
00:19:06,357 --> 00:19:07,480
Well, you heard it.

242
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,880
He came to tend to the programme

243
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,040
instead of you.

244
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,200
I know.

245
00:19:13,497 --> 00:19:15,137
You look like you have plenty of time.

246
00:19:15,938 --> 00:19:17,018
Get me coffee.

247
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:18,689
Okay.

248
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,000
Gosh, what have I done?

249
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,560
I blushed

250
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,360
and played with my hair.

251
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,920
He must think that I'm crazy.

252
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,160
My gosh.

253
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,000
What have I done?
This is embarrassing!

254
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,490
We'll talk later.

255
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,280
Jia Yun.

256
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,120
I apologise.

257
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,120
You must have waited for long.

258
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,520
It's okay. I just arrived.

259
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,840
It was bumper-to-bumper.

260
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,000
Time's ticking.

261
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,080
Let's get down to
discussing the play script.

262
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,240
Okay.

263
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,880
Where are you taking me?

264
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,120
I'm looking for an empty meeting room.

265
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:57,690
Here.

266
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,440
This meeting room is yours.

267
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,680
I have things to attend to.
I'm off.

268
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,960
-Okay.
-I'll be back later.

269
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,880
The first segment looks okay.

270
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,880
We'll speak more on the
details on the actual stage.

271
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,320
But, it's this segment that

272
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,560
the presenter plays a crucial role.

273
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
The interaction with the audience could be

274
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,640
a little more interesting
at the live stage.

275
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,600
What do you think?

276
00:20:24,747 --> 00:20:25,547
Sure.

277
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,240
[Senior, why are you looking at me]

278
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,440
[instead of the script?]

279
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,440
Okay.

280
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,520
Let's move on to the second segment.

281
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,440
Remove these two questions
for the Q&A segment.

282
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,160
They are not related to the theme.

283
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,480
I suggest adding some

284
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:07,601
question that are work-related.

285
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,200
Such as, questions related to our movie,

286
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,840
mentioning the original intentions
of filming this movie.

287
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,520
What do you think?

288
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,920
[Looks like I'm more interesting to
look at compared to the script.]

289
00:21:20,858 --> 00:21:21,858
You okay?

290
00:21:23,704 --> 00:21:25,664
Yeah.
I just find that question exceptional.

291
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,240
Okay.

292
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,880
For the scenes,

293
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,720
we should discuss

294
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,880
if we should use

295
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,200
themes that promote
traditional Chinese culture.

296
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,560
Liang Chen,

297
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,120
what do you think?

298
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,640
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

299
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,760
You've been coughing.

300
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,240
Are you unwell?

301
00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:15,154
Why don't we record the mock-up tomorrow?

302
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,160
It's okay.

303
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,080
It should be fine.

304
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,840
Liang Chen's voice sounds so good.

305
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,280
It's alright.

306
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,240
She sounds a little tired.

307
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,840
Are you okay?

308
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:12,233
Why don't you rest?

309
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,480
I'm fine.

310
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,440
Let's continue.

311
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,320
Okay.

312
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,400
Liang Chen, are you alright?

313
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,200
Something is wrong with my throat.

314
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,840
Why don't you see the doctor?

315
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,520
I think you should.

316
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,840
Leave this to me.

317
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,480
I'll give Liu Yi Qing a call.

318
00:23:43,177 --> 00:23:44,377
Thank you, Jia Yun.

319
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,520

320

Hello.

321
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,440
Hello. What happened?

322
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,040
I must be too tired.

323
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,240
My voice is affected.

324
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,480
Have you gone to the hospital?

325
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,040
I'm on my way there.

326
00:24:47,145 --> 00:24:48,185
Which hospital is that?

327
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,200
[It's fine. My assistant is with me.]

328
00:24:50,777 --> 00:24:51,737
Don't worry.

329
00:24:51,856 --> 00:24:53,016
It's nothing serious.

330
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,120

00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,760
I'll go get her.

You need to take the surgery.

383
00:31:21,695 --> 00:31:23,080
You're a singer.

384
00:31:23,802 --> 00:31:25,762
You'd be using your voice regularly.

So, there is a higher risk
for the polyp to turn

386

cancerous compared to non-singers.
