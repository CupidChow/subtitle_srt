00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,240
[I'm asking]

4
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,781
[where are you now?]

5
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,760
Chen,

6
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,320
are you suffering from hypoxia?

7
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:55,071
Your face is so red.

8
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,894
My goodness!

9
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,040
It's too hot here in the lift.

10
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,880
Is there no ventilation system?

11
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,400
Is it hot?

12
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,280
It is.

13
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
[I'm in Shanghai.]

14
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:17,895
[Why are you in Shanghai?]

15
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,920
[It's a work trip.]

16
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:20,973
[Okay.]

17
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,280
[I probably won't have time
to use the computer.]

18
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,839
Work hard, Little Box.

19
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,541
Chen, who is the guy that you're
reporting your itinerary to?

20
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,960
Stop talking nonsense.

21
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:49,998
Why aren't you coming in?

22
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,880
I almost lost the place I occupied.

23
00:02:54,398 --> 00:02:55,518
Senior Lu Jing!

24
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,346
Where are you going?

25
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,240
To the washroom.

26
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,079
Senior Zhou Zhou,

27
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,560
why did Senior Lu Jing leave?

28
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,320
He's in a hurry to
get back and do research.

29
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:09,715
What is he researching?

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,639
Why are you so concerned about
Senior Lu Jing?

31
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
You care about him too.

32
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,600
I...

33
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,200
I wish to make progress
together with him.

34
00:03:40,078 --> 00:03:41,998
Did the sun rise from the west today?

35
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,639
Unexpectedly, Jing is on his phone.

36
00:03:43,842 --> 00:03:45,119
He's not even writing code

37
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,320
or looking for bugs.

38
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,160
I finished all of them.

39
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,120
No bug is found.

40
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,160
We admire you.

41
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,560
Oh, right!

42
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,680
Why aren't you guiding Spirit Box today?

43
00:03:54,077 --> 00:03:55,045
She is busy.

44
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,239
Brother Jing,

45
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,559
it's been a long time
since you practised with us.

46
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,480
Right!

47
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,040
Organize some activities.

48
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,080
How about unboxing?

49
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,080
Where is the strength?

50
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,640
Up there, up there!

51
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,240
Alright! I'll play one round
with you guys

52
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,000
to loosen up
after finishing my homework.

53
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,760
This is the rehearsal rundown
for the program tomorrow.

54
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,760
You are the first to go on stage.

55
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,720
and Mr Jia Yun is the last.

56
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,360
What else do you want to adjust?

58

59
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,760
Can we change the song?

60
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,961
Why do you want to change the song?

61
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,680
I'm weary of singing this song.

62
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,160
Which song do you want to sing?

63
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,040
I'll talk with them.

64
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,640
I'm not sure.
I'll tell you later.

65
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,320
Okay.

66
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,520
It's really fun to play
with Brother Jing!

67
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,160
It's really boring to
do tasks with you guys.

68
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:37,797
The most stimulating moment is here!

69
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,360
Hold on! Let me wash my hand first.

70
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,720
So grim.

71
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,440
There's nothing here!

72
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,519
Same here.

73
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,200
There's no equipment either.

74
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,480
I told you guys to wash your hands.

75
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,000
Use 20 years of Liu's single life

76
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,148
to exchange for the best equipment.
Open!

77
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,720

My youth has been wasted.

78
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:06,165
You're the one who's unlucky.
Don't blame the program.

79
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,640
Open yours then, Mr Confident.

80
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,160
This flamboyant special effects
is the best equipment?

81
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,640
Have my good energy!

82
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,720
Quick, open it and see what it is!

83
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,040
It's actually a skirt.

84
00:06:31,332 --> 00:06:32,772
I feel better now.

85
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,840
What's wrong with a skirt?

86
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,640
It looks pretty good.

87
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:39,079
Do you think it suits
the image of your character

88
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,520
which is 1.9m tall?

89
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,800

Ke Ke, what song do you think
I should sing this time?

92
00:07:09,989 --> 00:07:11,709
Just sing the song that your fans like.

93
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,000
The song that my fans like.

94
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,040
The live fans.

[I like all of them,]

99
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,320
[but if I have to choose,
I'll pick the new song.]

100
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,280
[Why?]

101
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,400
[Because of anticipation.]

102
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,840
[Feel it.]

103
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,120
I get it.

104
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,600
Chen, what is it you get?

105
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,480
I know which song my fans
would like me to sing.

106
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,560
They like my new song.

107
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,320
But you don't have any
completed new song now.

108
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:13,606
I can recompose them.

109
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,280
Where is my computer?

110
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,480

[I'll send you something.]

114
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,720
Is it a present for me
from your work trip?

115
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,230
[I guess so.
Do you want it?]

116
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,760
Forget it! I have done
nothing to deserve it.

117
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,360
[What do you mean?]

118
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,440
[You led me to develop from a newbie]

119
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,560

[You deserve much credit!]

121
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,640
You might need to give me

122
00:10:01,911 --> 00:10:04,031
a villa, if you said so.

123
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,040

Never thought it'd
become the boys' dorm now.

00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,360
Let's go!
I'll give you a tour of the girls' dorm.

131
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,440
This building used to be

132
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,200
brimming with creativity.

133
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,199
Come to think of it,

134
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,880

when I was in school.

No way! What a coincidence!

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,840
This was my table.

So you were the one

143
00:13:19,348 --> 00:13:20,775
who wrote those words on the wall.

144
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,415
I passed the exam long ago.

145
00:13:25,496 --> 00:13:29,056
Why hasn't the school repainted
this wall after so many years?

146
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,825
What about your room-mates?

147
00:13:34,025 --> 00:13:35,225
Do you know Ma Shan Shan?

00:13:36,105 --> 00:13:39,079
The one who debuted as comedic Garfield

149
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,240
was my room-mate.

150
00:13:41,425 --> 00:13:42,225
Then?

151
00:13:43,745 --> 00:13:45,585
She was in the school modelling team

152
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:47,865
before I graduated university.

153
00:14:47,305 --> 00:14:49,305

154
00:15:08,225 --> 00:15:10,225
I never thought such a coincidence
could happen.

00:15:46,065 --> 00:15:46,865
Lu Jing,

157
00:15:47,384 --> 00:15:48,664
why are you facing the wall?

158
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:53,958
It's nothing.

159
00:16:08,705 --> 00:16:09,545
Brother Jing,

160
00:16:09,785 --> 00:16:11,545
can I discuss something with you?

161
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,482
Say it.

162
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:18,334
Can you give me the skirt?

163
00:16:18,705 --> 00:16:19,505
Why?

164
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,945
I think the skirt is
particularly beautiful

165
00:16:22,145 --> 00:16:23,305
and it is an ultimate gift for girls.

166
00:16:29,465 --> 00:16:31,425
I think you make a good point.

167
00:16:36,185 --> 00:16:36,985
Good luck!

168
00:16:38,505 --> 00:16:40,145
What do you mean?

169
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:42,687
Since it's a present,

170
00:16:43,408 --> 00:16:45,145
it'll be more sincere
to obtain it yourself.

171
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:47,785
You're really stingy!

172
00:17:02,865 --> 00:17:04,745
How can this song be changed like this?

173
00:17:05,144 --> 00:17:06,984
What is this? It's such a mess!

174
00:17:07,065 --> 00:17:08,425
The original version is better.

175
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:12,705
For me, it's more sure-footed to
sing the original version.

176
00:17:14,345 --> 00:17:17,185
She has been trying to change
these days.

177
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,160
Do you want to drink milk tea?

178
00:17:57,225 --> 00:17:58,025
Yes.

179
00:17:58,432 --> 00:17:59,391
How about you, Lu Jing?

What on earth is in your phone?

183
00:18:12,784 --> 00:18:14,344
Did someone send you red packets?

184
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:16,705
No, I'll go back to dorm first.

185
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:23,305
I think there's something
wrong with Lu Jing.

186
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:25,865
No, isn't he usually like this?

187
00:18:26,025 --> 00:18:28,145
He has been staring
at his phone the whole day.

188
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:29,345
Was he like this before?

189
00:18:29,545 --> 00:18:31,985
He even smiled at the wall
this morning.

190
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:32,878
Really?

191
00:18:33,185 --> 00:18:36,225
Don't forget that he had drunk before.

192
00:18:37,745 --> 00:18:38,745
I know what's going on.

193
00:18:38,825 --> 00:18:41,143
Is Lu Jing trading stocks?

194
00:18:41,225 --> 00:18:43,505
That's why he feels ups and downs.

195
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:50,185
Don't go.
Did I say anything wrong?

196
00:19:02,945 --> 00:19:04,385
Chen, something's wrong.

197
00:19:06,305 --> 00:19:08,425
Chen, this is bad.

198
00:19:10,102 --> 00:19:12,319
-What is?
-The video of your rehearsal got out.

199
00:19:12,927 --> 00:19:15,327
How is it? Is it particularly great?

200
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,750
No, the Internet has gone crazy.

201
00:19:20,736 --> 00:19:22,095
[Is this Liang Chen?]

202
00:19:22,185 --> 00:19:23,785
[Why is there a vast diversity
in her style?]

203
00:19:23,943 --> 00:19:25,583
[Her agency is to blame.]

204
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,384
[Don't they know
the positioning of Liang Chen?]

205
00:19:27,465 --> 00:19:29,385
[Liang Chen doesn't fit this style.]

206
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,440
[I support our Orange to make changes.]

207
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:32,465
[Chen Chen, you can do this!]

208
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,560
[Wake up, Liang Chen!]

209
00:19:34,646 --> 00:19:36,086
[Please don't insult rock.]

210
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:39,665
Are you still planning
to sing this song now?

211
00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:45,305
This is only the fans' opinion.

212
00:19:45,865 --> 00:19:46,665
Okay.

213
00:19:47,465 --> 00:19:48,505
I'll try my best to

214
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:49,945
fight for you if you insist to.

215
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,260
You don't have to care
about what happens on the Internet,

216
00:19:51,345 --> 00:19:52,185
I'll handle it.

217
00:19:52,385 --> 00:19:53,585
Thank you, Ms Qing.

218
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:03,865
Hello, Jia Yun.

219
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:04,825
[Hello, Liang Chen.]

220
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:06,505
I saw your rehearsal.

221
00:20:07,025 --> 00:20:09,025
Your version of the song is not bad.

222
00:20:09,711 --> 00:20:10,951
Thank you, Jia Yun.

223
00:20:11,265 --> 00:20:13,065
Don't read the comments on the Internet.

224
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,225
[The audience need some time to accept]

225
00:20:15,305 --> 00:20:16,465
[your change after all.]

226
00:20:17,025 --> 00:20:17,985
[Take your time.]

227
00:20:18,945 --> 00:20:19,745
I understand.

228
00:20:21,425 --> 00:20:22,225
Liang Chen,

229
00:20:23,385 --> 00:20:24,425
I...

230
00:20:25,105 --> 00:20:26,782
I think it's better to sing
the original version

231
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,159
on the show tomorrow.

232
00:20:28,705 --> 00:20:29,865
It'll be safer that way.

233
00:20:30,665 --> 00:20:33,665
[It is premature for you to change now.]

234
00:20:37,785 --> 00:20:40,505
Okay, I'll give serious
consideration to it.

235
00:20:42,745 --> 00:20:43,545
Bye bye.

236
00:20:53,427 --> 00:20:54,747
You guys may go back first.

237
00:20:54,825 --> 00:20:56,865
I need some time alone.

238
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:59,657
Alright, rest well then.

239
00:20:59,865 --> 00:21:01,105
Don't overthink.

240
00:21:58,625 --> 00:21:59,425
[Are you busy?]

241
00:22:02,385 --> 00:22:03,185
[Not really.]

242
00:22:06,465 --> 00:22:07,305
[Are you in a bad mood?]

243
00:22:09,345 --> 00:22:10,905
[How do you know that?]

244
00:22:13,585 --> 00:22:15,225
[I can feel it conversing with you.]

245
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,065
[I'll show you something interesting.]

246
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,070
[Don't be depressed.]

247
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:46,351
[Just try to fix it if there's a problem.]

248
00:22:52,465 --> 00:22:55,025
[What if I can't fix it?]

249
00:22:58,345 --> 00:22:59,825
[If you still can't fix it
after making efforts,]

250
00:23:00,185 --> 00:23:01,465
[just take a break then.]

251
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,225
Chen,

252
00:23:35,345 --> 00:23:36,904
the production team
has rushed us several times.

253
00:23:36,985 --> 00:23:38,105
You need to make a decision.

254
00:23:55,825 --> 00:23:57,145
What will Liang Chen sing today?

255
00:23:58,065 --> 00:24:00,985
Don't tell me that it's the song
she sang yesterday.

256
00:24:06,265 --> 00:24:07,745
[Is Liang Chen going down the drain?]

257
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,545
[Why is she dabbling in rock music?]

258
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,360
[Liang Chen's voice is
totally unfit for rock music.]

259
00:24:12,425 --> 00:24:13,505
[It's an awful arrangement.]

260
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:14,905
[She even dared to sing it.]

261
00:24:14,985 --> 00:24:15,785
[If you're not gifted,]

262
00:24:15,865 --> 00:24:17,985
[just keep your nose clean
and sing your love songs.]

263
00:24:27,905 --> 00:24:29,144
Ms Qing, I'm so glad that

264
00:24:29,225 --> 00:24:30,224
Chen is singing the original version.

265
00:24:30,305 --> 00:24:31,905
Finally, I don't have to work overtime.

266
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:36,425
Ms Qing, what's wrong?

267
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:40,065
I don't know why.

268
00:24:40,863 --> 00:24:42,663
I actually feel some loss.

269
00:26:23,585 --> 00:26:25,585
See, it's better to sing
the original version.

270
00:26:25,705 --> 00:26:26,784
You had me worried sick.

271
00:26:26,865 --> 00:26:28,465
I was so worried
you'd sing the new version.

272
00:26:28,785 --> 00:26:29,585
Ke Ke,

273
00:26:30,027 --> 00:26:30,958
go do your work.

274
00:26:34,158 --> 00:26:34,998
Drink some warm water.

275
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:41,825
Don't stress yourself out.

276
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,320
It's me who overestimated myself.

277
00:26:46,945 --> 00:26:48,345
I'm not well-prepared

278
00:26:48,705 --> 00:26:50,105
to make brand new attempts.

279
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,465
Do you think that I'm terrible?

280
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:54,745
No.

281
00:26:55,399 --> 00:26:57,079
I think you're really brave.

282
00:26:57,942 --> 00:27:00,222
At least, you already tried to change.

283
00:27:00,678 --> 00:27:02,438
No such thing can be achieved overnight.

284
00:27:09,465 --> 00:27:10,265
Hello.

285
00:27:19,865 --> 00:27:20,781
It was good.

286
00:27:21,344 --> 00:27:22,744
It's true, I saw it.

287
00:27:24,465 --> 00:27:26,185
Let's have dinner together
after completing the show.

288
00:27:27,531 --> 00:27:28,237
Okay.

289
00:27:28,305 --> 00:27:29,825
I haven't had a proper meal

290
00:27:29,905 --> 00:27:31,225
since I had been busy rehearsing.

291
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:34,705
I booked a restaurant. You'll like it.

292
00:27:36,025 --> 00:27:37,185
Boss, it's our turn soon.

293
00:27:37,265 --> 00:27:38,065
Okay.

294
00:27:38,465 --> 00:27:39,515
Then, I'll go first.

295
00:28:05,385 --> 00:28:06,369
Guess what this is.

296
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,145
I'll give you a hint, 7th of November.

297
00:28:10,486 --> 00:28:12,046
Have you thought of anything?

298
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:16,385
Data Mining Competition.

299
00:28:16,865 --> 00:28:19,025
What? The competition is on that day?

300
00:28:19,745 --> 00:28:20,585
What should I do then?

301
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:22,424
I managed to get two

302
00:28:22,505 --> 00:28:24,865
tickets of Liang Chen's birthday fan meet.

303
00:28:25,905 --> 00:28:27,865
The competition takes place every year

304
00:28:28,225 --> 00:28:29,384
but we can't get

305
00:28:29,465 --> 00:28:31,315
these tickets every time.

306
00:28:31,385 --> 00:28:32,545
We must go to the competition.

307
00:28:34,678 --> 00:28:35,638
Then, I'll go on my own.

308
00:28:36,345 --> 00:28:37,145
Alright.

309
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,865
Then, you'll have to do revision
by your own

310
00:28:38,945 --> 00:28:40,225
in the following final exams.

311
00:28:40,305 --> 00:28:41,105
You...

312
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,880
*[Face ID]

313
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,600
*[Unlock with Face ID
or enter passcode]

314
00:29:24,338 --> 00:29:27,355
Ke Ke, why did you
change my wallpaper again?

315
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:28,722
I didn't change it.

316
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,783
Isn't your phone here with me?

317
00:29:34,585 --> 00:29:36,465
Whose phone is this then?

318
00:29:39,265 --> 00:29:41,585
Ms Chen, did you see my boss's phone?

319
00:29:43,385 --> 00:29:44,825
Is it this?

320
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:48,824
Yes, it is.

321
00:29:48,905 --> 00:29:49,705
Thank you, Ms Chen.

322
00:29:50,367 --> 00:29:51,247
Zhu Guang,

323
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:54,425
when is Jia Yun's birthday?

324
00:29:55,065 --> 00:29:56,825
December 24. Why?

325
00:29:58,705 --> 00:29:59,505
Nothing.

326
00:30:00,225 --> 00:30:01,117
Then, I'll leave first.

327
00:30:01,185 --> 00:30:01,985
Goodbye, Ms Chen.

328
00:30:16,705 --> 00:30:18,905
What was our record last time?

329
00:30:19,065 --> 00:30:20,225
Thirty.

330
00:30:21,225 --> 00:30:22,665
We are going to break the record.

331
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:24,745
Brothers, give it your all.

332
00:30:24,945 --> 00:30:25,825
We can do this.

333
00:30:35,265 --> 00:30:36,585
[Let me ask you a question.]

334
00:30:35,462 --> 00:30:37,142
*[Let me ask you a question.]

335
00:30:37,222 --> 00:30:38,782
*[Go ahead.]

336
00:30:37,345 --> 00:30:38,145
[Go ahead.]

337
00:30:42,622 --> 00:30:45,182
*[If you set a girl's birthday
as your phone passcode,]

338
00:30:42,705 --> 00:30:44,185
[If you set a girl's birthday]

339
00:30:44,265 --> 00:30:45,305
[as your phone passcode,]

340
00:30:45,262 --> 00:30:48,582
*[does it mean that you like her?]

341
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,825
[does it mean that you like her?]

342
00:30:48,662 --> 00:30:54,702
*[It could be that she's my mother.]

343
00:30:48,705 --> 00:30:50,625
[It could be that she's my mother.]

344
00:31:02,505 --> 00:31:05,065
Slow down! Stop shaking!

345
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:06,505
Fantastic!

346
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:08,545
We are going to succeed!

347
00:31:08,665 --> 00:31:10,785
One piece to go to break the record.

348
00:31:11,063 --> 00:31:12,703
Lu Jing, you do it.

349
00:31:13,425 --> 00:31:14,425
You do it.

350
00:31:16,422 --> 00:31:18,342
*[Who set your birthday as the passcode?]

351
00:31:16,505 --> 00:31:17,945
[Who set your birthday as the passcode?]

352
00:31:25,065 --> 00:31:28,145
[No, it happened to a friend of mine.]

353
00:31:25,182 --> 00:31:29,342
*[No, it happened to a friend of mine.]

354
00:31:31,665 --> 00:31:32,865
Friend?

355
00:31:33,505 --> 00:31:34,305
Brother Jing.

356
00:31:35,288 --> 00:31:36,088
Brother Jing!

357
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:48,585
She couldn't even lie.

358
00:31:52,465 --> 00:31:54,265
Liang Chen, let's go.

359
00:31:56,025 --> 00:31:59,265
Jia Yun, I'm not feeling well
all of the sudden.

360
00:31:59,345 --> 00:32:00,385
I'm sorry.

361
00:32:00,825 --> 00:32:02,745
What's wrong?
Do you need a ride to the hospital?

362
00:32:02,825 --> 00:32:03,625
No.

363
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,599
It'll be fine for me to go home
and have a rest.

364
00:32:08,505 --> 00:32:09,305
It's okay.

365
00:32:16,265 --> 00:32:17,505
How about we start it all over again?

366
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:21,665
I quit. I'm going to play basketball.

367
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:29,816
What's wrong with him again?

368
00:32:30,345 --> 00:32:31,145
Bad mood?

369
00:32:31,585 --> 00:32:32,385
Do you know why?

370
00:32:36,145 --> 00:32:37,105
Let's go take a look.

371
00:32:37,185 --> 00:32:38,145
We could play too.

372
00:32:38,225 --> 00:32:39,025
Let's go.

373
00:32:39,545 --> 00:32:40,505
Go, go, go.

374
00:33:01,185 --> 00:33:02,345
They are fully occupied.

375
00:33:02,665 --> 00:33:04,425
Forget it. Let's head back
and write codes.

376
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,945
Gu Fei Ming, do you want to join us?

377
00:33:09,118 --> 00:33:10,478
Are you really that desperate?

378
00:33:11,705 --> 00:33:12,785
I don't want to write codes.

379
00:33:16,678 --> 00:33:17,518
What do you want?

380
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:19,159
How about a bullfight?

381
00:33:20,905 --> 00:33:21,705
Deal!

382
00:33:35,705 --> 00:33:37,345
I'm starving to death.
My goodness.

383
00:33:45,265 --> 00:33:47,385
Master, are you there?

384
00:33:55,145 --> 00:33:55,985
Nice shot!

385
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:01,465
Nice! Nice!

386
00:34:01,545 --> 00:34:02,705
Nice shot!

387
00:34:10,225 --> 00:34:12,705
Nice shot!

388
00:34:34,665 --> 00:34:35,505
Chen,

389
00:34:35,705 --> 00:34:37,464
are you sure it's alright

390
00:34:37,545 --> 00:34:38,945
to eat like this?

391
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:41,574
I tell you what.

392
00:34:42,257 --> 00:34:43,457
You need to
clean them up later.

393
00:34:43,545 --> 00:34:44,865
Don't get caught by Ms Qing.

394
00:34:49,825 --> 00:34:51,163
Let me use the toilet first.

395
00:34:51,225 --> 00:34:52,185
I'll continue later.

396
00:35:10,905 --> 00:35:12,265
Why hasn't he replied yet?

397
00:35:29,265 --> 00:35:30,625
Stop, enough.

398
00:35:31,305 --> 00:35:32,185
You guys win.

399
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,240
Let me rest for a while.

400
00:35:45,502 --> 00:35:50,702
*[Master, are you there?]

401
00:35:46,345 --> 00:35:48,425
[Master, are you there?]

402
00:35:52,425 --> 00:35:53,225
I'm here.

403
00:35:53,305 --> 00:35:54,985
Ten minutes, wait for me.

404
00:36:39,065 --> 00:36:41,945
Ke Ke, the milk tea is here.
Open the door.

405
00:36:42,945 --> 00:36:45,545
I still need some time.

406
00:36:47,025 --> 00:36:47,945
Fine, I'll open it.

407
00:36:53,425 --> 00:36:54,225
Coming!

408
00:37:06,262 --> 00:37:07,102
*[Thousand Years Box Spirit]

409
00:37:23,505 --> 00:37:25,025
Ke Ke bought these.

410
00:37:25,545 --> 00:37:26,945
I don't want to eat but she made me to.

411
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:30,545
She said I won't suffer from
stomachache after eating these.

412
00:37:33,865 --> 00:37:36,157
Then, do you still want
the porridge and medicine

413
00:37:36,225 --> 00:37:37,274
that I bought for you?

414
00:37:39,705 --> 00:37:40,505
Sure.

415
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:43,265
Thank you, Jia Yun.

416
00:37:45,105 --> 00:37:46,985
Do you want to come in and have a sit?

417
00:37:47,344 --> 00:37:49,344
No, you need to get some rest.

418
00:37:49,425 --> 00:37:50,865
I'll go now.

419
00:38:25,945 --> 00:38:27,265
What is this?

420
00:38:28,865 --> 00:38:30,265
It's from Jia Yun.

421
00:38:31,865 --> 00:38:34,425
Mr Jia Yun is being so nice to you.

422
00:38:35,385 --> 00:38:36,185
Ke Ke,

423
00:38:36,265 --> 00:38:38,117
do you think I gave Jia Yun

424
00:38:38,185 --> 00:38:39,345
the wrong idea?

425
00:38:39,665 --> 00:38:40,596
About what?

426
00:38:41,825 --> 00:38:42,745
Nothing.

427
00:38:50,902 --> 00:38:53,902
*[I got caught up just now. I'm sorry.]

428
00:38:50,985 --> 00:38:52,905
[I got caught up just now. I'm sorry.]

429
00:39:09,382 --> 00:39:16,582
*[I got caught up just now. I'm sorry.]

430
00:39:10,985 --> 00:39:12,865
[I got caught up just now. I'm sorry.]

431
00:39:16,465 --> 00:39:17,265
[Oh.]

432
00:39:27,022 --> 00:39:29,022
*[When are you coming back?]

433
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,400
[When are you coming back?]

434
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,000
What does he mean?

435
00:39:48,982 --> 00:39:50,622
*[What do you mean?]

436
00:39:49,105 --> 00:39:50,265
[What do you mean?]

437
00:39:52,582 --> 00:39:55,262
*[I analyzed meteorological map
in recent hours]

438
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:53,985
[I analysed the meteorological map]

439
00:39:54,065 --> 00:39:55,105

441
00:39:55,342 --> 00:39:57,022
*[and ran a forecasting
model of rainstorm.]

442
00:39:57,102 --> 00:40:03,782
*[The probability of having rainstorms in
Shanghai next week is up to 83 percent.]

443
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:59,025
[The probability of having rainstorms
in Shanghai next week]

444
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,465
[is up to 83 percent.]

445
00:40:00,705 --> 00:40:02,985
What is that?
Can't he just watch the weather forecast?

446
00:40:04,262 --> 00:40:07,062
*[So what?]

447
00:40:04,545 --> 00:40:05,865
[So what?]

448
00:40:07,142 --> 00:40:10,822
*[Stay safe when you're on the way back.]

449
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,000
[Stay safe when you're on the way back.]

450
00:40:10,902 --> 00:40:13,742

[I'll go back tomorrow.]

454
00:40:19,665 --> 00:40:21,865
Ke Ke, let's go back tomorrow.

455
00:40:23,865 --> 00:40:25,185
We still have job to do on tomorrow.

456
00:40:25,265 --> 00:40:26,865
The job may not be finished
until afternoon.

457
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:30,225
We'll go back after finishing the job.

458
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:31,105
That's right.

459
00:40:32,945 --> 00:40:33,958
Alright.
