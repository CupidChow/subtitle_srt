00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,910
[Episode 20]

2
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,920
[The false statement about
Liang Chen's tumultuous]

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,480
[private life was posted maliciously
on the Internet recently.]

4
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,840
[Our company will reserve
the right to pursue]

5
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,280
[corresponding legal liability
through legal means.]

6
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,280
[Please do not believe
or spread the rumours.]

7
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,480
Did you guys see that shining tree?

8
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
I think

9
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:19,977
Gu Fei Ming still likes Qi Qi.

10
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,160
Then it's over.

11
00:02:22,626 --> 00:02:24,306
Lu Jing will definitely
see it after class.

12
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:26,360
No wonder Lu Jing got angry.

13
00:02:26,721 --> 00:02:28,508
They must be fighting because of this.

14
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,720
What is Lu Jing going to do?

15
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,120
What do you mean?

16
00:02:41,107 --> 00:02:41,922
Lu Jing,

17
00:02:42,097 --> 00:02:44,977
you didn't see anything
on your way back here?

18
00:02:45,928 --> 00:02:46,820
What?

19
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,040
The one that Gu Fei Ming gave Qi Qi...

20
00:02:51,382 --> 00:02:52,300
I saw it.

21
00:02:53,785 --> 00:02:54,585
Well,

22
00:02:55,874 --> 00:02:56,899
don't be too sad.

23
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,520
Why would I be sad?

24
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,480
He speaks with a forked tongue

25
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,240
and forces a smile.

26
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,600
Forget it, I'm a hopeless student.

27
00:03:30,372 --> 00:03:31,109
You go take a look.

28
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,240
Jia Yun, I heard it from Zhu Guang that

29
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:49,953
you guys have to
close down the production

30
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:51,297
as there were many reporters
on the set today.

31
00:03:53,362 --> 00:03:54,962
I'm really sorry about it.

32
00:03:57,218 --> 00:03:58,778
It's alright. I can handle it.

33
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:02,209
I'm more worried about you.

34
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:15,746
It's so suffocating.

35
00:04:17,186 --> 00:04:18,266
You guys have no idea.

36
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:21,106
Everyone is staring at me on my way here.

37
00:04:21,306 --> 00:04:23,226
My heart can't handle this.

38
00:04:23,617 --> 00:04:24,346
With your outfit,

39
00:04:24,426 --> 00:04:25,586
it would be strange if
no one stared at you.

40
00:04:25,713 --> 00:04:26,633
Really?

41
00:04:28,026 --> 00:04:29,386
Taro, I'm sorry.

42
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:33,946
Eat more.

43
00:04:35,346 --> 00:04:36,306
It's fine.

44
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:39,066
It can be regarded as
experiencing the feeling of

45
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:40,186
becoming the trending topic.

46
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:41,266
It feels not bad.

47
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,106
Thank you.

48
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,100
[Lu Jing]

49
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:02,706
You don't look very well.

50
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:05,386
Did you not rest well
because of this matter?

51
00:05:05,626 --> 00:05:07,466
It's all too sudden

52
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:09,386
and I never thought that

53
00:05:10,146 --> 00:05:11,506
this would hurt so many people.

54
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:15,746
I find you are particularly worried.

55
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:19,066
Is there something else going on?

56
00:05:25,306 --> 00:05:26,146
Orange,

57
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,226
what are you going to
do about this matter?

58
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,500
[Lu Jing]

59
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,720
[Lu Jing]

60
00:05:57,026 --> 00:05:57,986
Hello, what's wrong?

61
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,386
[Taro, do you know where Liang Chen is?]

62
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:02,266
Why don't you ask her?

63
00:06:02,347 --> 00:06:03,547
Why are you asking me?

64
00:06:03,986 --> 00:06:05,226
[She didn't answer my call.]

65
00:06:08,386 --> 00:06:09,666
Let me ask her for you.

66
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:11,266
I'm going to the washroom.

67
00:06:15,011 --> 00:06:16,691
This... I...

68
00:06:18,506 --> 00:06:20,066
I'll call you back later.

69
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:46,666
Thank you.

70
00:06:56,746 --> 00:06:59,386
Ding, are you sure you want to do this?

71
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,026
Calm down.

72
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,386
Aren't you afraid that Orange
will get angry if she knows it?

73
00:07:08,586 --> 00:07:09,946
I only have this chance.

74
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,226
Good morning.

75
00:07:58,226 --> 00:08:00,106
I brought you breakfast. Have some of it.

76
00:08:12,466 --> 00:08:14,266
Chen Chen, take a look.

77
00:08:17,586 --> 00:08:19,186
What happened after I had a sleep?

78
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,786
So-called the second wave
with concrete proof.

79
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:25,626
Meng Lan Zhi, this person,

80
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:27,929
really doesn't give up.

81
00:08:28,546 --> 00:08:30,386
The trend on the Internet
has also changed.

82
00:08:30,866 --> 00:08:32,546
It points on you and Ding Jia Yun.

83
00:08:42,496 --> 00:08:44,626
Why do I think Liang Chen and Ding Jia Yun

84
00:08:44,706 --> 00:08:45,866
really are having
romantic relationship?

85
00:08:46,466 --> 00:08:47,666
Look at this photo.

86
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:49,626
Are they really having relationship?

87
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:53,520
They really do make a glamorous couple.

88
00:08:54,306 --> 00:08:55,946
Why don't they just

89
00:08:56,026 --> 00:08:57,346
be together?

90
00:09:01,146 --> 00:09:02,466
Take a look.

91
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:04,706
Why aren't you interested at

92
00:09:04,786 --> 00:09:05,986
Liang Chen's gossip?

93
00:09:06,626 --> 00:09:07,586
Where are you going?

94
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:08,746
I'm going to get an answer.

95
00:09:09,626 --> 00:09:10,345
From who?

96
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:11,137
Gu...

97
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:11,905
Fei...

98
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:12,706
Ming!

99
00:09:42,386 --> 00:09:43,066
Hello.

100
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,931
[Lu Jing, it's me.]

101
00:09:45,346 --> 00:09:47,906
[I just heard a big news.]

102
00:09:48,146 --> 00:09:49,626
[You know the recent scandal between]

103
00:09:49,706 --> 00:09:50,866
[Liang Chen and Ding Jia Yun, right?]

104
00:09:50,946 --> 00:09:52,866
[They seem to be together for real.]

105
00:09:53,386 --> 00:09:55,866
[I heard that Ding Jia Yun
asked the reporters]

106
00:09:55,946 --> 00:09:57,146
[to go to Zijing Club.]

107
00:09:57,226 --> 00:09:59,186
[Seems like they are going to
announce their relationship.]

108
00:10:14,506 --> 00:10:15,426
I'm sorry, sir.

109
00:10:15,506 --> 00:10:17,066
Someone has booked the club today.

110
00:10:22,546 --> 00:10:23,866
Reporter? Inside, please.

111
00:10:27,706 --> 00:10:29,546
Do you know what the
reporters are here for?

112
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:30,346
I'm sorry.

113
00:10:30,426 --> 00:10:32,306
This is the privacy of the guest.
I can't tell you that.

114
00:10:32,786 --> 00:10:33,626
Please leave.

115
00:11:20,426 --> 00:11:21,506
Liang Chen, take a sit.

116
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:22,986
The pastries here taste good.

117
00:11:23,106 --> 00:11:24,266
I'll get some for you.

118
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,450
Jia Yun, let's talk about the

119
00:11:26,531 --> 00:11:28,171
process of the press conference first.

120
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,541
All right.

121
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:36,226
You haven't discussed it with me before

122
00:11:36,306 --> 00:11:37,346
so I'm not too sure

123
00:11:37,427 --> 00:11:39,147
what exactly I should say on the stage.

124
00:11:41,586 --> 00:11:43,026
Liang Chen, the truth is

125
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:48,066
there's a better way
to solve this problem

126
00:11:48,746 --> 00:11:51,186
rather than clarifying our relationship.

127
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:52,866
What is it?

128
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:55,506
It is to disclose to the media that

129
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:57,106
we really are having relationship.

130
00:11:57,506 --> 00:11:59,106
Then the scandal will
meet a swift death

131
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,546
and there will be no more rumours.

132
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:01,946
It won't do.

133
00:12:02,106 --> 00:12:03,146
Why not?

134
00:12:03,946 --> 00:12:05,706
I can't be the reason that

135
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:06,826
drag you into this.

136
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:07,946
But I'm not afraid.

137
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:10,266
I think this is the best
way to quell heresy.

138
00:12:10,401 --> 00:12:12,081
But I can't do this!

139
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:15,426
Liang Chen,

140
00:12:16,546 --> 00:12:17,546
why don't you understand me?

141
00:12:17,626 --> 00:12:18,746
Understand what?

142
00:12:36,073 --> 00:12:36,886
Lu Jing.

143
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,426
Boss.

144
00:12:59,266 --> 00:13:01,946
The press conference is about to begin.

145
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:19,746
Lu Jing, what are you doing?

146
00:13:23,296 --> 00:13:24,128
Lu Jing!

147
00:13:24,266 --> 00:13:25,586
Lu Jing, what are you doing?

148
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:30,106
Why are you avoiding me?

149
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:38,106
I've been thinking a lot recently.

150
00:13:40,635 --> 00:13:41,835
I'm a singer,

151
00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:44,351
a public figure.

152
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:48,484
That's why my every move

153
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:50,826
will be criticized by others.

154
00:13:53,178 --> 00:13:54,491
But you are different from me.

155
00:13:56,426 --> 00:13:57,866
You are just a student.

156
00:13:58,026 --> 00:13:59,306
You should be enjoying

157
00:13:59,386 --> 00:14:01,306
a carefree campus life.

158
00:14:02,386 --> 00:14:04,146
I'm not supposed to mess up your life.

159
00:14:08,124 --> 00:14:09,070
So

160
00:14:12,906 --> 00:14:13,866
I think we...

161
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,360

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,550

I don't want to hear that three words.

♫ Sneaking a glimpse at you ♫

175
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:17,020
♫ As the breeze blows, I look for ♫

176
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:14,976
I've never thought of you as a big star.

177
00:15:16,826 --> 00:15:19,986
And never thought if
we were a good match.

178
00:15:21,986 --> 00:15:23,666

You won't even try.

184
00:15:37,928 --> 00:15:39,540
What makes you think
I'm not the right one?

185

190
00:15:57,882 --> 00:15:59,522
I'd like to think about it again.

191
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:04,298
Senior!

192
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:09,906
In my four years in university,

193
00:16:10,746 --> 00:16:12,786
I received the national first-class
scholarship every year.

194
00:16:13,946 --> 00:16:15,546
I am rewarded as
Triple-A student every year.

195
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,626
I even got champion in ACM Asia.

196
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:20,706
I can play violin.

197
00:16:21,226 --> 00:16:22,386
I can play basketball.

198
00:16:23,026 --> 00:16:25,746
I'm also the champion of marathon
for university students.

199
00:16:26,626 --> 00:16:28,306
In the future, I'll continue to
work hard in computer science

200
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:29,906
and bring glory to the country.

201
00:16:50,546 --> 00:16:52,506
I think I have the ability
to protect myself

202
00:16:53,706 --> 00:16:55,026
and to protect you.

203
00:16:58,266 --> 00:16:59,206
Senior,

204
00:17:00,146 --> 00:17:02,266
love is supposed to be
simple and beautiful.

205
00:17:03,626 --> 00:17:04,746
Since it has come,

206
00:17:06,386 --> 00:17:07,826
just enjoy it, okay?

207
00:17:28,056 --> 00:17:29,466
So you really don't want me?

208
00:17:41,106 --> 00:17:41,964
I want you.

209
00:17:42,546 --> 00:17:43,426
I want you.

Mr Ding,

212
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,986
is it true about the relationship
between you and Liang Chen?

213
00:18:37,946 --> 00:18:39,586
Is it true that Liang Chen
was having affair

214
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,026
with another man when she was with

215
00:18:41,106 --> 00:18:42,746

217
00:18:47,266 --> 00:18:48,706
Hello, friends from the media.

218
00:18:49,906 --> 00:18:51,426
Firstly, thank you for

219
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:54,426
your attention to me and Liang Chen.

220
00:18:55,826 --> 00:18:56,865
Then I'll answer

221
00:18:56,946 --> 00:18:58,466
your most interested question,

222
00:18:59,746 --> 00:19:01,106
the relationship between
me and Liang Chen.

223
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:17,426
Liang Chen is my good friend.

224
00:19:18,186 --> 00:19:18,972
Friend?

225
00:19:19,282 --> 00:19:20,183
Liang Chen's friend.

226
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:25,146
We met each other at work.

227
00:19:26,155 --> 00:19:28,355
To be frank, I deeply admire her.

228
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,026
Because she has been working hard.

229
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,266
She has been pursuing what she wants.

230
00:19:35,586 --> 00:19:39,106
I saw her stumbling along the way

231
00:19:40,506 --> 00:19:43,226
but she never gives up.

232
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:46,426
I respect her

233
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,386
and I cherish

234
00:19:50,338 --> 00:19:51,778
for having such a good friend.

235
00:19:53,106 --> 00:19:56,826
I won't allow anyone to denigrate her.

236
00:19:57,347 --> 00:19:58,146
Denigrate?

237
00:19:58,226 --> 00:20:00,185
You mean someone has
intentionally against Liang Chen?

238
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:01,386
Who do you mean?

239
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,546
Do you mean Meng Lan Zhi?

240
00:20:03,706 --> 00:20:04,746
It's possible.

241
00:20:05,226 --> 00:20:06,666
Did I say that?

242
00:20:07,786 --> 00:20:09,026
This member of the media,

243
00:20:09,386 --> 00:20:10,706
you're good at joking.

244
00:20:22,906 --> 00:20:24,106
I've reached home.

245
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:34,146
Well... Goodnight.

246
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,515
Goodnight.

247
00:20:54,946 --> 00:20:55,986
What are you doing?

248
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:31,266
Aren't you afraid of getting
slammed by the door?

249
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:34,581
I'm not afraid.

250
00:22:37,146 --> 00:22:38,906
I'm just afraid that today is a dream.

251
00:22:53,746 --> 00:22:54,546
It's real.

252
00:23:13,786 --> 00:23:15,986
What's so attractive about Gu Fei Ming?
Tell me.

253
00:23:17,706 --> 00:23:18,586
You ask him when he comes back.

254
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:19,546
-You ask him.
-You ask.

Only you can, only you, you can.

257
00:23:30,546 --> 00:23:31,345
Why is he this happy?

258
00:23:31,426 --> 00:23:32,230
No, he...

259
00:23:32,586 --> 00:23:33,346
What's wrong with him?

260
00:23:36,626 --> 00:23:37,466
What?

261
00:23:42,186 --> 00:23:43,266
What's going on?

262
00:23:43,466 --> 00:23:44,506
Why is he so happy?

263
00:23:44,746 --> 00:23:45,746
I know, right?

264
00:23:46,146 --> 00:23:48,226
I can feel his happiness
is almost overflowing.

265
00:23:49,466 --> 00:23:50,466
He's so scary.

266
00:23:51,626 --> 00:23:54,186
Gu Fei Ming and Qi Qi
are already like that.

267
00:23:54,346 --> 00:23:55,906
How could he be happy?

268
00:23:56,706 --> 00:23:57,666
In my opinion,

269
00:23:57,826 --> 00:23:59,986
he's probably pretending to be relaxed.

270
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,520

Is my underwear dry?

278
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,918
Say it.

279
00:24:35,146 --> 00:24:36,293
What exactly are you guys doing?

Nothing, nothing.

00:24:38,106 --> 00:24:39,466
We're not curious about you.

282
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:40,266
Right.

283
00:24:42,394 --> 00:24:43,186
Really?

284
00:24:44,186 --> 00:24:46,506
Get some sleep then.

285
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,762
Right,

286
00:24:57,986 --> 00:25:00,906
there's one thing I
need to tell you guys.

287
00:25:03,226 --> 00:25:04,226
What is it?

288
00:25:09,506 --> 00:25:10,466
I have a girlfriend.

289
00:25:12,586 --> 00:25:13,346
Jing,

290
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:15,146
are you serious?

291
00:25:15,705 --> 00:25:17,345
Are you suffering from anything?

292
00:25:17,426 --> 00:25:18,527
That's why you intentionally...

293
00:25:18,706 --> 00:25:19,425
Right.

294
00:25:19,506 --> 00:25:20,746
There are plenty
more fish in the sea.

295
00:25:20,826 --> 00:25:22,346
Don't be single-minded.

296
00:25:22,626 --> 00:25:23,345
You're still young.

297
00:25:23,426 --> 00:25:25,666
Do not give up on yourself

298
00:25:25,902 --> 00:25:28,706
just because of a blind person.

299
00:25:33,946 --> 00:25:37,346
What are you talking about?

300
00:25:39,586 --> 00:25:40,586
Get some sleep.

301
00:26:05,186 --> 00:26:08,066
Boss, the public opinion has subsided.

302
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,946
Boss, I don't understand.

303
00:26:12,186 --> 00:26:13,426
You've done many
things for Ms Liang.

304
00:26:13,586 --> 00:26:14,946
Why don't you tell her about it?

305
00:26:17,626 --> 00:26:18,754
I'm afraid to make
things difficult for her.

306
00:26:19,266 --> 00:26:19,986
How about you?

307
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:21,426
You like her so much.

308
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:26,626
At least now we're still friends.

309
00:26:26,866 --> 00:26:28,146
If she rejects me,

310
00:26:29,186 --> 00:26:30,546
we can't even be friends.

311
00:26:32,546 --> 00:26:35,746
Boss, if you don't tell her,

312
00:26:36,106 --> 00:26:38,026
she'll never know that you like her.

313
00:26:39,026 --> 00:26:41,546
No matter what the result is,

314
00:26:41,826 --> 00:26:43,746
you should give yourself an answer.

315
00:27:23,706 --> 00:27:25,186
Keep going, stick to it!

316
00:27:26,546 --> 00:27:28,506
What is the matter with you?

317
00:27:28,826 --> 00:27:30,546
Why do you torture us?

318
00:27:30,706 --> 00:27:31,506
It's over.

319
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:33,386
Lu Jing must be crazy.

320
00:27:36,306 --> 00:27:37,186
Let's just walk.

321
00:27:46,826 --> 00:27:50,106
Ms Qing, you look really beautiful today.

322
00:27:54,346 --> 00:27:55,946
It must be no good
once you start flattering.

323
00:27:56,027 --> 00:27:57,747
Say it, what mistake have you made?

324
00:27:57,881 --> 00:27:59,321
I'm speaking the truth.

325
00:28:02,066 --> 00:28:04,106
We have an appointment with
Director Ma today, right?

326
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:05,985
Why?

327
00:28:06,066 --> 00:28:06,957
Keep it up.

328
00:28:07,146 --> 00:28:08,426
Ms Liang, good luck.

329
00:28:08,706 --> 00:28:09,496
I can do it!

330
00:28:11,386 --> 00:28:12,866
Okay, then we'll talk next time.

331
00:28:13,386 --> 00:28:15,706
All right. Feel free to communicate
with me if there's any problem.

332
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:16,783
Goodbye.

333
00:28:28,843 --> 00:28:30,883
Ms Liang, what a coincidence.

334
00:28:31,306 --> 00:28:32,191
What's the matter?

335
00:28:32,306 --> 00:28:33,121
Nothing.

336
00:28:33,826 --> 00:28:36,946
I just want to say sorry.

337
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:41,306
It was me who got the spot after all.

338
00:28:41,522 --> 00:28:42,962
Don't be disappointed.

339
00:28:46,906 --> 00:28:48,026
What are you laughing at?

340
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:51,946
As a senior,

341
00:28:52,386 --> 00:28:53,786
I kindly remind you that

342
00:28:54,546 --> 00:28:56,066
no matter which sector you're in,

343
00:28:56,346 --> 00:28:58,746
you should take every step steadily.

344
00:28:59,346 --> 00:29:01,306
You'll eventually get
yourself into trouble

345
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:03,346
if you played tricks.

346
00:29:09,506 --> 00:29:11,986
Thanks for your advice, Ms Liang.

347
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:14,986
Unfortunately, I don't understand it.

348
00:29:16,146 --> 00:29:19,426
Go back and listen more to nursery
rhymes if you don't understand.

349
00:29:21,066 --> 00:29:22,986
Right, I forgot to tell you.

350
00:29:23,266 --> 00:29:24,666
I got a spot too.

351
00:29:28,586 --> 00:29:29,946
Get ready for the competition.

352
00:29:30,906 --> 00:29:31,706
Keep it up.

353
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:47,023
Look.

354
00:29:47,506 --> 00:29:49,425
The list of challengers
for the latest edition

355
00:29:49,506 --> 00:29:51,266
of The Journey of Music Lovers is out.

356
00:29:51,386 --> 00:29:53,346
Liang Chen is going to
battle with Meng Lan Zhi.

357
00:29:53,466 --> 00:29:55,226
Discussion on the Internet has blown up.

358
00:29:55,386 --> 00:29:57,506
This is the first time
having two challengers.

359
00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:59,866
The next show will be really exciting.

360
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:01,746
What else did netizens say?

361
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,960
After the official announcement of the
program team, some doubted Liang Chen,

362
00:30:05,025 --> 00:30:07,145
saying that she has
the same style with Lisa,

363
00:30:07,226 --> 00:30:09,106
and she'd lose in the first round.

364
00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:10,100
Right.

365
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:10,986
The popularity of

366
00:30:11,066 --> 00:30:13,786
Liang Chen's songs is
higher than Meng Lan Zhi's

367
00:30:14,026 --> 00:30:16,426
but her style is not
as flexible as Meng Lan Zhi's.

368
00:30:16,546 --> 00:30:18,506
So I think Meng Lan Zhi has

369
00:30:18,706 --> 00:30:20,466
more advantage in this program.

370
00:30:22,226 --> 00:30:24,986
I'm afraid Liang Chen would be
screwed in this competition.

371
00:30:26,428 --> 00:30:27,746
You're the one who's screwed.

372
00:30:29,506 --> 00:30:30,626
You guys don't know her.

373
00:30:35,026 --> 00:30:36,106
Only you know.

374
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:41,586
Ms Liang,

375
00:30:41,866 --> 00:30:43,866
the netizens doubted you
about joining the contest.

376
00:30:43,986 --> 00:30:45,546
How could you be so calm?

377
00:30:45,945 --> 00:30:46,825
Doubt what?

378
00:30:46,906 --> 00:30:49,266
They doubted me, saying that
I'm no match for Meng Lan Zhi?

379
00:30:49,546 --> 00:30:50,826
That's pretty much what they mean.

380
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,386
No matter what people said,

381
00:30:52,506 --> 00:30:54,226
they won't affect my performance.

382
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:56,906
Forget it, the coat I'm wearing
still looks the best,

383
00:30:56,986 --> 00:30:57,626
right?

384
00:31:09,991 --> 00:31:10,625
Hello.

385
00:31:10,706 --> 00:31:11,426
Senior.

386
00:31:12,226 --> 00:31:13,115
What are you doing?

387
00:31:13,266 --> 00:31:14,986
I'm ready to go out to work.

388
00:31:15,146 --> 00:31:16,666
Are you free after that?

389
00:31:16,826 --> 00:31:17,746
Why?

390
00:31:19,026 --> 00:31:19,825
[I want...]

391
00:31:19,906 --> 00:31:20,795
I'll go to Sun Bin Yu's house

392
00:31:20,876 --> 00:31:22,396
to have dinner after working.

393
00:31:22,946 --> 00:31:24,266
Okay, I'll go too.

394
00:31:24,537 --> 00:31:25,386
See you there.

395
00:31:32,186 --> 00:31:33,546
-Lu Jing.
-What do you want to eat later?

396
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:35,666
Eat Spicy Hot Pot.

397
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:37,226
Okay, still that one.

398
00:31:48,266 --> 00:31:49,586
Hello, seniors.

399
00:31:50,026 --> 00:31:52,986
Lu Jing, where are you going?

400
00:31:54,266 --> 00:31:55,386
I'm going to the next class.

401
00:31:57,146 --> 00:31:58,106
I'll leave you then.

402
00:31:58,226 --> 00:31:59,946
We are going on a date.

403
00:32:03,306 --> 00:32:04,866
You definitely have no time for dating

404
00:32:05,026 --> 00:32:06,546
since you're studying so hard.

405
00:32:08,786 --> 00:32:10,346
Have fun on your date

406
00:32:10,497 --> 00:32:12,297
but don't forget to study as well.

407
00:32:12,428 --> 00:32:13,786
Only then can you have a future.

408
00:32:17,546 --> 00:32:18,373
You...

409
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:20,866
All right.

410
00:32:20,946 --> 00:32:22,026
Let's go. We have class.

411
00:32:28,403 --> 00:32:29,352
Did you guys see it?

412
00:32:29,986 --> 00:32:31,271
He is apparently heartbroken

413
00:32:31,362 --> 00:32:33,162
but still pretends to be strong.

414
00:32:34,226 --> 00:32:35,546
This is his last stand.

415
00:32:37,426 --> 00:32:39,146
Lu Jing, you poor thing.

416
00:32:40,586 --> 00:32:41,545
It's not right.

417
00:32:41,866 --> 00:32:43,318
Didn't he say that he has a girlfriend?

418
00:32:43,706 --> 00:32:44,705
What do you know?

419
00:32:44,786 --> 00:32:46,186
Lu Jing is hurt.

420
00:32:46,267 --> 00:32:48,467
That's why he got a girlfriend
to be the replacement.

421
00:32:49,026 --> 00:32:50,306
Right, you're right.

422
00:32:50,706 --> 00:32:51,545
This won't do.

423
00:32:51,626 --> 00:32:52,745
We can't stand still

424
00:32:52,826 --> 00:32:54,266
and watch Lu Jing get bullied.

425
00:32:54,586 --> 00:32:55,786
We have to find a way

426
00:32:55,867 --> 00:32:57,067
and help him earn his dignity back.

427
00:33:09,666 --> 00:33:10,529
Liang Chen.

428
00:33:12,986 --> 00:33:14,386
Director Ma, is there anything else?

429
00:33:15,066 --> 00:33:17,186
I just want to remind you that

430
00:33:17,267 --> 00:33:18,740
the remaining seven singers

431
00:33:18,821 --> 00:33:19,781
are all distinct.

432
00:33:20,186 --> 00:33:22,746
You have to be very careful
at choosing your song.

433
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:24,986
I understand, thank you.

434
00:33:25,266 --> 00:33:26,287
Do you have any idea?

435
00:33:26,506 --> 00:33:29,266
I'm choosing between
ballad and rock-and-roll.

436
00:33:32,106 --> 00:33:33,666
I know a music producer.

437
00:33:33,953 --> 00:33:35,353
He happens to have a song.

438
00:33:35,746 --> 00:33:36,786
Do you want to give it a try?

439
00:33:37,546 --> 00:33:38,746
Okay, thank you, Director Ma.

440
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:41,786
Coming.

441
00:33:47,306 --> 00:33:48,217
Why are you here?

442
00:33:49,506 --> 00:33:50,505
My care for a single man,

443
00:33:50,586 --> 00:33:51,586
here to give you warmth.

444
00:33:53,106 --> 00:33:55,826
Lu Jing, why are you so polite today?

445
00:33:55,907 --> 00:33:57,105
We've known each other for so long.

446
00:33:57,186 --> 00:33:58,586
Why are you being so polite?

447
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,586
I heard that you've invited

448
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:02,267
Liang Chen over for dinner tonight.

449
00:34:03,386 --> 00:34:05,346
Liang Chen even told you this?

450
00:34:06,626 --> 00:34:08,266
I have something to ask her.

451
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:09,346
We'll just have dinner

452
00:34:09,427 --> 00:34:10,497
at a small restaurant nearby.

453
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:12,575
It's not convenient for her to go out

454
00:34:12,656 --> 00:34:13,616
since gossip hasn't died down.

455
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:16,746
You are such a fussy man.

456
00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:20,866
Are you asking me to cook for her?

457
00:34:21,066 --> 00:34:22,425
I can't cook.

458
00:34:22,506 --> 00:34:23,905
So you are the only one
I can count on.

459
00:34:23,986 --> 00:34:25,226
I... You...

460
00:34:25,306 --> 00:34:26,066
Thank you.

461
00:34:28,165 --> 00:34:30,055
Lu Jing, you're out of line!

462
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:49,679
How is it?

463
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,319
I think this song is not right.

464
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,520
Which part do you think is not right?

465
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:55,466
All of it.

466
00:34:55,906 --> 00:34:56,625
Orange,

467
00:34:56,706 --> 00:34:57,825
are you doing it on purpose
because of me?

468
00:34:57,906 --> 00:34:58,866
You're imagining it.

469
00:34:59,026 --> 00:35:00,265
You guys know each other?

470
00:35:00,346 --> 00:35:01,106
-No.
-Yes.

471
00:35:02,306 --> 00:35:04,826
Director, I don't think
this song suits me.

472
00:35:05,026 --> 00:35:07,426
I want to be more careful
on the song selection.

473
00:35:07,626 --> 00:35:09,666
I'm afraid I can't accept your kindness.

474
00:35:09,906 --> 00:35:10,679
It's fine,

475
00:35:10,826 --> 00:35:12,906
as long as you can
confirm the song promptly.

476
00:35:13,066 --> 00:35:14,346
It takes time to do an arrangement.

477
00:35:14,971 --> 00:35:16,179
Okay, thank you.

478
00:35:16,306 --> 00:35:17,266
Then I'll leave first.

479
00:35:17,586 --> 00:35:18,390
Okay.

480
00:35:26,762 --> 00:35:28,082
You're not satisfied with the song?

481
00:35:35,426 --> 00:35:36,386
Hello, Jia Yun.

482
00:35:36,746 --> 00:35:37,746
Hello, Liang Chen.

483
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:39,946
I saw the official announcement.

484
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:41,266
Congratulations.

485
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:42,865
Thank you.

486
00:35:42,946 --> 00:35:44,706
I'll treat you to dinner
after the contest.

487
00:35:45,786 --> 00:35:46,825
Also to thank you

488
00:35:46,906 --> 00:35:49,346
for helping me to clarify
in the press conference last time.

489
00:35:51,186 --> 00:35:52,586
I'm calling

490
00:35:53,826 --> 00:35:55,498
to ask

491
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:58,466
if you are free on the night of the 24th?

492
00:35:58,746 --> 00:35:59,986
24th?

493
00:36:02,146 --> 00:36:02,986
Birthday.

494
00:36:06,986 --> 00:36:08,306
It's your birthday?

495
00:36:11,826 --> 00:36:13,346
Of course I'll go.

496
00:36:14,946 --> 00:36:16,826
Okay, I'll wait for you.

497
00:36:28,866 --> 00:36:29,786
Your apron looks nice.

498
00:36:30,754 --> 00:36:32,354
You are full of crap.

499
00:36:54,786 --> 00:36:55,706
Ms Ma,

500
00:36:55,946 --> 00:36:58,906
would you like to come to
my house for dinner tonight?

501
00:36:59,273 --> 00:37:01,553
I'll make you a loving dinner.

502
00:37:06,586 --> 00:37:07,490
Wash them clean.

503
00:37:07,946 --> 00:37:09,146
They need to be eaten.

504
00:37:14,386 --> 00:37:15,946
The reception is good.

505
00:37:18,146 --> 00:37:20,306
Didn't she look at her phone?

506
00:37:22,151 --> 00:37:23,431
What are you laughing at?

507
00:37:23,626 --> 00:37:25,546
You're sending WeChat
message to a girl, right?

508
00:37:25,986 --> 00:37:28,706
It doesn't feel like
she wants to talk to you.

509
00:37:28,986 --> 00:37:30,346
Nonsense.

510
00:37:30,506 --> 00:37:32,225
Ms Ma is too busy.

511
00:37:32,306 --> 00:37:33,916
She has no time to
look at her phone, okay?

512
00:37:34,034 --> 00:37:36,018
Do you think everyone is free like you?

513
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:37,937
Looking at the phone
and waiting to reply every day.

514
00:37:39,586 --> 00:37:41,385
Then you just wait for her reply.

515
00:37:41,466 --> 00:37:43,466
I guess it will take half a month.

516
00:37:44,706 --> 00:37:45,586
You...

517
00:37:45,706 --> 00:37:47,066
Go back and bring me some vinegar.

518
00:37:47,162 --> 00:37:48,962
You talk too much as a freeloader.

519
00:37:49,043 --> 00:37:49,923
Go!

520
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,740
Why didn't she reply me?

521
00:38:10,146 --> 00:38:11,066
Coming.

522
00:38:11,946 --> 00:38:13,266
He's pretty fast.

523
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:15,932
It's you.

524
00:38:16,826 --> 00:38:17,682
Taro,

525
00:38:17,986 --> 00:38:19,418
I think this apron

526
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:20,876
fits you well,

527
00:38:20,957 --> 00:38:22,477
like it was made for you.

528
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,660
You look really nice.

529
00:38:24,018 --> 00:38:25,425
Orange, have you been

530
00:38:25,506 --> 00:38:26,626
hanging out with Lu Jing lately?

531
00:38:26,715 --> 00:38:27,995
He is a bad influence.

532
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,426
Lu Jing bought this for me.

533
00:38:30,507 --> 00:38:31,947
Don't you think he's crazy?

534
00:38:32,051 --> 00:38:33,091
Just buy me the groceries,

535
00:38:33,172 --> 00:38:33,746
why buy this apron?

536
00:38:33,826 --> 00:38:34,946
Is he here already?

537
00:38:35,122 --> 00:38:35,962
Lu Jing?

538
00:38:37,082 --> 00:38:38,025
Lu Jing?

539
00:38:38,426 --> 00:38:41,146
Why do I sense something fishy?

540
00:38:41,846 --> 00:38:42,657
Lu Jing?

541
00:38:46,978 --> 00:38:48,378
Lu Jing didn't come?

542
00:38:53,427 --> 00:38:54,307
Orange,

543
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:57,210
don't you have a good
relationship with Ms Ma?

544
00:38:57,331 --> 00:38:59,106
Why don't you
invite her over for dinner tonight?

545
00:38:59,186 --> 00:39:00,666
Look, it's rare that I cook.

546
00:39:02,103 --> 00:39:02,929
Okay.

547
00:39:03,947 --> 00:39:04,847
You call her.

548
00:39:08,635 --> 00:39:09,555
Orange,

549
00:39:10,146 --> 00:39:13,466
what's the matter with Ms Ma?

550
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:14,580
Tell me since you guys

551
00:39:14,706 --> 00:39:15,586
were classmates.

552
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,810
Has she always been like this?

553
00:39:17,586 --> 00:39:19,146
Aren't you close with her?

554
00:39:19,226 --> 00:39:20,866
Ask her yourself.

555
00:39:22,826 --> 00:39:26,026
Right, it's Jia Yun's
birthday in two days.

556
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:27,803
What do you think I should give him?

557
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,225
We've known him for so long.

558
00:39:30,306 --> 00:39:31,946
Just give him anything.

559
00:39:33,986 --> 00:39:35,866
Orange, I'm begging you.

560
00:39:36,111 --> 00:39:38,431
Just tell me more about Ms Ma.

561
00:39:38,946 --> 00:39:39,826
Please.

562
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:42,386
Just give him anything?

563
00:39:42,826 --> 00:39:44,066
Then what will you give him?

564
00:39:48,058 --> 00:39:48,915
Lu Jing.

565
00:39:49,506 --> 00:39:50,393
You're here.

566
00:39:50,866 --> 00:39:52,096
Why did you come early?

567
00:39:53,546 --> 00:39:55,826
I know you were coming so I rush here.

568
00:39:58,221 --> 00:39:59,426
I'm still here, okay?

569
00:39:59,507 --> 00:40:00,787
What's wrong with you both?

570
00:40:03,586 --> 00:40:04,534
Taro,

571
00:40:05,106 --> 00:40:06,268
have you finished cooking?

572
00:40:06,586 --> 00:40:07,826
Liang Chen is starving.

573
00:40:07,987 --> 00:40:08,746
Go, quickly!

574
00:40:09,385 --> 00:40:10,026
Hurry up and cook.

575
00:40:10,106 --> 00:40:12,706
This is my house,
I'm not a chef, you...

576
00:40:22,706 --> 00:40:23,866
What were you guys
talking about just now?
