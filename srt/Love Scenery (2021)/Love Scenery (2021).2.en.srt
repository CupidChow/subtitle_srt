00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:10,781
I can see you. I'll get you in there.

189
00:13:11,383 --> 00:13:12,221
[Click confirm.]

190
00:15:48,621 --> 00:15:49,821
Is this how you got here?

191
00:15:50,901 --> 00:15:52,901
Bullets have no eyes.
I was afraid of getting hurt.

192
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:02,181
Put on the bulletproof vest.

193
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,093
It's safer that way.

194
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:08,326
This is hideous.

195
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:09,661
I won't wear it.

196
00:16:10,061 --> 00:16:11,701
I want to look pretty even if I die.

197
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:15,741
Come on in, come on in.

198
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:16,621
Hurry up.

199
00:16:18,901 --> 00:16:19,781
What is wrong with you?

200
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:21,261
There's a robot. I'm afraid.

201
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:22,541
There's nothing to be afraid of.

202
00:16:22,622 --> 00:16:24,141
No, no! When there are many robots,

203
00:16:24,213 --> 00:16:25,493
I'd die easily.

204
00:16:26,341 --> 00:16:27,259
How quickly?

205
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,190
I restarted the game six times
within half an hour.

206
00:16:32,461 --> 00:16:34,181
So you're quite persistent, huh?

207
00:16:35,073 --> 00:16:36,741
What should we do now?

208
00:16:37,741 --> 00:16:38,861
Our mission this time

209
00:16:38,981 --> 00:16:40,981
is to find the robot's plan
for invading the earth.

210
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,437
I will storm out later.

211
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:43,318
Just follow me.

212
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,270
Okay.

213
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,920
Don't let me die.

214
00:16:49,999 --> 00:16:50,838
Please.

215
00:16:51,687 --> 00:16:52,487
Let's go.

216
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,070
[First mission accomplished.]

for confidential documents.]

220
00:17:44,838 --> 00:17:46,198
There's a robot behind the cabinet.

221
00:18:03,518 --> 00:18:04,478
Sorry.

222
00:18:04,565 --> 00:18:05,558
Another one by the door.

223
00:18:23,158 --> 00:18:24,918
What... What is going on?

224
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:27,038
Many robots will appear downstairs.

225
00:18:33,643 --> 00:18:34,518
Watch closely.

226
00:18:41,182 --> 00:18:42,398
Did you get a good look?

227
00:19:13,878 --> 00:19:15,158
Did you get it?

228
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:17,238
Do you want to know my true feelings?

229
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:18,478
Fill me in.

230
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:20,159
I think

231
00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:21,758
I'm blind.

232
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,918
Do you also think that you're deaf?

233
00:19:24,238 --> 00:19:25,478
Blind and deaf.

234
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:30,951
How did you determine it?

235
00:19:31,758 --> 00:19:33,198
Just listen to the sound.

236
00:19:38,638 --> 00:19:39,478
You're amazing.

237
00:19:59,695 --> 00:20:01,049
This is so ugly. Nope.

238
00:20:02,663 --> 00:20:03,823
This gun is huge.

239
00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:04,918
It might come in handy.

240
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:10,718
What is this?

241
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:14,638
Lu Jing, help!

242
00:20:14,718 --> 00:20:16,118
[Lu Jing, help!]

243
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:19,838
How did you die?

244
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,601
Somehow I bumped into a robot.

That was such a wrongful death.

247
00:20:27,438 --> 00:20:29,678
I lost all the props that I found!

248
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,150
[They're all gone!]

249
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:33,232
Downwind.

250
00:20:33,927 --> 00:20:34,727
Play it.

251
00:20:34,878 --> 00:20:36,078
We'll present a song

252
00:20:36,158 --> 00:20:38,198

This time, just stick with me.

262
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,230
I think
this round will end within three minutes.

263
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:15,478
Two minutes.

Are we Superman?

271
00:21:51,238 --> 00:21:52,158
Will you do it or I'll do it?

272
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:53,838
Will I die? If I land with my face,

273
00:21:53,918 --> 00:21:54,958
won't I look horrible?

274
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:33,878
Don't hit me! I don't want to die!

This is amazing. We're still alive.

276

We wouldn't die.

277
00:22:44,838 --> 00:22:46,078

00:31:20,638 --> 00:31:21,918
always have a good attendance?

375
00:31:27,438 --> 00:31:29,718
Okay. Let's start our class.

376
00:31:31,158 --> 00:31:32,229
Let's recap

377
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,990
what we learned last time.

378
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:41,420
*[Ocean Deep Chaos National
Undergraduate Challenge in Big Data]

379
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:56,174
How was it?

380
00:31:57,438 --> 00:31:58,238
Among these four demos,

381
00:31:58,278 --> 00:32:00,078
two of them were composed
by famous producers,

382
00:32:00,158 --> 00:32:01,478
another two were composed by newcomers.

383
00:32:01,918 --> 00:32:02,758
They're all special on their own.

384
00:32:05,238 --> 00:32:06,038
What's the matter?

385
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:07,439
Still not happy with it?

386
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:10,117
They're special on their own indeed,

387
00:32:10,198 --> 00:32:12,158
but I can't decide yet now.

388
00:32:14,238 --> 00:32:15,198
This time,

389
00:32:15,318 --> 00:32:17,038
we really spared no effort

390
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,639
to find good songs for you.

391
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,917
But now, it's extremely difficult

392
00:32:19,998 --> 00:32:21,518
to find a good song.

393
00:32:22,918 --> 00:32:24,558
I know.
Mr Zhou, thanks for your hard work.

394
00:32:24,838 --> 00:32:26,398
Then, I'll listen to them again.

395
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,318
If you have something to do, go ahead.

396
00:32:28,862 --> 00:32:29,662
Sure.

397
00:32:29,743 --> 00:32:30,823
Listen to them first.

398
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:36,198
I really think

399
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,127
that these songs are really good.

400
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,640
Think it over.

401
00:32:57,134 --> 00:32:57,934
How did it go?

402
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:00,358
Anything suitable for the album?

403
00:33:02,623 --> 00:33:03,623
They're not bad,

404
00:33:04,175 --> 00:33:05,695
but I just don't feel anything.

405
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,390
What happened?

406
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,430
Will it get better
if you give it another try?

407
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,430
I'm not sure either.

408
00:33:22,095 --> 00:33:23,255
What is going on?

409
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,790
If you keep staying in your comfort zone,

410
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:26,958
of course it's boring.

411
00:33:27,558 --> 00:33:28,678
If you want a breakthrough,

412
00:33:28,878 --> 00:33:30,118
you have to take the challenge.

413
00:33:31,198 --> 00:33:31,998
Amazing.

414
00:33:32,406 --> 00:33:33,406
As expected from our top student.

415
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,910
This is not something that an ordinary
people like me can understand.

416
00:33:36,158 --> 00:33:38,278
This contest only accepts teams.

417
00:33:38,438 --> 00:33:39,339
You know, don't you?

418
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:40,750
So?

419
00:33:40,838 --> 00:33:42,118
I've signed you up too.

420
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:43,918
What?

421
00:33:44,078 --> 00:33:46,838
You signed me up for Big Data Contest?

422
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:49,358
Why do you have confidence in me?

423
00:33:50,758 --> 00:33:52,318
I have confidence in myself.

424
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,438
If you stick with me,

425
00:33:54,678 --> 00:33:56,038
you're bound to make progress.

426
00:34:06,191 --> 00:34:07,038
Where's Lu Jing?

427
00:34:12,206 --> 00:34:13,446
Follow me.

428
00:34:23,718 --> 00:34:25,038
[What time are we meeting tonight?]

429
00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:28,469
[Teachers,]

430
00:34:28,558 --> 00:34:30,398
[propagate the doctrine, impart knowledge
and resolve doubts.]

431
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:31,838
[Today, we've invited]

432
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:34,118
[Professor Chen Bei from the artificial
intelligence at Nanze University]

433
00:34:34,278 --> 00:34:36,958
[to explain the current
cutting-edge results.]

434
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:41,478
Liu,

435
00:34:41,518 --> 00:34:42,438
take me to Nanze University.

436
00:34:42,598 --> 00:34:43,398
Okay.

437
00:34:44,718 --> 00:34:46,878
Chen, why do you want to go
to Nanze University?

438
00:34:48,158 --> 00:34:49,478
To find inspiration.

439
00:35:03,798 --> 00:35:04,598
What are you doing?

440
00:35:05,078 --> 00:35:07,558
Do you remember losing your bet last time?

441
00:35:07,918 --> 00:35:10,278
Now it is time for you to pay the price.

442
00:35:10,366 --> 00:35:11,166
Go!

443
00:35:15,518 --> 00:35:17,398
There is never an end of taking revenge.

444
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:20,598
If you're a man, learn to let go.

445
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:21,758
No way.

446
00:35:21,988 --> 00:35:22,798
Dream on it.

447
00:35:23,318 --> 00:35:24,238
You wish.

448
00:35:25,198 --> 00:35:26,238
Follow me.

449
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,111
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

450
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:28,992
Come on.

451
00:35:53,678 --> 00:35:55,158
Where on earth are you taking me to?

452
00:35:55,398 --> 00:35:56,347
It's definitely

453
00:35:56,428 --> 00:35:57,988
the Faculty of Music.

454
00:35:58,878 --> 00:36:00,558
Let's go, let's go.

455
00:36:48,238 --> 00:36:50,278
Chen, where exactly are you going?

456
00:36:50,478 --> 00:36:51,437
It's right ahead of us,

457
00:36:51,518 --> 00:36:52,438
the Faculty of Music.

458
00:36:55,278 --> 00:36:57,118
Chen, there are so many people here.

459
00:36:58,038 --> 00:36:59,358
Don't worry. Just be careful.

460
00:36:59,438 --> 00:37:00,398
No one will notice us.

461
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:04,358
I remember
that when I was still a student,

462
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,934
I often felt the magic of music

463
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,158
brought by nature here.

464
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:09,118
Back then,

465
00:37:09,198 --> 00:37:10,558
all my worries would disappear.

466
00:37:11,117 --> 00:37:11,917
Chen,

467
00:37:11,998 --> 00:37:13,198
you don't have

468
00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:15,599
to make skipping class
sound so novel and sophisticated.

469
00:37:19,398 --> 00:37:22,478
Nature and music are just so magical.

470
00:37:22,598 --> 00:37:24,678
I feel like all the troubles

471
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,310
have gone away now.

472
00:37:38,478 --> 00:37:39,278
Hello.

473
00:37:42,278 --> 00:37:43,158
Hello, hello.

474
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:44,798
Hello, everyone.

475
00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:47,959
We're the Fantastic Four
from Computing Science.

476
00:37:48,158 --> 00:37:49,421
The guy standing beside us

477
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:51,878
is a top student
from Computing Science, Lu Jing.

478
00:37:52,398 --> 00:37:54,718
All of you must be tired
from practising.

479
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,198
Next,

480
00:37:56,278 --> 00:37:57,878
let us enjoy

481
00:37:57,959 --> 00:37:59,438
his wonderful solo performance!

482
00:37:59,558 --> 00:38:01,078
A round of applause!

483
00:38:47,848 --> 00:38:48,648
Zhou Zhou,

484
00:38:50,552 --> 00:38:52,232
didn't you say he's tone-deaf?

485
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,360
This melody is so familiar.

486
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,398
Symphony No. 35 in D major.

487
00:38:59,607 --> 00:39:01,887
When I was composing 'You Have Me',

488
00:39:02,055 --> 00:39:04,495
it was my inspiration.

489
00:39:05,278 --> 00:39:06,598
It sounds really nice.

490
00:39:07,352 --> 00:39:09,043
Chen, it's this way.

491
00:39:08,153 --> 00:39:10,706
*[Concert Hall]
