Oh my gosh!

191
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,488
It's so cruel!

192
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:13,529
From now on,

193
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,890
all entrances are sealed.

194
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,089
It's too late to ask for a refund.

197
00:16:20,817 --> 00:16:22,217
Let's take a look at

198
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:23,930
everyone's gaze full of desire.

199
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:25,730
Who will be the unluckiest

200
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,370

201
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,730

202

Great! it's you!

204

No, no!

205
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,050
Go, go on!

206
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,810
Come on, it is hard to be the lucky one.

207

Go, go, go!

208
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,130
I wouldn't exactly call that lucky.

209
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,570
Look at me, I'm so thin.

210
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,850

215

That guy gave up on

216
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,250
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

217
00:17:01,505 --> 00:17:04,065
Am I not popular enough?

218
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:06,929
Are you all with your girlfriends?

219
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,090
Maybe they came with others' girlfriends.

220
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:08,970

221
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,130

Young man, I think
you are a little thin too.

228
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,730
Thin? I'm masculine.

229
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,890

Let me remind you gently.

234

Be careful not to sprain your back.

235
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,770
Don't worry, my back is strong.

236
00:17:46,151 --> 00:17:47,711
Just try and you will find out.

237

Good!

238
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,970
It sounds like a duel!

239
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,810
A round of applause

240
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,730
and welcome his attempt to try it out.

241
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,130
Don't clap, you. Give a try, quick.

242
00:18:01,628 --> 00:18:03,216
Okay. I'm about to carry you.

243

My back doesn't hurt at all.

-Five.
-Isn't he on location shooting?

It can't be him.

272
00:19:28,818 --> 00:19:29,938
-Six.
-Just a look-alike.

My friend gave me a ticket.

561
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:16,174
Yes, you shot it.

562
00:38:19,615 --> 00:38:20,415
Get ready.

563
00:38:24,142 --> 00:38:24,942
Shoot!

564
00:38:31,516 --> 00:38:32,316
Here.

565
00:38:37,956 --> 00:38:38,756
Shot!

566
00:38:39,676 --> 00:38:40,476
shoot!

567
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,060
Nice job.

568
00:38:55,396 --> 00:38:59,676
♫ The wind directs me to your side ♫

569
00:38:59,836 --> 00:39:04,196
♫ You shot me with the arrow of love ♫

570
00:39:04,277 --> 00:39:06,397
♫ Breaking my defences ♫

571
00:39:08,142 --> 00:39:13,262
♫ So let's go just with the wind ♫

572
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:18,236
Awesome!

573
00:39:18,646 --> 00:39:19,686
You sing very well.

574
00:39:20,061 --> 00:39:20,861
That's...

575
00:39:21,452 --> 00:39:23,812
[I'm the original singer,
of course it's good.]

576
00:39:25,036 --> 00:39:26,756
I practised for a long time.

577
00:39:26,885 --> 00:39:29,525
I was hoping for a chance
to sing out loud.

578
00:39:33,325 --> 00:39:34,208
Your water.

579
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:38,109
Complimentary?

580
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,239
*[Webmaster: The water you
ordered has been delivered! ]

581
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,640
Forget it.

582
00:39:49,645 --> 00:39:51,485
The service here is pretty good.

583
00:39:53,461 --> 00:39:54,421
Free water for me.

584
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:56,959
The service of my cyber cafe
is not good at all.

585
00:39:57,646 --> 00:39:59,086
You are also at a cyber cafe?

586
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,470
Who ordered fish-flavoured
shredded pork rice?

587
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,836
Who ordered fish-flavoured
shredded pork rice?

588
00:40:05,462 --> 00:40:07,702
Who ordered the fish-flavoured
shredded pork rice?

589
00:40:08,504 --> 00:40:09,759
Did you order this, mister?

590
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:11,373
I'm sorry.

591
00:40:14,076 --> 00:40:15,497
Your fish-flavoured
shredded pork rice?

592
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,476
You ordered it?

593
00:40:16,556 --> 00:40:17,956
Why didn't you answer my call?

594
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:18,916
What a bother.

595
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,560
Fish-flavoured shredded pork rice?
