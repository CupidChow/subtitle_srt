1
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,420
Xu Yang.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,540
They took the diary yesterday.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,220
They were playing with it in the morning.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,840
I did not participate.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,520
In fact...

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,020
Zhong Xiaoxiao.

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,680
I remember you told me last time

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,280
that there are many things in this world

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,380
that cannot be explained clearly.

10
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:25,940
At that time I was thinking

11
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,600
how is this possible?

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,320
I do not believe that.

13
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,120
But because of you,

14
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,020
You speak first.

15
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,180
You will return?

16
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,860
Go back to your world.

17
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,460
I have tried many times before.

18
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,940
But it did not work.

19
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,940
Do you want to go back?

20
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,720
All good.

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,680
I can help you.

22
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,720
Let's figure it out together.

23
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,200
OK.

24
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,440
After all, you are so smart.

25
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,780
You must be better than me.

26
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,380
But do not worry.

27
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,880
I failed so many times.

28
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,980
Good morning, Xu Yang.

29
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,480
Good morning, Xu Yang.

30
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,680
Xu Yang.

31
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,440
Let me talk.

32
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,300
Just now,

33
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,980
the stage in the old hall collapsed.

34
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,460
A month ago,

35
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,820
Zhong Xiaoxiao said that the stage would collapse.

36
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,400
We don't believe that.

37
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,300
I told you.

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,560
I have a good dream.

39
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,240
Zhong Xiaoxiao is very suitable.

40
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,360
Xiaoxiao.

41
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,220
Let's go out tonight.

42
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:21,880
Let's go out.

43
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:22,960
Let's go out.

44
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,240
One by one.

45
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,080
OK.

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,000
One by one.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,500
Let's go.

48
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,260
It's the first time I feel the enthusiasm of my colleagues.

49
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,300
It's not easy to exhale.

50
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,340
Speaking of which,

51
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,740
did you think about time travel yesterday?

52
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,700
I've heard about the way to travel through time.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,780
But it's very difficult

54
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,240
to go back.

55
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,060
How about now?

56
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,740
You can remember

57
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,140
what happened before you came back.

58
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,140
We can try to restore it.

59
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,500
Here we are.

60
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,280
The place where the class reunion is...

61
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,620
Oh my God.

62
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,040
Ten years later, it is the city center.

63
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,740
Do you know what I'm thinking?

64
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,280
This direction is wrong.

65
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,640
We have to find another way to get back.

66
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,500
I want

67
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,480
to find this land first.

68
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,740
And go back to sleep.

69
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:28,960
You have everything in your dream.

70
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,940
If the location doesn't exist,

71
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,660
let's try the next clue.

72
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,320
Think about what happened next.

73
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,120
Next is the class reunion.

74
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,620
I heard that you were with Meng Ran in the bathroom.

75
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,760
Why don't you confess to her?

76
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,780
It's impossible.

77
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,040
Since it is a wine party,

78
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,640
there must be wine.

79
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,540
Does it have anything to do with wine?

80
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,020
This is what I drank back then.

81
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,840
Is expensive.

82
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,460
You should drink some juice.

83
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,200
How many cups are there?

84
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,620
Still no reaction.

85
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,540
I'll look for something else.

86
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:30,880
Xu Yang.

87
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,900
There is a reliable way.

88
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,620
According to unreliable data,

89
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,240
more than 80% of time travelers

90
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,720
claim that space-time travel

91
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,940
is very likely to happen

92
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,140
after kissing.

93
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,440
What is that?

94
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,720
It's so obvious.

95
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,680
I read a lot of novels.

96
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,540
It looks like you drank from my glass.
