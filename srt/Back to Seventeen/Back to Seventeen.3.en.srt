1
00:00:02,186 --> 00:00:04,133
What is the situation?

2
00:00:10,868 --> 00:00:11,801
Hey Hey!

3
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:13,353
where are you going?

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,280
I'm going home.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,400
Did you take time off?

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,400
Today I'm on duty.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,880
I really have something!

8
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:22,569
It's time for class.

9
00:00:39,952 --> 00:00:42,440
What the hell is going on here?

10
00:00:51,316 --> 00:00:56,880
Five days, always at school, I'm from school N PC?

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,420
Still don't let people live?

12
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,200
What magnetic field must this space-time leap have to do with it?

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,900
I remember that you were very interested in this.

14
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,560
You must know what magnetic field and what wave it is, right?

15
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,300
Doesn't it say wormholes are space-time tunnels?

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,360
You really say you use more?

17
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,880
Fifth.

18
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:18,920
What?

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,780
You've asked me five times since starting school.

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,740
You also said that you also have some understanding of this.

21
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,380
But you only took 20 physics tests last time.

22
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,420
That's not what I asked.

23
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,880
but it's not my problem now.

24
00:01:34,143 --> 00:01:35,366
I mean...

25
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,214
What do you mean and ask me again.

26
00:01:40,064 --> 00:01:40,800
What?

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,140
Don't say anything, how else do I get out of school?

28
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,199
I am out?

29
00:01:51,553 --> 00:01:52,604
I am out?

30
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:57,820
This question is the same as the book type of question, let's have a look at it for yourself.

31
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:06,510
I am very happy to meet you at 17, at 27.

32
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:07,530
See you later.

33
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,310
Every time I jump it feels like it's because of me.

34
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,690
Since I am separated from Xu Yang's side, I want to return to the original world.

35
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,342
So everyone thinks the key to this question is...

36
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:21,781
Yes, Xu Yang!

37
00:02:26,983 --> 00:02:31,248
Inexplicably, I came into the world at the age of 17.

38
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,770
In this world, everything seems to surround this heat.

39
00:02:39,297 --> 00:02:40,938
sit down, I'll be quick.

40
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,310
Didn't you just bring me two books?

41
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,810
I took the teaching material and left, not entering.

42
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,710
Yes, the textbook, I have to find it, I don't know where to put it, come on come on!

43
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,090
Come in and sit for a while, sit for a while.

44
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:57,931
I'll go in and look for it, don't leave here!

45
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,730
Because... Because... where did I put it?

46
00:03:15,646 --> 00:03:21,058
-3-2-1!
