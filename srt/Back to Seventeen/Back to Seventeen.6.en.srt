1
00:00:16,992 --> 00:00:18,996
take this, you're dirty.

2
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:38,542
Do not touch me.

3
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,660
Who cares!

4
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,540
Was I blind before?

5
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,240
Because I like him?

6
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,160
Forget.

7
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,360
Losing is good, jumping is also jumping.

8
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,480
Ignore it again.

9
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,390
Xu Yang, I saw that you didn't bring an umbrella today.

10
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,930
do you want to come with me?

11
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,290
He is well.

12
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,630
I saw that the rain was almost stopping.

13
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:24,830
When I finish my homework, I'll come back.

14
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:25,910
So I go first.

15
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:27,550
Okay.

16
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,520
Actually, there's no need to wait for me.

17
00:01:34,492 --> 00:01:36,040
Do you think I want?

18
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,140
I just wanted to finish this chapter.

19
00:01:40,055 --> 00:01:41,280
Who was waiting for you?

20
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,900
I'm ready to go.

21
00:01:46,436 --> 00:01:47,640
Hello, student.

22
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,280
Are you in your second year of high school?

23
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:49,920
I am.

24
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,560
Xu Yang, do you know him?

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,080
I know, he's in our class.

26
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,640
I'm his father.

27
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,560
I came to give an umbrella.

28
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,780
Is he in the classroom now?

29
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:58,640
Oh yes!

30
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,180
This is beautiful.

31
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,180
Xu Yang.

32
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,520
I still haven't met my mom and dad.

33
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,540
Xu Yang, come, hold the umbrella.

34
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,199
Xu Yang, take it.

35
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,278
Didn't you hear daddy say? you take the umbrella.

36
00:02:12,278 --> 00:02:13,698
is that you make people feel like you?

37
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,460
Come on, come on!

38
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,440
Grab it quickly!

39
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,460
I announce something before class.

40
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,436
At the gas ceremony next week,

41
00:02:19,436 --> 00:02:21,790
our class and the next class will join forces to produce an Ancient Song.

42
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,420
The theme is "affection".

43
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,880
Our class is in charge of Xu Yang.

44
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,300
Xu Yang, you can choose the other four students to make the Song.

45
00:02:31,062 --> 00:02:34,069
Don't choose me, don't choose me.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,420
I just found out that the classroom was occupied.

47
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,700
Let's go to the old auditorium.

48
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,280
There is a lot of empty space and few people.

49
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,320
"Old auditorium?".

50
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,120
Isn't there a special in the second semester of high school?

51
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,340
Let's wait for them to finish rehearsing.

52
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,100
Time is of the essence, how can there be so much time to wait?

53
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,380
You don't go, I go.

54
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,160
Let me tell you the truth.

55
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,080
I had a dream last night that the stage in that old auditorium collapsed.

56
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,920
I always dreamed of precision.

57
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,480
Last time I dreamed that I scored 98 points and I sure as hell didn't miss a single point.

58
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,000
Who believes?

59
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,060
Unless you say you had a recent dream, it won't come true.

60
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,820
Recent?

61
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,240
You know that lighthouse that broke for half a month, right?

62
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,980
Tonight is not lit.

63
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,980
