1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,260
Maybe it fell on the road.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,380
Forget it, just get my ticket and go in.

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:05,260
I'll be waiting here.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,280
Brother, my ticket was actually stolen.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,480
I still have photos on my cell phone.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,050
Alright, okay, let us in.

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,260
You have to have a ticket to enter, if I were you, I would go home.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,640
Let us in a little and we can sit on the outermost floor.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,240
Or just sit across the aisle.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,280
Little girl, if you don't have a ticket, accept your fate.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,440
Go back and study hard.

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,540
What are you weighing?

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,020
In fact, nothing.

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,860
Although it is a shame to miss the presentation, the knowledge points that made me enter the top ten are entirely my own.

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:51,980
I won't lose them no matter what.

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,040
Plus, I can hear it here.

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,300
You can hear?

18
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,640
Maybe, but I can't hear it clearly.

19
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,630
The May Day concert is complete.

20
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,070
Eating West Street wontons.

21
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,180
Grandma, where is Xu Yang?

22
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,740
I heard he went to study at a cram school or something.

23
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,920
Yes, he wants to compete and go to college to train.

24
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,820
Looks like I'm going to eat alone.

25
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,750
Grandma, do you want to eat wontons? I'll bring them to you.

26
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,980
Xu Yang, aren't you here?

27
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,160
I already know.

28
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,060
Grandma, I have something to do, I'm going out first.

29
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,220
That's it for today's class. Remember to review today's content when you return.

30
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,710
How did you come?

31
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,950
I'm here to pick you up after class. I'm happy today.

32
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,450
Come on, give me here, you must be tired.

33
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,040
I'm very happy to have a solution to the problem.

34
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,940
You are really good students.

35
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,140
It's more or less the same thing: there was sudden progress on a super difficult issue.

36
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,680
But I still have no ideas.

37
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,160
No idea, go back and check the conditions.

38
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,400
Condition?

39
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,660
So let me ask you: did you do anything in cram school that you've never done before?

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
No.

41
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,560
You weren't looking at that?

42
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,020
Isn't it possible that you are secretly watching Meng Ran?

43
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,800
You should be able to see everything.

44
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,890
Maybe I was in the photo and he saw it.

45
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:11,000
