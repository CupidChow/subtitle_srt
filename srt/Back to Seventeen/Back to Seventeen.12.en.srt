1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,000
Xu Yang, please help me.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,260
You can't always get what you want but...

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:21,700
It's okay.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,740
That's because you helped me.

5
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:26,640
I owe you a favor.

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,220
This 17 year old boy is so cute.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,460
I can see it written all over his face.

8
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,560
Xu Yang has been helping Zhong study a lot recently.

9
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,780
He feels sorry for her.

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,680
However, it is estimated that after today, Xu Yang will not have time to help her study.

11
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,700
For what reason?

12
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,140
Xu Yang, the exam will be held soon.

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,860
The teacher suggested that we, who learned well, help each other.

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,340
I may not have much time.

15
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,400
If you have any problems, ask the teacher to help you.

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,800
I saw you helping someone else yesterday.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,960
Furthermore, this was proposed by Professor Zhang.

18
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,640
Even if it was an offer, I could refuse it.

19
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,560
Zhong Xiao Xiao.

20
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,580
We have so much to study.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,460
You may not understand when you are young, but I returned all my knowledge points to the teacher after the college entrance exam.

22
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:37,480
These days have been like years, and suddenly I feel like studies don't attract me as much.

23
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,580
I really want to give up.

24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,620
Xu Yang, don't you think this cloud looks like a big mushroom?

25
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,580
Focus your attention, don't look outside.

26
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,940
You will be more like a tiger.

27
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,540
I want a student to solve this problem.

28
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,840
Who qualifies?

29
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,370
Zhong Xiao Xiao.

30
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,790
Xu Yang has been teaching her how to study.

31
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,810
I seem to have seen similar questions in Zhong Ying's book.

32
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,540
Zhong Xiao Xiao, why don't you try.

33
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,500
Then you can come.

34
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:10,730
The problem was very simple, why couldn't he?

35
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,500
I haven't studied this subject yet.

36
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,820
I'm sure Xu Yang taught it to you.

37
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:27,770
I used to be able to be in the top ten in physics, but now I'm older and forgetful.

38
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,750
Will I be looked down upon by someone younger?

39
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,950
No, I have to be in the top ten and punch her in the face.

40
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,200
The more you use it, the more is possible, and what is impossible?

41
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,910
