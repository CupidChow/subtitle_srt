1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,159
Have you...

2
00:00:03,805 --> 00:00:06,430
been bullied lately?

3
00:00:06,644 --> 00:00:07,964
- So... - You mean Xie Lin?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,460
No! We are in the same situation!

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,380
You don't always mix with Xie Lin and these people.

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,700
Isn't it because you want to protect me?

7
00:00:35,182 --> 00:00:36,800
Let me ask you something.

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,540
Yes.

9
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,240
Under what circumstances would a girl be obedient to a boy?

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,920
Or is it loyalty?

11
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,200
This must be a love affair!

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,840
Only if you like someone, will you listen to them.

13
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:49,222
It's not possible.

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,140
Who is obedient to you?

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,380
Who?

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:55,940
Who?

17
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,300
If you don't tell me I'll pinch you!

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,320
what?

19
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,820
"This must be a love affair!

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,420
Only if you like someone, will you listen to them."

21
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,160
Besides listening to her, what other performance would prove that girls like boys?

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,820
There is also the desire to meet up all the time.

23
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,670
Where are you going so late?

24
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,650
I'm going down there.

25
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,630
until later!

26
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,520
And the big night?

27
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,540
and on that day I want to eat dumplings from the west side of the city.

28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,820
Then?

29
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,729
Sorry, I forgot who I was this week.

30
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,150
How cooked do you want your fritters?

31
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,290
Okay, look, I can fix it.

32
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,190
Until later.

33
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,090
Wait a minute.

34
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,850
Did you come to me late to say this?

35
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,530
Don't you have my home phone number?

36
00:02:27,454 --> 00:02:29,510
That one, the phone ran out of power.

37
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,530
I happen to be right here.

38
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,470
In fact, here for you.

39
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,990
How did you know I wanted to drink this?

40
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,450
I haven't bought it in so long, since I came back.

41
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,110
I knew.

42
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,750
until later.

43
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,010
He's actually quite middle class.

44
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,780
Qin Yang, this Zhong Ying has been getting quite close to Xie Lin recently.

45
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,600
Won't you bring her breakfast?

46
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,320
When do you say she was in love?

47
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,520
She doesn't like you, she likes Xie Lin.

48
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,423
play it!

49
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,420
Not bad!

50
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,820
Chen Jiang 39.

51
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,060
Zhang Qiang 40.

52
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,360
Xu Yang 45.

53
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,060
What's your class like?

54
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,120
All good!

55
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,360
The best forty-five.

56
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,700
Our class is similar.

57
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,460
The most was Xie Lin, from 47.

58
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,640
Yes, two more than us.

59
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,140
Oh, right?

60
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,160
Professor, I just didn't play well and I want to try again.

61
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,460
what?

62
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,620
I wasn't in good shape and wanted to try again.

63
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,600
So together?

64
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,520
Come, together.

65
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,820
These young people are really energetic.

66
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,880
These two guys.

67
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,940
Get ready, get started!

68
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,640
Wow, Xu Yang is faster!

69
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,320
Xie Lin is now fast!

70
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,970
Xu Yang's speed, which will definitely win.

71
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,870
How did Xie Lin have one?

72
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,110
Xu Yang caught up and Xu Yang caught up.

73
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:46,450
I said How can it seem like Zhong Ying's ex-boyfriend and current boyfriend is giving you this secret?"

74
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,150
Don't talk nonsense!

75
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,090
zhong Xiao!

76
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,270
Doing a sit-up can pull your muscles up, and you can struggle enough.

77
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,450
What Is that it?

78
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,630
Well, I'm determined that you won't be my little brother in the future.

79
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,990
But you have to grant me one request.

80
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,170
What request?

81
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:17,710
That is, I wanted to date a girl, but I've never dated.
