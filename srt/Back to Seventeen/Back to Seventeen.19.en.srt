1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,630
Well, I'm determined that you won't be my little brother in the future.

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,990
But you have to grant me one request.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,170
What request?

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,710
That is, I wanted to date a girl, but I've never dated.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,570
Can you simulate a date with me for a day , and I'll teach you the process.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,370
I happen to have activity in the park this weekend, what will it be like?

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:20,890
It's up to you.

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,970
What you said, I went out with you over the weekend, and we both wrote it.

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:25,930
I said.

10
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,830
Yes.

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,490
xiao, are you coming or not?

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,150
See you on the weekends.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,680
Xie Lin's muscles are tense,

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,360
are

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,360
you

16
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,160
ok ?

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,660
beautiful, who are you going with?

18
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,180
Xie Lin!

19
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,860
If you're free, come with us!

20
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,420
No, I'm going to read a book.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,180
That skirt is really ugly.

22
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,140
Didn't you say it looked good?

23
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,140
How am I?

24
00:01:47,297 --> 00:01:49,140
Don't all girls like it now?

25
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,300
Look how nice it is!

26
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:58,840
Maybe they like it, I'll forget it. he is very blind.

27
00:02:01,442 --> 00:02:03,920
I knew I shouldn't use it.

28
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,280
yang!

29
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,740
hey colleague, you arrived first.

30
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,050
How are you here?

31
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:32,825
I...

32
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,075
I heard there's a market there,

33
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:37,593
you can find a manual.

34
00:02:38,089 --> 00:02:39,232
you came alone?

35
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,570
until later.

36
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,270
I'm here to read a book, let's check it out together?

37
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,560
This is so cute!

38
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,463
Look,

39
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:09,136
finding out they were actually together.

40
00:03:09,308 --> 00:03:13,767
and I heard that Zhong Xiao personally admitted that she was Xie Lin's girlfriend.

41
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:15,413
but I didn't think it was true.

42
00:03:19,076 --> 00:03:19,890
Xu Yiyang!

43
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,460
How are you here?

44
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,659
What a coincidence, are you here too?

45
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,960
Didn't someone say they were going to read a book?

46
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,513
Yes, we came here to read books, so we are here.

47
00:03:35,121 --> 00:03:36,100
Do you want to go along?

48
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,120
No, I see that she doesn't have the courage to study now.

49
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,600
What do you think of this one?

50
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,100
What attitude was that?

51
00:04:00,293 --> 00:04:02,430
What do you think?

52
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,830
Did you just see that expression on his face?

53
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,170
What does it mean to study without thinking?

54
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,350
I haven't said it yet, what did he do to help me make a decision?

55
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,230
Turns out you just didn't care what he said.

56
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,870
Unfortunately, regardless of her, you won't choose gifts?

57
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,230
What kind of girls do you like?

58
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,240
this is not

59
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,520
Are you picking?

60
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,200
Extraordinary people buy their own books

61
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,920
Extraordinary people don’t need to follow me.

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,880
extraordinary person

63
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,480
Aren’t you going to find Zhong Xiaoxiao now?

64
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,160
Aren’t you the same as me?

65
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,400
I like you

66
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,520
So I want to follow you

67
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,280
Do you like Zhong Xiaoxiao

68
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,240
So you want to find her
