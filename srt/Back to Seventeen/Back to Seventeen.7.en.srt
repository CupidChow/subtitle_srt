00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,778
You know that lighthouse that broke down by the sea for half a month?

2
00:00:04,414 --> 00:00:05,316
It will be bright tonight.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,310
Well, I remember that Xu Yang's family was close there.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,390
Xu Yang, are you going to see her tonight?

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,330
you Work hard.

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,120
Did you go to the beach last night?

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:40,780
I went.

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,240
Xu Yang, how was it?

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,240
Was the light turned on or not?

10
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,960

11
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:50,490
Yes.

12
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,020
It's brilliant.

13
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,340
See what I say?

14
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,180
I was sure dreaming about it.

15
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,340
The stage in that auditorium is really going to collapse!

16
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,620
Tell the other people we're not going.

17
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:08,900
Why is the canteen door being renovated again?

18
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,220
What a mess.

19
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,380
I heard it would take a few days, and the sound was still loud.

20
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,620
Bored to death.

21
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,220
"Canteen renovation?"

22
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,420
Xia Xiao, have you heard?

23
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,840
Xu Yang was injured by a wooden plank at the entrance to the cafeteria.

24
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,420
The canteen is working and seems to be quite serious.

25
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,840
Ultimately, it's time to be a word of caution.

26
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:28,740
Hey Xu Yang!

27
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,060
You must be careful when you go to the cafeteria on these two days.

28
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,520
You see that everything is working and you nod.

29
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,180
Like falling porcelain tiles or wooden boards or something.

30
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,880
Is it a dream again?

31
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,740
Yeah, I was there two days ago... Zhong Qiao,

32
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,060
The light was not on.

33
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,140
What?

34
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,860
The lighthouse was not lit last night.

35
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,620
I said I was lit just because they were at our table.

36
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,000
I don't want you to do that.

37
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,460
But I can't complain about you a second time.

38
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,040
Zhong Xiao, can you stop saying such absurd things in the future?

39
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,600
I'm not talking nonsense, you just don't believe me.

40
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,640
You find anything more ridiculous than you know.

41
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,980
But there are many things in this world that cannot be explained by science.

42
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,880
is You never try to believe.

43
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,900
He didn't even take my words seriously, what else did he help him with?

44
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,010
If he gets hurt and can't go to school, I'll have to suffer.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,200
Forget it, I'll help you one last time.
