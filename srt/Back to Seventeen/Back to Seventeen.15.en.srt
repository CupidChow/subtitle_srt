1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,000
Qingchuan No. 1 High School

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,200
Implementation to the next level

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:03,760
I forgot to do this

4
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,040
Let me take a look

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,920
Show me too.

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,520
Wow, who is this?

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,880
Isn't this Zhong Xiaoxiao?

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,560
Why do you have photos of her?

9
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,480
What is happening?

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,720
Xu Yang can do this

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,560
Zhong Xiaoxiao

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,880
He will be angry with me after this.

13
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,760
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,500
It was my mistake that

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,760
I accidentally put the photos

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,200
in your course booklet.

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,480
Forget what happened, but you need to know

18
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,800
I used to follow you every day for a reason.

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,480
I promise that I will never be like this again

20
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,320
and I will never wait for you at the cram school

21
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,320
again. I won't tell you this strange thing again.

22
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,240
Xu Yang you forget everything I said now.

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:48,720
Please don't worry
Please Xu yang

24
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,880
I Zhong xiaoxiao, I won't bother you anymore

25
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,580
Absolutely

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,920
Don't wonder if you got a bad rating

27
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,540
What

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,520
Do everything with half your heart

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,800
Zhong Xiaoxiao Aren't you on duty today?

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,520
Do you want to run away from duty

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,920
I almost forgot

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,000
I know I chased Xu Yang all day

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,800
The water bucket has been changed, you can clean the table

34
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,620
I will mop the floor

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,880
Zhong Xiaoxiao Let's have lunch together

36
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,240
I won't

37
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,280
be with Xu Yang at this time

38
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,460
So.

39
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,280
You didn't see anything last night,

40
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,760
did you?

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,180
I don't care about other people.

42
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:54,980
Xu Yang

43
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,160
See what I wrote here

44
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,380
Meng Ran seems to be looking for you all the time today.

45
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,480
You are very sensitive at this age.

46
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,220
She is the same.

47
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,419
That's right.

48
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,080
My math class failed again.

49
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,200
Lao Chang asked me to stay after school

50
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:13,940
You go first.

51
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,220
Oh

52
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,520
You just agree

53
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,640
Xu Yang is right

54
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,000
Don't jump when you should

55
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,160
Because I never listen

56
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,480
Hey, you there

57
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,440
what's going on?

58
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,360
Your name is Zhong Xiaoxiao

59
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,340
yes

60
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,720
Right

61
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,120
I just want to remind you.

62
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,720
From now on, you won't see or hear anything.

63
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,880
Just pretend you don't know anything.

64
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,400
Otherwise, I won't leave you alone.

65
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,460
Are you listening?

66
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,180
You heard?

67
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,080
Meng asked to say this, right?

68
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,000
I already said.

69
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,840
I don't care what she does.

70
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,280
What attitude is this?

71
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,840
Are you looking for a spanking?

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,900
Police

73
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,040
Do you think you can fool us?

74
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,160
I'll let you know straight away

75
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,680
I have a black belt in taekwondo

76
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,440
Oh, that scared me to death

77
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,120
I also have a taekwondo belt.

78
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,400
Where is your track?

79
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,960
What should I do if she really hits me?

80
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,360
When I was in high school, there seemed to be a boss.

81
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,200
Everyone seemed to be afraid of him.

82
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,240
What is his name ?

83
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,720
Why can't I remember for a moment?

84
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,420
Brother Xie

85
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,680
Brother Lynn

86
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,880
Never mind.

87
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,320
Fear them first and then speak

88
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,680
Did you know?

89
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,000
What are you talking?

90
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,120
You walk the streets

91
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,800
It's impossible not to hear about it.

92
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,400
You know ?

93
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,020
Brother Lynn

94
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,400
Brother Lynn

95
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,280
Yes, yes, it's him

96
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,840
Do you know what our relationship is?

97
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,060
Brother Lynn

98
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,200
Do you know Lynn?

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,120
Not just acquaintances.

100
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,120
Our relationship is closer than you think.

101
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,840
He is actually my brother.

102
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,880
I know you both

103
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,340
Ah

104
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,760
Girlfriend

105
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,240
Oh God help

106
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,880
Qingchuanyi, oh God

107
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,600
No no no

108
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,440
You say it wasn't the great flood that destroyed the dragon king's temple?

109
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,960
Do you know the whole family?

110
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,840
Tell me

111
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,480
Hello sisters

112
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,720
If anything happens on the road after graduation, you can look for me

113
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,080
Just call me

114
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,840
I have something else to do and I will go first

115
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,160
Just be here and walk slowly, it's okay.

116
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,180
OK

117
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,120
I didn't expect Brother Lynn to like this.

118
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,600
Of this kind of girl

119
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,880
Fortunately, I have good memories.

120
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,320
What are the good memories?

121
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,200
I recite ancient Chinese

122
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,320
Why are you here

123
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,000
I came to buy something

124
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,800
Yes, let's go home.

125
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,680
Go home

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,560
I will cook for you.

127
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,040
I wasn't looking forward to cooking.

128
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,040
Is Zhong Xiaoxiao you?

129
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,240
Who are you

130
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,360
That's right if it's you.

131
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,160
Our boss is looking for you.

132
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,480
Who is your boss?
