1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,000
You don't seem to be drinking your glass.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:10,100
♫ Keep you well, enjoy the peaceful summer ♫

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:17,260
♫ Don't stay at home, why don't you go to the beach? It's not a waste of time, it's okay ♫

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:21,360
♫ But I'll always be by your side ♫

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,660
I'm just trying it out.

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:30,620
♫ Throw it all away, oh, you could see it another way ♫

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,480
♫ Let's get closer, take off some more clothes ♫

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,740
I knew you wouldn't react.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,860
♫ Hold tight, don't run away, don't blame me, oh, oh ♫

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,860
♫ This is a scene, let's forget the scene, let's be quiet ♫ ♫

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,980
In this summer party, all the hardships, say goodbye ♫

12
00:00:50,300 --> 00:01:00,240
♫ I'll make you okay, leave you well, leave you well ♫

13
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,000
Good evening, Zhong XiaoXiao

14
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,980
This is what you asked me to bring and give you

15
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,960
I'll take it back and take a look

16
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,160
Xu Yang

17
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,880
Did you think of anything when you called me?

18
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,900
This is the tape you gave me before

19
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,900
I suspect it could be a critical support

20
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,620
Is it possible to put the tape in the camcorder?

21
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,280
Maybe

22
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:46,760
Do you

23
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,100
I'm not ready yet

24
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,200
Why don't you do it in a little while?

25
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,660
I still have something to do

26
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,800
This shop will disappear next year

27
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,120
Eat once and think about it

28
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,660
Hello, you are in the right place

29
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,260
We were here just now

30
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,540
I went to buy something and just came back

31
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,580
I've been here for half an hour

32
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,580
I haven't seen you

33
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,980
Are you going do the same thing?

34
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,220
I was already here

35
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,980
Little Sister

36
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,240
Are you looking for a boyfriend

37
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,220
You didn't know how to choose?

38
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,680
What are you talking?

39
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,620
Repeat what you said

40
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,360
Xu Yang

41
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,220
I feel like I have a nosebleed

42
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,620
I didn't touch you

43
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,360
I just said

44
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,279
Are you ashamed?

45
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:17,779
I'm sorry

46
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,740
this was really timely.

47
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,740
