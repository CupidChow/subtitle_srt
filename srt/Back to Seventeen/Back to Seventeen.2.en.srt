1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,023
Isn't that the DV you shot in high school?

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,640
This is an old antique, can it still be used?

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,100
Let me see.

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:05,740
Can't look.

5
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:06,320
Let me see.

6
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,040
Hurry up.

7
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:07,840
Let me see.

8
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:08,920
No.

9
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,300
Be careful!

10
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:09,800
No.

11
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,300
Give it to me.

12
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,580
Take care!

13
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,950
Where I am?

14
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,570
I'm dreaming?

15
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,830
That's what you told me to go out and give it to me.

16
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,710
Rain Rippl.

17
00:00:29,957 --> 00:00:31,234
I'll take it back and have a look.

18
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,380
Am I dreaming of high school?

19
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,480
Hey!

20
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,880
They also look out for people.

21
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,660
Since it's a dream, I always have to compensate, right?

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,600
After all, I don't know when the next time I have this kind of dream will be.

23
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:54,600
Hey!

24
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:06,830
Give me an explanation!

25
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:08,710
Not like words.

26
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,190
You said it's too much.

27
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,090
It's just a mess.

28
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:14,130
LaoWang.

29
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,310
Don't always get angry.

30
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:15,950
you will have more hair loss.

31
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:17,610
Zhu Qiao!

32
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,550
Be serious!

33
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,510
I urge you teachers to get in touch with your parents.

34
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,730
Reflect these situations clearly to him.

35
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,540
Forget.

36
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,540
The more you do it, the less interesting it gets.

37
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,120
I better wake up and go to work.

38
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,390
Hey!

39
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,210
Hey!

40
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,070
Hey!

41
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,170
Hey!

42
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,770
Isn't it really a dream?

43
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,971
Did I really go back to my sophomore year of high school?

44
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,020
Teacher Chen asked me to ask about your situation.

45
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,580
I'm fine...I'll continue my physics class after class.

46
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,640
I can't go to class.

47
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,880
It was like my foot had been pricked with needles.

48
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,140
I can't go any further!

49
00:02:27,807 --> 00:02:32,920
Just left?

50
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,890
I've been very stressed out lately.

51
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,590
Many behaviors are uncontrollable.

52
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:50,470
If you really care, can I ask you to come back?

53
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,180
Zhu Qiao.

54
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,600
Today's behavior led the teacher to mistakenly think we were practicing.

55
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,360
I hurt you too.

56
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,280
So I'm going to take you home today.

57
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,420
I hope that when you recover, you will explain to me.

58
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,620
Why did I suddenly go back to high school?

59
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,380
And my work?

60
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,740
I wouldn't get kicked out, would I?

61
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,340
My parents would be worried.

62
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,760
No, I have to find a way to get home.

63
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,520
The most classic wear are those few.

64
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,020
I can try to get home.

65
00:03:24,182 --> 00:03:25,652
or can i stay?

66
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,550
No no.

67
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,070
If I didn't go home, it would be ugly.

68
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:42,639
If the computer works, if it doesn't work, will I die?

69
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,580
Look at the road.

70
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,620
Isn't this a TV series you filmed in high school?

71
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,640
No, Zhu Qiao.

72
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,540
No, give it to me.

73
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,900
Take care!

74
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,860
It's that TV series.

75
00:03:59,170 --> 00:03:59,770
What?

76
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,990
I'm going first!

77
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:12,110
Glad to meet you at 17, at 27.

78
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,400
See you later.

79
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,870
What is the situation?
