00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000

00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
2

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
1!

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,395
why don't you send me back?

5
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:23,418
If you can't find it, forget it.

6
00:00:23,418 --> 00:00:25,418
I'm going to another store tomorrow.

7
00:00:25,418 --> 00:00:26,627
It's getting late, I'm leaving.

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,231
Bye Bye.

9
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:38,021
3-2-1!

10
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:47,788
eat delicious pancakes that don't close.

11
00:00:47,788 --> 00:00:48,881
Doesn't look bad to me.

12
00:00:53,578 --> 00:00:55,601
yes, it's amazing!

13
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:57,601
you have been playing this game so well since it was released.

14
00:00:57,601 --> 00:00:59,601
It's accelerating and you can't hit it.

15
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,601
Don't talk about me!

16
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:02,601
I'm better at this game!

17
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:04,601
looks so fierce!

18
00:01:04,601 --> 00:01:06,438
wow, she plays too much!

19
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:16,275
cute guy on the high school basketball team.

20
00:01:31,577 --> 00:01:33,321
what the hell!

21
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:37,855
I can't live a normal life like this.

22
00:01:37,855 --> 00:01:40,366
But I can't be with him all the time.

23
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,133
wang ting must be in love.

24
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:45,133
how do you know?

25
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:46,683
stay together every day

26
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:47,865
No matter where they are,

27
00:01:47,865 --> 00:01:48,934
two people are like Siamese twins.

28
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:50,934
can it be anything but love?

29
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,608
If you are in love with me.

30
00:01:54,608 --> 00:01:56,608
he has to stay with me every day.

31
00:02:01,445 --> 00:02:02,049
xiao!

32
00:02:05,746 --> 00:02:06,746
I like you do you

33
00:02:06,746 --> 00:02:08,745
want to fall in love with me?

34
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:19,582
We don't run.

35
00:02:19,582 --> 00:02:22,023
If your brain is flooded, pour it out quickly.

36
00:02:28,185 --> 00:02:28,813
See you tomorrow.

37
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,882
this time, the seat change will be by lot.

38
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:38,905
Of course, it can also be adjusted privately.

39
00:02:41,672 --> 00:02:42,811
Please please!

40
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:44,811
let me be at the same table as xu yang.

41
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:46,415
I really can't, the backseat is fine.

42
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:48,415
give me a chance to get close to me.

43
00:02:53,228 --> 00:02:54,577
Hey!

44
00:02:55,146 --> 00:02:56,127
can i move to your position?

45
00:02:56,899 --> 00:02:57,526
What?

46
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:01,223
look at my window.

47
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,316
a great place to sleep in class and play with your phone after class.

48
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:05,362
you do not want?

49
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:09,652
more...

50
00:03:09,652 --> 00:03:13,362
how about I change the spring afternoon walk with you and help you with your nonsense?

51
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:24,431
I didn't study so hard just to be at the same table as you.

52
00:03:25,384 --> 00:03:28,291
take care of your new tablemate.

53
00:03:29,779 --> 00:03:31,058
hey you, smile.

54
00:03:31,058 --> 00:03:33,058
is very difficult?

55
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,709
where do i put it

56
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,871
put it there, just help me put things there.

57
00:03:40,084 --> 00:03:40,979
Hey, let me show you.

58
00:03:42,927 --> 00:03:44,426
interesting?

59
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:49,519
you don't have to do that to sit with me.

60
00:03:51,077 --> 00:03:52,239
is required.

61
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,494
And I'm doing this for myself.

62
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:58,587
I will treat you like anyone else today.

63
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:02,424
Hey zhong xiao!

64
00:04:02,424 --> 00:04:04,424
bring things.

65
00:04:05,237 --> 00:04:06,470
He is well!

66
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,470
zhong xiao?

67
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:11,865
honestly with the same table.

68
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:13,865
I'm going to run around and I'm responsible for what happens.

69
00:04:23,353 --> 00:04:25,004
do your own thing.

70
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,701
you don't have to follow me.

71
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,631
how can this work? You said you were my responsible for me.

72
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,840
no one follows the boy step by step.

73
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,212
only when they were on the bus did they close their eyes.

74
00:04:45,212 --> 00:04:46,165
Pay no attention to the impact.

75
00:04:46,165 --> 00:04:48,427
If it were me, my mother would answer me to death.

76
00:04:48,474 --> 00:04:50,018
you are so thick.

77
00:04:53,373 --> 00:04:55,257
didn't you hear what they just said?

78
00:04:55,257 --> 00:04:55,977
Yes.

79
00:04:57,651 --> 00:04:59,279
this person wants to be happy.

80
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:02,232
The first step is to ignore other people's opinions!

81
00:05:03,952 --> 00:05:06,162
you'll understand when you're my age.

82
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:08,045
you are only three months older than me.

83
00:05:08,045 --> 00:05:09,556
Hey!

84
00:05:09,556 --> 00:05:11,161
how do you know?

85
00:05:11,393 --> 00:05:13,161
you just asked me to help you get your ID.

86
00:05:14,091 --> 00:05:15,161
someone fainted!

87
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,440
ok, i know what i'm saying is outrageous.

88
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,440
more from now on you must not leave me.
