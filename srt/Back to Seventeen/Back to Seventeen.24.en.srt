1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,940
I already said everything is fine.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,100
You are a troublemaker.

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,440
I feel dizzy after running on ice.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,180
You're feeling better now?

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,960
I am fine.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,480
Xu Yang, you are so cool.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,920
So, rest early.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,520
Goodnight.

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,180
Indeed, it is good to remain in this world.

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,600
My family is here.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,100
You are here too.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,740
Go to bed early.

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,660
If you're not feeling well,

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,880
I'll take a day off for you tomorrow.

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,660
No.

16
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,360
No doctor's appointment tomorrow?

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,620
It's so fun.

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,160
I have to go even if I don't feel well.

19
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,100
What are you looking at?

20
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,340
I just want to remember the days here.

21
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,540
I used to live a busy life.

22
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,540
I didn't remember those happy things.

23
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,620
Everyone,

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,660
I, Chen Jiang,

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,220
will bring you my original dance.

26
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,380
I will say goodbye to all my problems.

27
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,440
All the problems, say bye, bye

28
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,100
All the problems, say bye, bye

29
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,360
Baby, baby, happy birthday

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,540
Every day is wonderful

31
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,400
All the problems, say bye, bye

32
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,600
All the problems, say bye, bye

33
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,480
Ten years ago,

34
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,260
I must have stayed with ashamed to dance.

35
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,300
But now,

36
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,400
Happy Birthday

37
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,560
Happy Birthday

38
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,919
Three, two, one, go!

39
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,860
Happy birthday!

40
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,140
Xiaoxiao

41
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,660
Her condition doesn't look like a tumor.

42
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:29,920
Maybe...

43
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,960
You woke up so early.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
How are you feeling?

45
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,460
I am fine.

46
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,920
Okay, rest first.

47
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll get you some water.

48
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,240
I think it's hypoglycemia again.

49
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,400
I'm good now.

50
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,260
Let's go.

51
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,080
What is wrong?

52
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,820
I am fine.

53
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,540
Drink some milk.

54
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,040
Take a walk with her.

55
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,620
I...

56
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,040
I just choked.

57
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,660
Xu Yang

58
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,420
I want to see the sunrise.

59
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,020
Let's watch the sunrise.

60
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,040
The sea is so beautiful.

61
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,700
When I was in high school,

62
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,360
I had a lot of desires.

63
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,600
One of them

64
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,820
is going to the beach.

65
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,400
As a result,

66
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,880
such a small desire

67
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,000
dragged on for so many years.

68
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,120
It's good now.

69
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,480
After staying here,

70
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,560
I have plenty of time to make up for my regrets.

71
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,760
It must be very dry today.

72
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,080
Director Feng

73
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,280
You don't need to scold me anymore.

74
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,440
You've been feeling bad lately.

75
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,380
You should know

76
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,240
it is not a normal disease.

77
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,220
What do you mean?

78
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,760
You're getting worse and worse.

79
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,520
It's because you don't belong

80
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,480
in this world.

81
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:22,800
Then?

82
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,360
It's not good anymore.

83
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,660
Didn't I hide it?

84
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,060
Why are you with me?

85
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,500
It's not so bad.

86
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,880
At least not now.

87
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,120
I want to keep you here too.

88
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,820
But you shouldn't just exist on TV.

89
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,340
You also have to eat a lot of delicious food

90
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,740
and watch a lot of fun things.

91
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,400
You simply go to your future.

92
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,480
I will definitely come to you.

93
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,540
At that time,

94
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,780
I will tell you once again.

95
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,840
Zhong Xiaoxiao,

96
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,980
Zhong Xiaoxiao,
I like you.
