1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:05,241
Who bumped into my hair?

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,600
why are you in my room

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,040
you are in my room.

4
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,440
Why don't you lock the door when you go to sleep?

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,800
It's too dangerous!

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,720
What if it wasn't me who entered?

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,320
Can you imagine a dangerous person coming in?

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:34,820
What would you do?

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,640
Is there anyone more dangerous than you?

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,600
I will forgive you this time.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:42,980
pay attention next time!

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,500
Zhong Xiao?

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,725
did you stay up late last night?

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,319
It's all Xu Yang's fault he bumped into my hair in the morning, and I couldn't sleep well.

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,575
I have a dog and he was barking all night.

16
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,560
they heard wrong, they heard wrong!

17
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,520
Recently everyone is a little lazy.

18
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,600
It's almost time for the exam.

19
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,200
Guys, pull out the papers for the test.

20
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,120
See the first question first.

21
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,520
Anyway, my grades weren't good before.

22
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,840
I might be able to come back soon, right?

23
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,600
I really miss my cell phone Wi-Fi and my food.

24
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,680
Zhong Xiao!

25
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,440
you have a phone call.

26
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,240
I am going!

27
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,200
Hello?

28
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,560
hello, zhong xiao?

29
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:15,940
father!

30
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,000
When are you and Mom coming back?

31
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,440
I miss you so much.

32
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,960
We haven't been on a business trip for a long time.

33
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,680
it's just...

34
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,640
It seems like we haven't seen each other in a long time.

35
00:02:29,369 --> 00:02:31,830
Do not say that.

36
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,080
The principal called me,

37
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,520
what happened to your recent grades?

38
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,040
that's...

39
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,320
Yeah Why don't you have any motivation?

40
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,300
we will see now!

41
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,600
If you manage to be in the top ten

42
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,200
you will get to see your favorite band.

43
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,800
seriously dad?

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,340
Yes yes!

45
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,120
I'll buy you a ticket to go to their concert.

46
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,740
accepted!

47
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,520
so i want two can i?

48
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,320
If you manage to do this,

49
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,920
we'll give you as many as you want!

50
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,220
right.

51
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,260
Xu Yang?

52
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,280
If I work hard from now on,

53
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,760
can we make it to the top 10 in the final race?

54
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,040
If you dreamed, yes.

55
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,400
In fact...

56
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,005
I think it's better to knock out people with better grades than me.

57
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,840
can't you think of anything else?

58
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,120
beauty trap!

59
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,560
Stop playing around, zhong xiao!

60
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,360
I am not kidding!

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,560
What do you think...

62
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,360
I am fascinated by everything that is in front of me.

63
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,920
I still work harder to seduce fourth, third and second place!

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,280
So I'm number one?

65
00:03:53,797 --> 00:03:54,439
Wrong.

66
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,800
You have to be the first to be fascinated by being the first.

67
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,080
Who was first last time?

68
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,033
Eu.

69
00:04:09,614 --> 00:04:15,033
