1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
Zhong Xiao Xiao, are you finished? You will be late.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,340
I can't find my diary. You go first.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,660
Is important? Do you want me to help you find it?

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,300
There is no necessity. You go to school first.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,920
Is weird. I didn't put it here.

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,000
Qing Shang Jun.

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,480
Xu Yang, you are just in time.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,500
Hurry up and show something good.

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,860
It's so funny.

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,660
The first day of 2008.

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,980
I thought it was all a dream.

12
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,600
Who write this?

13
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,040
Who else? Your classmate, Zhong Xiao Xiao.

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,240
You're stupid?

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:36,800
Have more.

16
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,860
Is it fun to use other people's privacy for fun?

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,460
Zhong Xiao Xiao.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
Why are you arriving late?

19
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,620
I'm not late. What happened?

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,160
Their romance was spread throughout the class.

21
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,040
They're all talking about it.

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,100
Did you really think you were dreaming?

23
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,140
My diary.

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,980
Xu Yang.

25
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,040
Were you looking for this this morning?

26
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,140
Why do you have this?

27
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,240
You also think I'm making up a story, right?

28
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,300
It's not like that.

29
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,360
Actually I...

30
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:39,740
Zhong Xiaoxiao.

31
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,800
The director wants you to come to his office.

32
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,920
You are laughing?

33
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,540
Can you laugh?

34
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,180
Sir.

35
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,440
In between.

36
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,140
Zhong Xiaoxiao.

37
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,120
What is your relationship with Xie Ling?

38
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,120
What is your relationship with Xie Ling?

39
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,140
He just got into a fight with a boy in his class Zhang Hu.

40
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,340
Zhang Hu said he was just messing with you.

41
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,580
You're dating so soon.

42
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,000
Tell me.

43
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,160
What is your relationship with him?

44
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,700
That I date early?

45
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,620
It's just...

46
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,280
It's just a rumor.

47
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,460
I only hit him because he was annoying me.

48
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,000
This is not about Zhong Xiaoxiao.

49
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,640
The person I like

50
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,720
will be a school beauty.

51
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,620
I haven't messed up yet.

52
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,840
You're spreading a rumor to me.

53
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,580
How can I prove this?

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,340
Xie Ling.

55
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,140
You are a student.

56
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,280
Zhong Xiaoxiao.

57
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,260
You go back first.

58
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,060
OK.

59
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,300
I have to talk to your father today.

60
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,940
It's ridiculous.

61
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,540
So you actually hit Zhang Hu

62
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,280
not because of me?

63
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,860
It really isn't like that.

64
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,820
Last time, his hand was very dirty.

65
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,940
I couldn't take it.

66
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,360
You...

67
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,400
Do you like Xu Yang?

68
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,000
If you like him, just say so.

69
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,980
You don't seem like a reserved person.

70
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,760
In fact, I liked it.

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,380
I liked him.

72
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,160
I liked him a long time ago.

73
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,660
But now

74
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,660
we're not in the same world.

75
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,360
What is the problem?

76
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,140
I don't know.

77
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,180
I just know

78
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,200
as long as you like him,

79
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,700
he will definitely like you too.

80
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,200
After all,

81
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,460
a girl as good as you

82
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,100
is not difficult to fall in love with.

83
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,380
You are really a good boy.

84
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,940
Alright let's go.

85
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,860
See if he has anything to say to you.

86
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:47,860
Speaking of which,

87
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,760
I wish you could find a good girl.

88
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:55,980
Come with me.

89
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,420
Xu Yang.
