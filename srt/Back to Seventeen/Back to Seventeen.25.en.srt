1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,040
Xu Yang.

2
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,560
Zhong Xiaoxiao.

3
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,060
Hello, Xiaoxiao.

4
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:25,880
What are you doing?

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,120
Why don't you answer the phone?

6
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,520
I just fell asleep.

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,320
Have you slept until now after shopping?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,700
Shopping?

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,820
June 12.

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,500
The day before the class reunion.

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,180
The day before the class reunion?

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,800
What are you talking?

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,880
I will come to your house tomorrow at 9 o'clock.

14
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:52,720
Don't oversleep.

15
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,400
If you are late for your class meeting,

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,180
you will definitely be distracted.

17
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,660
This is very embarrassing.

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,580
OK.

19
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,360
So,

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,700
I just had a dream.

21
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,300
Xiaoxiao, Xiaoxiao.

22
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,600
What's wrong with you?

23
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,160
You were distracted today.

24
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,200
I am fine.

25
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,920
Oh my god, can you even use this?

26
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,520
It's the same thing.

27
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,820
It's the same as in my dream.

28
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,260
This is not a dream.

29
00:01:59,280 --> 00:01:59,860
It is not me?

30
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,520
Chen Jiang, where is Xu Yang?

31
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:08,880
Xu Yang?

32
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,440
He hasn't returned to China yet, right?

33
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,840
I didn't hear he was coming today.

34
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,600
I don't know.

35
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,160
So do you have his contact information?

36
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,240
Let me find it for you.

37
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,360
This is weird. I remember having it.

38
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,720
Why did it disappear?

39
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,520
Thanks.

40
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,160
Xia Xia, what's wrong with you?

41
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,980
Are you not feeling well today?

42
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,260
I'm very confused now.

43
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,680
I think I had a dream.

44
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,280
But this dream was very real.

45
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,000
I don't believe everything is fake.

46
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,040
Xia Xia.

47
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,580
I want to be alone.

48
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,960
I'm leaving.

49
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,180
Can you hear me?

50
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,420
Yes, but it's not very clear.

51
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,360
Last time you told me

52
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,880
that many things in this world

53
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,680
are very complicated to understand.

54
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,960
That's why I don't want to be too meandering.

55
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,460
I do not believe that.

56
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,880
But because of you,

57
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,840
I want to believe.

58
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,380
You said you believed me.

59
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,360
You also said you liked me.

60
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,440
How is this all fake?

61
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,980
Qiao Qiao, where are you?

62
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,040
Aren't you looking for Qu Yao?

63
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,480
I heard someone saw him at the door.

64
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,420
I don't know where he is now.

65
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,620
But he must be here.

66
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,600
Do you want to come?

67
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,460
OK.
