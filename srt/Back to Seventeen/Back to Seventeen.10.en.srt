1
00:00:00,379 --> 00:00:03,147
- hey, - your dad is still a mystery guest!

2
00:00:05,346 --> 00:00:12,584
The excellence of children is, indeed, inseparable from the influence of the home atmosphere.

3
00:00:12,584 --> 00:00:18,318
Although Xu Zang's mother and I were relatively busy at work, we never relaxed into Xu Zang's education.

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:27,660
Of course, the right amount of stress at home is still needed, but love and inclusion are most important.

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,980
I never ask my children for excellence, including my mother.

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,620
He never asked how much time he spends with his children, much less his family.

7
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:47,280
Of course, this is the responsibility of a man, a husband and a father.

8
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,560
Hello, what are you looking for?

9
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,960
In next week's issue of the paper, I propose that our class do anti-riot stories.

10
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,140
This topic is very far from us.

11
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,840
Yes, it's not a TV series.

12
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,820
Indeed, it is not far away, and violent forces can be seen everywhere in our lives.

13
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,580
School bullying, domestic violence, online violence and even cold violence are happening all around us.

14
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,080
We don't care that it doesn't exist.

15
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:54,200
Victims are sometimes reluctant to speak up because they feel that no one cares, so they sink deeper and deeper into the swamp of violence.

16
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,020
Divorced?

17
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,320
Do you believe that I kill you?

18
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:10,449
Talk to my lawyer, it's a guide, not a negotiation.

19
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:16,290
Even if our propaganda gives these victims a feeling of resistance, it makes sense.

20
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,610
I approve!

21
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:20,570
Just do it!

22
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:21,550
Good!

23
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,660
After that, where did you go with your mother?

24
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,920
My mother got a high-paying job, but she had to move to another city.

25
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,780
She said she had to earn some more money back before I graduated.

26
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,220
How about you?

27
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:52,460
My mom was going to rent me a room, and tomorrow morning I'm going to have a look.

28
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,800
The air on summer nights was very good.

29
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,110
zhong xiao.

30
00:03:08,994 --> 00:03:11,128
thanks.

31
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:33,620
- I am sleeping? - Is there a leak?

32
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,620
It is also said that this journey to and from school is very long.

33
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,640
It is not?

34
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,880
Then, Xu Yang's mother asked me to look closer.

35
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,840
This annexe is also close to the school, and I don't know if there is a suitable room?

36
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,840
May I give you a moment's attention to this room, but I don't know what kind of room this child wants to live in?

37
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,420
Ah, better to be close.

38
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,040
oh, good morning!

39
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,140
you let Xu Yang live with you?

40
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,600
Yes, my room is big, and the boy is a little more spacious.

41
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,320
Heck, our family has really grown.

42
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,820
In fact, there is no need to worry so much, we can look for it again.

43
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,980
Wouldn't it be that my family is small?

44
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,680
Well, anyway, our family really isn't big.

45
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,460
I don't mean it, I'm afraid of getting you in trouble.

46
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,920
No problem! no problem!

47
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,720
here is your room, which I vacated this afternoon.

48
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,400
If you see what's missing, I'll go with you to buy.

49
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,700
I live next door, and you're welcome to tell me anything.

50
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:46,920
Thanks.

51
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,140
Thanks? From now on it will be a family!

52
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,920
I mean... they all lived together anyway.

53
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,520
No, so we're roommates.

54
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,540
Well... then you pack your things first, and I'll be off.

55
00:05:06,713 --> 00:05:09,841
Subtitles annara fansub + kasiak fansub on YouTube.

56
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:24,419
Thirst...

57
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,930
Who bumped into my hair?
