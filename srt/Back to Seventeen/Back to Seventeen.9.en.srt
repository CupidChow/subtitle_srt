1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,140
Xu Yang

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,400
Not much time has passed,

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,920
Xu Yang must still be around.

4
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,900
Before today

5
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,480
he promised not to hit me in the face anymore

6
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,560
so it wouldn't be easy to see.

7
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:45,960
Why is that ?

8
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,120
It's no use...

9
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,460
I mean, why don't you tell anyone.

10
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,320
It's useless

11
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,700
The first time he did this

12
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,960
I was in my sophomore year of high school.

13
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,160
Why don't you listen to me?

14
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,440
Go to your room.

15
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,760
Got it, come here

16
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:20,800
But

17
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,040
What if you know

18
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,160
Mom

19
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:24,580
Um...

20
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,660
Did Dad hit you yesterday again?

21
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,180
How absurd

22
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,000
You're still young

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Daddy was just drunk

24
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,700
But don't worry

25
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,760
he promised he wouldn't drink anymore

26
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,380
I always thought

27
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,600
Maybe mommy is right

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,240
Maybe tomorrow will be a better day

29
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,760
I was wrong with this family

30
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,400
All Useless

31
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,080
We also weigh in resisting

32
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,320
Don't go away

33
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,320
Me I beg

34
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
you I'm not human

35
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,580
I'm a bastard

36
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,580
I beg you

37
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,580
You're no child

38
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,040
My mother was always patient

39
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,320
She held on for five more years

40
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,620
But patience leads nowhere

41
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,500
Don't you dare divorce me

42
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,580
I'll never let you go

43
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,580
I will to die with you

44
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,580
Hit me if you want

45
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,580
But don't hit my mother

46
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,000
I work hard with you

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,580
How dare you

48
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,580
Your life is mine

49
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,580
Don't disobey me Do

50
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,320
n't hit me in the face

51
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,160
The teacher will see tomorrow in class

52
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:48,680
Kneel down Kneel

53
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,000
down

54
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,580
I want to leave that place more than anyone else

55
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,080
But what I am now

56
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,260
I'm still not able to protect my mother yet

57
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,260
When I graduate

58
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,060
I'll take her away without hesitation

59
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,580
There's still

60
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,660
a year and thirty-five days to

61
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,240
go Doesn't your mother know?

62
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,320
You know

63
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,160
My mother the other day

64
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,460
She held my hand and said

65
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,900
That she was sorry

66
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,300
Xu Yang , I heard that name a lot in my school days

67
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,420
It seems to be blurred at this moment

68
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,820
Along with the memories of that time

69
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,420
The one who was always shining

70
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,160
seems to have a side where the sun doesn't shine

71
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,100
I said we're too sorry

72
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,100
It's okay your parents didn't come

73
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,660
and volunteered to clean the classroom

74
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,760
Are your parents in trouble too?

75
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,920
Ah, my grandmother must be home by now.

76
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,820
Hmm, no problem.

77
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,300
You two haven't told your parents

78
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,620
No, hey

79
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,300
it's possible that the principal's errands

80
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,300
This shouldn't be possible

81
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,500
So my parents must be rushing to this result

82
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,540
I'm so happy

83
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,540
I want to get the best grades

84
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,540
I can't wait for the parent meeting

85
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,980
As for the situation of students'

86
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,720
learning this semester

87
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
, let's talk about that first.

88
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,960
But first, there's a father who wants to surprise his son.

89
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,400
Let's ask Xu Yang's father

90
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
to share his

91
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
educational experience with us

92
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
during his busy schedule.

93
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,760
Applause !!!

94
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,320
-Hey, your father is still a mystery guest.
