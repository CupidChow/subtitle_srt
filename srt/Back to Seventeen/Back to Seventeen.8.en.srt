1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
- Are you well? -Take care.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,320
- You almost hit your head.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,340
-I am well thanks.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,160
Did I hurt you?

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,960
Weird, he wasn't hit by a plank, how could he still be injured?

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,330
There is also pain in the right shoulder, indicating that it is a pain in the heart.

7
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,210
- Are you well?

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,090
-Everything is fine.

9
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,610
I'm still not well, you can go on.

10
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,190
I'm going to the infirmary to get some medicine.

11
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,470
Did you get hurt?

12
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,130
Where is the injury?

13
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:42,690
Let me see.

14
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:52,200
You won't let me see what kind of injury you have, how can I prescribe you medicine?

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,880
Student, are you being bullied?

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,960
No, I just got hurt while playing.

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,040
- Was it in the chest or somewhere else?

18
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:01,520
Let me see.

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,020
-Xu Yang?

20
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,540
I have medication here, you can use mine, don't waste the ward's resources.

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,420
- Goodbye, teacher.

22
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,680
-Thank you teacher.

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,600
I took it the last time I went to the infirmary, there are still a few left.

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,340
Thanks.

25
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,300
How did you get this?

26
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,520
playing, it's normal to happen.

27
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,600
Did you fight with someone?

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,900
How do you know?

29
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,370
Forget it, don't think too much about it.

30
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,510
You are still in a rebellious period, which is normal.

31
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,590
If someone is really bullying you, you tell me.

32
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:51,790
I protect you.

33
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,830
Come on, go back to the classroom.

34
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:02,610
Before class, let's know about it.

35
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,650
To match this recitation activity, the school website needs to have a small record in the previous period to warm up in advance.

36
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,530
It is also a portrait of the real situation between your students and their parents at home.

37
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,010
So how many of your tablemates are responsible for taking notes, okay?

38
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,090
It's not me who goes to your house, it's the teacher.

39
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:24,710
Right.

40
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,390
In the future, the quality of this image looks quite old.

41
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,850
Don't smile too much while I'm recording, otherwise it will be very discordant.

42
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,170
Your dad is obviously going to smile, but just act normal.

43
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,410
Come, taste uncle's food.

44
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,750
Hey, are you going to put this on TV?

45
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,970
Ah, it will be on the school website.

46
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,610
Uncle, you can just maintain your usual state of being, with no pressure.

47
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,170
Hell, that's how it used to be in this house.

48
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:08,470
Xu Yang, the same student did not mention to tell daddy before, daddy is good at cooking some good dishes, really, this kid.

49
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,730
The vegetables are ready, eat.

50
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,350
Oh, right.

51
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,480
Hurry up, sit down and eat, eat fast.

52
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,860
Well, isn't the aunt here?

53
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:23,920
Hmm ?

54
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,760
Oh, she's working overtime.

55
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,240
Eat fast, eat fast.

56
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,800
Xu Yang, since I was a child, I love to eat the dishes I cook.

57
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,880
Hey, you eat too, come, try what uncle cooks.

58
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,700
When you get home, let Xu Yang know.

59
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,300
No fun often, prioritize studies.

60
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,200
Well, goodbye uncle, see you tomorrow Xu Yang.

61
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,640
Don't run, be careful.

62
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,460
The camcorder.

63
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,610
Uncle, it looks like I forgot to take the camcorder.

64
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:30,350
Oh good.

65
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,350
Wait here, I'll bring it.

66
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,160
And Xu Yang?

67
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,020
Ah, that, he went to play with his friends.

68
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,120
You guys love to play games at your age.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,780
Goodbye Uncle.

70
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,940
Well, goodbye ah, goodbye.

71
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,590
Why did you forget to turn it off again?

72
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:04,760
I didn't expect Xu Yang's temper and friends.

73
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,090
You guys love playing games at your age, really.

74
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,350
He wasn't hit by a plank, how could he still be hurt?

75
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,970
Because I have a father who is often drunk and drunk to the point of carelessness.

76
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,590
Do not fool yourself.

77
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,590
