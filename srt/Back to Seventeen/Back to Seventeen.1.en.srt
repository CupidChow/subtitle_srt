1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,355
Name: zhong xiao. age: 27.

2
00:00:03,355 --> 00:00:05,355
Ah! 17.

3
00:00:08,517 --> 00:00:11,657
A strange thing happened to me recently.

4
00:00:11,657 --> 00:00:16,424
at 27 I feel like I'm stuck at my 17.

5
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:21,493
I finally got the dress for tomorrow's meeting.

6
00:00:21,493 --> 00:00:25,074
I don't know who came up with the idea of ​​wearing a dress to a meeting.

7
00:00:26,608 --> 00:00:29,260
I go home first.

8
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:33,004
go back to China.

9
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:35,004
why are you making noise.

10
00:00:35,004 --> 00:00:37,004
Haven't seen you in years, I have no idea.

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,236
If you have an idea, I'm 17 and you're 18.

12
00:00:41,236 --> 00:00:41,968
is different.

13
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:45,863
zhong xiao, you can hide it from others, but not from me.

14
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:49,979
who chased everyone around with a camera every day in high school?

15
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:51,979
Where is it?

16
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:53,979
I don't know if it's bad or not.

17
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:16,025
xiao zhou, here!

18
00:01:17,722 --> 00:01:19,676
Hey, where is the bathroom here?

19
00:01:19,676 --> 00:01:20,311
there!

20
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:21,398
thanks.

21
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:31,049
The third.

22
00:01:31,886 --> 00:01:33,025
did you not say,

23
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:35,025
when you bought the clothes, that it is absolutely impossible to clash with the new clothes?

24
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:40,141
I decided to change.

25
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,141
happens, that My clothes are in the car.

26
00:01:45,954 --> 00:01:47,815
Hey, guess what I just saw.

27
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:49,815
when he came, all the girls came.

28
00:01:49,815 --> 00:01:51,815
do you really say that?

29
00:01:51,815 --> 00:01:53,815
have you seen his girlfriend?

30
00:01:53,815 --> 00:01:55,815
girlfriend dreamed that they were together.

31
00:01:55,815 --> 00:02:00,721
that said, I don't know if I'm wearing a limited hasty dress.

32
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:04,814
Ah, I don't know how many girls will break their hearts.

33
00:02:10,488 --> 00:02:12,976
Oh, are you leaving now?

34
00:02:12,976 --> 00:02:16,836
in fact, you also know that I came today to give the DV.

35
00:02:16,952 --> 00:02:20,184
So since he has a girlfriend, it's not appropriate for me to see him again.

36
00:02:21,114 --> 00:02:25,509
I'm right on the way out, can you help me deliver the DV? Okay okay.

37
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:30,299
Are you sure you put it on the table here?

38
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:33,554
why?

39
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:35,554
I'm coming now.

40
00:02:36,716 --> 00:02:38,181
Still don't see?

41
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:40,878
I go there.

42
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:44,808
how long to see you.

43
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,854
Today is the monitor's birthday.

44
00:02:48,854 --> 00:02:50,854
where are all the presents?

45
00:02:50,854 --> 00:02:54,481
because it will not be considered a gift for the monitor, right?

46
00:02:58,457 --> 00:02:59,574
I'll get the medicine.

47
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,736
will you come back this time?

48
00:03:07,736 --> 00:03:09,736
currently there is no return track.

49
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:10,247
good to be home.

50
00:03:10,247 --> 00:03:12,247
after everyone is here, we often get together.

51
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,828
she is stealing something.

52
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,828
you stop there!

53
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:19,386
pretending to be a lady of etiquette, right?

54
00:03:19,386 --> 00:03:21,386
you're brave.

55
00:03:26,362 --> 00:03:27,874
zhong xiao? smiled at me. I thought I was stealing.

56
00:03:29,432 --> 00:03:31,618
you work here?

57
00:03:31,618 --> 00:03:33,618
I flapped my shirt.

58
00:03:35,571 --> 00:03:36,711
long time without seeing you.

59
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:38,711
yes, long time no see you.

60
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:44,315
Hey, today is the monitor's birthday and all the gifts are together.

61
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:47,198
do you want to ship separately?

62
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:49,198
What is that?

63
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,825
Isn't that the humble DV you picked up in high school?

64
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:54,825
This is an antique, can it still be used?

65
00:03:54,825 --> 00:03:56,825
hey, can't you look.

66
00:03:56,825 --> 00:03:58,825
No!

67
00:03:58,825 --> 00:04:00,825
give me back!

68
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:02,825
Careful!

69
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:03,359
give me back!

70
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:05,359
take care!
