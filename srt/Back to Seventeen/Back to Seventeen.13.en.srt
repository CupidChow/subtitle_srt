1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,860
I used to be good at physics. Can I get into the top 10? I'm just older now.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,540
I was despised by a child.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,520
In no way.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,700
I need to get into the top ten and punch her in the face.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,900
The more you try, the more is possible, what is impossible?

6
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,590
For the last photo of the recitation activity, you choose one to return to Xiaobao.

7
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,680
Xu Yang, can you help me do this.

8
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,580
Sorry, I forgot to knock on the door.

9
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:23,780
I disturbed you.

10
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,320
You are that kind of person, you can continue, I will ask you tomorrow.

11
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,960
Come, replenish the body.

12
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,440
You got it wrong.

13
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,350
I reached the tenth.

14
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,430
I'm running to tell my father.

15
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,770
So that's why you made the top ten?

16
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,250
Yes, my father's reward.

17
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,090
Don't you like it either?

18
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,370
Thank you for helping me do the lessons, please let's see together.

19
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,650
I still do not.

20
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,810
No, you have to go.

21
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,410
If you don't go, I won't be able to watch.

22
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,970
I mean, the concert ends late.

23
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,810
I'll be scared to go home alone.

24
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,550
Plus, you can't study every day.

25
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,530
Believe me, tomorrow will be an unforgettable day.

26
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,210
Is that what you mean by unforgettable?

27
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,110
Bitter before sweet, bitter before sweet.

28
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,070
Just a little more and we're almost there.

29
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,850
Don't push me.

30
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,610
Fortunately I wasn't late.

31
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,030
What about my tickets?

32
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,130
Probably lost along the way.

33
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,470
Forget it, you take my ticket and go in.

34
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,450
It's here...

35
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:41,850
