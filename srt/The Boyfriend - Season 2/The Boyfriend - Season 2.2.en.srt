1
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,449
You were the first to see
us walk in here, one by one…

2
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,851
- The second.
- Fill the room.

3
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:20,687
When I think back to how the two of us
were at first, it's hilarious.

4
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,956
- Bomi was here…
- I couldn't make out their faces.

5
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,859
There was this light here,
and I was like, "Wait, is someone here?"

6
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:27,527
- And you were like, "What?" Right?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:30,830
- The third person showed up.
- Yeah, you two knew each other, right?

8
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:32,532
- We knew each other.
- Thought so.

9
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:33,967
I got here and I saw Izaya.

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,603
- It was a surprise.
- I was like, "What is he doing here?"

11
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:39,606
- I didn't know anyone. Anyone at all.
- Yeah.

12
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:43,343
When I saw Izaya, I was like, "Wait,
aren't you supposed to be in Australia?"

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,879
When I saw you, I was like,
"Aren't you supposed to be in Spain?"

14
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,515
- <i>Oh, it's starting.</i>
- That's so funny.

15
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:50,650
I was real surprised to see you.

16
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,253
Izaya, I thought
we were connected on social media.

17
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:54,587
- Like on Insta?
- No, we're not.

18
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,923
- I thought we were connected before.
- Mm.

19
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,760
- Maybe you unfollowed me?
- No, no, no. I didn't unfollow you.

20
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,762
- Don't you ever update?
- Careful.

21
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,431
- What?
- Don't you post?

22
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:05,598
No, not very often.

23
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,701
Okay, that's why I thought
we weren't connected any longer.

24
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,572
- <i>Wow, wow, wow</i>!
- <i>Ooh!</i>

25
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:13,807
<i>Wow, wow!</i>

26
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:21,414
<i>Yeah, yeah </i>

27
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:24,417
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- I like it when you're tipsy</i>

28
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:27,053
<i>Naughty little thrill seek </i>

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,623
<i>Oh, oh, we can keep it flirty</i>
<i>Not too dirty </i>

30
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,725
<i>Does everyone know</i>
<i>how to snowboard and ski?</i>

31
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,727
<i>Some are better snowboarders than others.</i>

32
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:35,762
<i>That's right.</i>

33
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,730
<i>You tell by the way they get on the lift.</i>

34
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:38,998
<i>Yeah, you're right.</i>

35
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:41,634
- <i>And how they get off.</i>
- <i>Also how they get off.</i>

36
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,304
- I'll get on the one after this one.
- Okay.

37
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,673
- I'll get on with Huwei.
- Go with Huwei.

38
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,042
- You?
- I can go by myself.

39
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,543
- No, it's fine.
- Sure?

40
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,579
It's totally fine. It'll be fine.

41
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,647
<i>Gonna get down on the floor</i>

42
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:58,952
- We can finally talk in private.
- You're right.

43
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,653
- Do you want to?
- Sure.

44
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,156
I wanted to ask you
about the letters we had to write.

45
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,391
- You haven't asked about that yet?
- No, I haven't.

46
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,927
No way. So, who did you write to?

47
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,930
What? You want me to say here?

48
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,065
You can just say it.

49
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,133
- Really?
- Yeah.

50
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,870
It's embarrassing.

51
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:20,206
- You don't have to tell me, then.
- But you can tell me?

52
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,842
- I'm not telling you.
- Why? So, you want me to tell you?

53
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:26,012
- But you don't want to tell me?
- I'm not telling you. No way!

54
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,115
- I won't tell you either.
- If we go by seniority, you tell me first.

55
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,784
It's the other way around.
The youngest goes first.

56
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,387
You tell me first, you're older.

57
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:39,325
I wanted to tell him, but couldn't
for some reason, that I wrote to him.

58
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,195
I just… I just got, well… It was silly.

59
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,730
I just got nervous.

60
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,399
I got nervous and couldn't tell him.

61
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,201
I thought I was the type
who could speak up,

62
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,036
but in that moment, I just couldn't.

63
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,905
Something… something crossed my mind.

64
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,940
The thing is, now… I wanna tell him.

65
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:57,577
<i>Now I'm like,</i>
<i>"Why didn't I tell him before?"</i>

66
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,446
<i>I really regret it.</i>
<i>I also noticed his vibe today.</i>

67
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:04,751
He was giving off a good vibe.
He had a real sexy vibe today.

68
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,820
MEMBER OF THE THAI NATIONAL JUDO TEAM
GRADUATE STUDENT

69
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:10,256
You got this. Stand up.

70
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,859
When you're up,
shift your weight onto your heels

71
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,327
and come down this way, towards me.

72
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,396
- Sure I won't fall forward?
- You won't.

73
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,830
- I won't? Okay.
- No.

74
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,832
If you believe you won't fall, you won't.

75
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,770
Let's try.

76
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:27,907
- Try to stand up. Come on, get up.
- You're so strict.

77
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,742
- Stand up.
- You're so strict.

78
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,811
- Stand up. Stay up.
- I can't. Whoa!

79
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,414
Hey… try to stand up.

80
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,317
Yeah, that's it. Good, that's it.

81
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,718
Yeah, that's it. Just like that.

82
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:42,288
Yeah, that's it, good, yeah.
Yeah! Okay, this way.

83
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,526
Yeah, that's it. That was good. Hah!

84
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:47,927
You did it!

85
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,063
- So that's how you do it? Okay.
- Yeah.

86
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:55,535
- <i>He's already snowboarding? Wow!</i>
- <i>He learned so fast.</i>

87
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,870
- <i>He's ready to compete!</i>
- <i>What a genius!</i>

88
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:01,341
He's so athletic. I bet
his core is stronger than anyone else's.

89
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,543
- That was great!
- Hooray.

90
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:08,014
He can stop where he wants to stop,
and go where he wants to go. Awesome.

91
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,388
Wait, I can't do this.

92
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,657
I can't do this!

93
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,627
I can't…

94
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:22,762
Don't leave me behind!

95
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,979
<i>Wanna get your body moving with me…</i>

96
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:43,149
Hu-chan improved so fast.
I mean, come on! Look at him!

97
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,550
- He's good at everything.
- Hang on.

98
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,352
- He's so good.
- He's just… too fast.

99
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,421
He took one lift
and he's already over there.

100
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,523
He's amazing. He really is!

101
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,126
Look at Huwei.

102
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:57,030
<i>And be down on the floor</i>

103
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,098
<i>- Make it better</i>
<i>- On the floor</i>

104
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,566
<i>Make it better</i>

105
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,969
<i>- Break that beat down</i>
<i>- On the floor</i>

106
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,771
<i>- We make it better</i>
<i>- On the floor</i>

107
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:08,107
<i>- We make it better</i>
<i>- On the floor, we make it better</i>

108
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:10,343
<i>Look how cool he is.</i>

109
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,211
<i>He really looks like he can snowboard.</i>

110
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:13,913
- <i>He does.</i>
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

111
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,782
<i>On the floor, we make it better</i>

112
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,484
- Good job.
- I can't do this anymore.

113
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,887
- What?
- I can't take this anymore.

114
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,322
- My butt hurts.
- Hah!

115
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,257
Izaya, let's go together.

116
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,327
- Okay, let's go.
- All right, we're off.

117
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,036
- I never would've guessed we'd meet here.
- Neither would I.

118
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,705
- Oh!
- Oh, here it comes.

119
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,340
- We've been waiting.
- Finally gonna talk.

120
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,208
Were you surprised?

121
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:49,782
Well, I'm someone who strongly
believes that everything has a meaning.

122
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:56,155
I honestly never thought… I never
would've guessed I'd see you here.

123
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,156
Mmm.

124
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:00,026
- At first, I regretted being here.
- Really?

125
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,895
Maybe not regretted, but, uh…

126
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,599
What I mean is that,
at first, I didn't want to see you.

127
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,167
Really?

128
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:10,470
I was really feeling confused.

129
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:14,140
I wasn't sure how to interact with you,
or what I should say.

130
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:18,411
You know, the last time we met was two…
two and a half years ago, right?

131
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,113
- That sounds right.
- I think so.

132
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:23,015
And back then,
we had an honest discussion.

133
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:26,085
After that, we…
we both went our separate ways.

134
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,053
Hmm.

135
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,793
But the fact that we meet again
must have some sort of meaning.

136
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,662
- I think it does mean something.
- I think so too.

137
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:40,166
You know, there are things
I wanna work on,

138
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:44,737
and I was hoping
that I could work on them with you,

139
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,006
going forward.

140
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,710
I had absolutely no idea
you felt that way.

141
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:53,880
I'm embarrassed.

142
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,651
<i>I wasn't expecting</i>
<i>to have this conversation on the lift,</i>

143
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,987
<i>so I was pretty flustered. </i>

144
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,624
<i>Everything I was feeling,</i>
<i>my emotions, overflowed.</i>

145
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:11,030
I was trying very hard to keep
my past feelings hidden deep inside

146
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,598
while interacting with him.

147
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:17,136
But then I started to realize
that maybe I wasn't

148
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,908
truly facing
the real emotions I was feeling.

149
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:27,980
I realized that hiding them, that
running away from those feelings is easy,

150
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,584
and if I did that, I knew I wouldn't be

151
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,020
any different from
the person I was before.

152
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,556
So I decided to face these feelings.

153
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,659
And I think that by finally doing this,

154
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,229
I'll be able to move forward in my life.

155
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:57,210
<i>- "Think easy," she said</i>
<i>- She said</i>

156
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,946
<i>"Forever young and so wild"</i>

157
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:03,015
<i>"Or pull a gun and then fire it"</i>

158
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:06,419
<i>- "Easy," she said</i>
<i>- She said</i>

159
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:12,425
<i>"You're never young if you don't run</i>
<i>So get over"</i>

160
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,661
<i>- We still got walls on both sides</i>
<i>- Sides</i>

161
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,263
<i>Maybe</i>

162
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,099
<i>- I wanna know how to climb</i>
<i>- Climb</i>

163
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,534
<i>We're blind, blind</i>

164
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,970
<i>- Blind</i>
<i>- How'd we get air all this time?</i>

165
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,072
<i>- This time</i>
<i>- These things</i>

166
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,641
<i>- These things</i>
<i>- I never thought when you were mine</i>

167
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,444
<i>We used to break it together</i>

168
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,412
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

169
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,583
<i>We used to dive</i>
<i>In our highest feelings</i>

170
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,586
<i>Are we growing older together?</i>

171
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,555
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

172
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:47,260
<i>I don't wanna miss anything</i>
<i>When I'm dreaming about</i>

173
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,530
<i>When we were dazed and confused</i>

174
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,266
So, Izaya and William finally talked.

175
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,734
YOSHIMI, CHIAKI, THELMA, DURIAN

176
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,968
They got some one-on-one time.

177
00:08:56,035 --> 00:09:00,540
But didn't you find William's reaction
to what Izaya said a little odd?

178
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,775
It felt as if he was trying to show Izaya

179
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,311
that he wanted to keep things
more neutral for now.

180
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,446
- You're right.
- I think that's exactly right.

181
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:10,249
One thing that bothered me, he kept
his sunglasses on the whole time.

182
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,183
Oh!

183
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,353
I mean, don't you wanna push them up
when you're on the lift?

184
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,088
It's different for everyone.

185
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,157
- Everyone pushes up?
- Apparently.

186
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,393
You know, the glare
from the snow is no joke.

187
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:25,264
But don't forget, William also
took the lift with Jobu and had a talk.

188
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:29,168
He specifically asked him,
"Can we have a private conversation now?"

189
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,102
Mmm.

190
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,271
He seems to be
a free-spirited flirt, right?

191
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,941
- Maybe because he's romantically popular?
- Mmm.

192
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:37,176
Or it could be that
he's just a natural charmer.

193
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,011
- He's used to having admirers.
- Yeah.

194
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,680
That is possible, yeah.

195
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,482
Thank you for doing this.

196
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:44,517
Uh-huh.

197
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,686
- Let me know if it hurts…
- Will this hurt?

198
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,621
- No, it doesn't hurt.
- Don't hurt me!

199
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,023
- It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.
- Does it hurt? Does it hurt?

200
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,992
- Was it too strong?
- It was a bit strong.

201
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,962
- Tell me exactly where it hurts.
- It hurts here.

202
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,631
- This side?
- It's not the same as me.

203
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,299
I must've fallen like this.

204
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:03,603
Ow, that hurts.

205
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,738
- Oh, like that, huh?
- Oh, that side.

206
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,473
I sprained it the other way.

207
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,145
- <i>Oh, wow!</i>
- <i>Oh no! That must really hurt!</i>

208
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,547
<i>So it really aches here.</i>

209
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,582
- Oh, so you probably sprained it this way.
- Yeah.

210
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:17,683
Do you use this machine?

211
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,753
Yeah, of course.
I bought this when I injured myself.

212
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,623
They say using an ultrasound device
helps fractures heal faster.

213
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:24,624
Hmm, I see.

214
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,059
- Why did he bring an ultrasound device?
- Priceless!

215
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,963
- Does he usually carry one around?
- It's my first time seeing that.

216
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:35,534
- I think it feels a bit better now.
- Oh?

217
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,403
- It's just your imagination,
- Oh, okay.

218
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,338
- It doesn't work <i>that </i>fast.
- Okay.

219
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,309
My turn, if you please. Okay.

220
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,877
<i>It's just the two of them.</i>

221
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,814
<i>Oh, applying</i>
<i>the ultrasound gel is a little sexy.</i>

222
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,816
- Feels good.
- <i>He put a lot on!</i>

223
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,019
<i>Doesn't this feel like</i>
<i>something from a movie?</i>

224
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,955
<i>It's like the pottery scene</i>
<i>from the movie </i>Ghost.

225
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,890
Were you naturally good at judo?

226
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:01,193
No, not at all.
I mean, I'm not even that good at it now.

227
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,996
So, when did you start thinking
about becoming a pro?

228
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,831
It's not like my goal was to become a pro,

229
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,134
but if I was gonna do it,
I wanted to give it my all.

230
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,135
Yeah, I get that.

231
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:11,671
At first, I didn't want to do it
because it was such a hassle.

232
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:12,672
- You know?
- Mmm.

233
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,541
But once I got started, I'm
the kind of guy who really gets into it.

234
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,110
- Oh.
- So that's why I did it.

235
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,050
<i>We got really close</i>
<i>and started having more physical contact.</i>

236
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:28,654
I might have physical contact with people
unconsciously, although I'm not sure,

237
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,424
but if I like someone and I know it,
I probably won't touch them.

238
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,927
I probably won't be able to touch Huwei,
at least not yet.

239
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:39,231
I wonder why. If I follow my theory,
then I must like him.

240
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,036
- The cooking team will cook.
- Okay. Thank you.

241
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,473
- Let's talk while we cook.
- Okay.

242
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,909
- What's your type of person?
- Someone tall.

243
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:53,179
I mean, obviously,
I think very well-built guys

244
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,048
who are popular with gay men
are really cool.

245
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,084
But the fact of the matter is,
unfortunately,

246
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,752
I don't end up dating those kinds of men.

247
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,921
- Oh.
- I date really normal people.

248
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,090
Like, people who are really plain.

249
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,525
- Oh.
- Those are the people I date.

250
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,161
- What about you, Huwei?
- Who, me?

251
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,765
- I prefer someone with a pretty face.
- Someone pretty?

252
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,633
- Someone pretty?
- Right. Yeah.

253
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,304
I don't mind if his face
and appearance are a bit masculine,

254
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,708
but if his personality is too manly,
then that can be very off-putting for me.

255
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,444
- That's kinda harsh.
- Hmm.

256
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,947
I know this can be
considered a stereotype,

257
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:31,050
but you've been a professional judoka
for a while, right?

258
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:35,621
And, as a professional, you've been around
men who are very masculine.

259
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,491
- Yeah, I have.
- You've never liked any of them?

260
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,594
- No, never.
- Not even once?

261
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,499
- <i>Hiroya was happy to hear that.</i>
- <i>Oh!</i>

262
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,401
I mean, someone with a pretty face,
how can you go wrong with that, right?

263
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:52,271
- You can't go wrong with that.
- No one hates someone with a pretty face.

264
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,173
- No one.
- Yeah, that's true.

265
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,809
Wow! That looks great.

266
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,079
Wanna taste?

267
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,250
- Wait, I can't taste that. Too scary!
- <i>He's giving him too much!</i>

268
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,851
That's way too much for a taste.

269
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,453
And he was holding it up so high.

270
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,755
- Just a little.
- Okay, here.

271
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,825
"Aah." Open up and say "aah."

272
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,360
- Watch out.
- <i>That's a lot!</i>

273
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,362
- <i>Isn't it hot?</i>
- <i>He can't escape.</i>

274
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,097
<i>He really has a mouthful.</i>

275
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,733
<i>- He looks really happy.</i>
- <i>Oh, look at that face!</i>

276
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,301
<i>- Ah!</i>
- <i>He made a good face.</i>

277
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,370
<i>The kind you make for someone you like.</i>

278
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,806
- Looks delicious.
- Seriously high-class cuisine.

279
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,475
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

280
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,343
Good work today, everyone.

281
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,247
- Delicious!
- You like it?

282
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,417
I had an interesting conversation
with Hiroya today.

283
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,920
We talked about what our boyfriend did
that really annoyed us.

284
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,923
- Let me think…
- Like not using chopsticks properly.

285
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:44,924
- Yeah!
- Oh!

286
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,959
Stabbing his food,
holding chopsticks like this…

287
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,862
- You really know someone like that?
- There are people who do that.

288
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,931
Yeah, there are people
who stab their food.

289
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,667
Jobu was saying he has lots
of examples like that.

290
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,669
I remember something else
that annoys me.

291
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,737
- What is it?
- Let's hear it.

292
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:02,274
Let's say I like someone and he likes me,
and this person has a dream.

293
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:06,712
Every day, he says that his life's
dream is to work in a foreign country.

294
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,249
Then finally, one day,
he gets a job offer.

295
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:14,753
He gets a job offer, but he says,
"If you don't want me to go, I won't go."

296
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,556
- "I'll put your feelings first."
- Mmm.

297
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,959
When he said that, it turned me off.

298
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,227
- Yeah?
- Oh?

299
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,329
I mean, I was like,
"That's your dream, right?"

300
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:27,199
I'd rather have him say, "I'm going
no matter what, so come with me."

301
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,134
- You want that.
- Yes.

302
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,503
Or "I'm going,
but I don't wanna do long-distance."

303
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,039
- You're lost in thoughts, Izaya.
- No!

304
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,008
I was just thinking
what I'd do in that situation.

305
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,543
I was thinking about it too.

306
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,878
- It's tough.
- It's tough.

307
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,379
But I get it. Yeah.

308
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,549
Yeah, you don't want someone
to leave everything up to you.

309
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,851
- It's their life, after all.
- Exactly what I mean.

310
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,420
"You're the main character in
your life." That's how I feel.

311
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,923
- Yeah, I agree.
- And I'm the main character in my life.

312
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,658
That's cold.

313
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,327
But I'll be right by your side,
supporting you.

314
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,897
When you become partners with someone,

315
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,633
when you decide to share a life,
you can't just live for yourself.

316
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,935
- Absolutely.
- You have to support each other.

317
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,871
And accomplish things together
because you're not alone anymore.

318
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,641
- Mmm.
- Of course it's tough.

319
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:11,443
But it seems like everyone has
gone through something similar.

320
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,679
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

321
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,950
What was the one thing your ex-partner
did that made you absolutely crazy?

322
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,485
- He was a reckless driver.
- Mmm.

323
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,619
A reckless driver?

324
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,322
I mean, he's really good at racing,
and he zooms around the city,

325
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,025
like, vroom-vroom-vroom,
passing cars super fast.

326
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,227
That's me.

327
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,696
- The speed freak. Yeah.
- The speedster, right?

328
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,165
Wait, wait, wait. Whoa!

329
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,902
- <i>He was reckless.</i>
- <i>How did you feel about that?</i>

330
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,138
- It reminded me.
- Reminded you of who?

331
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,941
- Of your ex-boyfriend?
- Of your ex-boyfriend?

332
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:44,176
But you know, the way a person drives

333
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,912
can also reveal their personality
and how they are in bed.

334
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,348
- How they are in bed?
- That can't be true.

335
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,650
- That's crazy.
- I've heard that it does.

336
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:54,153
- So, your ex was zooming all around town?
- He was real intense.

337
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:57,256
- No, not intense, more like rough.
- Aah.

338
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,924
What about you, Izaya?

339
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:02,061
What are you asking? If I'm rough in bed?

340
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,630
- Only my partner knows.
- Based on the way you drive…

341
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,967
- It's a secret.
- So, I guess you're not gonna tell us.

342
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,176
I really wanna go snowboarding again.

343
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,744
- Me too.
- See?

344
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,915
- I wanna see the drift ice.
- Me too. I wonder if whales show up.

345
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,851
- I've never seen it before in my life.
- There's a chance it won't show up.

346
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,087
You have to be lucky.

347
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,556
- Oh Go ahead!
- Please, go ahead.

348
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,960
"Starting tomorrow, the coffee truck
will finally be open for business."

349
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,862
- So soon. That's weird.
- No, no!

350
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:40,165
- I'm not ready.
- "The coffee truck is entirely set up."

351
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,534
- "So go take a look."
- Yay!

352
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,536
- Hurray!
- Let's go!

353
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,171
- Let's go!
- Let's see.

354
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,206
Okay.

355
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,542
Wow! Look, we have
our very own coffee truck!

356
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,311
- Amazing.
- Oh! I love it!

357
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,946
- Amazing.
- Cool!

358
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,714
- Really nice.
- It's so cute!

359
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:59,084
- It stands out against the white.
- The checkered pattern is cute.

360
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,854
- It's a nice color.
- "Us, Journey, and Coffee."

361
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,722
- Hey, check it out!
- Yeah, so nice.

362
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,225
- Ooh, nice.
- Wow. It's really nice inside.

363
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,293
Hello and welcome.

364
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,764
- I like it.
- This is really nice.

365
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,665
<i>Just can't be feelin'</i>

366
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,601
<i>What I'm feelin'</i>

367
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,804
<i>Ah, I don't wanna wake up</i>

368
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,706
<i>I want you to stay with me</i>

369
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,275
<i>Promise that you'll never leave</i>

370
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,710
<i>'Cause I just don't wanna</i>…

371
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,546
- Wow, I'm getting excited.
- It's like in school.

372
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,482
I want to write on the board because
I never got to when I was in school.

373
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,618
A trauma we avoided as young gay men.

374
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,187
But now we can experience the joys of it.

375
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,824
If I fill this up with the hope
that it becomes something delicious,

376
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,026
do you think it will turn
into something good?

377
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,162
Please be delicious.

378
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,465
- We can change the font later.
- Mmm.

379
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,133
DRIP COFFEE, AMERICANO
LATTE, COFFEE FLOAT

380
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,269
- I think these can be closer.
- Mmm.

381
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,473
- These write pretty clearly.
- Oh, that's really nice.

382
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,209
Oh, you should be
in charge of writing, Jobu.

383
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,112
Your handwriting is way cuter than mine.

384
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,248
- Oh, that's nice.
- Nice.

385
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,151
- Look, aprons. For everyone?
- Oh yeah?

386
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,853
- It might be cute.
- Let's.

387
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,888
- It looks good.
- Looks best on you.

388
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,124
- Really? It does?
- It looks best on you.

389
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,226
- You look the part. Huh?
- What do you think?

390
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,928
- It doesn't look bad.
- Oh, come on.

391
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,831
- No, it's too high. This is way too high.
- <i>What are they doing?</i>

392
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:21,767
- <i>Flirting! And Jobu's watching.</i>
- <i>So cute.</i>

393
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,769
- <i>Oh, he saw!</i>
- <i>Jobu's watching!</i>

394
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,304
- Here?
- Yeah.

395
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,639
- There.
- No place for beans.

396
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,075
So we put them here,
and these go a bit more to the right.

397
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,977
- The menu is ready too.
- Wow!

398
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,213
Oh, wow. I'm impressed!

399
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,948
Isn't it amazing? It's a proper menu.

400
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,850
- A proper menu.
- A proper menu.

401
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,719
Bomi, who would you choose?

402
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,155
I wonder who.

403
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,925
It's a secret.

404
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,594
Who would you choose?

405
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,462
- Have you decided?
- Huh? Well, I…

406
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,132
Yeah, I have.
The one I wrote the letter to.

407
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:58,403
Um, I might want to get
your advice just as a friend.

408
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,972
- You wanna go?
- On a few little things.

409
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,140
Oh, I get that.

410
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,908
But what will it say if I pick you first?

411
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,176
- I see what you mean.
- Yeah.

412
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,278
Yeah, I get it, because if you pick me,

413
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:07,946
then the person you really wanted to pick

414
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,681
is gonna think
you're not interested in him.

415
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:12,184
- Or think, "Hey, why didn't he choose me?"
- Exactly. That's why.

416
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,753
- That's a concern.
- Yeah, that's the tricky part.

417
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,356
Yeah, that's a concern, definitely.

418
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,795
I wanted to ask everyone,

419
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,265
who was your favorite in season one?

420
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,467
- Kazuto.
- Really?

421
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,002
- Mmm.
- Oh, Kazuto, huh?

422
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:33,472
- What did you like about him?
- Well, first off, he seemed very calm.

423
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,108
He was also a chef, and he was very sweet.

424
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,410
- Yeah, that's true.
- It was his… his voice and…

425
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,212
- His tone?
- Yeah, his tone, everything.

426
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,447
- His whole aura was sweet.
- He had a calm vibe.

427
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,416
- That was cool.
- He did. Who was your favorite?

428
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,852
Well… I'd say it was Taeheon.

429
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,754
- Likewise.
- Mmm.

430
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,290
- You liked Taeheon?
- Yes, Taeheon.

431
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,457
Can you tell me why?

432
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,927
- Come on, tell me why?
- Well, it's because he's also calm.

433
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,962
In fact, it's really simple,
I just think he's cute.

434
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,430
You're right, I think so too.

435
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:02,034
- Taeheon seems like he speaks his mind.
- I also think he's kind of a princess.

436
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,869
- He's a princess.
- And you, Huwei?

437
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,005
Well, I'm kind of torn
between two of them.

438
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,807
- Tell us who!
- Yeah, who?

439
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,842
I liked Taeheon and Shun.

440
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,611
- Oh!
- Shun?

441
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,013
They're so different,
but both of them are a bit…

442
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,181
Is that what you like?

443
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,383
- Can you explain?
- Tell us.

444
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,852
- Well, Shun has a pretty face.
- Yeah, that's true.

445
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:24,089
I get that. What about his personality?

446
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:27,960
- Personality… Well, I think he's funny.
- You're right, he is funny.

447
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,828
- You get his sense of humor.
- He's your type?

448
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:33,165
And I like Taeheon because
he has this big sister vibe to him.

449
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,967
He does have a big sister vibe.

450
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,269
- Big sister?
- But they both act like princesses.

451
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,271
- They're both princesses.
- Yeah, both.

452
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,039
- Shun and Taeheon.
- True.

453
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,407
Maybe that's your type?

454
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,143
- Taeheon was popular.
- Yeah, he was.

455
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,880
Both Hiroya and Jobu
designated Taeheon as their favorite.

456
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,483
- Mmm.
- Do we know if princess types are popular?

457
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,686
Well, that's in fact
a very tricky question.

458
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:58,056
Having a princess-like personality,
and also a princess-like…

459
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,425
For example, if you have muscles,
or if you're good-looking?

460
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:03,128
- Obviously, you're going to be popular.
- I see, I see.

461
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,931
But when you have a princess personality,
it's a tricky skill to master.

462
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,432
- Oh, I see.
- Mmm, I see.

463
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:08,967
But some people are into it.

464
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:12,537
I think Huwei is actually a sensitive,
big-hearted person,

465
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:16,575
since he said he likes princess types, and
chose Shun and Taeheon as his favorites.

466
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,945
- That's amazing.
- I think this will earn him major points.

467
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,680
He also knows how to cook.

468
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,682
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, he's amazing.

469
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,151
- He's the perfect package.
- He can do everything.

470
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,120
He even provides ultrasound treatments.

471
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:31,189
Amazing! I've never seen
anyone with that device before.

472
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:34,426
Why did he bring it? I mean,
he packed it in his suitcase on purpose.

473
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,594
He thought he might need it.

474
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,996
When he was choosing what to bring,
he decided to bring this.

475
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:41,099
But he's not great at proportions
for tasting, right?

476
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,102
- No. That wasn't a tasting portion.
- His idea of having someone taste food?

477
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:46,605
The portion to distance ratio
was a bit off.

478
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,279
Kazuyuki,
are you letting your beard grow out?

479
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,684
- Mmm… I haven't thought about it.
- I didn't even notice.

480
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,286
You look younger without it,
wouldn't you agree with that?

481
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,822
- It's not like I want to look younger.
- You know what?

482
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,591
- You should tie your hair back like this.
- I can't do that.

483
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,494
- You can, you can totally do a man bun.
- You mean slicked back?

484
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,229
- Tie it here.
- Cute!

485
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:13,965
- You look like a samurai.
- It's the man bun.

486
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,902
- Nice.
- It's not long enough.

487
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:20,038
- Like a defeated samurai.
- Mmm. A defeated samurai is bad.

488
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,441
<i>He's all over his hair.</i>
<i>They seem pretty close.</i>

489
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,509
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Wait, what's the expression?

490
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,812
"Everything you do looks good?"

491
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:29,214
- "Everything looks good on you."
- That's it.

492
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,016
- It doesn't look good on me.
- It does.

493
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,718
You'd look great with it shaved.

494
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,553
- That might look nice.
- Maybe.

495
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,925
- <i>They really are close.</i>
- <i>He's playing hairdresser.</i>

496
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,462
Just wait till he looks in the mirror!

497
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,334
Oh, but that would make a cute picture.

498
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:50,702
It's super cute.

499
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,038
It's a really good picture. Cute.

500
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,576
- Whoa!
- Oh!

501
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,579
- It's stylish.
- Oh, hey, it's stylish.

502
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,781
- Looks good!
- It's cool.

503
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:04,683
Oh.

504
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,151
- It pinged.
- Oh, a message.

505
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:09,654
Damn, it's the first day.

506
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,223
- It's exciting.
- It's started.

507
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,359
- It's started.
- "We have an announcement."

508
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:17,863
- Oh!
- What?

509
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,731
- What?
- Huh?

510
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,934
"The shift leader for today is Bomi."

511
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:25,504
- Aah!
- Bomi.

512
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,507
"Bomi, please choose
one person you would like to work with."

513
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,877
- What? This is nerve-racking.
- Whoa, really? Come on.

514
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:35,046
"Once you've decided, please
turn over that person's nameplate."

515
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,281
Mmm.

516
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,716
You're first up.

517
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:44,423
- It's a little nerve-racking, huh?
- Yeah.

518
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,526
What color is it?

519
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,298
- Really nice!
- A nice bright color.

520
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,133
The color of the sky and the truck.

521
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,269
- It's stylish.
- Very stylish.

522
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:08,747
Who will it be?

523
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,455
Wait, I feel really nervous.

524
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,727
<i>Hu-chan?</i>

525
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:26,698
Oh.

526
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,700
- <i>Oh.</i>
- <i>So cute.</i>

527
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,902
- Let's work together.
- Let's work together.

528
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,437
- Have fun.
- Good luck.

529
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:33,638
Good luck.

530
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,155
This is exciting.

531
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,390
Yeah, I'm excited. I hope we can sell.

532
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,464
Wow. So this is what it's like.

533
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:01,633
Here we go.

534
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:07,405
Take care.

535
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,875
- Hey, you look the part.
- Good luck.

536
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:10,909
Good luck.

537
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:18,216
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

538
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,318
Huwei, drive safely.

539
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,387
Take care.

540
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:25,991
<i>And I cry when I see</i>

541
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,126
<i>Everything out there</i>

542
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,962
<i>Oh, it's over out there</i>

543
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,899
<i>It's over for him</i>

544
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:38,370
<i>Will anybody give a damn about him?</i>

545
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,006
<i>With what he did?</i>

546
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:44,409
- It's cold today.
- Yeah.

547
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,380
SEVEN GUYS LIVING TOGETHER AND SELLING
COFFEE. ON TODAY, HUWEI AND BOMI

548
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,985
- Oh, nice.
- It looks good, right?

549
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,053
- Yeah.
- Amazing.

550
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,556
- Do I look like a pro?
- You look like a pro, definitely.

551
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,059
- Trust me.
- Are you sure?

552
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:04,896
Wait, the flash went off.

553
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,032
Hey, this is fun.

554
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:09,234
Okay, we did it.

555
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,136
- <i>Oh, nice.</i>
- <i>They're so cute.</i>

556
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,538
Hello and welcome.

557
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,106
Please look at this.

558
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,577
Look at this.

559
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:22,547
Do you think
they're speaking Chinese? Yeah?

560
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:25,584
Hello, do you speak Chinese?

561
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,919
- I do.
- All right.

562
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:31,222
What would you like to drink?

563
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:34,960
- This actually happens?
- He's nailing the customer service!

564
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:38,363
- He's so helpful!
- Wait. Isn't he amazing?

565
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,032
The menu has… Do you want black coffee?

566
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,069
- Drip coffee.
- Drip coffee. Medium.

567
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:45,136
Coffee, medium?

568
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:48,306
Drip coffee is 500
yen. The latte is also 500 yen. Thank you.

569
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:50,909
Sorry, I don't understand.

570
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:53,411
They would like
one drip coffee and one latte.

571
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,113
Do you think you could you make the latte?

572
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,381
Yeah, okay.

573
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:03,421
- Here you go. It's done.
- Is it ready?

574
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,126
- Thanks for waiting.
- Thank you.

575
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:11,096
- Here are some wet hand towels.
- Thank you.

576
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,498
- I'll send him for more later.
- Right. Thank you.

577
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:14,599
Right, thank you.

578
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:19,771
Yay!

579
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,340
- Yay!
- We sold coffee.

580
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,778
- A latte, yeah.
- Okay, I'll make one. Thanks.

581
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,683
- Here's the Americano.
- Okay.

582
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,320
Thank you. Take care.
Thank you for coming. Bye.

583
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:44,763
Wonderful. That's wonderful!

584
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,266
- How much did we make?
- I don't know. I don't know yet.

585
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,035
We work great as a team.

586
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,037
We might not have sold
anything without you.

587
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,405
TODAY'S SALES
6,850 YEN

588
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:56,241
It's done!

589
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:58,777
- Microwaved Wagyu.
- Japanese Black Wagyu.

590
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,812
Domestic Wagyu in the microwave?

591
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:03,181
That's so like you, Izaya.

592
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:04,816
It's Izaya-style.

593
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,552
This is the expensive meat,
and this is the cheap meat.

594
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:09,888
- Thank you.
- No problem.

595
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,289
Enjoy your meal.

596
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,225
- The expensive meat first.
- You should. It's delicious.

597
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,428
- How is it?
- Mmm!

598
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:18,430
- Is it good?
- It's really, really good.

599
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:20,999
- Like grilled meat. It's good.
- Right?

600
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:24,436
By the way,
Bomi and Huwei knew each other, right?

601
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,771
- Yeah.
- I heard they were friends.

602
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,406
- Mmm.
- I was surprised.

603
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:29,340
That's true.

604
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:32,577
I mean, it's not like I know every detail
of how they knew each other.

605
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:35,814
- I think they just went to dinner once.
- They just went to dinner?

606
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,449
- Apparently, that was all.
- I see.

607
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:39,417
That means their feelings
are still there, right?

608
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:41,453
I don't know They just went to dinner.

609
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,956
Even if one had feelings, maybe
the other didn't and it didn't go further.

610
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:47,325
- Yeah, that's possible.
- So we really don't know.

611
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,160
If I were to guess what happened,

612
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,129
I think Bomi had feelings.

613
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,198
- But Huwei wasn't feeling the same.
- Yeah.

614
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:54,466
- Mmm.
- Oh!

615
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:57,102
So I wonder what Huwei
might be feeling right now.

616
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,004
I didn't mean to imagine it.

617
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,448
Oh, wow. This is so cool.

618
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:12,050
Looks warm.

619
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:16,087
- Oh, it is warm.
- Oh, it is warm.

620
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:24,362
So, I picked you, Huwei,
and I want to thank you for coming.

621
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,330
Mmm.

622
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:29,367
I'm not sure how I'm supposed to do this.
Was it okay?

623
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,036
It's kind of weird to ask, "Was it okay?"

624
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:35,240
I think it worked out well, personally.

625
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,644
- We made a good team.
- We made a really good team.

626
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,316
But I have to say,
even though we were friends before this,

627
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:49,154
I realized that there might be
a lot of things I don't know about you.

628
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,588
What didn't you know?

629
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:53,291
I mean, we've never really talked
about our points of view on love

630
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,994
or had a deep conversation
about anything at all.

631
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,396
So, what is your point of view on love?

632
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,599
I've never really been in a
proper relationship per se.

633
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,535
- So everything is new to me.
- Mmm.

634
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,304
I'm looking forward to finding
that special person.

635
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:10,575
Someone who can make me happy
just by being with me.

636
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,709
- You know?
- Mmm.

637
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,379
I want to spend my days like that.

638
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,114
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

639
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:19,150
Do you have a preference?
An ideal type?

640
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:22,020
- My type?
- The kind of person you're drawn to.

641
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,659
Oh… I like people who you can sit down
and have a serious conversation with,

642
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:29,627
who won't run away from
an important discussion.

643
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:30,528
Yeah, I get it.

644
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:33,731
Otherwise, I feel like
some of the more important things

645
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:36,768
might get too difficult to talk about
if set aside for too long.

646
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,869
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

647
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:41,406
- I wanna have those conversations too.
- Really?

648
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:43,408
Yeah, of course I do.

649
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:47,779
We still have time. I hope
we can get to know each other better.

650
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,114
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

651
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,817
There might be things
we don't know about each other yet.

652
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:55,019
Definitely. I think there are many.

653
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:00,758
Okay…

654
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:10,702
- We're finally back home.
- Yeah.

655
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,208
- Oh!
- Hey!

656
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,410
- Welcome back.
- Are you cold?

657
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:22,213
- Do you need help carrying anything?
- Anything you need help with?

658
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,249
- Anything to bring in?
- We're okay.

659
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,217
- <i>Oh, Hiroya's curious.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

660
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,485
<i>He's curious about them, see?</i>

661
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,354
See? He's choking!

662
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,855
"Oops." His chest hurts.

663
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:35,226
He was so focused on them,
he didn't see the ice cube fall on him.

664
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,695
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah, we did have fun.

665
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:40,031
- Oh.
- Cute!

666
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,567
Today, I decided to go out
and buy some flowers.

667
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:45,303
- Oh, wow, that's so cute.
- This is charming.

668
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,205
Are the flowers in a 3D printed vase?

669
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:48,907
- Is it really?
- Well, is it?

670
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:51,242
- I actually have a 3D printer.
- Really?

671
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,244
I thought so.
I thought this was 3D printed.

672
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:54,545
- <i>Really?</i>
- <i>See?</i>

673
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,514
- He brought a printer with him? Why?
- 3D.

674
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,850
- <i>He brought a printer! See?</i>
- <i>No!</i>

675
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,419
- <i>He's making something.</i>
- <i>Wait a minute.</i>

676
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,488
<i>He wants to give form to his feelings.</i>

677
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:05,857
<i>They really surpass</i>
<i>your expectations, don't they?</i>

678
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,192
<i>Smart people do things</i>
<i>that surpass your expectations.</i>

679
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,694
- <i>True.</i>
- Where did you go?

680
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,496
- To Lake Akan.
- Oh, Lake Akan.

681
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:12,597
That's nearby.

682
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:15,400
But the problem was that there
was no one there today.

683
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:17,201
- There was absolutely no one.
- Mmm.

684
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:19,504
- It was really tough.
- What?

685
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,440
- Tell them, tell them.
- The most important part.

686
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,908
What's the total?

687
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,210
How much was it? 6,850 yen.

688
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,579
- Whoa! You sold a lot!
- You sold quite a bit.

689
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:30,815
- I thought you'd say zero.
- Me too.

690
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,818
- You said there was no one.
- Actually, a lot of people came.

691
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,553
- Oh, come on!
- That's more like it.

692
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,927
- Okay.
- That's nice, right?

693
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:45,129
Yeah, but it feels really lonely
with just one picture.

694
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:46,798
- There'll be more soon.
- There'll be more.

695
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,367
<i>As expected,</i>
<i>running a business brings people together.</i>

696
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:52,470
- <i>All kinds of conversations.</i>
- Did you notice?

697
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,605
- The vibe changed between them.
- It changed.

698
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:57,375
- It was different.
- I feel we've been left behind.

699
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:00,411
I know! They looked like
they'd moved onto the next step.

700
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,648
Like, "I'm different from you."

701
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:06,551
- Something was forever different.
- It's sad.

702
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:12,056
Of course I'm curious about what happened
during their shift. Of course I'm curious.

703
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:16,961
But there's no elegant way to ask,
and it's rude to ask anyway.

704
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:21,599
I feel like today really allowed us
to get closer to one another.

705
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,603
During our talk, I was able to open up
and tell him how I felt,

706
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,138
and I think Huwei really got it.

707
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:31,576
<i>I think running the coffee truck together</i>
<i>helped deepen our bond we already had.</i>

708
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:35,046
Or should I say showed
just how compatible we are together.

709
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:36,080
Mmm, mmm.

710
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:39,384
So far, Bomi and Izaya are
the only ones in the group

711
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,419
who have expressed their feelings, right?

712
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:45,156
But the two guys who those feelings
were told to haven't taken action yet.

713
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,058
Right? So what do you think about that?

714
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:50,862
If you meet someone again
a few years later in a different context,

715
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:53,164
does your heart skip a beat?

716
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,767
Or do you not care about them
anymore? Do you see what I mean?

717
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:59,303
If you meet them again and feel that
they've changed, you could fall for them.

718
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,338
- Yeah.
- Ah.

719
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:03,641
You know when you get that feeling
that they've become a better person?

720
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:07,378
Sometimes people can overcome their
faults, they can get a little upgrade.

721
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,781
- And you end up liking who they've become.
- Mmm.

722
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,582
If it's been maybe ten years,

723
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:14,118
yes, I can definitely think of them
as a different person.

724
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:15,553
But if it's only been two or three,

725
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,755
even if they've grown a little,
people don't change.

726
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,657
That's how it was. You're right. Yeah.

727
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:23,061
- I don't know how it was, just…
- Sorry. You're totally right.

728
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:26,431
You know, saying, "That's how it was,"
feels like a personal experience.

729
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:31,869
But he also said, "I'm the type of person
who thinks everything has meaning," right?

730
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:32,770
He did.

731
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:34,038
- So…
- He did say that.

732
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:37,975
So I feel that he thinks it's destiny
and that he's still into Izaya.

733
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,143
- Oh.
- Oh…

734
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,246
But if Izaya hears stuff like that
every day, he might be a bit on edge.

735
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:44,248
Well, Izaya is basically always on edge.

736
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:47,018
He's like, "So tell me, how do you feel?"

737
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,454
I get it. I definitely
don't think I could handle it.

738
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,354
It's tough.

739
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,091
- Every day might be rough.
- To have someone say that to you.

740
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:55,726
He probably thinks about it so much,
he can't sleep.

741
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:58,496
- Exactly.
- He's not sleeping.

742
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:01,065
You can tell there's
an intense attraction between them.

743
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:04,669
But the question is "Will this
relationship be a healthy relationship?"

744
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:06,737
- I don't think that will be the case.
- Yeah.

745
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,840
But unhealthy relationships
are much more fun.

746
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:10,775
- Yeah. That's just how it is.
- True.

747
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:11,809
When it comes to love?

748
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,911
- The messier it is, the better it is!
- Yeah.

749
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,513
Am I right?

750
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:24,155
Oh!

751
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,893
- Please read it.
- He's gonna tell us.

752
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,229
"The person in charge
of today's shift is…"

753
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,897
- Who?
- Oh.

754
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,733
"The person in charge
of today's shift is…"

755
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,871
- "Jobu will be on duty."
- Whoa! What do I do?

756
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:42,173
- It's you.
- This is nerve-racking.

757
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,144
"Jobu, please choose one person you would
like to work with during today's shift."

758
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,513
This is super nerve-racking.

759
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,515
- It is, isn't it?
- I need some water.

760
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,119
Hmm.

761
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,294
- He's so stiff.
- He's really thinking.

762
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,662
Yeah, he is.

763
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:12,670
- Oh.
- Hey, it's William.

764
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:16,240
Soccer player, let's work together.

765
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:17,708
Let's work together.

766
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:20,845
- Wonderful. This is great.
- Nice. It's a good team.

767
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:21,946
This is great.

768
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:31,923
- That was unexpected.
- Mmm.

769
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,157
Did you know?

770
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:34,759
- Yeah.
- No way!

771
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:35,893
I knew from before.

772
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,496
- I had no idea.
- I knew Jobu would pick Will.

773
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:41,666
If you watch closely, you can
notice that they're together a lot.

774
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:44,335
- I see they're together a lot, but…
- They're always together.

775
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:45,770
Oh, you're right.

776
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:47,038
I didn't feel it at all.

777
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:49,040
- I don't think William felt it.
- Seriously?

778
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:50,374
- Really?
- Yeah.

779
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:10,761
<i>Rise up, ascending melody</i>

780
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:13,664
<i>Climbs to the heavens for you</i>

781
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:15,433
Crazy.

782
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:17,702
The snow is crazy.

783
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,672
The snow's gonna pile up quickly.
I hate this.

784
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,084
Hello and welcome. How are you?

785
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,354
We're selling coffee,
if you're interested.

786
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,557
- Three café lattes.
- Total? Okay.

787
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:40,491
Thank you.

788
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:42,460
What's happening?
Where did they come from?

789
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,795
- There's too many!
- They came all of a sudden.

790
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:58,409
- Our bus is here.
- Ah, okay.

791
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:00,645
- So we need to hurry.
- Yeah.

792
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,013
Okay!

793
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,381
We have to hurry.

794
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,682
Ah, sorry.

795
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,052
This is hectic!

796
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:10,454
The lid won't fit.

797
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:12,923
The first time for you?

798
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,993
Yes, this is my first day. So sorry.

799
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,263
- Yeah, my first day.
- Yeah, our first day. Sorry.

800
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:21,766
I can't get this lid to fit.

801
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:23,034
Okay, we can…

802
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,771
- Okay. One more latte. This one.
- Okay. We can…

803
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,839
We can do it, we got this.

804
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:31,542
Sorry!

805
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:33,577
Chocolate milk. You can put yourself.

806
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,579
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

807
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,415
- Thank you, sorry!
- Have a nice day!

808
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,317
- Bye!
- Have a nice day.

809
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,921
- We did it! We did it.
- You bet!

810
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:46,724
Ugh! That was so hectic!

811
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,260
I can't do this. Let's clean up and leave.

812
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:51,896
I think we did well.

813
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:55,533
- We did well.
- Great. We're a good team.

814
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,901
TODAY'S SALES
6,450 YEN

815
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:01,972
What should we do today?

816
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,676
There really isn't much to do.

817
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:07,478
We can build an igloo.

818
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,380
- You like igloos?
- No one wants to?

819
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,115
Let's go. I totally want to.

820
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,951
- We can go look for a place to build one?
- Right over there.

821
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,820
It'd be cool if we could see it from here.

822
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:17,822
- You're right.
- That'll be cute.

823
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:19,623
We can see it from the window.

824
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,059
We can use it to talk in private.

825
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,828
- Good idea.
- Go and chill.

826
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:25,162
Important discussions.

827
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:27,365
- That sounds great.
- So, should we do it?

828
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:33,270
- Okay.
- It's really snowing.

829
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,039
Let's do this.

830
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:39,410
Aah!

831
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,582
We need to make this bigger.

832
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:47,518
Let's get some more snow.

833
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:57,962
<i>I worked very hard on the igloo</i>
<i>while thinking about William.</i>

834
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:00,197
<i>We'll be able to go in there together.</i>

835
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:03,768
I don't want
another half-hearted relationship.

836
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:09,106
Yeah, what I want is to be able
to tell him that someday.

837
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,641
Hmm.

838
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,245
Not many people can build an igloo
while thinking about someone.

839
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,281
- You don't hear that very often.
- That's true.

840
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,216
I can understand if it was knitting.

841
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:21,452
- This should do it.
- <i>But he loves him.</i>

842
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:22,720
- Ready?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

843
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,121
<i>He loves him.</i>

844
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:27,291
I feel like I'm back in the real world.

845
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:30,661
Aah!

846
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,363
Good job. Well done, seriously.

847
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,533
No, you guys did a good job.
It looks great.

848
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:40,004
We were able to finish it quickly
thanks to everyone. Seriously.

849
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:59,957
I don't know how
to start this conversation.

850
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,893
- So true. It feels formal.
- Exactly.

851
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,195
- Shall we start?
- But I was--

852
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:05,463
- Huh?
- I was surprised.

853
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:06,363
- Today?
- Yeah.

854
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:11,202
You know, I didn't choose you on a whim.
I knew from day one who I'd pick.

855
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:13,637
- Because I wrote you the letter.
- You did?

856
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:16,140
- <i>He told him!</i>
- <i>Good for him.</i>

857
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,309
- You knew since you wrote the letter?
- Yeah.

858
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,713
Since I first saw you.
My mind was made up since day one.

859
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,982
- <i>Really?</i>
- <i>Wow, he told him.</i>

860
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:28,552
I haven't looked at anyone else
but you since day one.

861
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,654
That's the truth.

862
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:33,090
- <i>Whoa, he's going for it.</i>
- <i>Well done, Jobu!</i>

863
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,593
- I thought I was being pretty obvious.
- Really?

864
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,228
- Mmm.
- But you were always joking around.

865
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:40,130
Yeah, that's true.
I can't do serious conversations.

866
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:43,167
Even now, when I know
I have to have a serious conversation,

867
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:44,902
I can't help joking.

868
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:46,604
- I laugh the whole time.
- I see that.

869
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,439
I get embarrassed and laugh.

870
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:52,376
When I'm struggling,
or lonely, or having a hard time,

871
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,745
or working hard, or stuff like that…

872
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:57,715
I don't really show it.

873
00:41:58,449 --> 00:41:59,450
Okay…

874
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,319
I'm glad, really.

875
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:03,387
Really?

876
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,995
- <i>What kind of expression is that?</i>
- <i>Yeah, I wonder.</i>

877
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,369
- Hey, no laughing.
- What?

878
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:21,005
- No laughing.
- No laughing? I can't help it.

879
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:23,040
- No laughing.
- I can't laugh?

880
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,676
But we had a serious conversation.

881
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:33,183
- We got through another day.
- Good work, everyone.

882
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,252
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy your meal.

883
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:38,088
- This looks delicious.
- It looks good.

884
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:41,892
- The cheese is really nice.
- The cheese is nice and stretchy.

885
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,261
- Wow.
- It's hot.

886
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:45,930
- It's good.
- Sure is.

887
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:46,997
Yum!

888
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:50,434
How did it go for you two?

889
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:52,670
- It was fun.
- It was fun.

890
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,705
We had fun today too.

891
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:56,640
- What did you do?
- It was fun.

892
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:58,309
- I want to hear.
- A great time.

893
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:02,246
Since we didn't have a private room
where two people could be alone here,

894
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,014
we decided to make one ourselves.

895
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,617
- What? Seriously?
- Your attention, please!

896
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:07,651
Huh?

897
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:08,852
Ready!

898
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:12,790
You made that? That's amazing! Oh, wow.

899
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:14,391
That's amazing!

900
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,827
You really made something like that?
Have you gone inside?

901
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:18,896
- You can fit three in.
- Even five.

902
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:21,599
- So cool.
- Snowman has a well-defined nose.

903
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:25,002
- Huh? Oh!
- Look.

904
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:27,871
Oh, no way, look…
The deer might go inside. That's so cool!

905
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:31,909
- It's leaving.
- Oh, too bad.

906
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:33,510
It was checking it out.

907
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:36,513
- It really is cute.
- Izaya worked so hard.

908
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:39,450
- He did a lot of digging inside.
- I dug, dug, dug…

909
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:42,653
- It looks nice with the snow.
- It's really nice. It'll be used a lot.

910
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,922
- Yeah.
- Two people can be alone there.

911
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:47,524
- It can easily fit two.
- We can drink coffee.

912
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:48,759
Awesome.

913
00:43:57,568 --> 00:44:00,004
<i>I don't even know you</i>

914
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,840
<i>We met the other night</i>
<i>For not a long time</i>

915
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:05,409
<i>One day, I'll talk to you </i>

916
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,344
<i>One day, I'll be with you</i>

917
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:09,647
<i>Never getting used to you</i>

918
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:12,349
<i>But I'm feeling all right</i>
<i>Got my mind a little light</i>

919
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:16,987
<i>With William, it was like, nine years ago.</i>

920
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:19,823
That was probably
the very first time we met.

921
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:23,694
We just met.
We didn't exchange info or anything.

922
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,898
<i>Then, three years ago, what happened was…</i>

923
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:32,102
Well, I remembered having met William,
but I knew nothing about him.

924
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,437
I found him on Instagram.

925
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:37,041
I remember messaging him and saying
"We should meet and catch up sometime."

926
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:39,910
And that's how it started.
I remember our conversation.

927
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:42,146
<i>We talked about his family for a while.</i>

928
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:47,317
Right from the start,
we had a deep conversation.

929
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:48,752
I remember it clearly.

930
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:53,357
It kind of ended with
a promise to meet again soon.

931
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,993
Every now and then,
we'd go out for drinks,

932
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,363
or we'd hang out at William's place,
or go to the gym together.

933
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:03,033
I'd say we did that for about
two or three months.

934
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,470
I think we were meeting
around once a week. Hmm.

935
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:10,674
How did it happen again?

936
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,945
The thing is, I don't remember.

937
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,115
Was it on Insta?

938
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:22,853
Was it at a bar?

939
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:26,924
What I remember most is going to the gym.

940
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:29,660
But I feel like
it was only two or three times.

941
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,129
- No more than four.
- <i>Hold on a second.</i>

942
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:34,998
- How can their memories be so different?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait…

943
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,835
- Hang on, hang on…
- This is what you never want.

944
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,671
- Hang on a second.
- I mean, it's totally…
