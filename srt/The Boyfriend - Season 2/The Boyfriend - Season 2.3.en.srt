1
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:16,616
What kind of dance is salsa?

2
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,318
- I can't dance.
- Come on, let's dance!

3
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:20,620
What do you mean, let's dance?

4
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,555
Uh, I can't even hear the music.

5
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,060
Huh? Salsa? It's salsa, right?

6
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,962
Wait, wait. What?
Like this.

7
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,064
I don't even know what we're doing.

8
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,433
- No, no. Take a step back.
- What? I step back too?

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,335
Yeah, yeah. Then, now… dance.

10
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,704
- Like that? Okay.
- And step back. And dance.

11
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:41,007
- Step back. We dance. And step back. Yeah.
- Step back. Then?

12
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,676
- Then this, and then…
- Like this?

13
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,345
You're so stiff, man!

14
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:46,813
- Stiff?
- Yeah!

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,150
Only a true quirky soul would
do something like this!

16
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,918
Yeah, true. This gets you hooked.

17
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,654
- This will make Jobu fall for him harder.
- It will.

18
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:58,925
So, like this. One, two. One, two. Step.

19
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,393
- <i>You can't do this!</i>
- Step.

20
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,462
<i>Why is he doing this out of nowhere?</i>

21
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,164
<i>- Oh! Kazuyuki's head!</i>
- <i>Whoa!</i>

22
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,600
- <i>He scared me!</i>
- That's it.

23
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,503
Don't just pop out of nowhere, Kazuyuki!

24
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,511
Oh.

25
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:22,615
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

26
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,385
"The person for today's shift…"

27
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,755
- "Huwei will be on duty."
- Oh!

28
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,457
No way. Today, as well?

29
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:32,058
- What a turn of events.
- Huwei.

30
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,560
- Again.
- Huwei.

31
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,562
- Popular guy.
- Huwei's going again.

35
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,182
- Oh!
- <i>He's consistent.</i>

36
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,718
- I can't see.
- Oh, Izaya.

37
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,520
- Who?
- You.

38
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,123
- It's you, silly!
- Oh, me? I just couldn't see.

39
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,592
- Your reaction!
- Okay. Ah, you're right.

40
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,762
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

41
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,565
I have to stay behind.

<i>- This time</i>
<i>- These things</i>

53
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,079
<i>- These things</i>
<i>- I never thought when you were mine</i>

54
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,882
<i>We used to break it together</i>

55
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,851
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

56
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:08,922
<i>We used to dive</i>
<i>In our highest feelings</i>

57
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:12,025
<i>Are we growing older together?</i>

58
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:13,960
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

<i>I don't wanna miss anything</i>
<i>When I'm dreaming about</i>

60
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,968
<i>When we were dazed and confused</i>

61
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,841
Was it complicated? Kinda?

62
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,476
After Huwei?

63
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,478
Yeah, it stung a little.

64
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,547
- Didn't it look like he had no doubts?
- That's true.

65
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,717
- Felt like he already decided on Izaya.
- Yeah, yeah.

66
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,619
I didn't think Huwei would pick him.

67
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,054
- Wasn't that kind of mean?
- Izaya?

68
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,556
I honestly was a bit shocked.
Like, I picked him two days ago,

69
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,091
and then he picks Izaya?

70
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,127
I thought, "Wow, public execution."

71
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,463
I had no idea what face
I was supposed to make.

72
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,069
But I swear I wasn't actually smiling
then. I was forcing it so hard.

73
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,639
<i>- I was forcing myself to make a big smile.</i>
- <i>Yeah, I felt that.</i>

74
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,674
- You did? Ugh, that's embarrassing.
- I could tell.

75
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,343
I'm super embarrassed.

76
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,112
<i>I had a mix of feelings.</i>

77
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:10,783
I was partly a little pissed,
but also a bit hurt, too.

78
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,386
But last night, I told him,

79
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:16,256
"Huwei, you should
definitely pull your bangs back."

80
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,359
You know, I think
you should show your forehead.

81
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,363
- Should I pull my hair back?
- You definitely should.

82
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,266
- Really? Okay, I will.
- Looks good.

83
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:31,604
<i>And this morning, when he had his bangs</i>
<i>up, I was like, "Whoa, he did it."</i>

84
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,240
That made me a little happy.

85
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:38,211
- <i>That would make me happy.</i>
- <i>Stuff like this makes me happy.</i>

86
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,586
- Here.
- Thanks.

87
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,454
You should wear gloves too.

88
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:50,823
Here.

89
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,196
It's cold.

90
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,132
- Right?
- It's freezing.

91
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,034
- Hello.
- Hello.

92
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,236
- Here's the menu.
- Thanks.

93
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,472
- I want chocolate milk.
- Looks good.

94
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:09,242
- The chocolate milk's really good.
- Looks great.

95
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,678
- Four.
- Four chocolate milks? Got it.

96
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,813
- Chocolate milk? Okay!
- Four chocolate milks.

97
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,015
I'll make the milk.

98
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,785
Okay. Great customer service.

99
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,025
The sun's coming out.

100
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,364
Sorry for the wait.

101
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:34,467
- Please be careful, it's very hot.
- Thank you.

102
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:35,768
Thank you.

103
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,938
- One drip coffee. Small, please.
- Drip coffee, okay.

104
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,641
- Chocolate milk, please.
- Thank you so much.

105
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,309
That'll be 850 yen.

106
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:47,180
Um, uh… first, 20 grams…

107
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,016
Hey, can I?

108
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,552
- The beans are…
- In the back.

109
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,420
- Yeah, inside of the bag.
- Ah, the bag.

110
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,189
- They're in the bag.
- Okay.

111
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,793
First, here's your hot chocolate.
It's hot, so please be careful.

112
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,729
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- You're in a hurry, right? Sorry.

113
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,397
- Sorry, I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

114
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,566
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

115
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,502
We should speed up.

116
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,438
Yeah. I wonder where we slowed down.

117
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,873
Was I slow?

118
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,812
Not sure… Yeah, a bit slow.

119
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,348
Right.

120
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,218
I'll do better next time.

121
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,253
TODAY'S SALES
5,100 YEN

122
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,691
I've been wondering
about something for a while.

123
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:35,328
When we all first met,
you said you already kinda knew…

124
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,198
You mentioned something
about knowing Huwei from before.

125
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:42,135
Um, only you two know what
happened between you, but…

126
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,903
- But…
- Oh, it's nothing special.

127
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,872
We just went out to eat and stuff.

128
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:50,343
But yeah, that first dinner wasn't
exactly just friends grabbing food.

129
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,813
It was like we were both kind of
interested in each other at that point.

130
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,516
Yeah, yeah. I kind of figured as much.

131
00:06:57,016 --> 00:07:00,653
And then… you picked Huwei again here.

132
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,523
You know what I mean?

133
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,325
I don't mean to sound harsh,
but it ended, right?

134
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:11,063
Whether it was a date or something casual,
whatever it was.

135
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:16,135
It didn't go anywhere after that because
one of you didn't want it to, right?

136
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,303
I guess so.

137
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:22,041
- So why do you go for it again?
- But to me, it felt a bit like destiny.

138
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,210
Hmm.

139
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,916
Well, I wanted to take this opportunity
to get to know him better.

140
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,820
And me too. When I came in,
I already knew Izaya.

141
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,423
So, like you said,
I thought, "Maybe it's fate."

142
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:42,728
But if it didn't happen back then,
it's not like it would now.

143
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,031
If it were really meant to be,
we'd already be together.

144
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,632
- Exactly!
- That's what you mean, right?

145
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,936
But even when we first met,
it already wasn't like that.

146
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,738
- Yeah.
- That's what you're saying, right?

147
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,778
True, but I still wanted
to talk to him more.

148
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,784
YOSHIMI, CHIAKI, THELMA, DURIAN

149
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,619
He's wondering how he feels.

150
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,755
William was projecting onto himself.

151
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:13,025
He was asking someone else,
but also asking himself.

152
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:16,128
- But William said he thinks it's over.
- Mm-hm.

153
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:17,597
Yeah, yeah. The last time.

154
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,934
So, Izaya says it's over too, but
it was a really important love for him.

155
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,172
They're talking about "over"
in totally different ways.

156
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,174
They're stored
in different folders in their heads.

157
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,877
- Completely different feelings.
- You're right.

158
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,879
For someone who says it's over,

159
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:37,149
William's smile looked pretty into Izaya
when he was slicing mangoes.

160
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:40,052
- <i>That's the thing!</i>
- <i>And when he was making coffee</i>.

161
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,654
What's that about, then?

162
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,590
That might be a part
of his open and quirky personality.

163
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:45,825
His quirkiness!

164
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,961
At the very beginning,
William and Jobu were dancing, right?

165
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,563
- That…
- To silent Latin music.

166
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,664
Silent salsa.

167
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,733
- Silent salsa!
- That was not fair.

168
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,403
- So, is that him being quirky? Right?
- That's so right.

169
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,007
So he's the kind of person
who always shows affection.

170
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:04,010
- Right, right.
- He just likes getting on with everyone.

171
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,078
We thought it was only the two of them.

172
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:09,048
- Kazuyuki suddenly pops into the frame!
- He popped in from below!

173
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,751
- The way he showed up…
- He couldn't take it.

174
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,986
He was like, "I can't stay here."

175
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,456
- And that's why he left.
- I'd hate it if they did that behind me!

176
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,595
It's so beautiful.

177
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,263
All white.

178
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:26,966
Wanna take a break?

179
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:32,872
- It looks like a station.
- Right? Cool spot.

180
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,547
Okay.

181
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,283
It's warm.

182
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,785
- It is, huh?
- Yeah.

183
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:48,054
- Let's write in the journal?
- Yeah.

184
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,358
- How was the teamwork?
- I'd say it was pretty good.

185
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,193
- Yeah, it was good.
- I think so too.

186
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,766
Oh. By the way,
I wanted to ask you something.

187
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,202
- What?
- Who did you write your letter to?

188
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,937
- My letter?
- Yeah.

189
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,973
- Why?
- The letter on the first day.

190
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,574
- Guess who.
- Who was it?

191
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:09,909
Who do you think?

192
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,279
I thought it might be me.

193
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,048
You drew a smiley face on the blackboard,

194
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,919
and in the journal, the same smiley
face that was on the letter, too.

195
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,887
Ah, no!

196
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,591
- I was like, "I saw that in my letter!"
- Busted.

197
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,793
Damn.

198
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,696
<i>- Did I draw a smiley face?</i>
- <i>Yeah, there was a smiley face.</i>

199
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,264
<i>Totally forgot.</i>

200
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,533
He got busted!

201
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,772
But that letter made me so happy.
What you wrote made me really happy.

202
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,674
I LOVE HOW YOU TALK
AND THE WORDS YOU USE!

203
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:44,443
<i>You got me. It felt like</i>
<i>you really wrote about my inner side.</i>

204
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,578
I HOPE WE GET TO TALK MORE.

205
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,280
I've always liked how you speak,
honestly.

206
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,883
Oh. Thank you.

207
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:53,919
Yeah.

208
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:58,691
Shall we go?

209
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,860
- Hey, go in front.
- Huh?

210
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:01,827
- Go on.
- Why?

211
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:02,728
Just do it.

212
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:05,865
Hey!

213
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,568
I tripped. Aah!

214
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,973
- Isn't it soft? Feels nice, right?
- Feels great.

215
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,642
- <i>Love and snow go well together.</i>
- <i>So nice.</i>

216
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,812
This view is nice.
We can even see the moon.

217
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:24,083
- Yeah. It feels amazing.
- <i>This is so </i>Eternal Sunshine!

218
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,219
- <i>I wanna fall into the snow!</i>
- <i>Oh, they're already doing it.</i>

219
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,632
Did everyone go to the sauna?

220
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,267
- Sauna, did they go already?
- No idea.

221
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,769
- Not yet?
- I think everyone was in their rooms.

222
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:56,215
Bomi, when you chose Huwei
on your first day,

223
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:01,120
you just wanted to have one-on-one
conversations with everyone?

224
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,357
Or do you kinda see him
as someone special?

225
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,497
Well, I've known him for a while now.

226
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,698
Right.

227
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,868
I was scrolling back
through our DM conversation.

228
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:16,836
Hmm.

229
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,972
And he wished me
a happy birthday and stuff.

230
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:24,310
He actually reached out to me a lot,
and I didn't really notice at the time.

231
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:28,647
Not didn't notice, more like, I only found
out when I looked back on our chats. So…

232
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,649
You realized, "Oh, he was thinking of me."

233
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,384
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's why…

234
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,854
Even though I went out
for dinner with him,

235
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,356
I realized there was a lot
I didn't know about him.

236
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,361
So first off, I wanted to talk with Huwei.

237
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,797
So that's why I picked him.

238
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,133
How about you, Hiroya?

239
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,368
- I've decided.
- You've decided?

240
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,436
Hm?

241
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:52,638
Yeah, I have.

242
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:58,310
I think I want to talk with Huwei too.

243
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,579
Nice.

244
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:07,620
Yeah. So, I wanted to ask what
you had in mind when you picked Huwei.

245
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:12,458
Got it. But I also feel that way a little.

246
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,895
That's why I picked him.
And I told him that.

247
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,097
- That you're interested in him?
- Yeah.

248
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,865
I want to know more about him too.

249
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,702
That was the main reason,
and I told him that's why I picked him.

250
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:24,770
Hmm.

251
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:27,907
I see.

252
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,253
- What do you do for work again?
- For work?

253
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,190
For work… You know
what a data center is, right?

254
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,091
- Data center?
- Yeah. Data center.

255
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,728
You know, like the data centers
for banks and the government.

256
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,931
So, we take
the customers' information and…

257
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,933
- Super important.
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.

258
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,434
So it's cybersecurity?

259
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,771
- No.
- Then like a security guard?

260
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,940
- No!
- Didn't think so.

261
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,809
I actually… build data centers.

262
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,245
They run 24-7, 365 days a year.

263
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,880
- Always running?
- Always running, right?

264
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,882
You know, when
you withdraw cash at an ATM,

265
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,585
you're actually connecting
to a data server, like your bank's server.

266
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,787
If that infrastructure
goes down, that's it.

267
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,457
You absolutely can't let it crash.
If it does, every ATM stops working.

268
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,826
That's hundreds of millions in losses
in just a few seconds.

269
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:24,396
So we do all kinds of calculations
to make sure the system never fails.

270
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,498
Basically, we calculate how much power

271
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:30,002
each machine or server
can pull from the power supply.

272
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:33,439
- Oh, I see.
- Yeah. And how much heat they generate…

273
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:36,976
- So you're like a director?
- A project manager.

274
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:43,549
So you're overseeing pretty much
the whole data center? In a nutshell.

275
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,185
Yeah, the entire… Mmm.

276
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,587
Wait, did you just give up?

277
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,756
You did, right?

278
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,127
<i>Lately, we've been a lot closer.</i>

279
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,630
<i>I'm not sure if it's just me thinking</i>
<i>that we're getting closer,</i>

280
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,865
<i>but I'm kind of totally falling for him.</i>

281
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,433
Falling for him, huh?

282
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,801
So cute.

283
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:07,306
Butterflies. I mean, it's been a week
without touching anyone, right?

284
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,074
I haven't even hugged anyone yet.

285
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,911
So a part of me is craving
some human touch.

286
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,980
It's kinda too soon, but, like…

287
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,917
I want to do it already.

288
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,886
- Yeah, that's right.
- <i>What?</i>

289
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,956
Right now, he's just getting horny.

290
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:27,426
- He's smitten… and a little turned on too.
- And kinda turned on, I guess!

291
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,029
Hey, hey, hey.

292
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,931
B. T. C.
US, JOURNEY, AND COFFEE

293
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,870
- We're home.
- Welcome back!

294
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:40,973
- Was it cold?
- So cold.

295
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,508
- Freezing.
- So cold.

296
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,643
- Oh, you both have earmuffs on.
- Cute.

297
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,112
- Are you making a hot pot?
- Yeah.

298
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:50,249
- Nice. Looks delicious.
- That's some fancy napa.

299
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,818
Thanks.

300
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,553
- Good work.
- Good work.

301
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,522
- Looks really good.
- Thank you.

302
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:58,991
I want soup.

303
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,661
- How is it?
- So good.

304
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,730
- Good, good.
- This hits the spot.

305
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,898
Hits the spot?

306
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,701
- Was it cold today?
- It was cold, wasn't it?

307
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,102
I think it was pretty cold today.

308
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,337
- It was cold.
- I see.

309
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,871
What did you guys do today?

310
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,940
We were just chatting around here.

311
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,810
Like what to get
for birthday gifts and stuff.

312
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,012
A letter would make me the happiest.

313
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,013
Ooh!

314
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,182
- Letters didn't come up.
- No way.

315
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:24,750
- They didn't.
- As a gift?

316
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,684
Yeah.

317
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,353
I don't need material things.

318
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,321
- Oh yeah, someone said no material stuff.
- A trip.

319
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,657
- A trip together.
- Not material things, but a trip.

320
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:34,560
- I prefer experiences.
- A trip is nice, experiences are nice.

321
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,395
- But I'd like a letter.
- As we said.

322
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:39,431
- Would you read it right there?
- You don't say, "Read it now!"

323
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,799
Right after they hand it to you?

324
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,267
- Just give it normally?
- Yeah.

325
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,703
- You'd read it later.
- And feel warm and fuzzy.

326
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,605
- Yes! Exactly.
- Warm and fuzzy.

327
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,474
- I want that.
- Letters are better.

328
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,542
- You can keep them.
- You can keep them.

329
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,077
Letters are pretty special.

330
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,112
Hmm.

331
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:00,819
First time I've seen someone use
that spot. Does it feel good?

332
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,621
- Here? It's nice.
- It's flat.

333
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,690
- It feels really nice.
- I could sleep here.

334
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,692
Me too. You really could.

335
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,528
Are you tired?

336
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,764
Nope. How was your day?

337
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:13,799
- It was fun.
- <i>Whoa!</i>

338
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,967
<i>That was so smooth!</i>

339
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,502
- <i>Right?</i>
- I'm jealous.

340
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,737
Don't you think I've got so much arch?

341
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,807
What do you mean? You only have one arch.

342
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,776
- I have a super high arch.
- That's what you mean?

343
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:27,079
- Yeah, it's super curved.
- Oh, I see. Do you like that?

344
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,447
Oh!

345
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,116
Doesn't it hurt? Like hurt so good?

346
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,851
I'm not pressing that hard.

347
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,687
- Hurts so good?
- <i>Oh my.</i>

348
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,356
- <i>This is</i>…
- <i>Ooh!</i>

349
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,291
- Got it?
- It might feel good.

350
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,959
- Oh, it feels good.
- Right?

351
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:46,165
<i>William went to run the</i>
<i>coffee truck yesterday, and I went today.</i>

352
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,867
<i>So we haven't been able to talk at all.</i>

353
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:54,740
I wanted to show him some affection,
and that's what I came up with. A massage.

354
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,509
Hey, hey. Can you stand up?

355
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,745
I want to try a quick hug.

356
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,713
Whoa, big!

357
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,316
- But like, this feels just right.
- He's really big.

358
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,485
- Jobu's size is nice.
- It's nice.

359
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,387
Try hugging him. He's huge.

360
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,190
- You're tall too.
- That might be a good match.

361
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,591
Oh, this feels nice too.

362
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,162
- Okay then.
- He is huge.

363
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,465
Doesn't it feel like he wraps around you?

364
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,334
It's pretty nice, hugging Hiroya.

365
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,969
Your chest is really big.

366
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,572
- Oh, you're slim. Really slim.
- Yeah.

367
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,240
Between two slim guys.

368
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,509
Which do you prefer, thin or thick?

369
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,111
- Thicker.
- Muscular.

370
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,378
<i>Jobu started all this.</i>

371
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,480
But actually…

372
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,081
- Perfect fit?
- Perfect.

373
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,584
- Because of this.
- <i>They're craving human touch!</i>

374
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,751
How is it?

375
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,055
- Who hasn't gone yet?
- I haven't hugged William.

376
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,825
- Jobu, let's do it.
- No, I'm okay.

377
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,760
- I'm okay! Aah! Okay, okay!
- Go on!

378
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:52,030
- That's enough!
- Don't go, "Okay!" Enjoy it.

379
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,840
<i>Jobu just wanted to hug William, right?</i>

380
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,710
- <i>William was the one he didn't!</i>
- <i>That's how it is.</i>

381
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,012
- <i>Even though he wanted to.</i>
- <i>That's sad.</i>

382
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:13,919
There it is, there it is.

383
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,021
"For today's shift…

384
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,589
Izaya will be on duty."

385
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,326
- Two days in a row.
- Back-to-back.

386
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,494
So busy.

387
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,632
- I'm most curious about this.
- Yeah.

388
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,133
Hard to predict.

389
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,570
<i>Everyone's starting</i>
<i>to get a sense of each other's feelings.</i>

390
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,373
<i>- It feels tense when it's time to choose.</i>
- <i>Right? Yeah.</i>

391
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,918
Let's do it. Let's do this.

392
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,625
- Have a good day.
- See you.

393
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,513
Let it all out.

394
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:18,350
I'm just feeling down.

395
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:21,420
Seriously, I'm bummed out.
Totally bummed out.

396
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,390
I've been feeling totally bummed out
since this morning.

397
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:28,227
- I mean, those two are just so close.
- You're right.

398
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,964
They're together all night too.
I can't get in between those two.

399
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,532
<i>- I mean…</i>
- <i>True. No one can.</i>

400
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,001
- <i>You can't, right?</i>
- <i>Yeah, they're a bit intimate.</i>

401
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,703
<i>They feel pretty intimate.</i>

402
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,539
And… they're a better match.

403
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,841
Don't say things like that.
You don't know that.

404
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,743
I mean, they're closer in age too.

405
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,413
- It's tough when it comes to this.
- You still have a chance.

406
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,982
Like…

407
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:54,653
If you back down now, it'll be too late.
That's true. I need to pump myself up.

408
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,922
- Pump me up. Come on, hype me.
- Hype you up?

409
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:01,360
Yeah. But still,
they sorta look better together.

410
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:05,764
That's not true.
You've got your own charm, Jobu.

411
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,532
- That's true.
- You're great.

412
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:10,836
- A ball of personality.
- Oh, wow, I'm starting to feel better.

413
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,938
- You are?
- I'm starting to feel confident.

414
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:16,441
- You have so many great qualities!
- I'm starting to feel confident.

415
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:20,045
I mean, I've never met
someone so fun to be around.

416
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,081
- Pure happiness vibes.
- Total happiness vibes, that's you too.

417
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,517
- Happiness.
- You radiate happiness too.

418
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,119
Then we both radiate happiness.

419
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,454
Let's put that aside for now
and talk about you.

420
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:30,389
About me?

421
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:34,926
So I was talking with Hiroya, and he
talked about who he wants to go with.

422
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:35,994
Oh.

423
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:39,231
I picked Huwei, right?
Hiroya said he wants to choose him too.

424
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,733
- <i>Oh, didn't know that.</i>
- <i>And I was like, "What?"</i>

425
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:46,038
But when someone else shows interest
in Huwei like that,

426
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:47,839
I start feeling antsy too.

427
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:48,774
Ah.

428
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,344
My emotions are in a tangle.
I can't tell if it's love or just anxiety.

429
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,980
- It's hard to tell, isn't it?
- Really hard to tell, right?

430
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,283
- But it's different for you.
- What?

431
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,619
- You've been all-in from the start.
- Yeah.

432
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,658
It pisses me off that
he's just so handsome.

433
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:12,130
It really pisses me off, seriously.

434
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:15,534
You should go all out and put yourself
out there. Let Jobu out.

435
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,803
- Oh no, should I?
- Yeah, put yourself out there.

436
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:18,970
- Should I go for it?
- Do it.

437
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:22,207
Honestly, I almost kissed him
a few times, you know.

438
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,845
- Wait, I'm gonna spill my drink!
- Careful, careful! Sorry, sorry!

439
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:28,980
Careful. I'm trouble, you know.

440
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,816
<i>They look like they're having fun.</i>

441
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:31,817
"Should I go for it?"

442
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:35,153
It's nice to have friends
like that when you're in love. Yeah?

443
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,397
<i>Oh</i>

444
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:50,102
<i>I don't mind a backseat driver</i>

445
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:52,537
<i>If it's you</i>

446
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:53,605
Okay.

447
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,075
- Turn around.
<i>- You can tell me to turn, turn</i>

448
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:58,643
- Yeah, you're good.
- Is it okay?

449
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,379
It's not twisted. Yeah.

450
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:04,549
Should we take the menu
and call the customers over?

451
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,351
- Let's do that.
- Yeah.

452
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:10,355
Wow, it's so pretty.
I want to take a picture.

453
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:14,092
- I'll take one for you.
<i>- You can tell me to go, go, go</i>

454
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,361
<i>Go, go, go</i>

455
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:17,896
Nice.

456
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,901
- Nice.
- The weather is so nice.

457
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,636
Good weather makes me happy.

458
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,942
- Hello.
- Hello.

459
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,144
Hello.

460
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,045
Sorry to bother you.

461
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,281
We're selling coffee. Please come by

462
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,884
- After we finish fishing!
- We'll be waiting.

463
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:46,792
You know, it's fun staying in
and goofing around with everyone, but…

464
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,729
we haven't had any time
to talk one-on-one.

465
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:53,665
I didn't think I'd be working with you
with these feelings.

466
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:54,900
What do you mean?

467
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,602
Huh? I don't know.
It's just a weird feeling.

468
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:58,603
Feels weird?

469
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,607
Yeah, like, I thought I knew, but I don't.
You get that feeling, don't you?

470
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:04,910
Right.

471
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,648
Oh, hello.

472
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:11,716
- You came!
- Of course.

473
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,118
- I'm glad.
- Thank you.

474
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,855
- One small café latte, and…
- Sure. Yep.

475
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,590
- You have oatmeal cookies?
- We do.

476
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:21,159
We've got one oatmeal cookie left.

477
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,994
- Thank you.
- Is that okay?

478
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:23,929
Yes, please.

479
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:25,730
- Did you catch anything?
- We did.

480
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,033
- How many?
- We got a lot this time.

481
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,303
- Sorry to keep you waiting. It's hot.
- That's okay. Thanks!

482
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:34,239
- Thank you! See you!
- We hope to see you again.

483
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,609
- Please come again. Thank you.
- Thank you.

484
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:43,048
What were you talking about earlier?
We got customers in the middle of it.

485
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:44,349
Right, right.

486
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:49,387
Hey, when we met on the first day,
did you regret coming here?

487
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:52,023
Well, I didn't regret it,
but I had mixed feelings.

488
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,391
Yeah, I can imagine.

489
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,126
So, um…

490
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:59,364
Yeah. Well, I want to ask you a lot.

491
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:02,100
- Like what?
- Like, why you're here.

492
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,935
What made you decide to join.

493
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:05,337
Mm, mm, mm.

494
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,207
I mean, we went out
a few times before, right?

495
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,208
Mmm.

496
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:15,814
But honestly, I don't really know
how you felt about me back then.

497
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,549
I see.

498
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,352
Yeah… I see.

499
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:22,787
<i>Izaya's feelings</i>
<i>hadn't reached him back then</i>…

500
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,422
TODAY'S SALES:
3,100 YEN

501
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:25,357
<i>Ugh, come on!</i>

502
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:28,927
- You can't sell anything with that energy.
- It's really like that.

503
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:31,029
- It depends on energy.
- It's contagious.

504
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,131
- Your energy totally affects sales.
- Right, right.

505
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,467
But when it's someone you really liked,

506
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:39,671
someone you thought you'd shared
something deep with, say that to you…

507
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:40,739
It kind of makes you go…

508
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:42,274
- It hurts.
- Shocking.

509
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,943
- "Wait, what?"
- You realized it was one-sided.

510
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,913
It wouldn't be surprising if he thinks,
"If that's how it was, forget it."

511
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:50,715
- Totally fair.
- I'm not sure.

512
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:55,787
I think I totally get why Izaya,
who's usually pretty grounded and calm,

513
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,089
would be drawn to William.

514
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:02,060
He appears to be a very,
like, super bold and a free-spirited guy.

515
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,095
He's just so different from him.

516
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:06,231
I guess so. I get it, I get it.

517
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:09,434
So, even after hearing that,
I don't think he'd back off.

518
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,870
- I agree.
- He's already in too deep.

519
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,472
- Right, right, right.
- - He's so into him.

520
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:16,841
- Past the point of no return.
- Already past it?

521
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,810
- He's already fallen.
- He's in this much?

522
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,146
- He's in, he's in.
- Yup, this is where he's at right now.

523
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:24,249
- I think he'll go for it.
- I can't tell William's feelings.

524
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,051
- No clue.
- I can't either.

525
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:28,286
Maybe he doesn't have feelings for him,

526
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:32,724
or maybe he's more conservative
than he looks?

527
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,627
- So we're already in deep too.
- True.

528
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,162
- Completely.
- You're right.

529
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:49,107
- <i>Is this Hiroya?</i>
- <i>Oh, is that a 3D printer?</i>

530
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:53,111
- <i>Yeah, is that a printer?</i>
- <i>He's brought all kinds of stuff.</i>

531
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,016
<i>He went to Huwei's room. He's going.</i>

532
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,121
Is he gonna scan him?

533
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,858
- Scan Huwei?
- "Let me take your 3D data."

534
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:14,199
- Would you like to go downstairs a bit?
- Okay.

535
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,838
Is this a good spot?

536
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,077
I was thinking… I've talked with you
with everyone else around often,

537
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,680
but we've never been alone together.

538
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:31,116
- You're right.
- So I've been wanting to chat with you.

539
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:32,617
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

540
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:36,655
- And Izaya went with Will today, right?
- Mmm.

541
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:39,491
So I figured you might have
some thoughts about it.

542
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:41,326
I wanted to ask you about that too.

543
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,930
At this point, all I can think is,
"Oh, so that's how it is."

544
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,365
Hmm…

545
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,635
So it's not like you're feeling down?

546
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:53,605
I'm not exactly feeling down, but…

547
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,008
Yeah, I did wonder
what he thinks of William.

548
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,310
Yeah. Well, I'm curious
about that just as much.

549
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:00,412
Yeah.

550
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:04,482
I wonder if everyone picks
the person they're interested in

551
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,484
to run the coffee truck with.

552
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:09,988
Or do they just decide
they want to work together?

553
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,990
- We just don't know their motives.
- That's true.

554
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:15,260
- Hmm.
- Speaking of that, how was it for you?

555
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:16,161
- Me?
- Yeah.

556
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:19,831
I guess it was mostly because
I was interested in him.

557
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:22,000
- Hmm.
- Anyway…

558
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:27,038
What I want to tell you is, that I…

559
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,675
Right now, the person
I'm most interested in here is you.

560
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,678
Hmm?

561
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:36,481
- So I was going to pick you.
- Oh, I see.

562
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,682
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

563
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,120
But I didn't get a chance
to pick this week.

564
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:43,254
I see.

565
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:47,492
I just felt like I should tell you
how I feel as soon as possible.

566
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:50,462
That's why I wanted
some alone time with you.

567
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,097
Right, thank you.

568
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,400
I was just afraid my feelings for you
hadn't gotten through.

569
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:56,601
- Hmm.
- Mmm.

570
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,504
Aaah!

571
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,740
- No way.
- He said it.

572
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:04,476
- Hiroya…
- Everyone's playing fair and square.

573
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:08,213
Many of them are being
very straightforward.

574
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:11,082
- He told Bomi that he would be upfront.
- Yeah, yeah.

575
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:14,185
- And he really followed through.
- That was impressive.

576
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,088
Isn't this the first time that someone
has knocked on someone's door?

577
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:19,357
- That's right.
- A pretty bold move, isn't it?

578
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,993
- "Let's go downstairs for a bit."
- Right?

579
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:29,100
How was running the coffee truck today?

580
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:33,171
Yeah. I was a little worried about
our teamwork at first.

581
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,173
- But it went well.
- It did?

582
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:39,010
When I met you three years ago,

583
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,213
I don't think I was able
to show my true self.

584
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,414
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

585
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:49,154
So today, when you said that you didn't
really realize how I felt back then,

586
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,190
I thought maybe
I didn't express myself enough.

587
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,893
- Right.
- Mmm.

588
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,396
And then we both went
to different countries, right?

589
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,699
I went to Australia
and you went to Spain.

590
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,134
Mmm.

591
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,270
But I couldn't forget about you.

592
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:09,240
Honestly, you were always
in the back of my mind.

593
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,743
Yeah.

594
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,513
In the end, I remembered,

595
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:19,117
and I think I was the one

596
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:22,020
who stopped responding, was I?

597
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:26,858
It's not like I wanted you, um…
to chase after me or anything,

598
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:30,461
but I felt like you wouldn't have
come after me anyway.

599
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:39,404
And I thought maybe that's all it was.

600
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:41,906
That's how I was feeling.

601
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:47,312
But now that, um…
we've met again like this,

602
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:50,381
I think there's some kind
of meaning to it.

603
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:52,584
It feels like…

604
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,953
<i>I chase your name…</i>

605
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:59,424
…I've been given another chance
to face you and work things out again.

606
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,292
<i>I know you are there</i>

607
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,296
It's only because we happened
to already know each other.

608
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,732
I was surprised to see you here.

609
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:11,703
And to be honest, I didn't expect
things to turn out this way.

610
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,639
I wanted to ask you about that.

611
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,307
The reason you decided to come here.

612
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,309
Why was that again?

613
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:23,781
Well, um… honestly, I didn't know
if I'd find someone or not.

614
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:27,719
But my biggest goal was
to find a life partner.

615
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:31,322
Yeah, I guess that's why I came here.

616
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:35,293
<i>With love</i>

617
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:40,431
<i>I can change the sky above</i>

618
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:45,103
<i>And rise a little higher</i>

619
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:46,371
I see.

620
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:50,775
If you came here
with that reason and saw me,

621
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:54,145
I'm sure you must have felt something.

622
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:57,849
From your point of view,
it must feel like destiny.

623
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:58,883
Mmm.

624
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:05,156
But I don't know if this is destiny,
or just the universe messing with me.

625
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,394
Mmm. But since I'm here…

626
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:15,967
I want to really face things head-on,

627
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,036
to confront them,

628
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,773
and find my true life partner.

629
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,708
That's why I'm here.

630
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,344
Like…

631
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,884
I want you to know
that I'm serious about this.

632
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,219
<i>I think I'm just falling</i>

633
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,689
<i>Falling for you</i>

634
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:43,328
Back then, three years ago, I think I was
trying too hard to only show my best side.

635
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:46,597
We'd only meet on dates,
or only meet at the gym,

636
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:49,500
and I was holding back a lot
and being overly careful,

637
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:54,739
trying to match William
instead of trying to show my true self.

638
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,308
I just hope he could tell
how serious I was,

639
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,844
how much I was really trying to reach him.

640
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:01,546
You know?

641
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:06,351
I hope he feels like, um…
he got to see a new side of me.

642
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:07,618
That's how I feel.

643
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:12,924
Yeah, I'm not sure why, I just can't help
but wonder if he really means it.

644
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:16,961
But I know that's not his fault.
It's probably my fault.

645
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:22,600
<i>That's why I don't want</i>
<i>to get his hopes up or lead him on.</i>

646
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:26,270
So right now, I'm not sure
how to interact with him.

647
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:31,409
<i>Now hold my hand, I promise that</i>

648
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:35,913
- 34.
- Wait, 35?

649
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,914
No, 34.

650
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,351
- When's your birthday again?
- July.

651
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:44,722
Do you remember when
I celebrated your birthday once?

652
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,190
What?

653
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,797
You don't remember?

654
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:56,034
No way, really? How many years ago was it?

655
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,037
- Oh, I remember now, I remember now.
- You remember?

656
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,809
- I remember, I remember
- You punk.

657
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:07,278
- You remember?
- I remember.

658
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:08,479
You remember?

659
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:11,949
- I remember.
- Not three, four.

660
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:14,886
That's true. Ugh, I'm terrible.

661
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,455
- I'm terrible.
- You forgot?

662
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,657
I just remembered.

663
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:23,795
Okay, if you remembered,
then, I'll… forgive you.

664
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,298
- Man, I'm bad. This is not good. Hold on.
- I'm just relieved.

665
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:30,735
Back then, I was like…

666
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:35,640
I was just a single guy, and…
I probably met a lot of people.

667
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,975
And I think Izaya was one of them.

668
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,345
- Well, that makes sense.
- Yeah, that's fair.

669
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,980
That's what it was.

670
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:47,051
But maybe William is actually the kind
of guy who has to see that he's loved,

671
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,854
like he needs a lot
of constant reassurance?

672
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,190
- You know what I mean?
- Hmm, maybe he's a little insecure?

673
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:56,060
It seemed like he was asking,
"Do you like me? Really?"

674
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,996
He sounded to me that he really
needed to make sure.

675
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:00,565
Maybe he's passionate?

676
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:03,000
- Maybe he's not as confident as we think?
- Maybe not.

677
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,736
But didn't Izaya look
super handsome in that moment?

678
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:07,672
- Very handsome.
- He looked determined.

679
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:09,574
The face of someone who's
made up his mind.

680
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,410
He said he came to face this,
with even some regrets.

681
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:16,047
- That was cool, wasn't it?
- Yeah. He didn't back down even a step.

682
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:18,649
Oh.

683
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:21,486
"For today's shift…

684
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:25,056
Hiroya will be on duty."

685
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,758
- Here we go! This right here!
- <i>They have their own drama!</i>

686
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:30,728
- Long-awaited.
- He's the best at making lattes.

687
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,965
"Hiroya, please pick one person
you want to work with."

688
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:36,300
- Okay, here I go.
- Go for it.

689
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:39,604
Who will it be?

690
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,739
- No idea.
- This is hardest to guess.

691
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,555
- Will you come with me?
- Let's go.

692
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,358
- Let's do this.
- Cute.

693
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,429
<i>Bomi's smile isn't coming naturally.</i>

694
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,831
<i>He's forcing a smile.</i>

695
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:12,770
Oh, this is nice.

696
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,472
- I'm getting hyped!
- Yeah.

697
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,210
- I don't think I can put this on.
- I'll help you.

698
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,212
Wait a second. Like this, right?

699
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,148
Yeah. Thank you.

700
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,318
- Please.
- Like this and…

701
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:31,589
I'm Thai! I'm cold!

702
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:32,490
HUWEI
FROM THAILAND

703
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:34,825
What if we get Thai customers?
I can't speak Thai.

704
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,462
- They might miraculously come.
- They might.

705
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,799
Hello. Come join us.
Would you like some coffee?

706
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,135
- Would you like coffee?
- Oh!

707
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,503
- Yeah.
- Oh, really?

708
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,205
Did you want to look at Lotteria?

709
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:50,141
- You're from Thailand?
- Yes.

710
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,376
- From Thailand.
- Oh, that's good.

711
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:54,912
- Oh, Thai customers!
- It happened! What a miracle.

712
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:56,847
That's so wild.

713
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,850
- Oh. Huh?
- There are Thai people. Thai customers.

714
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:02,153
- Oh!
- You can speak Thai?

715
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,422
- I'm Thai.
- You're Thai!

716
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:07,792
I can only speak a little Thai.

717
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,298
- All right. Chocolate milk.
- Chocolate milk.

718
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:17,368
- Have a good day.
- Have a good day.

719
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,605
Thank you.

720
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,673
That was cool.

721
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,009
My Thai was terrible, I'm embarrassed.

722
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,179
- You can speak it to an extent.
- I understand what they're saying.

723
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,914
- But I can't speak much.
- I see.

724
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:33,217
TODAY'S SALES
5,050 YEN

725
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,924
What time is it?
Oh! It's later than I thought.

726
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,561
- What should we comment?
- Let's write something.

727
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:52,336
- Okay.
- Random. I wrote something super random.

728
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:58,576
- Huh?
- Open it.

729
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:01,612
Whoa!

730
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,516
- Thank you!
- I bought it earlier.

731
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,319
It's the one I really wanted.

732
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:09,987
- It's cute, isn't it?
- So cute.

733
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,556
I'll take a picture for you later.

734
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:16,160
- Aww, so adorbs.
- <i>Adorbs!</i>

735
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:17,728
Thanks. I'm so happy.

736
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,096
Looks best on you.

737
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:20,431
TSURUTAN

738
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:24,335
But I feel like that kind of stuff
actually gets to someone like Huwei,

739
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,304
maybe more than you'd think.

740
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:29,674
I get the feeling he's the type
who'll cave once he gets that final push.

741
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,574
Yeah, yeah.

742
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,144
- He's gonna push. He's going all out.
- Yeah.

743
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,313
- Then Bomi will…
- How will he react?

744
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:38,616
- Good question.
- But this is all new for Bomi, so…

745
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:41,919
There was that moment when his love
almost turned into frustration.

746
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,522
Like, "Why are you going?
Why aren't you choosing me?"

747
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:46,324
There were moments
when he was pissed off.

748
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:50,227
That's why if Hiroya and Hu-chan end up
together, Bomi might lose control a bit.

749
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,363
I wonder what Bomi will do
if that happens.

750
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,497
Yeah.

751
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:55,966
Everyone's personalities are
starting to show little by little.

752
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:57,368
Yeah.

753
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:04,208
- Wanna go to the gym?
- I wanna hit the gym.

754
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,077
- I'll get some rest.
- Mmm.

755
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:07,978
- Then…
- Take a bath.

756
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:09,714
- I want a bath.
- Take one.

757
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:12,917
- Whose scent is that?
- Whose is it? Jobu?

758
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:14,418
Is it me? Smell me.

759
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:16,654
- Bomi.
- Doesn't it smell super coconutty?

760
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:20,224
- No. It's Jobu's hair.
- Isn't it my hair wax?

761
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:24,095
- It's Jobu's hair.
- Oh, it's Jobu. My coconut arrived today.

762
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:25,663
What do you mean, your coconut?

763
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,898
- You mean oil?
- My coconut oil finally arrived.

764
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,534
- Finally!
- What do you use it for?

765
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:31,702
- Hair?
- My whole body.

766
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,938
- Full-body oil?
- You'll be oily?

767
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:36,741
It's for my hair, my skin, everything.

768
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:40,077
- There's something here. Some clumps here.
- Get it off.

769
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:44,348
Got it.
You've even got some on your beard.

770
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,917
- No! This is terrible. There are so many.
- Got it, got it.

771
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:49,086
- <i>Don't give up!</i>
- <i>This hurts!</i>

772
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,322
- No one hates seaweed, right?
- I love it.

773
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:53,124
I love it.

774
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,593
I wonder if they're selling well.

775
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,262
I feel like those two
would sell a lot. Make bank.

776
00:39:58,329 --> 00:39:59,764
They would, they would.

777
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,701
At what point does it count as cheating?

778
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,270
- I don't really wanna talk about this.
- Why not?

779
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,005
I think my definition's off from the norm.

780
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,442
If it's just sex, I don't mind
if you go ahead and do whatever you want.

781
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,077
- You'd hate it.
- I don't like it.

782
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,045
But I'd be like,,
"Just go ahead and do it."

783
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:16,947
- It's cheating if feelings change.
- Yeah.

784
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:18,916
Cheating is fine
as long as you don't get caught.

785
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:21,118
- Same! Exactly, exactly.
- That way of thinking…

786
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,888
- But you'll get caught.
- I hate to say it, but that's true.

787
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:25,923
You say it's cheating
if your feelings change,

788
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,726
but isn't it over anyway
if you develop feelings for someone else?

789
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:30,861
It's cheating if you catch feelings.

790
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,630
Some people catch feelings
for someone else,

791
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:35,533
but can't bring themselves
to end things, that's cheating.

792
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,902
People who stay
in a relationship out of habit.

793
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:39,670
But have you ever cheated?

794
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:41,672
Depends on your definition of cheating.

795
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:44,875
It's not fair if I'm the only one
who has to answer. I've never cheated.

796
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,478
- You have!
- Never.

797
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,047
- You sound like you have!
- No, no, no, never, never.

798
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,283
So it counts as cheating
as soon as you take action.

799
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:54,919
Yeah, as soon as it gets physical.

800
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:58,422
So if they go all the way,
it's immediately over?

801
00:40:58,489 --> 00:40:59,423
I wouldn't forgive them.

802
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,725
- Mmm.
- I'd forgive them.

803
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,527
- I might forgive them.
- What?

804
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:06,530
I just think you should
value yourself better than that.

805
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:07,865
Do I not?

806
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:11,602
I mean, if you forgive them,
they'll think you're that kind of person.

807
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:14,038
- They'll walk all over you?
- They'll take you lightly.

808
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,108
I mean, I tell them,
if they cheat, it's over.

809
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:20,711
If they cheat,
they're the ones who will regret it.

810
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:23,013
They'll probably regret it
for the rest of their life.

811
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:27,852
I cheated once before, a long time ago.
And I regretted it afterwards.

812
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:29,119
When was that?

813
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:32,356
- Before.
- Before?

814
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:36,760
- My last relationship.
- You mean the most recent one?

815
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,596
- <i>Oh no, oh no, oh no.</i>
- Yeah.

816
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,632
Cake ingredients.
Maybe I'll make cookies instead of cake.

817
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,301
- It ended up a good thing.
- <i>He got all vague.</i>

818
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:46,670
We don't have a cake mold, though.

819
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:48,205
<i>He's bad at this.</i>

820
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:52,910
Well, there were a lot of reasons for it.
It didn't just happen out of nowhere.

821
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,514
<i>Everyone's facing totally</i>
<i>different directions. Hilarious.</i>

822
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,482
<i>They're all pretending not to be there.</i>

823
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:09,493
<i>I broke up with my boyfriend</i>
<i>of seven years because he cheated on me.</i>

824
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:14,932
Looking back, it just feels like
maybe there were a bunch of lies.

825
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,034
I can't help thinking like that.

826
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:19,270
There probably were.

827
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:22,439
It's not exactly like
I can't trust people anymore,

828
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:26,810
but… I just can't help
but wonder why they lie.

829
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:27,878
Like…

830
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:32,316
being in a relationship
with someone like that

831
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:35,386
feels like it would bring
uncertainties in the future.
