IT COMPANY SALES WORKER

4
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:20,020
- I learned it.
- Hmm?

5
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,055
Was it correct?

6
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,093
You know what it means?
That's embarrassing.

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,428
Wait, you know Spanish?

8
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:31,064
Yeah, I know some Spanish.

9
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,133
I might get annoyed and act out.

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,868
For real.

11
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,604
Jobu, of all people, knows Spanish.

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,972
Seriously.

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,774
Lastly…

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,609
<i>- "Amor."</i>
- I can't do that.

15
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:43,543
<i>Amor.</i>

16
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,078
- Wow!
- You nailed it!

17
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,080
- I can't roll my R's.
- Can you?

18
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:48,982
- A bit.
- You can!

19
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,183
<i>Amor.</i>

20
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:55,088
<i>Amor, amor, amor, amor.</i>

21
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,323
He's been practicing this forever here.

22
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,625
He tries.

23
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,296
Where's Izaya?

24
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:04,230
He's working?

25
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,566
Izaya said he can't join us
during the day.

26
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,035
- Because he has to work remotely.
- Oh, I see.

27
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,272
Oh, it pinged. Go ahead.

28
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,409
"The shift leader for today is

That's great.

- <i>He chose Bomi!</i>
- <i>He's focusing on Bomi.</i>

00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:38,998
<i>- Growing a beard!</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

37
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:42,168
- Let's run the truck together.
- With pleasure.

38
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,536
Let's work together.

39
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,105
Have a good time.

00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,721
I'll have an iced café latte.

00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,524
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Thank you.

43
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,025
- Safe trip home.
- Thank you.

44
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:07,527
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

45
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,799
How long will you grow your beard?

46
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,235
I don't know. I'll let it grow
for a while. What do you think?

47
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,836
- Hmm?
- What do you think?

48
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,572
- What do I think? I don't like it.
- You don't?

49
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,875
- <i>"I don't like it!"</i>
- <i>Oh, he's so blunt!</i>

50
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,244
- <i>So blunt.</i>
- You don't mince words, do you?

51
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,248
So, you don't like it?

00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,680
You know, when we got back from Niseko,

57
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,982
I told you how I felt, right?

58
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,318
<i>And you were like, "Oh, I'm super happy,</i>

59
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,988
<i>but I'm not really sure</i>
<i>how to put it into words."</i>

60
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:10,590
<i>- That's what you said?</i>
- <i>Mmm.</i>

61
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,825
Now, I want you to tell me how you feel.

62
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,594
Okay, that's fair.

63
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,430
- Have you sorted your thoughts?
- Not yet.

64
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,066
Not yet? Okay.

65
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,869
I haven't sorted them out, but…

66
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:27,407
I realized I want to feel
a little more passion.

67
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:32,078
- You want to feel more passion?
- I want to feel more passion.

68
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,479
What do you mean?

69
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,816
I realized that I still haven't found

70
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:42,255
someone who's been able to give me
the desire to like them yet.

71
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,356
Okay.

72
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,327
And you've never
dated a guy before, right?

73
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:49,596
To be honest, that scares me a little.

74
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,464
- Oh, because it's my first time?
- It's…

75
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,534
That's not exactly the reason.
I don't know, it's just…

76
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:58,972
Your expectations might be…
If we were to get together,

77
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:01,507
I'm not sure you'd get
the kind of romance you're expecting.

78
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,410
That's fair enough.

79
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,348
I get it, so… Okay.

80
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,117
So, right now, what you're saying is

81
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:14,988
you're still figuring out
your feelings, right?

82
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,023
- Mmm.
- I'm starting to warm up.

83
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,891
What? You're warming up?

84
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,460
- You mean your feet?
- Mmm.

85
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,329
What do you mean?
That's not what I'm talking about.

86
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,766
<i>Why talk about warming</i>
<i>his feet up at a time like this?</i>

87
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,637
But, you know…

88
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:36,843
if you heat up too quickly,
you'll cool down just as fast.

89
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,280
- You want to warm things up slowly?
- I want to warm things up slowly.

90
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,384
- Is that wrong?
- Mm-mm. I think it's fine.

91
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,461
- Will we catch anything?
- Let's stay where it's safe.

92
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,031
I just want someone
to catch at least one fish.

93
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,766
- Yeah, seriously.
- Please.

94
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,570
<i>This slow motion is so unfair.</i>

95
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,640
I caught something.
Look, check it out. I'm serious, look!

96
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,711
- It's big!
- It's huge! It's big! It's big!

97
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,484
Hello?

98
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,122
Excuse me.

99
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,458
<i>That's a different suitcase.</i>

100
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,026
- The color.
- Right.

101
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:30,363
- This is someone else. Taeheon's is green.
- Yeah, it was green, wasn't it? Who is it?

102
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,201
Huh? No one's here.

103
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,710
- We're home now!
- Good work!

104
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,712
- Here come the guys.
- Hey, guys.

105
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:48,514
- We were out too, we just got back.
- Where were you?

106
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,184
- Where did you go? I'll ask later.
- Over there.

107
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,787
- <i>What? So this isn't Taeheon?</i>
- <i>Who is it?</i>

108
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,390
- <i>Show his face!</i>
- <i>Something's going on?</i>

109
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,262
Finally…

110
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,301
- That startled me.
- We're home now.

111
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,202
Hello.

112
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,304
- Hello.
- Hello.

113
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,939
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

114
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,108
- Hello.
- Hello. Um…

115
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:18,544
I'll be living here with all of you
starting today.

116
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,780
My name is Tomoaki. Nice to meet you.

117
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,215
Nice to meet you.

118
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,417
<i>Tomoaki!</i>

119
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,252
What a surprise. Starting today?

120
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,322
- <i>Welcome, Tomoaki.</i>
- <i>He looks like a Kabuki actor.</i>

121
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,958
My name is Tomoaki. I'm 31 years old.

122
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:35,461
<i>And I work as a project manager</i>
<i>at an IT company.</i>

123
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:39,665
<i>My flaw is that I tend to be negative,</i>

124
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,335
<i>and my strength is</i>
<i>also rooted in negativity.</i>

125
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:46,305
<i>I have a habit of thinking negatively</i>
<i>about everything,</i>

126
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,741
<i>and I want to change that.</i>

127
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,843
I want my strength to be positivity,

128
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,647
and I want my flaw
to be positivity as well.

129
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,784
That's how cheerful I want to become.
Yeah.

130
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,686
Ah!

131
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,022
Nice to meet you. My name is Tomoaki,

132
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,525
and I'll be living here with you
starting today.

133
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,593
- Glad to be here.
- Glad to have you.

134
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,897
When I came this way,
I was like, "There's more people."

135
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,698
You didn't tell him?

136
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,500
- It was a surprise.
- No.

137
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,136
<i>Here he is!</i>

138
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,338
- Here he comes!
- It was green!

139
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,774
- Taeheon!
- He has such a presence.

140
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,380
Can I ask you why
you came here to this experience?

141
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,617
- Why did I come here?
- You know…

142
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,686
Maybe we can ask him
when we're all eating.

143
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,322
- Yeah, that works too.
- When we're all together.

144
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:39,826
Hey.

145
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:41,561
What's going on?

146
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,564
- Huh?
- Eh?

147
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,000
Huh? Two people at once? What's going on?

148
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,303
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh! Oh!

149
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:54,941
I'm Taeheon, I'll be living here
with you starting today.

150
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,442
- I'm excited!
- Glad to be here.

151
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,211
- For real?
- No way! Yeah!

152
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,279
- <i>Going to live with them?</i>
- Crazy.

153
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,248
- <i>Crazy!</i>
- <i>I'm so happy! Taeheon!</i>

154
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,083
- What?
- Nice to meet you.

155
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,954
My name is Taeheon. I'm 35 years old.

156
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,889
<i>I'm a designer.</i>

157
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:15,061
I didn't have any regrets
the first time living in the Green Room.

158
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:19,332
However, I did have the sensation
of leaving a few things unfinished.

159
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:23,803
So I thought I would try to be more honest
with my feelings and try again.

160
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,307
That's essentially the main reason
why I came here. Yeah.

161
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,776
- <i>Exciting!</i>
- We should get along.

162
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,778
- <i>Everyone knows Taeheon.</i>
- Let's.

163
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,381
- <i>He has an advantage.</i>
- <i>Things will start moving!</i>

164
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,884
- Who would have thought?
- I was so surprised.

165
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,187
Jobu's expression changed,
it was so obvious.

166
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,524
- His face lit up.
- What? Why? It didn't change!

167
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,093
- Shut up! Huh?
- I remember, I remember. On the first day.

168
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,262
- I said what?
- You said, "I hope Taeheon comes."

169
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,831
- You said that. So I was surprised.
- I did. I was surprised too.

170
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,132
I was like, "What?"

171
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,803
I was kind of expecting at least
one person from season one to be here.

172
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,939
I was hoping Taeheon would come,
that he'd show up,

173
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,842
But he didn't. There's still time, though.

174
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,712
He ended up coming.

175
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,548
"He ended up coming."

176
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,716
- "He'll end up coming."
- "He ended up coming."

177
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,586
I'm like, "What should I do?"
I can't stop grinning.

178
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:17,657
Well, in person, I saw that
he's handsome and cute.

179
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,259
He's really great. He's really great!

180
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,762
He's really great, but…

181
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:26,232
things might get tough again…

182
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,800
Maybe my feelings are overflowing.

183
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,937
They're overflowing!
They're overflowing and…

184
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:34,974
I can't talk to him face-to-face.
I don't know what to do.

185
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:48,487
<i>- "Think easy," she said</i>
<i>- She said</i>

186
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,223
<i>"Forever young and so wild"</i>

187
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,293
<i>"Or pull a gun and then fire it"</i>

188
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,697
<i>- "Easy," she said</i>
<i>- She said</i>

189
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:03,703
<i>"You're never young if you don't run</i>
<i>So get over"</i>

190
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,939
<i>- We still got walls on both sides</i>
<i>- Sides</i>

191
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,541
<i>Maybe</i>

192
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,377
<i>- I wanna know how to climb</i>
<i>- Climb</i>

193
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,812
<i>We're blind, blind</i>

194
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:15,247
<i>- Blind</i>
<i>- How'd we get air all this time?</i>

195
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,350
<i>- This time</i>
<i>- These things</i>

196
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,919
<i>- These things</i>
<i>- I never thought when you were mine</i>

197
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,722
<i>We used to break it together</i>

198
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,690
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

199
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:28,861
<i>We used to dive</i>
<i>In our highest feelings</i>

200
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,864
<i>Are we growing older together?</i>

201
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,833
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

202
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:38,537
<i>I don't wanna miss anything</i>
<i>When I'm dreaming about</i>

203
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:41,807
<i>When we were dazed and confused</i>

204
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,611
Okay everyone,
let's gather the ingredients

205
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,380
for the salad over here.

206
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,315
- Sounds good.
- Do that for now.

207
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,117
Lettuce.

208
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,487
- Lettuce. Soft-boiled eggs.
- What about that thing you wanted?

209
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,122
- Where's the scale?
- Eggs.

210
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,458
Wait, what should I do?
I'm kind of nervous. What should I do?

211
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,827
What should I do? I'm nervous.
I can't do this. I can't!

212
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,163
My heart is pounding. This is bad.

213
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,533
Salad… Lettuce, is there any lettuce?

214
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,270
<i>He can't help but be conscious of Taeheon.</i>

215
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,506
Mayonnaise, basil, ginger pork sauce…

216
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:14,907
That looks good!

217
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:18,010
- Yay!
- That looks delicious!

218
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,746
Okay, let's toast
to the new members! Cheers!

219
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,982
- Cheers!
- Welcome.

220
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,685
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

221
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,054
- Glad to have you.
- Glad to be here.

222
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,790
Since it's your second time,
you're not nervous, are you?

223
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,060
- Well, yeah, I am a little nervous.
- Oh, you are?

224
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,697
- Why did you come?
- Good question.

225
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:43,602
If I had to determine what unfinished
business I still had from last time,

226
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,572
I think it would be finding love.

227
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,910
I wanted to approach this
in a very serious manner,

228
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,678
so I decided to come back.

229
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,947
- Good idea.
- Courageous.

230
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,183
- Best of luck.
- I think that's very brave.

231
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,053
Oh, I'm really nervous.

232
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,023
I don't really know how important
this might seem to everyone,

233
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,392
but I really wanted to like myself.

234
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:11,063
That was the main reason
I applied to come here.

235
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,300
Ever since I was little, I've always
struggled with being overweight.

236
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:17,970
My highest was 116 kilos.
That was very hard.

237
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:23,609
Then, over the past two years,
I went on a diet and lost about 40 kilos.

238
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,511
- From my maximum weight.
- That's amazing!

239
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,414
I was finally able
to accept the way I look,

240
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:33,285
and I've grown to appreciate
my appearance a lot more.

241
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:39,158
But I still can't completely
come to terms with my sexuality,

242
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:43,562
and I can't bring myself
to like that part of me.

243
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:47,633
I came here with the intention
of growing to love myself more,

244
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,338
and ideally, to find a boyfriend
to introduce to my parents.

245
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,907
That's my story.
and I hope we can all get along.

246
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,809
Welcome to the Green Room!

247
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,646
- That's a very good reason.
- That's a great story.

248
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:04,817
I have to say, hitting over
100 kilos is quite a talent in itself.

249
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:07,720
I really have an abnormal
obsession with food.

250
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,588
You like to eat, right?

251
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,824
- You like to eat?
- Oh, you're right.

252
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,126
But this was less than my max weight.

253
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,461
Wow, you were big!

254
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:16,862
You're a different person!

255
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,165
- Totally different.
- How much did you weigh?

256
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,500
- I was a bit slimmer already.
- I want to see.

257
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,436
- So maybe 108 kilos.
- You really do look different.

258
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,572
- A different person.
- 108 kilos, wow.

259
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,340
- You worked hard.
- And you're tall.

260
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,643
- That's so embarrassing.
- That's amazing.

261
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,311
Hmm?

262
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,548
- It pinged just now.
- It pinged.

263
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:38,250
- Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!
- What? Now?

264
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,752
- Right now?
- Why?

265
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:44,790
"New members have just joined
the Green Room."

266
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:50,129
"To commemorate this special day, write
a letter to just one of the participants."

267
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,165
"However, do not sign your name."

268
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,603
"Drop your letter in the recipient's
mailbox by the end of tonight."

269
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,240
"Check your mailbox tomorrow morning."

270
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,510
Have you written letters here before?

271
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:08,447
- We did on the first day.
- It's the first time since the first day.

272
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,049
<i>Why now?</i>

273
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:14,787
<i>I got interlocking feelings</i>
<i>I know nothin' about </i>

274
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,791
<i>I got interlocking feelings</i>
<i>And they're tearin' me down </i>

275
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,759
<i>They're comin' to the surface…</i>

276
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,262
<i>I bet Jobu's brain will be on hyper-drive</i>

277
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:26,165
<i>when he sits down</i>
<i>to write his anonymous letter.</i>

278
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,567
<i>I'm feeling new </i>

279
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,805
<i>I'm feeling new </i>

280
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,642
<i>I'm feeling new </i>

281
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:48,487
- <i>Oh, thank goodness. He's happy.</i>
- <i>That's good.</i>

282
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:53,192
MY THIRD LETTER TO YOU.
I'LL KEEP WRITING YOU UNTIL I'M OLD.

283
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,728
- <i>"Until I'm old and gray."</i>
- <i>That's nice.</i>

284
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,132
<i>Oh, it's long.</i>

285
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,868
IT'S BEEN AN EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER,
BUT I'M SO GLAD I FELL FOR YOU.

286
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:03,936
WE'LL ALWAYS BE TOGETHER.

287
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,338
<i>Huwei.</i>

288
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:08,741
<i>- Oh, it's from Bomi.</i>
- <i>Bomi.</i>

289
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:11,477
I HOPE WE CAN MAKE LOTS OF TIME
FOR THE TWO OF US OVER THE LAST MONTH.

290
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,849
I HOPE ONE DAY I CAN PUT
MY FEELINGS INTO WORDS. SINCERELY YOURS.

291
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,652
- <i>Oh, I'm glad. "Sincerely"?</i>
- <i>"Sincerely yours"?</i>

292
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,628
<i>No letters?</i>

293
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,163
<i>Oh.</i>

294
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,333
- <i>Kazu…</i>
- <i>I'm starting to worry.</i>

295
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,002
<i>He's in that "kind older brother" role.</i>

296
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,270
<i>Exactly.</i>

297
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,082
- <i>Oh, no…</i>
- <i>Well, he's the youngest.</i>

298
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,118
Of course.

299
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,587
- <i>It's just beginning.</i>
- <i>Still time.</i>

300
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,623
<i>The ocean is so peaceful </i>

301
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,626
<i>The mountaintop's a steeple</i>

302
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,896
<i>And the beauty of the people…</i>

303
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,599
- <i>Wait, did he get one?</i>
- <i>More than one!</i>

304
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,368
- <i>He must be happy.</i>
- <i>Hurry!</i>

305
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,036
<i>- Who sent them?</i>
- <i>Playing it cool.</i>

306
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,604
<i>Maybe one's from Taeheon.</i>

307
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:16,175
<i>…high above the world…</i>

308
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,645
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU CHEERY AGAIN.

309
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,380
- <i>Kazuyuki wrote him</i>.
- <i>Wow.</i>

310
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,449
I HOPE YOU ENJOY
THE REST OF OUR TIME HERE!

311
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,150
<i>Who is this from?</i>

312
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,152
THANK YOU FOR BEING KIND!
I HOPE WE CAN GET ALONG.

313
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,054
- <i>It's from Tomoaki</i>.
- <i>Tomoaki.</i>

314
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:32,691
Of course, I would've been happy
if I'd also gotten one from Taeheon.

315
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,693
But I don't think this letter is from him.

316
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,762
I think things are just getting started.

317
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:38,530
Yeah.

318
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:41,300
<i>Never come back down</i>

319
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,337
<i>Never touch the ground </i>

320
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,707
<i>The ocean looks so peaceful…</i>

321
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,410
<i>That's wonderful!</i>

322
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:52,311
<i>A steeple </i>

323
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:56,815
<i>And the beauty of the people</i>
<i>Oh, so small </i>

324
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:58,083
I HAD FUN COOKING WITH YOU.

325
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,085
- I'm glad.
- <i>Taeheon!</i>

326
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,487
I ADMIRED YOUR QUIET HARD WORK!

327
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:05,457
I wasn't expecting
to get any letters from anyone here.

328
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,494
So it made me happy to find one.

329
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,730
- <i>That would make him happy.</i>
- <i>Absolutely.</i>

330
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:16,869
<i>Flying away </i>

331
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:20,139
<i>It makes me feel so calm</i>

332
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,408
<i>- Takes my cares away…</i>
- <i>Oh!</i>

333
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:23,876
<i>Good for him!</i>

334
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,945
<i>I don't think he ever got</i>
<i>a letter in season one, so…</i>

335
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,113
<i>You're right.</i>

336
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,350
<i>Flying away, never come back down</i>…

337
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,852
I WAS SUPER HAPPY
THAT YOU TALKED TO ME SO MUCH!

338
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,089
I was surprised.
There were two letters for me.

339
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:41,960
When I opened it this morning,
my eyes probably got bigger.

340
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,362
I was like, "What?"

341
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:46,799
I WAS REALLY DRAWN TO YOUR SMILE.
I HOPE WE CAN SHARE MORE LAUGHS.

342
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,935
It's been so long since I've heard
the words, "I was really drawn to you."

343
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,739
Yeah, I wonder who it's from.

344
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,576
YOSHIMI, CHIAKI, THELMA, DURIAN

345
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:00,412
- Things are shaking up.
- Things are starting to move.

346
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,248
It feels like a new season
has just started.

347
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,285
Tomoaki has joined the show,
but he seems fragile.

348
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,721
He said he thinks negatively
about everything,

349
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:13,392
but yet he gathered up enough courage
to come on this show.

350
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,961
He wants a boyfriend to meet his parents.

351
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,497
Everyone's situation is
more or less the same,

352
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:22,134
and I think they're all dealing
with similar concerns as well.

353
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:25,037
It's reassuring to have people
like that around, isn't it?

354
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,972
- And then there's…
- Taeheon!

355
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,907
- Taeheon.
- The big sister.

356
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:32,144
He finally made his entrance
after a bunch of slo-mo shots.

357
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,046
I liked the way he turned round
when he came in.

358
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,414
- <i>Me too.</i>
- <i>Swish!</i>

359
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,216
<i>He totally drew out the suspense.</i>

360
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,417
"It's me. Swish."

361
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,719
We know Jobu likes Taeheon,
and that he said,

362
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,754
"I hope Taeheon comes on the show,".

363
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,591
Now, his wish has literally come true,
right?

364
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,960
- This is amazing for Jobu.
- I'm happy that Jobu looks happy.

365
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:50,762
They say that the best cure
for a broken heart is a new love, right?

366
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,464
Absolutely, sensei.

367
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:56,135
In season one, Taeheon was always the
reliable older brother everyone went to,

368
00:18:56,201 --> 00:19:00,005
and he gave a lot of really wonderful
advice that helped them through the show.

369
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:03,642
But as for romance, we never saw
any signs of anything happening.

370
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:07,479
So now I'm kind of curious
to see what Taeheon will be like.

371
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,848
- In full romance mode.
- Yes, me too!

372
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:13,285
Yeah, we kind of know Taeheon, but we
don't know what he's like in romance mode.

373
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,154
We don't know that side of him yet.

374
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,989
I wonder if he cries and shouts.

375
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:19,191
Like, "What's the deal?"
Or something like that.

376
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:22,861
What about Huwei and Bomi?
They both wrote to each other.

377
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,796
But I wonder how Huwei feels.

378
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:28,267
I couldn't decide if he had a "brilliant
mind" conversation at the foot bath.

379
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:32,137
- What was that with those two?
- Or he was being his normal awkward self.

380
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,173
- It was like a comedy skit.
- So funny.

381
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:37,843
- They should go on stage.
- His words could be interpreted.

382
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,679
- Was he talking about his feet or heart?
- It was funny!

383
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,419
I wanted to know,

384
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:51,590
is there anything you want to do
during the rest of your stay here?

385
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:54,626
Of course. At first,
I was hoping to focus on romance

386
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,695
and everything that goes with that…

387
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:03,135
But now, I'm thinking it might be too late
to start anything

388
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,338
with anyone who's here at the Green Room.

389
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,907
What about you, Huwei?

390
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:11,877
- Hmm? It's complicated right now.
- It's complicated?

391
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,145
Mmm.

392
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:18,350
It kind of feels like
I'm watching myself from the outside,

393
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,385
waiting to see how my feelings will grow.

394
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,655
- It might be hard to understand.
- No, I kind of get it.

395
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,391
You're looking at yourself objectively.

396
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,728
Well, it's more like I'm experimenting

397
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:34,032
to see if or how
my feelings will change, right now.

398
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,902
I was wondering.

399
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,471
Do you want to fall in love?

400
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,473
Well, yeah, naturally…

401
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,910
I always thought it'd be nice
to fall in love again.

402
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,913
But I wonder if I can still
do that here, right now.

403
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,147
- Mmm.
- Hmm.

404
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,416
So I think I'll use my time here

405
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:55,854
to look back on my entire
15-year relationship

406
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,223
with fondness.

407
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,292
When did you break up
with your last partner?

408
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,828
- Around August, I think.
- Of last year?

409
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:03,962
Mmm.

410
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:07,366
I was actually thinking of writing down

411
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,702
all of my reflections
on those 15 years while I'm here.

412
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,604
- You'll write them down?
- In a notebook.

413
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,540
- In a notebook?
- I've been writing a bit lately.

414
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,875
Mmm.

415
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,777
And when you actually write things down?

416
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,879
- You sometimes notice new things.
- Yeah.

417
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:24,249
It's been so long that
I'd forgotten a lot of things.

418
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:28,453
But by talking and listening,
I remembered a lot of what happened.

419
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,423
So you decided to write down
all your reflections?

420
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,458
- About your past relationship?
- Exactly.

421
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,663
<i>Wouldn't writing things down</i>
<i>make it harder for him to let go?</i>

422
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:41,033
- He'd remember more and more vividly.
- I think he'd get stuck in the past.

423
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,901
Or it could help him sort things out.

424
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,472
There are more nameplates now.

425
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,775
- There are.
- Look at all that.

426
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:52,377
- It goes all the way down.
- There are a lot now.

427
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,746
- There it is!
- Please.

428
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,916
I'll read it. "Here's the person
on duty for today's shift."

429
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,786
"For today's shift,
Taeheon will be on duty."

430
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,354
Ooh!

431
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:03,755
Already?

432
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:08,360
"Anyone who wants to work
with Taeheon, please put your hand up."

433
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,062
Ooh!

434
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,930
- Okay.
- We nominate ourselves?

435
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:12,964
We nominate ourselves.

436
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:15,534
"Taeheon, please choose
one person you want to work with

437
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,402
if more than one person
raises their hand."

438
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:21,106
"Once you've decided, please
turn over that person's nameplate."

439
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,975
- I want to go.
- I think I want to go too.

440
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,078
I want to go too!

441
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,847
- <i>He's so popular!</i>
- <i>What a star!</i>

442
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:32,484
- I want to go.
- Four people want to go?

443
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,889
- Well, okay!
- This is the first time we do this.

444
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:40,692
- Yeah, he's right.
- It's the first time.

445
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:49,835
- <i>Who will he choose?</i>
- <i>It'd be wild if Jobu could go.</i>

446
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,908
- Oh!
- No way.

447
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,477
<i>Huwei!</i>

448
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,878
<i>Why him?</i>

449
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,147
- Let's work together.
- Let's work together.

450
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,551
- I have to get ready.
- Have a good time.

451
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,687
- Have a good time.
- Go enjoy it.

452
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:13,525
I raised my hand because
I wanted him to go with me, not Huwei.

453
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:17,295
<i>I was like, "Don't go with him,</i>
<i>go with me instead."</i>

454
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:20,365
But then, Taeheon chose Huwei,
and I was like, "Well, of course."

455
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,501
I remember in season one,

456
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,370
Taeheon had put a letter
in Usak's mailbox,

457
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,272
<i>and he was interested in him.</i>

458
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:30,375
<i>He kind of likes big guys.</i>

459
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:36,081
Maybe that's why he wrote
to someone he was attracted to physically.

460
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,883
That's what Jobu said.

461
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,619
That's why I thought
Taeheon would choose Huwei.

462
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:42,521
That's an impressive analysis.

463
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,423
- Bomi was playing a game of chess.
- Absolutely.

464
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:47,259
Trying to prevent Taeheon
from positioning himself.

465
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,327
Hello and welcome.

466
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,196
A drip coffee, medium.

467
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,365
- Drip coffee, medium, and…
- The same for me.

468
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:54,966
Two drip coffees.

469
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,135
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Thanks.

470
00:23:57,202 --> 00:24:00,272
- Two drip coffees, medium. Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

471
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:02,908
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, thank you.

472
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:05,811
TODAY'S SALES
3,850 YEN

473
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,881
- I'm tired.
- How was work?

474
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:14,553
Okay. I did everything I could in an hour.

475
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,155
- I haven't been working recently.
- I noticed.

476
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:19,357
- Yeah, I'm not really in work mode.
- I get it.

477
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:23,995
By the way, there's something
I want to discuss with you.

478
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:27,265
I'd like to talk about our future together
in more detail…

479
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:30,068
so if you don't mind,
we could have a one-on-one talk.

480
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,437
I'd like to talk things over with you.

481
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:33,772
- Okay.
- Yeah.

482
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,441
Two or three years from now,
or even in five years…

483
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:41,713
Ultimately, I want to know whether we want
to get married or not and stuff like that.

484
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,283
Well, as you know,
my mind's already made up.

485
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:50,121
I mean, I sort of
had a life plan for myself from the start.

486
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,291
I knew at what age
I wanted to get married.

487
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:58,763
It's not necessarily about us.
There are things you want for yourself.

488
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,066
Right?

489
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:08,607
But right now, I want to hear
your plans for the immediate future.

490
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:13,044
What do you want to do? If I go
to Barcelona for three months, can you go?

491
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,446
Yes, of course.

492
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,482
I can go.
It's just about going back for me.

493
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:21,319
If anything, I think the burden
of the decision will be on you.

494
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:22,387
At first, right?

495
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:25,824
What if you go there and it's not what
you expected? Working hours are different.

496
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,393
- It will be new for me.
- Yeah, it's very different.

497
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,563
The schedules, the environment,
and even the language.

498
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,398
I have to study Spanish.

499
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:37,102
You say that like it's something easy,
but it's not that easy.

500
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,072
- Aren't you worried?
- Me?

501
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,643
Not really.

502
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,012
That's nice.

503
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,650
Give me some of that optimism.

504
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,219
Because I believe in you.

505
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:57,188
I know, but I'm not that…

506
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,591
You never know with people.

507
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,694
What do you mean?

508
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,897
- Like, your feelings might change?
- That won't happen. Of course it won't.

509
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,465
But you never know.

510
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:10,068
The thing is… people change.

511
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:11,770
Mmm.

512
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,444
<i>I wanted to hear</i>
<i>his thoughts about our future,</i>

513
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,279
<i>like, five or ten years from now.</i>

514
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:24,816
Our romance has just started,
and our relationship is still new,

515
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:28,787
so I just wanted to have fun
talking together about our dreams.

516
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,389
He did say he has
a life plan all mapped out

517
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:35,026
and that he can explain
what kind of future he's hoping to build

518
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,129
with the person
he ends up living with, eventually.

519
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:42,200
But he didn't say
specifically "With Izaya."

520
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:46,371
He didn't say those words,
so I was a bit…

521
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:47,906
Hmm.

522
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,941
It made me feel a bit unsettled.

523
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,877
Even I would feel anxious hearing that.

524
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,279
Mmm.

525
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,082
I completely understand how Izaya feels.

526
00:26:57,148 --> 00:27:00,285
He wants to know what William's
general vision for the future is.

527
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:03,188
But what he said didn't sound like that.

528
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:07,892
Maybe they're the kind of couple
that needs to constantly talk things out.

529
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,161
But isn't a relationship
supposed to be like that?

530
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,864
- Don't you constantly work things out?
- When you're serious.

531
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,200
The three of us here
are usually guided by our feelings,

532
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:17,235
and these two are all about
thinking things through.

533
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,536
We think them through.

534
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,438
His tone might have been
a bit heavy and clumsy,

535
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:23,308
but it's helpful to know,
at this stage of the relationship,

536
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,076
which direction
each one of them is facing,

537
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,345
or willing to go, regarding their future.

538
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,047
They might be facing different directions,

539
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,249
but they can work it out
and adjust to each other.

540
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,652
That's all he really wanted
to talk about… right?

541
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:34,819
- Yeah.
- Just a little talk.

542
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:38,056
I understand, but…
they just barely got together.

543
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:42,494
Right now, William just wants to enjoy the
honeymoon phase of their new relationship.

544
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,929
He just wants to have some time
to enjoy what he already has.

545
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,632
Yes, but even if they do enjoy
the honeymoon phase now,

546
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,200
their paths might not cross later.

547
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,703
They would just be wasting
their time, That's possible too.

548
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,905
But when are they supposed
to enjoy the honeymoon phase?

549
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:54,939
That's what I'm saying.

550
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,575
He's saying, "Give me some time
to enjoy the honeymoon phase."

551
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:01,079
- You can enjoy it, and at the same time--
- You can't do both at the same time!

552
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:04,916
- No, that's impossible to do.
- It's hard to enjoy it and talk logistics.

553
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:07,419
People change, right?
Even when you're aligned.

554
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:09,554
Yeah, you never know.

555
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,223
People change, but
Izaya's just looking for peace of mind.

556
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,426
It'll be fine!

557
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:15,894
It'll be fine!

558
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,363
- There's nothing to prove it, but…
- It'll be fine!

559
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,065
When you're in that honeymoon phase?

560
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,834
- You can coat the differences with honey.
- That's really good!

561
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:25,336
- Oh, that might be true.
- Ohh!

562
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:27,238
That makes sense. That might be true.

563
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:28,606
When the honeymoon phase is over?

564
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,709
- Differences are all you see.
- Too late.

565
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,510
It might make things even more tense.

566
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:36,114
That's probably why Izaya wanted
to know William's general thoughts…

567
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:40,018
especially since they were still enjoying
the honeymoon phase of their story.

568
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:43,421
"What about five or ten years from now?
What about marriage?"

569
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:45,490
I also understand why
William was like, "Whoa."

570
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,325
I get both sides.

571
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,327
- They're both right.
- Two different types.

572
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,395
They're both serious.

573
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,831
- They really like each other.
- Let's not forget that!

574
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,267
Yeah, so everyone watching can
ask themselves which type they are.

575
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:59,471
- Place a hand on your chest.
- People can take something away from this.

576
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:04,042
We didn't take any photos today.
Should we take one now?

577
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,144
Should we take one now?

578
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,915
Let me take it for you?

579
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:12,784
Good idea, thanks.

580
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,386
- I'm all puffy.
- You are?

581
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:16,888
You're not puffy at all.

582
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:19,390
It should be vertical.

583
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,893
Vertical? You're so particular.

584
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:23,795
Looking good!

585
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:28,633
Thanks. Thank you.

586
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,569
Oh?

587
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:33,304
- What?
- It pinged.

588
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:34,873
- Huh?
- It pinged again?

589
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,976
- Does someone want to read it?
- It did? I'll do it.

590
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,913
"We have an announcement."

591
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,618
- What?
- I'm scared.

592
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:50,588
"Tomorrow, you will go
on a one-on-one date."

593
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:52,390
- <i>Here we go!</i>
- <i>Who'll it be?</i>

594
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,426
"Write the name of the person
you want to go with on a piece of paper."

595
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:01,099
"You can only go on a date
if your feelings are mutual."

596
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,002
- That's it.
- Yay!

597
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,471
- Yay!
- Yay.

598
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:26,558
<i>Every now and then</i>
<i>I like to make pretend</i>

599
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:30,228
<i>I'm livin' high up in the clouds</i>

600
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,630
<i>Soakin' up the sun</i>

601
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:34,465
<i>We're havin' lots of fun</i>

602
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:37,502
<i>Yeah, all my friends are hangin' out</i>

603
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,505
<i>La, la, la, la, la</i>

604
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,607
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la</i>

605
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:46,177
<i>We're livin' high up in the clouds</i>

606
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,313
<i>Na, na, na, na, na </i>

607
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:50,381
<i>Na, na, na, na, na, na</i>

608
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:53,885
<i>We're never gonna come back down</i>

609
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,755
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

610
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,490
<i>Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

611
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:02,727
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

612
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:05,897
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

613
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,665
<i>Everything is all right </i>

614
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:11,870
<i>Better, all a good time</i>
<i>La, la, la, la</i>

615
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:15,206
- <i>I hope at least three pairs go.</i>
- <i>Yeah, I want to see that.</i>

616
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,348
- It pinged.
- Okay, here we go.

617
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:28,152
"Here are the names of the
couples who can go on one-on-one dates."

618
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,121
Yay!

619
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:33,825
Let's see. "Pair one."

620
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:41,032
"Izaya."

621
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:44,769
"William."

622
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:45,737
Mmm.

623
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:48,072
<i>They can go and have another proper talk.</i>

624
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,141
- It's your second date?
- It's our second date.

625
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,644
Uh, "Pair two."

626
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,779
- Oh!
- Oh! Another pair?

627
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:57,181
<i>Who's going?</i>

628
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,155
I'm nervous.

629
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:06,591
"Huwei."

630
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,627
<i>Who's he going with?</i>

631
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,362
<i>Bomi or Taeheon?</i>

632
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,701
"Bomi."

633
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:19,370
<i>Oh, thank goodness.</i>

634
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,307
<i>Maybe Huwei's feelings really are</i>
<i>finally heating up a little bit?</i>

635
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:25,143
Oh, I'm glad. I was so nervous.

636
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:29,147
"That's all."

637
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:31,549
Congratulations.

638
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,351
- You're lucky.
- Have fun.

639
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:35,353
I will, thanks.

640
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:38,556
- Have a good time.
- Bye-bye.

641
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,558
- Bye-bye.
- Have fun.

642
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,934
I'm sad. Or maybe I should say,
I wish he had chosen me,

643
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:53,371
but it's the first time,
so things can change in the future.

644
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:56,307
I see he didn't choose me.
That's about it.

645
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,577
- He still doesn't know everything.
- He doesn't know, you can't blame him.

646
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,779
Ryuki chose Taeheon,
and Taeheon chose Huwei.

647
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:04,182
- Right. Ryuki chose Taeheon.
- Oh, I see now.

648
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,250
Taeheon really chose Huwei, huh?

649
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,819
- The feelings don't match.
- Yeah.

650
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:10,221
- Not with this many people.
- It's hard, isn't it?

651
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:11,990
Welcome.

652
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:17,462
It's our second date, but…
were you nervous this morning?

653
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:18,730
- This morning?
- Mmm.

654
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,198
I was a little nervous.

655
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:21,699
- Oh.
- Hmm.

656
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,801
Honestly, I was super nervous.

657
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,436
- You were?
- Yeah.

658
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,671
<i>I was praying.</i>

659
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:34,612
I can really tell you're slowly trying
to take the idea of us seriously.

660
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,083
What made you begin to feel like that?
That's what I want to know.

661
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:46,090
Well, at first, when I noticed you here,
I didn't see you in a romantic light.

662
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:50,395
But your intentions towards me
were so serious,

663
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:52,930
I found myself wanting to respond to that.

664
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:55,199
But I was afraid
those weren't my real feelings,

665
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:57,735
and I thought that wasn't
the right thing to do.

666
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:00,171
I've been watching you for a while, and…

667
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:05,843
I don't know, sometimes,
in the most random moments…

668
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:09,280
when I really don't expect it,
I see you and I find you really cute.

669
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:13,418
What kind of random moments?

670
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,120
- Do you mean my gestures?
- Mmm.

671
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:18,289
I see.

672
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,227
You know,
it's pretty amazing to be living together.

673
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:24,362
I get it.

674
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,731
- It's strange, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is strange.

675
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:32,170
- <i>He keeps staring.</i>
- <i>He's drinking and staring.</i>

676
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,540
Do you like mugs?

677
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,241
Hmm.

678
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,010
Yeah, I do.

679
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:40,711
Mmm.

680
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:44,015
- You just thought you'd ask?
- Yeah. Why?

681
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:45,817
I thought you'd say that.

682
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:48,886
If I asked you why, you'd say,
"Nothing, I just thought I'd ask."

683
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:51,389
Huh? What?

684
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,828
I wonder what the pairs
on dates are doing.

685
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:58,429
I wonder what they're doing.

686
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,632
I feel like my heart's about to give out.

687
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:05,303
There's just so much
happening here every day.

688
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:09,507
Do you think it's fun in the Green Room?

689
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:11,242
Well, yeah. It's fun.

690
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:13,277
Was it really fun from the start?

691
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:15,713
It was so-so. Yeah.

692
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,716
You don't start enjoying yourself
until you get settled in.

693
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,684
That's so true.

694
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,553
I thought it would be easier

695
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,023
if I didn't share my opinions
in front of a big group,

696
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,827
so I tried to stick
to a tight circle of close friends

697
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,430
to make life a little easier for myself.

698
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:37,101
And now, I've been thinking a lot about
how that wasn't a good thing.

699
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,204
- Maybe you're overthinking it.
- Mmm.

700
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:43,975
I don't think
anyone cares that much anyway.

701
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:48,546
I joined the group
halfway through the show just like you,

702
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:51,916
but that doesn't mean that
the people who were here before me

703
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,352
always get to call the shots
on what we do.

704
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:57,555
As participants,
we're all in the same position.

705
00:35:58,189 --> 00:35:59,657
We should try to overcome it.

706
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:03,094
Yeah. I came here to overcome it. Mmm.

707
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,363
- <i>Taeheon's really great.</i>
- <i>He's so kind.</i>

708
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:09,500
- <i>He's always known what to say.</i>
- <i>Yeah, I remember, he was great.</i>

709
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:12,937
This is the place.

710
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:13,971
It's really nice.

711
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:16,741
- It's really nice.
- It's a nice restaurant. I can't wait.

712
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,311
- After you.
- Thank you.

713
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,447
ROBATA AND WINE K

714
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:25,883
Whoa!

715
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,056
This is my first time
in a place with a view like this.

716
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:33,424
- It's amazing.
- Nice.

717
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:35,326
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

718
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:42,700
This is our first proper dinner together?

719
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:43,601
Yeah.

720
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,736
- This is nice.
- Mmm.

721
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:47,271
Mmm.

722
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,777
- Whoa! How amazing.
- Whoa, it's a paella! Wow.

723
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,445
This is our local crab.

724
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,014
Crab!

725
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,883
- With the shell on top.
- Looks great.

726
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,418
It's red snow crab.

727
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:01,619
I really love paella.

728
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:03,654
- Like it?
- I love it.

729
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,823
It's different from
what you'd get in Barcelona.

730
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,427
- But it's delicious.
- Delicious.

731
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:10,861
Thank you very much.

732
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:15,032
I have this image in my mind.

733
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:18,002
You know, once you get to be our age,

734
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,971
dates start to look
a lot like this, right?

735
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,773
Not just in Japan, but even overseas.

736
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,043
I imagine we'll do this kind of thing
every now and then.

737
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:30,781
Which brings us back
to our conversation the other day.

738
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:34,986
Can you imagine
what the future will look like

739
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,821
in five or ten years?

740
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,923
Or is it still difficult?

741
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:42,827
I mean, sometimes,
you get into a negative mood, right?

742
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:46,130
I've been thinking recently
that I'm making you feel that way

743
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,165
and I'm making you anxious.

744
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:49,433
It's not

745
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,536
that I'm holding anything back.

746
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:57,608
It's just that, if anything,

747
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,778
I want to think about
the immediate future first,

748
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,246
rather than the next five years.

749
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:04,448
Or our future.

750
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,019
- Because we haven't talked about that yet.
- That's true.

751
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,454
Let's have fun.

752
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:14,992
There's your answer.
He dodged the question.

753
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,927
How's Izaya gonna take it?

754
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:17,928
It makes me nervous.

755
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:20,698
Izaya might think
he's being given the runaround.

756
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:22,967
It probably wasn't
the answer he was hoping for.

757
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,035
- Right?
- Maybe.

758
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:28,306
When someone asks you, "Do you think
about the future in five or ten years?"

759
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:30,341
are you supposed to say, "Yeah, I do."

760
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,410
"Let's go ahead
and enjoy the future together."

761
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,045
- What do you think?
- What? Well…

762
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,914
- What are you supposed to say?
- What are you to do, sensei?

763
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,318
They're in the early, passionate phase,
so you can just talk about your dreams.

764
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,887
Right now, it doesn't matter
if they come true or not, okay?

765
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:45,256
He wants to dream about the future
in a lighthearted way.

766
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,724
- Is that how it is?
- Sorry.

767
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,292
- That's all he wants to do.
- Oh, really?

768
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,128
Talking about the immediate future
feels more real.

769
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:53,631
- It's scary to seriously discuss that.
- Oh, is that it?

770
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:57,535
But his reaction to the red snow crab
was absolutely too weak.

771
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:59,070
He was thinking about the future.

772
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:01,672
- Even with such a delicious paella!
- I'm sorry.

773
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,207
- "It's delicious."
- Yeah.

774
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:05,009
"So, about our future lives…"

775
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,411
The chef must have been like,
"I can't deal with this drama."

776
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:10,748
- I was neglecting the crab. Sorry.
- He was just promoting his specialty dish.

777
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:13,951
It's really all about enjoying
and living in the present, isn't it?

778
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,254
Izaya probably thinks that if they have
a future, they can come back each year

779
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:18,723
to eat this wonderful crab dish.

780
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,758
Enjoy your crab today,
and not the future one!

781
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:23,594
Exactly! Mister, that's exactly right!

782
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:25,963
- Words to live by!
- There's a crab in front of you!

783
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,065
Yeah, but they should be able
to enjoy both crabs.

784
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:31,035
They should be able to enjoy today's crab
and also the future crab.

785
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:33,170
- They're trying to figure that out.
- Exactly.

786
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:36,040
- Which type of couple they are.
- William wants to enjoy crab today.

787
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:39,844
Izaya wants to be sure to enjoy crab
five or ten years in the future.

788
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:43,514
He's missed out on crabs before, so he's
scared that he might lose this one too.

789
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,450
- A lost crab is worth two in the dish.
- Let's find the next crab.

790
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:49,220
- There are lots of crabs.
- The next is hard to come by.

791
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:51,922
Crabs can only move sideways.
They can't move forward when they want.

792
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:56,260
- You're so right, mister!
- Crabs always move like this or like this.

793
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,796
They really don't know
how to move forward in life.

794
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,164
- That was hilarious.
- So…

795
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,067
Hu-chan and Bomi finally seem
to really be hitting it off.

796
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,902
Hitting it off… but slowly.

797
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,238
The foot bath conversation
is really working.

798
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:10,174
- It's working. It's definitely working.
- Maybe they're heating up?

799
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,477
But I don't feel a spark yet.
It hasn't sparked.

800
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:16,380
Maybe what they need
is a romcom kiss scene.

801
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,249
One of those big smooch scenes.

802
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:20,751
- Like in the '80s or '90s.
- Oh, I like that.

803
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:24,522
- Holding their face while going for it.
- Like leaning out of a car window to kiss.

804
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,825
- They should have that.
- They need a trigger.

805
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,562
Wow, I can't wait.

806
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,497
SIGHTSEEING CRUISE

807
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:36,801
- Please watch your head.
- Okay. Wow.

808
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,737
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

809
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:41,405
Yay.

810
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,307
- I can't wait.
- I can't wait.

811
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:47,011
- Here we go!
- And away we go!

812
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:49,447
The weather is awful.

813
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,916
It couldn't get worse than this.

814
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,952
- Is this hail?
- It's hail.

815
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,055
I guess the hail is welcoming us.

816
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,657
Is that what it is?

817
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:03,994
- Huh?
- It's cold, isn't it?

818
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:05,029
It's cold.

819
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:06,997
You're so warm.

820
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:08,966
Aah.

821
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:14,738
So warm.

822
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:18,476
<i>They're holding</i>
<i>each other's ears. How cute is that?</i>

823
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:21,312
- <i>This is cute. It's really sweet.</i>
- <i>Yeah, this is cute.</i>

824
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:27,718
- <i>That, you couldn't script.</i>
- <i>No, you couldn't write that.</i>

825
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,653
- <i>That was amazing.</i>
- <i>True.</i>

826
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,589
- Wanna do the Titanic pose?
- Sure.

827
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,023
Spread your arms like this.

828
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,792
- Is this how you do it?
- Yeah.

829
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:37,027
Hey!

830
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:39,830
HUWEI, BOMI

831
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:41,665
- It's cold.
- It's cold.

832
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,969
- It's pretty.
- Yeah.

833
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:46,570
Okay.

834
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,250
- It's pretty.
- It's really pretty.

835
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:06,824
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah, I did. And also…

836
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,427
I don't know.

837
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:11,829
Oh, it's cold.

838
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:21,972
I hope we can come back again.

839
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,140
Let's go again.

840
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:27,478
Okay!

841
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,381
<i>I wonder what</i>
<i>he was going to say after "And also…"</i>

842
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,324
- Huh.
- Okay.

843
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,995
- Bomi's not here.
- Oh, is he sick?

844
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,731
It was cold yesterday. It was really cold.

845
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:51,268
- We should let him rest a while.
- Yeah.

846
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:52,736
That way he'll get better.

847
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:32,810
- <i>What's wrong with him?</i>
- <i>He's just standing there.</i>

848
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:35,846
- <i>He seems distracted.</i>
- <i>Now he's back to his old self.</i>

849
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:49,093
- <i>He's already done.</i>
- <i>Fast!</i>

850
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,395
- <i>Looks like he can't concentrate.</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

851
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:57,968
- Welcome back.
- The soba looks good.

852
00:43:58,035 --> 00:43:59,737
It was good, but it's all gone.

853
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,939
I don't need it.
It's fine. I'm not hungry.

854
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:03,407
Want my leftovers?

855
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:12,783
- <i>Hey, he's…</i>
- <i>Maybe he'll make Bomi something?</i>

856
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,519
- Are you going to eat something?
- No, I'm not.

857
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:17,454
What's this? Are you baking?

858
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,523
- I might make a caramel custard.
- Oh!

859
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,291
- What?
- Caramel custard.

860
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:23,560
- What? Just like that?
- Mmm.

861
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:25,195
That's just like you, Huwei.

862
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:27,831
What's in a caramel custard?

863
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:30,234
Eggs and milk? Is that all you need?

864
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,769
That's all you need.

865
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,958
- Did the timer go off?
- It did.

866
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:00,964
Oh, I think the caramel
has melted just right.

867
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:03,934
Wow, it smells really eggy.

868
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:05,469
You're right.

869
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:08,238
- Let's see…
- Is it done?

870
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,380
It looks like <i>chawanmushi!</i>

871
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:20,417
- It does!
- <i>Chawanmushi.</i>

872
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:22,753
- We're leaving.
- See ya.

873
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:37,000
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>Oh!</i>

874
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,603
- <i>Two cups!</i>
- <i>He'll eat it with him!</i>

875
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,538
- Oh, how sweet!
- Oh, wow!

876
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:44,174
- This is incredible.
- That is so cute!

877
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:03,827
I made caramel custard. Let's eat.

878
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:05,763
I'm happy.

879
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,098
Sorry, you surprised me, I just woke up.

880
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:09,566
- You just woke up?
- Mmm.

881
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,269
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, come in.

882
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:14,605
- Excuse me.
- Go ahead.

883
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:17,141
Wow, this is my first time
entering someone's room.

884
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:21,044
Do you have a cold?

885
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:25,215
I'm not really sure it's a cold.
I have a bit of a fever.

886
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,017
- Really?
- A slight fever.

887
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,189
- Yay!
- Yay!

888
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:34,057
- Did you make it?
- Yeah, I did.

889
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:36,527
Wow, amazing.

890
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:39,596
Okay, let's eat.

891
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:49,039
How is it?

892
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:52,776
- It's delicious.
- Okay, good.

893
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:57,047
It turns out you can make
caramel custard on a whim.

894
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:58,081
Mmm?

895
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:03,754
What did you do today?
You made caramel custard and?

896
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:06,857
- I made the caramel custard by myself.
- What, you did?

897
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:08,592
You guys didn't make it together?

898
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,762
I tried making it discreetly
while everyone was eating,

899
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,096
but they found out.

900
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,399
So, you made some for everyone then?

901
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:16,433
No, I didn't.

902
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,768
- Just for me?
- Mmm.

903
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,503
- Really?
- Hmm.

904
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:24,741
That kind of makes me happy.

905
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:28,745
- Was it because I was in bed?
- Mmm.

906
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:32,549
Are you kidding me?

907
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:37,254
You can't just do cute things like that.
You're making me blush. I mean, really!

908
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:40,958
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

909
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,093
I really didn't have an appetite.

910
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,830
I thought so, and I figured
caramel custard would go down easier.

911
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:48,799
- I'm happy.
- Or a gelatin dessert.

912
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:51,068
That makes me happy.

913
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:53,403
That makes me very happy.

914
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,311
- You're zoning out, aren't you?
- Mmm.

915
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:05,349
Because I can't see.

916
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:07,184
- Hmm?
- Because I can't see.

917
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:10,220
- How bad is your eyesight again?
- It's really bad.

918
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:12,155
- You can't see anything?
- Hmm?

919
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,624
How far can you see?

920
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:15,859
- Can you see my face?
- No.

921
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:16,793
It's that bad?

922
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,199
I can't see unless I get this close.

923
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:24,434
- It's that bad?
- I'm serious.

924
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:27,804
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey!

925
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:30,540
That made me get out of my chair.

926
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:36,513
I like him.

927
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:38,815
Maybe.

928
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:51,128
When our faces got close,
I felt like I liked him.

929
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:53,897
My heart was racing, too.

930
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:56,800
And I was like, "Wow, we're really close."

931
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:03,273
When I do something for him,
he gets really happy,

932
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,142
and that makes me really happy.

933
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:08,045
I can't do anything really romantic,

934
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:11,214
but I want to do
a lot of little things for him.

935
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:16,019
- Do you think you'll be better tomorrow?
- Mmm, of course.

936
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:21,291
It's not fun without me, right?

937
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,194
- That must be it.
- You'll be bored, Hu-chan.

938
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:27,364
- What do you mean?
- I'll get better for you.

939
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,533
See you.

940
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:31,969
What?

941
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:37,708
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

942
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,712
- Bye.
- Bye.

943
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,083
Thanks again.
I'll eat all of it so leave it here.

944
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,418
- Mmm.
- Thanks.

945
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:50,354
Welcome.

946
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:52,289
- Bye.
- See you.

947
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:53,523
See you tomorrow.

948
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,660
Bye.

949
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,915
- That was so good!
- That was a great--

950
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:21,118
We finally got ourselves
another legendary scene.

951
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,552
- Finally.
- We did.

952
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:25,188
- What?
- Come on! You even stood up for it.

953
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:28,525
- I just stood up without thinking!
- I've never seen you stand on this show.

954
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:30,394
A 50-year-old stood up!

955
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:33,530
I love that he said he had bad eyesight.

956
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:35,732
- It allowed him to get close!
- I'll steal that!

957
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:38,468
Huwei was like,
"You can't see? How far can you see?"

958
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:42,572
- Then Bomi got really close. It was great!
- That was intense! Intense!

959
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:44,975
- It's what <i>The Boyfriend's </i>about!
- Was that a spark?

960
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,744
- And the hand-holding too.
- Yeah, what was that?

961
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:50,647
- "See you tomorrow!"
- Bomi wanted to hug him and kiss him.

962
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:51,648
But was like…

963
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,183
- Right.
- Poor Bomi!

964
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,585
- I get it!
- Everything was in that gesture.

965
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:57,554
- He was holding it back.
- That was sweet.

966
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:59,823
Oh! That was great.
