That's true.

101
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:42,402
Also, the lighting makes it hard
to see faces from here, right?

102
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,437

00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,915
and I think there are some things that can
only sprout because you have two months.

172
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,617
Is there anyone who caught your interest?

173
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,685
All the participants this time
are so handsome!

174
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:20,586
- Right?
- Yes.

175
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:24,357
- Many people with a global mindset.
- Many with global backgrounds.

176
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:27,560
William, for example,
just got back from Barcelona,

177
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,763
and he seems like someone
who's been flying all over the place.

178
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,734
So I think he might be someone with
new values and a broad perspective.

179
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:38,170
For me, since
we're around the same age, it's Kazuyuki.

180
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:39,305
I get it.

181
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,474
I think it takes a lot of courage

182
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,443
to jump into a place like this
at this age.

183
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:48,547
I'm a bit curious to see
how his determination to jump in here

184
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,583
will develop over the next two months.

185
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,585
- Yeah.
- What about you, Thelma?

186
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,022
So, Bomi said,
when Huwei entered the Green Room,

187
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,124
he said, "Um… Oh, we once…"

188
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,726
- He did say that!
- He did.

189
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,962
I was like, "What did he mean by 'once'?"

190
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,397
That made me curious.

191
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,432
But there were people
who already knew each other.

192
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,835
- There were quite a few of them.
- Durian mentioned it's a small world.

193
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,438
Yeah, things like
you've been drinking at the same bar.

194
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,673
Or you met at the same club.

195
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,175
Things like that happen all the time.

196
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:20,312
I think we'll find out from here
what kind of acquaintances they are.

197
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,148
True. I wonder how they know each other.

198
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,916
- It could be good or bad.
- Good or bad!

199
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,584
What did he mean by "once"?

200
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,287
- Right?
- I'm so curious.

201
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,357
- We're having steak.
- Awesome.

202
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,993
- This is amazing.
- For this many people.

203
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,995
I've never cooked for this many people.

204
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,897
- I can't guess the portions.
- No idea.

205
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,032
- We don't need that many mushrooms.
- We don't?

206
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,834
- I don't think so.
- Nearly overdid it!

207
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,036
- A crazy amount.
- We seriously love mushrooms.

208
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,038
- It'll be delicious.
- A crazy amount of mushrooms.

209
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,013
This is good enough, right?

210
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,114
Looks good, right?

211
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,916
- Is it? Is it enough?
- Yeah.

212
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,118
<i>The way you grill meat</i>
<i>shows your personality.</i>

213
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,587
- It'll keep cooking. Residual heat.
- <i>It's super rare.</i>

214
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:02,621
<i>True.</i>

215
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,125
No, I don't think we can eat this at all!

216
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,461
It's super rare. Super rare!

217
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:12,531
- No way we can eat this.
- It's almost raw. Raw meat.

218
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:13,933
But, I mean…

219
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,936
- Our first day.
- To our first day.

220
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,637
Cheers!

221
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,039
Awesome.

222
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:23,375
- Why did we apply? Let's talk about why.
- Why we came.

223
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:24,844
Why we came to the Green Room.

224
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,715
Well… I was in a relationship
for 15 years until last year.

225
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,584
- Mmm.
- Aah. That's a long time.

226
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,219
But when I reached this age,

227
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:36,622
I was wondering if things
were going to stay the same forever.

228
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:40,359
So I wanted to be alone for a while
and think things over, right?

229
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,129
I thought if I had
an opportunity like this,

230
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,098
I might be able to express
my true feelings.

231
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,967
That's kind of why I applied.

232
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,703
<i>I do worry that people are going to say,</i>

233
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:54,473
"I can't believe
you went on this show at 40."

234
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,343
But I wanna be able
to express my honest feelings,

235
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:01,347
connect with someone,
and go home together with someone.

236
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:05,584
That's my… yeah, ideal scenario.

237
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:10,756
Actually, um…
I also had a partner a while ago.

238
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:14,226
Well, we broke up
about two or three years ago.

239
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:18,864
There's a part of me that feels like I'm
forgetting how to be in a relationship.

240
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,734
- There's that.
- I need this kind of opportunity.

241
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,803
To take a new step forward.

242
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,871
I think. Yeah.

243
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,909
I want to be with someone
who has similar values

244
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,745
and sensibilities as me.

245
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:37,883
I believe a real partner is someone with
whom you can envision a future together.

246
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:42,421
That's the kind of person I want to meet
and fall in love with. I feel that deeply.

247
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:48,861
<i>You never know</i>
<i>when someone dear to you might die.</i>

248
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:54,099
<i>So if I meet someone like that,</i>
<i>I want to tell them how I feel.</i>

249
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,403
Izaya seems to have it fairly together,

250
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:00,039
but I think he's got
a fragile side to him too.

251
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,540
You figured that out just from that?

252
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,976
- Yeah.
- Of course you did! So impressive.

253
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:09,048
For me, I was really moved
when I watched season one of this show.

254
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,684
I felt that everyone placed
a lot of importance

255
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,919
on their relationships with people.

256
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:19,024
I realized that that's something
I've always put second to work until now.

257
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:25,030
My job is an architect,
and I work in the design industry.

258
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:28,500
<i>I've always liked and been good at</i>
<i>making things since I was a kid</i>.

259
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,037
<i>I use a 3D printer</i>
<i>to create stuff like vases.</i>

260
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:35,374
<i>I immediately start making</i>
<i>whatever I picture in my head.</i>

261
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:40,980
I've been… neglecting things
like socializing until now,

262
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,816
so I want to take the time

263
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,318
to engage with different people.

264
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:49,788
This society sucks, doesn't it?

265
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,157
<i>I don't want to give in.</i>

266
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,693
Oh, I wonder what happens.

267
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,063
- Not just romance, but a lot of things.
- Exactly!

268
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,499
Yeah, I could see him
making something scary

269
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,201
with a 3D printer when under pressure.

270
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,038
- The cucumbers were spicy, huh?
- Why?

271
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,339
The peppers are spicy--

272
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,209
- Hey! Fireworks!
- Oh, wow. Pretty.

273
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,510
No way.

274
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,078
- Wow.
- I wanna go see.

275
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:14,613
No way. Really?

276
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,116
- Wait! Short sleeves.
- Too sudden!

277
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,317
So sudden!

278
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:27,026
- Crazy!
- They're really going off.

279
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,594
Isn't it amazing?

280
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,796
Wait, you saw them
in that direction, right?

281
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,832
- So pretty.
- Wow! So pretty,

282
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:39,271
<i>Colors in you, colors in me</i>

283
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:42,641
<i>Colors in everybody </i>

284
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:46,612
<i>- Colors in you, colors in me</i>
- Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

285
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,681
<i>Colors in everybody</i>

286
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:51,250
<i>I never thought</i>
<i>I'd get to see fireworks in winter.</i>

287
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,052
<i>Round and around and around </i>

288
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,654
<i>- And around</i>
- So cool.

289
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,656
<i>Oh</i>

290
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:02,394
<i>Round and around and around and around </i>

291
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,563
<i>Oh </i>

292
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:08,534
<i>Colors in you, colors in me</i>

293
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,304
<i>Colors in everybody</i>

294
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:16,108
<i>Colors in you, colors in me</i>

295
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,011
<i>Colors in everything</i>

296
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,714
<i>Some of them have already</i>
<i>fallen for someone at first sight.</i>

297
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,850
<i>It looks like it. They must've</i>
<i>felt, "Oh, this person's cute."</i>

298
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,019
- <i>You think so?</i>
- <i>Glancing to the side!</i>

299
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,921
<i>"I like your face watching fireworks."</i>

300
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,256
<i>- Not looking at the fireworks!</i>
- <i>Exactly!</i>

301
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,791
<i>They're looking at </i>you!

302
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,597
Time for some fruit for dessert.

303
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,699
- Fruit duty.
- Dessert duty.

304
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,436
It's hard to cut mangoes, huh?

305
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,473
- What?
- No, nothing.

306
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,241
- Is this right?
- Huh?

307
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,711
- Is this the right way?
- Don't know. I don't know the correct way.

308
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,647
But I'm cutting it so it's easy to eat.

309
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,050
There must be lots of fruits in Australia.

310
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,651
Yeah, there's a lot.

311
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,788
I wish I could've gone to Australia.

312
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,523
You can still come.

313
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,959
- It's summer now, right?
- Yeah, summer now.

314
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,661
William, you do that… You surf, right?

315
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,296
- Huh?
- You like surfing, right?

316
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:15,934
Oh, yeah. I mean, I used to surf in Tokyo.
But there are no waves in Barcelona.

317
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,871
Oh, really? Australia is famous
for surfing, you know.

318
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,906
Yeah, I know. That's why I want to go.

319
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,877
I moved to Barcelona
about three years ago.

320
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,613
My dad… my dad is from Peru,

321
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:31,917
so I think Latin culture is kind of

322
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:34,153
ingrained in me somewhere.

323
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:39,691
So I decided to relocate there
partly to explore my roots.

324
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,430
- Can't wait for snowboarding.
- Yeah.

325
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,565
- Right?
- And hot springs after snowboarding.

326
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,101
Ah, the best. An outdoor hot spring.

327
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,771
Before we get too deep
into conversation, I have souvenirs.

328
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,707
- What do you mean?
- I had a ton of business trips.

329
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:59,178
- Dubai?
- Yeah. I went to Abu Dhabi.

330
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,612
- Wow.
- Nice!

331
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,981
- This is Dubai's…
- Dubai chocolate?

332
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,383
- Whoa!
- From the UAE.

333
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:07,953
- Looks delicious. Yay! Thank you!
- Yay! Thank you.

334
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,255
- I'm glad we have a fun group.
- Totally.

335
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,858
- For real.
- Truly glad.

336
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,095
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

337
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,831
- Should I check it?
- Yes, please.

338
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:23,669
"Your day in the Green Room
is coming to an end."

339
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,606
"Tonight, as you reflect on the day,

340
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:32,211
write a letter
to just one of the participants."

341
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:35,514
"However, do not sign your name."

342
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,286
"Drop your letter
in the recipient's mailbox

343
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,288
by the end of tonight."

344
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,992
"Check your mailbox tomorrow morning."

345
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:51,563
"May your feelings reach the recipient."

346
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,769
- Here it is.
- It was so sudden.

347
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:00,272
- <i>They have someone in mind.</i>
- <i>Definitely.</i>

348
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,342
<i>Of course they do.</i>
<i>They're here to fall in love.</i>

349
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,712
<i>I wonder if someone's love</i>
<i>is undercooked too.</i>

350
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:09,748
- <i>Oh, stop it!</i>
- <i>That's funny, I like it.</i>

351
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,550
- <i>This is fun.</i>
- <i>Oh!</i>

352
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,586
<i>- It's such a cute place.</i>
- <i>Yeah, the rooms are nice too.</i>

353
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,823
<i>Seize the day, yeah</i>
<i>We're bouncin' back into it </i>

354
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,725
<i>There's a way, yeah </i>

355
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,193
What should I write<i>?</i>

356
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,661
<i>What d'you say </i>

357
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,497
<i>Honestly, I thought he was handsome.</i>

358
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,533
<i>And I really like the way he talks.</i>

359
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,169
He picks fun words here and there.

360
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,571
<i>There's a way…</i>

361
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,774
<i>There's no way I'll get any.</i>
<i>There is no way.</i>

362
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,843
- <i>Don't say that.</i>
- I don't think I'm popular.

363
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,279
<i>What the heck is he talking about?</i>

364
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,782
<i>- Hiroya needs some confidence.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

365
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,217
<i>Feelin' so good </i>

366
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:50,589
I moved away from home to study
and went to the University of Tokyo.

367
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:54,560
<i>I'm short, so I can't help</i>
<i>but find tall people attractive.</i>

368
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,628
<i>I'm often drawn to people</i>
<i>who have what I don't.</i>

369
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,797
That grown man calm, that dandy vibe.

370
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,933
- <i>Okay, he must be really smart.</i>
- Yep.

371
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,635
<i>I wonder if he's</i>
<i>the type to really go for it.</i>

372
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:07,005
<i>I've never dated a man before.</i>

373
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:11,176
- <i>What? Oh, really?</i>
- So I'm here to find my first boyfriend.

374
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,111
<i>Really? That's amazing.</i>

375
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:16,915
<i>Well, since this would be</i>
<i>my first boyfriend, I want something pure.</i>

376
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:22,888
Like the kind of romance where we can buy
one ice cream and enjoy sharing it.

377
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,191
- Yeah.
- <i>His first love!</i>

378
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:29,194
<i>But first loves tend</i>
<i>to raise the bar quite a bit.</i>

379
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,829
<i>Yeah, that's true.</i>

380
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:48,947
<i>Maybe no letters, huh?</i>

381
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,283
<i>For Bomi.</i>

382
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,152
- <i>But it's only day one.</i>
- <i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

383
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,692
- <i>He's the youngest of all.</i>
- <i>Oh, that's right.</i>

384
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,961
- <i>He's among the big brothers.</i>
- <i>He's 23.</i>

385
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,299
- <i>The big brother.</i>
- <i>Our big brother.</i>

386
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,835
- <i>Kazuyuki.</i>
<i>- He took a leap of faith and joined.</i>

387
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,204
<i>Ah, big brother…</i>

388
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,491
<i>Oh! There it is!</i>

389
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,667
I'm glad there was at least one letter.

390
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,604
The person I thought
looked handsome was William.

391
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,240
<i>So I'd be happy if this were from him.</i>

392
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,976
But it's probably from Kazuyuki.

393
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,978
It says, "We're older,"
and he's the oldest.

394
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,680
I WANT TO SEE MORE OF YOUR POSITIVE SIDE!

395
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,381
DON'T MIND YOUR MANNERS WITH YOUR ELDERS!

396
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,327
- <i>Whoa, two letters!</i>
- <i>Impressive.</i>

397
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,596
<i>From Izaya?</i>

398
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,298
<i>What? From who?</i>

399
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,705
I'm happy to get two letters.

400
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,108
This last part.

401
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,410
It says, "I thought you looked handsome
at first glance."

402
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,813
THANK YOU FOR DAY ONE! THERE'S
SO MUCH I WANT TO TALK ABOUT!

403
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:28,980
That's the first impression.

404
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,049
I NOTICED HOW HANDSOME YOU ARE
AT FIRST GLANCE

405
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:33,552
Looking at this, I thought it was nice

406
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:36,221
that this person
was honest about his feelings.

407
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:39,791
I hope I got a letter from
the person I wrote to.

408
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,794
I THOUGHT YOU WERE FLASHY, BUT
HEARING YOU TALK CHANGED MY IMPRESSION.

409
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,963
But I don't think I did!

410
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,299
Just judging by the letter,
doesn't feel like it.

411
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,249
- <i>Well, it's only the first day.</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

412
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,651
- <i>They don't know anything yet.</i>
- <i>Exactly.</i>

413
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,399
- Whoa!
- <i>Whoa! All eyes are on him!</i>

414
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:22,701
- <i>Impressive.</i>
- <i>Wow, amazing. Izaya!</i>

415
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:25,303
<i>Izaya's popular, huh? Wow.</i>

416
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:29,941
<i>- But his reaction is so chill.</i>
- <i>Right?</i>

417
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,878
- <i>He doesn't go, "Yay!"</i>
- <i>I'd be overjoyed.</i>

418
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:41,386
IT WAS A HECTIC DAY, WASN'T IT?
LET'S ENJOY THE NEXT TWO MONTHS.

419
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:42,454
<i>Bomi.</i>

420
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,592
DEAR IZAYA, THANKS FOR TODAY.
YOU HAVE A LOVELY SMILE.

421
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:50,061
- <i>"You have a lovely smile."</i>
- <i>William!</i>

422
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:51,730
LET'S ENJOY THE NEXT TWO MONTHS!

423
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,266
DEAR IZAYA, I LOVE HOW YOU TALK
AND THE WORDS YOU USE!

424
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,268
The final letter genuinely made me happy.

425
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,470
I HOPE WE GET TO TALK MORE.
LET'S MAKE LOTS OF MEMORIES!

426
00:23:58,537 --> 00:23:59,571
<i>From Huwei.</i>

427
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,274
He said he really likes
the way I talk, and my word choice.

428
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,444
I guess it feels like
he's seeing who I am inside.

429
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,480
That's the impression I got
from this letter.

430
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:09,915
This, like…

431
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,350
The smiley face he drew.

432
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,487
This kind of feels like from Huwei.

433
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,289
<i>Wow.</i>

434
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:18,990
- <i>He knows.</i>
- <i>He can tell.</i>

435
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:24,095
<i>I kinda get the feeling</i>
<i>that Izaya has inner strength.</i>

436
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,835
<i>He said he wouldn't get any letters, but…</i>

437
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,705
<i>- He got a letter! I'm glad.</i>
- <i>He got one!</i>

438
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,174
<i>I'm so relieved. Hm? But who's it from?</i>

439
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:40,178
- <i>Mmm, he looks happy.</i>
- <i>Yeah, he looks happy.</i>

440
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:46,585
I was relieved to get a letter. I'm happy.

441
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,986
<i>I'm happy for him.</i>

442
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:50,155
Is this really
just a thank you for the gift?

443
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,691
THANK YOU FOR THE DELICIOUS GIFT.
IT WAS DELICIOUS. BEST WISHES.

444
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:54,426
Maybe he had no one else to write to.

445
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,329
Maybe he wrote to me because my souvenir

446
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,631
was the only thing
that left an impression.

447
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,234
I hope that's not the case.

448
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,070
- Don't say things like that.
- Yeah, too negative.

449
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:08,807
- There's always one person like that.
- Yeah, like, "I'm not good enough."

450
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,408
- Cute.
- No mutual crushes.

451
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,577
With this many people,
and no mutual feelings.

452
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,513
- Right.
- You're right. No matches yet.

453
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:18,750
Even though they're writing
these letters on the first day,

454
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,519
but they're pretty important, right?

455
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:21,953
- First impressions.
- True.

456
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,288
It means "You're my type."

457
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,790
And once you write a letter
to a specific person,

458
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,225
you start thinking about them more.

459
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,861
That's true.
Writing makes you aware of your feelings.

460
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,764
Huh? Are you cooking?

461
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:36,501
What are you making?

462
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:39,304
I wanted to marinate some eggs,
after boiling them.

463
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,206
- Eggs?
- Like ramen eggs.

464
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,408
- Oh, nice.
- So we can eat tomorrow.

465
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:44,809
Ah, that sounds good.

466
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,412
<i>Day two, marinating eggs!</i>

467
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,314
It's a "marinating boiled eggs"
kinda morning.

468
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:54,152
Hey, Huwei, have you ever
worked part-time somewhere?

469
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,488
- I was an airport interpreter.
- What?

470
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,523
I did some interpreting
in Chinese and English.

471
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,926
Oh, wait. You speak English too?

472
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:03,295
- I'm not a native speaker at all, but…
- That's so cool.

473
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:06,097
Huwei, how long
did you live in China again?

474
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,967
Until I was seven… Seven? Yeah.

475
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:12,370
- So you moved here when you were seven?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

476
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:15,907
At the moment, I'm studying two things,

477
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:18,610
gender theory and anthropology,
in graduate school.

478
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:23,181
It's not like I set out to specialize
in the gender studies area,

479
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:27,152
but as I got into my research
and did a lot of reading,

480
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:31,423
I learned that this is a society
where people like us can live,

481
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,425
and I found that really fascinating.

482
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,596
So I want more people
to learn about this as well,

483
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:42,367
and let them know that they too
can live authentically, as themselves.

484
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,970
- Let's eat.
- Let's dig in.

485
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:46,838
Why am I always the one to say that?

486
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,107
We should assign someone to say that.

487
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:50,575
- Meal captain.
- Meal captain.

488
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,077
Mmm, it's good.

489
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,646
Let's eat. I'm glad.

490
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:56,615
So good I forget to talk.

491
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:03,722
Oh, right. So today, I'm actually supposed
to get some important news,

492
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:08,593
and I thought I might as well open it
in front of you all.

493
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,462
Important news?

494
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,531
Well, I've been in, um, graduate school,

495
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:17,369
um, working toward completing
my master's degree.

496
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:21,706
- Next, I'm planning a doctoral program.
- You're doing a PhD?

497
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,308
- Yeah, PhD.
- Wow.

498
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:26,244
And the results are announced today.

499
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,812
- <i>Oh, my!</i>
- You haven't checked?

500
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,581
- I haven't.
- In front of everyone?

501
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,816
I've been wondering about how it went.

502
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,318
I've just been thinking about it.

503
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:36,154
- That's nerve-wracking.
- Yeah, so I thought I'd check now.

504
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,288
- Is it posted already?
- Now?

505
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,257
- Here?
- Can you see it already?

506
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,761
It's 312203.

507
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,096
- What?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't tap yet!

508
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,631
DOCTORAL PROGRAM ENTRANCE EXAM RESULTS

509
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:48,099
Will it show up right away?

510
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,234
- Hey.
- Wait.

511
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,769
- Seriously?
- See it?

512
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,171
- What?
- 31…

513
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,941
- What number?
- 2203! There it is!

514
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,577
Thank goodness!

515
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:00,612
Congratulations!

516
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,747
- I'm so happy for you!
- Amazing!

517
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,916
- So happy.
- Thank goodness.

518
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,251
So nerve-wracking.

519
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:09,421
- I'm so relieved. Thank you.
- Congratulations!

520
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:11,289
Today's an unforgettable day.

521
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,058
<i>So impressive!</i>

522
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:14,025
So what is Huwei doing?

523
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:16,628
I don't even understand.
What exactly is he doing?

524
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,297
There's university,
and then you go to graduate school

525
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,899
to earn a master's degree, right?

526
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,467
After that, there's the PhD.

527
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,903
Is it like the school above grad school?

528
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:26,471
It's still grad school.

529
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,574
The degree you get depends on
how many years you spend there.

530
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,543
Wait a minute.
Now it feels like I sound dumb.

531
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:32,711
Ugh!

532
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,114
Please cut this part from my question!

533
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,150
- Hey.
- This way, right?

534
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:42,754
- Oh, look. The mountain is so beautiful.
- Wow.

535
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,689
- It's so beautiful.
- Yeah.

536
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,091
Gorgeous.

537
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:48,860
Are we on the lake already?

538
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,896
- We're on it.
- Are we on the lake?

539
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:55,200
- Wow, it's frozen, huh?
- This is the best.

540
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,504
- What's this? Is this it?
- Banana boats?

541
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,806
- Are you serious?
- Are we doing this?

542
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:03,842
It'll definitely hurt
if you fall from this.

543
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,977
We have to be
careful not to hit our heads.

544
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:08,713
Helmets! Is everyone
choosing your favorite color?

545
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,482
Yeah. Something suits me.

546
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,450
I want a white one, but…

547
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,619
It'll be funny if you put this on.

548
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,288
I wonder what this is.

549
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,824
- So tiny, isn't it!
- Oh, this is bad.

550
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:20,925
Isn't it weird?

551
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:23,294
This thing…
It's definitely better with this, right?

552
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:24,996
Yeah, it's better to have it.

553
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:27,532
- It's better to have it.
- No, let's go with this.

554
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,201
- But it doesn't have this part.
- Yeah, it's better.

555
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,203
It's better to have it, right?

556
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,938
Let me just take a picture.

557
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,108
- Awesome, awesome.
- Your face looks goofy.

558
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:38,843
I like how he looks like a panda.

559
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,946
- Cute.
- Adorable! Huwei is so cute!

560
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:45,183
Funny thing with helmets, there's always
one person who doesn't look good in it.

561
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,284
Helmets, right.

562
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:50,588
This is tricky.

563
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,264
- <i>Thrilling!</i>
- <i>They're going for it.</i>

564
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,932
- <i>Amazing!</i>
- <i>So pretty.</i>

565
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:02,467
<i>It must feel so good.</i>

566
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,037
- It's pretty fast.
- This is so fun!

567
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:08,940
Feels great!

568
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:12,544
Beautiful.

569
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:15,780
<i>Hey, I wanna go to Lake Akan!</i>

570
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:20,351
<i>- I wanna do this!</i>
- <i>What on Earth? It looks so fun!</i>

571
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:24,722
<i>Wow, looks so fun. Such a release!</i>

572
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:27,725
Who wants to ride a snowmobile?
So, everyone?

573
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,294
Shall we? Let's do it.

574
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:32,163
- Go for it.
- We're off!

575
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,498
Who wants to do what?

576
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,367
- You can sit in the front.
- Huh? Are you sure? Yay.

577
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,404
- Here we go.
- Whoa! Wait, wait!

578
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,606
It's fast. It's pretty fast.

579
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:48,079
- So it's quite fast, huh?
- They're far gone already.

580
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:48,980
We lost 'em.

581
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,585
- <i>Looks fun.</i>
- <i>So much fun.</i>

582
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:55,086
<i>They're going so fast.</i>

583
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:57,522
<i>Please don't break a bone</i>
<i>and have to leave the show.</i>

584
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,924
- <i>They're so wild.</i>
- <i>Looks like so much fun.</i>

585
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,860
- Looks so fun.
- <i>I wanna try.</i>

586
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,632
Was that max speed? Were you at max?

587
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,934
- No idea.
- It was crazy!

588
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:13,204
- That was great.
- I thought it was normal.

589
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,207
If you're going to hold on,
grab me under the arms.

590
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:18,243
Here we go!

591
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,451
- <i>Nice. Hold tight, Hiroya.</i>
- <i>Nice!</i>

592
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,387
<i>They're totally different.</i>
<i>They're going so slowly.</i>

593
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,626
It's pretty tricky to go straight.

594
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:39,464
Let's go. Let's go!

595
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:41,666
Is this max speed?

596
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,074
- Huh?
- Here it is.

597
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:56,848
"For the next two months,
you will be running a coffee truck."

598
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,716
- Coffee truck.
- Here we go.

599
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:01,753
"By running it together as a team,

600
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:04,155
we hope you can grow closer."

601
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,592
"You're free to use the profits
however you like."

602
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,796
"First, decide on the name of the shop."

603
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:14,999
- It's happening.
- [Izaya[ It's starting.

604
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:18,937
So it's coffee, after all.

605
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:20,972
Okay, how about I handle the note-taking?

606
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,440
- Please.
- Please do.

607
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,675
That's so you.

608
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:29,213
- "Our Coffee."
- "Our Coffee."

609
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:33,918
- How about "Café de Nieve"?
- "Café de Nieve"?

610
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:37,055
It's kind of cute and stylish.
What does it mean?

611
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,590
- Snow, right?
- It means snow. Yeah, snow.

612
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:40,959
- "Snow Café."
- Nice.

613
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:44,462
- I kind of want to give it a warm feeling.
- Mmm.

614
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,631
How about naming it "Hot Coffee"?

615
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,333
"Hot Coffee."

616
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,035
Okay! It might be nice and simple.

617
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,705
Hot Coffee.
Oh, it might be cute in hiragana.

618
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:55,106
- Hiragana?
- Sorry.

619
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:57,275
I see you're particular
about that. Excuse me.

620
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:01,913
Um, since many of us are from Kansai,
and we're close to Lake Akan…

621
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,915
- How about "Akan Coffee"?
- "Akan Coffee"!

622
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:05,283
I like that.

623
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,453
- Like "Akan! Coffee."
- Is it safe to drink?

624
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:11,489
- People would…
- This is definitely trouble.

625
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:13,925
People would definitely ask,
"Why is it not okay?"

626
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:19,063
Since we all came from far away
by plane, how about "Journey"?

627
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:23,534
- Something along those lines.
- How about "Journey and Coffee"?

628
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:26,004
Something like this.
"Us, Journey, and Coffee."

629
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:30,641
That's new! Very nice.
I like it, I like it.

630
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,877
- Isn't this name cute?
- It's really good.

631
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,879
- It feels unique.
- It's cute.

632
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,347
- It's good.
- Good.

633
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,850
- Didn't think we'd get this far.
- Wonderful.

634
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,353
US, JOURNEY, AND COFFEE

635
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,729
Jumping right in, let's form pairs
for drip coffee practice.

636
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:52,630
COFFEE WORKSHOP

637
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,365
MUSASHI KIHARA, BARISTA
HINANO KATO, BARISTA

638
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,168
And others for café lattes and latte art.
Pair up with whoever you like.

639
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:58,970
- Let's pair up.
- Okay.

640
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,738
- Shall we?
- Shall we?

641
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:03,041
- Okay.
- Okay. Which one should we do?

642
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,576
Either is fine. This one or…

643
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:09,614
- <i>William was interested in Izaya.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

644
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,115
- Nothing's changed.
- Right.

645
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:14,018
- That will make the foam lumpy.
- <i>He's staring at his face.</i>

646
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,421
- <i>William stares a lot.</i>
- <i>He does!</i>

647
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,858
- <i>Hot! Is everything okay?</i>
- I get it now. Sorry.

648
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,327
He's in a tank top,
so the steam's hitting him directly.

649
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,997
He needs to be careful.
He should put on a shirt.

650
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:27,799
I'm nervous.

651
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:30,134
I'd hate to do it in front of a customer.

652
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:31,302
Right?

653
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,770
I'd be super nervous.

654
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:35,406
Wow, it changes this much?

655
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,975
I thought coffee tasted the same
no matter who brewed it.

656
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:47,785
Apparently, the area around Lake Akan is
famous for the hot spring.

657
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,221
So I really wanna try going there.

658
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:54,058
- I wanna go in an outdoor hot spring.
- Right? Do you all like hot springs?

659
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,393
I go about once a week.

660
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:58,429
- You go every week?
- I go every week to hit the sauna.

661
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:01,833
So if you all are okay with it,
I really want to go together.

662
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:03,701
- Shall we?
- Let's go.

663
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,869
We wanna go, right?

664
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:08,139
- Hot springs tomorrow, then.
- Hot springs in the morning, huh?

665
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:11,876
- I haven't heard the judo story.
- Right, right.

666
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,245
- Professional… You mentioned…
- He's the real deal.

667
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,980
You were on the Thai national team?

668
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:19,884
Before I came here, um, there was
something like a selection match.

669
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,719
<i>- For the Thai national team.</i>
- <i>Cool.</i>

670
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,821
<i>To decide</i>
<i>the national team for the Olympics.</i>

671
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:26,924
- <i>For Thailand?</i>
- <i>Yeah, there was a match, and so…</i>

672
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:28,993
- <i>For real?</i>
- <i>I won all the matches.</i>

673
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:33,531
So I'm back on the national team, and um,
I'm a designated national team athlete.

674
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:36,501
- Until the upcoming LA Olympics.
- Wait, you're going to the Olympics?

675
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,002
- A possibility?
- Possibility.

676
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,303
- Crazy!
- Crazy!

677
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,305
I can't believe he excels
at academics and sports.

678
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:43,341
- He's even pursuing a PhD?
- National team?

679
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:46,644
- He's like the perfect human being.
- Yeah, he's amazing.

680
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:49,514
I'd been aiming
for the Tokyo Olympics all along,

681
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,083
but just before, I got a serious injury.

682
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,753
So I missed Tokyo, and I couldn't make it
to the next one in Paris either.

683
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,589
I tore my knee ligaments twice.

684
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,992
I was still an undergraduate at the time.

685
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:03,027
It was right
when I had to write my thesis.

686
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,630
I had all this extra energy,
and I didn't know what to do with it.

687
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:08,132
So I put all my energy into my thesis,

688
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,535
and then I realized how fun research was.

689
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,803
And somehow, I ended up a grad student.

690
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,173
You'll train for the Olympics
while getting a PhD?

691
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,909
- School and sports.
- Excelling everything!

692
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,010
So cool.

693
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:34,792
- His face…
- Looked out of it.

694
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,860
He was gone.

695
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,799
Apparently, this pose helps you focus.

696
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:45,736
- That was nice.
- Yeah.

697
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:47,772
- I feel refreshed.
- Me too.

698
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:54,312
- You hitting the gym tomorrow?
- If I can wake up at 7:30.

699
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,013
- Will you?
- I will.

700
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,315
- Okay.
- And…

701
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,484
Between Huwei and you,
you're the one unlikely to wake up.

702
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,355
- I actually do wake up when it matters.
- Really?

703
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:06,324
Yeah. But if someone
doesn't wake up, call me.

704
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,659
If someone doesn't wake up, call me.

705
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,261
- Good night.
- Good night.

706
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,719
I'm embarrassed.

707
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,221
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

708
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,924
Wasn't it 8:30? You… I mean, Izaya.

709
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:44,395
Yeah. I was around from
about 6:30… No, 6:00. I couldn't sleep.

710
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:46,230
That's rough.

711
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,766
Not getting any sleep is rough.

712
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:52,436
- Yeah, I haven't slept a minute.
- But we'll drink coffee again at training.

713
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,138
Yeah, seriously, it's rough.

714
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:59,510
Actually, I was doing some thinking, too.
That might be part of the reason.

715
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:01,979
About work? Or what? About this place?

716
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,315
- A lot of things.
- That's cryptic.

717
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:07,485
Here goes.

718
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,939
What a luxury
to have good coffee in the morning.

719
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:30,641
Cheers.

720
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,077
It's got a nice color.

721
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:39,917
It's a bit strong.
We could dilute it with water.

722
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,019
Yeah, but it's still really good.

723
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:46,791
Well, then, shall we
go to the hot springs?

724
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:47,825
Shall we?

725
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:50,594
Do you… actually not like hot springs?

726
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,332
I thought maybe it was hard
for you to bring up.

727
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:56,033
- Oh, really?
- Are you okay?

728
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:56,967
Well…

729
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,339
- Um, can I be honest, then?
- Yeah.

730
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:02,740
I might not want to go.

731
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:05,009
Right. I thought so.

732
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:08,879
Yeah, I've been thinking about it…
since yesterday.

733
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,181
- Right?
- Yeah.

734
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:12,283
Let's not stress
over the little things, okay?

735
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,920
<i>I couldn't say, "I'll pass,"</i>
<i>when everyone was excited for it.</i>

736
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:20,491
I didn't want to ruin the mood like that.
Because it was a really good mood.

737
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,360
- It won't ruin it.
- You think?

738
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,595
- You don't like hot springs, do you?
- No, I do like them.

739
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:26,464
- But with everyone…
- I just don't feel like it.

740
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,498
Yeah, right.

741
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:29,467
You don't have to force yourself.

742
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:34,305
If you don't feel like going right now,
I'd be happy to stay back with you, Bomi.

743
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,506
Oh, are you sure?

744
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,377
- I feel bad.
- Don't be.

745
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,480
- Let's hold down the fort.
- Yay.

746
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,815
<i>It's so sweet of him to notice.</i>

747
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:48,419
<i>It's nice to have someone</i>
<i>looking out for you like that.</i>

748
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,955
I'm so excited.

749
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:52,590
Um, hey…

750
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:57,228
Wait, I don't want to get awkward.
Can I stay home?

751
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,830
- Huh? What?
- Um, it's not like that. Um…

752
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:02,199
- Huh?
- It's only the third day and…

753
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:04,235
- Too soon?
- It's a little too soon.

754
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:06,804
Like, I, um, really do like, um,
hot springs.

755
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,706
So I really want to go.

756
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:10,408
I mean, I really want
to go to hot springs.

757
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:12,209
<i>He's right. They have two months.</i>

758
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:14,111
Yeah, I'll go another time. Yeah.

759
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:16,447
Bomi said he wants to stay, so I will too.

760
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:17,648
- Oh? Yeah?
- Yeah.

761
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,017
- He said he would.
- I'm not in the mood for hot springs.

762
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,987
- <i>He's so sweet!</i>
- So, that's how it is. I'm really sorry.

763
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:25,322
- Have fun. Another time.
- We'll have fun.

764
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:27,558
<i>It's important to be able to say that.</i>

765
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,059
- Enjoy the hot spring!
- Bye.

766
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:30,961
<i>It's better not to let stress build up.</i>

767
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:33,931
<i>Way better for the people</i>
<i>who are going to go with a good feeling.</i>

768
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,136
<i>Oh! It's a dream come true </i>

769
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:41,005
<i>Hold on, wait a minute.</i>

770
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,339
<i>I mean, look at them.</i>

771
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,909
- <i>I don't like it.</i>
- <i>Towels are riding pretty low.</i>

772
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:46,510
<i>They're all something else!</i>

773
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:48,979
- <i>Oh my, oh my.</i>
- So typical of <i>The Boyfriend!</i>

774
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:51,715
- <i>Not everyone is this toned!</i>
- It's insanely beautiful.

775
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,984
- <i>Their bodies are amazing.</i>
- <i>So pretty.</i>

776
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:55,052
<i>Gorgeous.</i>

777
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,760
This is fantastic.

778
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:03,928
It feels great.

779
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:06,897
- This is awesome.
- This is the best.

780
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,899
- The view is crazy.
- It's not cold at all.

781
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,375
- I want to be this tan.
- Do you tan?

782
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,144
I take an ice bath every morning in Spain.

783
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:22,346
- You tan in an ice bath?
- Every morning?

784
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:25,449
- The sun is out when I take an ice bath.
- In the ice bath?

785
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,651
- When I get out…
- So you get tan from the sun.

786
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:31,255
- That's the best.
- I do this 15 to 30 minutes every day.

787
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,957
So I never lose my tan.

788
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,360
<i>I was thinking</i>
<i>that he has a gorgeous body.</i>

789
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:39,563
<i>And the color of William's skin…</i>
<i>I love it.</i>

790
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,299
<i>Ah, the color was just great.</i>
<i>His skin tone was great.</i>

791
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:45,536
<i>William gives off… a sexy scent.</i>

792
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:47,972
<i>There's just something about him.</i>

793
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,574
<i>A sensual vibe.</i>

794
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:54,345
Do you want to get married?

795
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:56,413
Hmm…

796
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,650
- It depends.
- Depends on the person?

797
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:02,520
Mmm. I mean,
if the other person really wants to…

798
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:04,154
- You'd be okay with it?
- Mm-hm.

799
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:08,259
Like, before I left Japan,
I never thought about marriage.

800
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:11,095
But I started thinking about it
when I went to Spain.

801
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:13,264
There were a lot
of married couples around.

802
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,765
- Same-sex marriage?
- Yeah.

803
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:17,234
These guys were calling
their partners "husbands."

804
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,770
- It feels a bit weird, right?
- We don't see that in Japan.

805
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:23,073
Like, "My husband's sleeping at home
right now." And I'm like, "Huh?"

806
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,942
But then I started
to really long for that.

807
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:26,710
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

808
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:29,313
Huwei talks about it
like it's the most natural thing.

809
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,549
That's how it should be.

810
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:33,684
And I realized that
it's okay to aim for that.

811
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:34,919
and Izaya] Mmm.

812
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:39,356
Since we're not going to the hot springs,

813
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:42,326
we're not going outside
for two whole days.

814
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,895
But you're actually fine with it, right?

815
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,198
- Well, yeah, I actually don't mind it.
- I'm totally fine with it too.

816
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,938
Hey, let's talk about
our impressions of everyone.

817
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:55,472
Hu-chan is…

818
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:58,709
<i>But I already knew him, though.</i>

819
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,745
- You know, I really like Hu.
- How so?

820
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:03,681
He's seriously like a panda.

821
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:06,083
- Like Wei Wei, the panda?
- Yeah, yeah.

822
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,885
- Xiang Xiang.
- Hu Hu, Lin Lin, Xiang Xiang.

823
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:09,053
- Hu Hu.
- Yeah, like Wei Wei.

824
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,789
That's how it is for me right now.
So I seriously like him.

825
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:13,257
I just adore him.

826
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,226
Just watching him heals me.

827
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:20,264
I seriously have no idea
what kind of person he likes.

828
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,467
But when you went out with
him for a meal at first,

829
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:26,203
you both thought there might
be something there, right?

830
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:29,540
Well, when I was leaving,
he even walked me out.

831
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:32,376
There's that side to him, too.

832
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,478
When I posted a story about my birthday,

833
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:37,047
he was, like, "Was it your birthday?"
and "Happy birthday."

834
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:40,351
- He's like that, huh?
- So, like the way he DMs and…

835
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:41,352
Interesting.

836
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:44,321
The way he is in real life is
different from how he is in 2D.

837
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:45,956
- 2D Hu is different.
- 2D Hu is different.

838
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,491
- ] 2D Hu.
- Yeah.

839
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,762
But isn't real-life Hu better, right?

840
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:53,864
- Yeah, I like both.
- Yeah, both are good.

841
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,874
- Oh, beautiful.
- Looks good. Really good.

842
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:05,976
- Looks great.
- Yum!

843
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:07,311
Looks delicious.

844
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,446
Let's dig in.

845
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:11,415
I'll start with the pickled ginger.

846
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,283
- Mm, it's good.
- Delicious.

847
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:17,554
So, we all live
in different places, right?

848
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:19,690
Can you handle
long-distance relationships?

849
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,692
- I can.
- You can?

850
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:24,995
I'm the type who can. I mean,
you can just hop on a plane, right?

851
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:27,898
That was hot. What was that?

852
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:30,467
- I can do Osaka.
- What do you mean?

853
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:32,770
I can do like between Osaka and Tokyo.

854
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:36,206
But if it's Australia and overseas,
that's a whole different scale.

855
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:37,107
That's true.

856
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,410
If we can't see each other,
impossible for me.

857
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:42,513
I can't do it if we can only see
each other once in two months.

858
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:43,947
That's like Tanabata. I mean…

859
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,050
- That's once a year.
- Basically Tanabata. Exactly!

860
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:48,686
- No way I can handle it.
- It's no for me. I can't do long distance.

861
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:50,954
I would hate waiting
for even just an hour.

862
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,489
That's such a nice feeling.

863
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:56,293
That "I need to see you every minute"
feeling fades as you get older.

864
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,030
No, it doesn't. It doesn't fade.

865
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:01,932
I don't really feel that way recently.

866
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,268
When you talk about it,
it reminds me of my younger self.

867
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,570
I wouldn't go see
someone for five minutes anymore.

868
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:08,706
But we used to do that, right?
We used to do that.

869
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:10,741
That was just an example. An example.

870
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:19,783
I'll help you out here.

871
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,518
Mmm.

872
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,187
Thank you.

873
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,291
When was your last romance again?

874
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:29,493
When was your last relationship again?

875
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,162
- Two or three years ago.
- Two or three years, huh?

876
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:35,499
It's been a while for me too.
I went to Spain and…

877
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,568
- Just one ex.
- Hmm.

878
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:39,269
I dated a German guy.

879
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:42,039
You didn't see anyone else?

880
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:43,741
I went on dates, of course.

881
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:47,911
But… the people I was interested in
already had boyfriends and stuff.

882
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:49,580
- Hmm.
- Like…

883
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,417
That happens a lot, right?

884
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:56,286
Yeah, the good ones are already taken.

885
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:57,621
Yes! Yeah, exactly.

886
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:00,524
You end up having to control yourself.

887
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:02,292
Hmm.

888
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,704
- What's wrong?
- <i>What was that sigh for?</i>

889
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:17,808
- You tired? Want me to take over?
- Izaya's gloomy from the ex talk.

890
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:44,802
<i>I trace your name</i>
<i>In this cold, freezing air</i>

891
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:49,473
<i>You're still a shadow</i>
<i>I know you are there</i>

892
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,875
<i>I'll be waiting for </i>

893
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:54,478
<i>I'll be waiting for you </i>

894
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,079
<i>Now hold my hand</i>

895
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,782
<i>I promise, I, I, I</i>

896
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:00,884
<i>I hear…</i>

897
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:03,554
There's one thing I haven't mentioned.

898
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:08,926
Here, in the Green Room…

899
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:12,396
To be honest…

900
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:17,067
I ran into the one person
who I didn't wanna see.

901
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,271
That person is William.

902
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:29,613
Three years ago,
for a few months… we sort of dated.

903
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,816
Something like that…
We were seeing each other.

904
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:36,753
<i>I told him I liked him.</i>
<i>I let him know that.</i>

905
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:40,324
<i>And I wanted to take it a step further.</i>

906
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,795
But he just ghosted. Um…

907
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:47,564
He completely stopped contacting me.

908
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:50,467
And… we just met again here.

909
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:57,841
<i>I thought he was someone who would</i>
<i>never be a part of my life again.</i>

910
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:00,911
<i>I didn't exactly erase him</i>
<i>from my memory, but…</i>

911
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:05,148
Yeah… I kind of pretended he didn't exist.

912
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,620
- What? Wait, wait.
- I wonder what happened.

913
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:11,922
I didn't fully catch it at first.
Can someone recap?

914
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:14,391
So, a while back,
they were dating for a few months.

915
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:17,160
And Izaya was starting
to get pretty serious about him.

916
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,563
Then, William suddenly
stopped contacting him,

917
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:22,165
so he erased him from his memory,
but they met again here.

918
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:25,035
So, for Izaya, William is
definitely someone who hurt him.

919
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:26,303
Exactly, yeah.

920
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,972
And they met again here? I see.

921
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:31,208
What are the chances of that?

922
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,844
I wonder if they'll have
a private conversation.

923
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,079
But they were working out
together in the morning.

924
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:37,547
- Oh my God!
- You're right!

925
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:39,683
- That's true!
- They even had a flirty conversation.

926
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,520
Yeah. But Izaya didn't have
to join the gym, but he did.

927
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,356
He didn't want to see him,
but maybe he still likes him.

928
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:49,826
Exactly, he went anyway.

929
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:51,662
Maybe that's why he couldn't sleep.

930
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:54,965
Aah! That's why! Exactly!

931
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:56,433
That's it!

932
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,038
- You're a genius!
- You're a genius detective!

933
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,572
Detective Pink!
