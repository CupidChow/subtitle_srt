3
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:40,673
- <i>He's drawing on him.</i>
- <i>Their relationship is soothing.</i>

4
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,710
- <i>These two are great together.</i>
- <i>I think so too.</i>

5
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,590
- Did I doze off?
- Good morning.

6
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:00,026
When everyone's so quiet,
it makes me sleepy.

7
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,796
It's hard to draw properly.

8
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:05,532
- <i>It's cute he drew hearts on him.</i>
- <i>It's cute.</i>

9
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:07,133
<i>Did he also write "meat"?</i>

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,935
- I'm tired.
- Good job.

11
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,938
You know you have hearts on your face?

12
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,940
- For real?
- Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

13
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:14,841
- What?
- Huh?

14
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,209
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,011
- <i>That says "meat"!</i>
- Oh, you're right.

16
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,046
<i>That's like in the Kinnikuman manga!</i>

17
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,515
I didn't feel anything.

18
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,418
I did a pretty good job.

19
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,320
Mm. You did.

20
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,756
Even today,
they still reference that old manga?

21
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,963
OFF TO NISEKO WE GO!
LET'S HAVE FUN TO THE MAX!

22
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,032
Come on, let's go!

23
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,201
It feels like a school trip.

24
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,369
- It really does.
- The bus is huge!

25
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,972
- <i>Look, Jobu's going too.</i>
- <i>What a trouper!</i>

26
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,041
<i>He's so good at switching gears.</i>

27
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,042
<i>Respect, Jobu.</i>

28
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,710
IT COMPANY SALES WORKER

29
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,045
Where did you wanna sit?

30
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,048
- It's taken.
- Sorry, did you want the window seat?

31
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,916
- I wanted the window seat.
- Naturally.

32
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:59,219
- It's taken.
- I'm already thirsty.

33
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,124
ART DIRECTOR

34
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,426
<i>Hiroya's sitting next to Bomi.</i>

37
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:09,996
Are you okay here?

IT COMPANY PROJECT MANAGER

39
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,999
- What?
- Are you okay?

40
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,335
Hiroya, you wanna switch places?

41
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:18,171
- It's fine. We can take turns.
- Is that okay with you?

42
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:21,875
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

43
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:22,976
Yay!

44
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,545
- We're off!
- Yay!

45
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,116
What a luxurious experience.

46
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,317
It really is.

47
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,720
But it does feel like a school trip.

48
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,058
- We should listen to some music.
- To music?

49
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,360
- Together.
- Okay.

50
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:43,096
I want you to listen to my playlist.

51
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,499
I want you to listen to mine.
Let's listen to each together.

52
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:47,567
Let's do that.

53
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:51,137
I have to say, I'm a bit nervous
about using my phone in front of you.

54
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:54,474
- Do you have weird stuff on it?
- No! I don't.

55
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,143
You kind of just admitted to having
weird stuff on it.

56
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,245
I mean,
I'm scared a notification might pop up,

57
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,080
like the other day.
This side or this side?

58
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:02,649
You said you wouldn't get any.

59
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,785
I don't know about that.
I can't control what people send me.

60
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,887
You did say you wouldn't get them anymore.

61
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,256
- No. I can't prevent it.
- You definitely…

62
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,158
You told me you wouldn't get them anymore.

63
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,127
Listen to the music.

64
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,130
- <i>This could get tricky.</i>
- <i>It's a trauma for him.</i>

65
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,998
- <i>William's scared.</i>
- Amazing.

66
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,066
It's so beautiful.

67
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,570
My mom's been sending me worried texts.

68
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,905
- Oh, really?
- She's telling me to come home.

69
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,576
It's because my mood was up and down,
like a rollercoaster.

70
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,378
I'll have a hard time one day,
but today, I'm having fun.

71
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:36,149
I go home every two or three months,
but she fights with me every time I leave

72
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,151
at the Osaka bullet train station.

73
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,487
Just a 60-year-old woman screaming
on the platform of the station each time.

74
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:45,225
I do wanna go home for a while,
at least for my mom.

75
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,459
Mm.

76
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,830
- It's plum.
- Thank you very much.

77
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,466
Wait a second, there are other flavors.

78
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,401
It's good.

79
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,471
I like this.

80
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,240
- My mood is sinking.
- What?

81
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,142
Come here.

82
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,545
Absolutely not.

83
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:07,947
I feel sick.

84
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,684
- My shoulder's free.
- I'm gonna sulk and sleep. Sulk and sleep.

85
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,754
- <i>Kazuyuki is such a nice guy.</i>
- <i>He's adorable. He's so sweet.</i>

86
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:15,955
<i>Such a good friend.</i>

87
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:28,701
<i>"Think easy," she said</i>

88
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,638
<i>"Forever young and so wild"</i>

89
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,807
<i>"Or pull a gun and then fire it"</i>

90
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:38,344
<i>- "Easy," she said</i>
<i>- She said</i>

91
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:44,284
<i>"You're never young if you don't run</i>
<i>So get over"</i>

92
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,353
<i>- We still got walls on both sides</i>
<i>- Sides</i>

93
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,788
<i>Maybe</i>

94
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,824
<i>- I wanna know how to climb</i>
<i>- Climb</i>

95
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,526
<i>- We're blind, blind</i>
<i>- Blind</i>

96
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:56,596
<i>- How'd we get air all this time?</i>
<i>- This time</i>

97
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,197
<i>- These things</i>
<i>- These things</i>

98
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,433
<i>I never thought when you were mine</i>

99
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,002
<i>We used to break it together</i>

100
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,004
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

101
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:09,542
<i>We used to dive</i>
<i>In our highest feelings</i>

102
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:12,278
<i>Are we growing older together?</i>

103
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,147
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

104
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:18,885
<i>I don't wanna miss anything</i>
<i>When I'm dreaming about</i>

105
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:21,754
<i>When we were dazed and confused</i>

106
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,928
Oh, you can see Mount Yotei now.

107
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,830
- Where?
- Mount Yotei.

108
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,598
- Is it famous?
- It's famous.

109
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,935
- Is that the mountain in Niseko?
- It's the one right next to it.

110
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,504
- We're here.
- Whoa.

111
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,914
<i>It's really beautiful.</i>

112
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,817
Are we here? I think we're here.

113
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:51,818
We're here.

114
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,686
- Exciting.
- It is.

115
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:54,921
We're finally here!

116
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,556
- Let's go in.
- This is great.

117
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:57,557
Wow.

118
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,559
- Amazing.
- It's so beautiful.

119
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,894
- Wow, amazing.
- This is so fancy.

120
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,796
Wow! Open the door.

121
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,466
- Whoa!
- Wow!

122
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,934
Wow, amazing!

123
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:10,770
This is really nice.

124
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,210
<i>Bomi can enjoy the hot spring now.</i>

125
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,778
<i>Yeah, Bomi can enjoy it now.</i>

126
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:30,957
I'm starving.

127
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,425
- I'm hungry.
- I'm hungry too.

128
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,460
Don't you feel like having
Hokkaido cuisine?

129
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,196
Yeah.
Maybe it's because we're wearing <i>yukatas</i>.

130
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,098
- Yay!
- Yay!

131
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,333
- Cheers!
- I can't reach.

132
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,234
Here, cheers!

133
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,136
- Cheers!
- Cheers, everyone.

134
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:44,170
Yay.

135
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,473
- Who's the cutest one here?
- Me.

136
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,176
Do we raise our hands?

137
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,813
No, the cutest one here is Ryuki.

138
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,781
It's Ryuki.

139
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:55,681
UNIVERSITY STUDENT

140
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,717
- Huwei is cute.
- Yeah, he is cute.

141
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:58,985
You think I'm cute?

142
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,421
When he walked in,
I thought he was the distant type,

143
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,856
but when he started talking,
I got a different impression.

144
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,359
The same could be said about you, William.

145
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,994
True. You're more like that.

146
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,463
You're more like that than me,
so you can't say that.

147
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,631
He's the cute type.

148
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,733
- We're the same.
- We're the same.

149
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,067
I agree. We're the same.

150
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,302
You two are the same.

151
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,871
- To good memories.
- To good memories.

152
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,873
I already miss those days.

153
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,812
How do you wanna spend…
the rest of your time here?

154
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:31,350
I wanna be sure
to do something I won't regret.

155
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,753
I wanna cherish each moment I have here.

156
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,857
I usually think about the consequences.
Maybe I don't need to think about that.

157
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,892
Just try not to worry about anything?

158
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,161
But if I don't worry,

159
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,032
then I'll worry
that I might end up being out of control.

160
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:49,235
- But I think that's okay too.
- You should show your true self more.

161
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,803
- You should too.
- Kazuyuki.

162
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,738
You should do that more than anyone.

163
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,007
- You're not showing it.
- This is me.

164
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:58,277
- The Osaka Kazu must be different, then.
- Is he right?

165
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,079
The Osaka Kazu?

166
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:02,582
We should finish talking.

167
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,617
We were in the middle of something.

168
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:07,286
- Earlier, we were talking…
- …about what to do afterwards.

169
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:08,921
- About what we want to do?
- Yeah, I mean…

170
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,891
I'm sorry. I've got a question for Ryuki.

171
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,527
- What is it?
- Tell us, have you come out yet?

172
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:18,965
I've gone out of my way to come out
to friends I wanna get close to,

173
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,667
if I think it's okay to tell someone.

174
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:22,635
Oh.

175
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:26,939
When I tell them,
I feel like they finally know the real me.

176
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,976
But… I haven't told my parents.

177
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,446
So if someone has come out
to their parents,

178
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,181
I would really like to know

179
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:39,552
just when and how
they decided to announce it to them.

180
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:43,556
Ever since I was a little boy,
I've never come out to them directly,

181
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,525
but I've introduced my boyfriends to them,

182
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,895
and I've always talked with my mom
about how handsome guys were.

183
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,030
- Hmm.
- I was never concerned by that.

184
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,865
They could tell without asking me,

185
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,033
and that was it.

186
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,336
- My whole family's like that.
- That's great.

187
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:01,007
For those who haven't told…
their parents yet,

188
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,608
how do you think they'd react?

189
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,077
I haven't come out
and told them straight-up

190
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,813
because I don't really like
using the word "gay,"

191
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,583
but my mom is always telling me

192
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,586
that she's expecting
to have five grandchildren.

193
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,489
Every time she says that,
I tell her to stop it.

194
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,992
I tell her that I'm not into women,
and that's how I kind of let her know.

195
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,460
- You told her that?
- I did.

196
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:25,831
But it's possible she might not have…
taken what I said seriously.

197
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,569
If I told her properly,
she might be able to accept it.

198
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,072
But then again, she might <i>not </i>accept it.

199
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,344
Same for me.

200
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:40,713
I'm really torn.

201
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:44,383
All my friends, for example,

202
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,386
and my cousins and my aunt,

203
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,056
I told them fairly easily.

204
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:55,194
But coming out to my parents
is an impossible task.

205
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,397
And I know it's because

206
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,734
being attracted to the same sex…

207
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:07,406
- It's unthinkable?
- They have… a negative opinion about it.

208
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:10,309
Mm. Do they know any gays?

209
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:14,714
I don't know if they do,
but… no matter how many…

210
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:17,984
people I can tell around me,

211
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:20,720
and who will support me,

212
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,255
if my parents ultimately reject me…

213
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,359
it'll just be sad.

214
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,863
So I guess that's the biggest obstacle.

215
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,268
That's so hard.

216
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:39,872
So we finally got to hear
how Ryuki feels about his family life.

217
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,942
Sometimes, the casual remarks
made in daily life,

218
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,411
like the things people say
while watching TV,

219
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,381
tend to really stick with those
who are directly concerned by them.

220
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,682
There are actually many times

221
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,351
when people think
they can't come out to their people

222
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,553
because they heard something like that.

223
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,823
I really hope this can serve
as an opportunity

224
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,293
to encourage everyone who needs it
to come out to their friends and family.

225
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,497
By participating in this show,
they're determined to find a solution.

226
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:05,798
We're rooting for them.

227
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,000
It was good to see
that Jobu went on the trip.

228
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,735
I was almost sure he wouldn't go.

229
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,270
Everyone who's in this show

230
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,507
is here with the hope of finding romance
within the group, right?

231
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:18,377
For example, William and Izaya are
in the fun phase of their relationship

232
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,513
and, of course, want to get intimate.

233
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:24,684
But they realize they should hold back
out of consideration for others.

234
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,086
But this is
an incredibly romantic setting.

235
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,522
What they're doing
is very considerate, right?

236
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,090
But it's really difficult to tell

237
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,426
how much intimacy is appropriate,
isn't it?

238
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,461
It's hard to find the right balance, yeah.

239
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,430
I think they went pretty far though!

240
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,298
Yeah, they were pretty intimate.

241
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,435
Yeah, sharing earphones shows
they were pretty intimate, doesn't it?

242
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,938
Izaya was gently rubbing his head
against William earlier.

243
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:49,308
- Yes, we saw that. We saw.
- Rubbing his head against him.

244
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,410
- That was cute.
- How fun and very cute.

245
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,981
- What are we doing tomorrow?
- The winner chooses.

246
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,850
- One person chooses?
- Right.

247
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,553
You choose a date
and then decide what you'll do.

248
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,189
- Can't we decide together?
- The dates can decide together.

249
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:06,058
If everyone decides to go snowboarding,
everyone goes snowboarding?

250
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,193
Yeah, that's it.

251
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,594
Are you ready?

252
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:09,962
Get set,

253
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,464
go!

254
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,667
- He's strong.
- He's really strong.

255
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,302
The start was…

256
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,377
Look how serious he is!

257
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,947
It's close.

258
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,749
Hiroya wins.

259
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,150
Go!

260
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:32,985
He's strong!

261
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,589
- There's that much difference?
- Yeah! He's strong!

262
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,058
- That's impressive.
- Final match. The two best.

263
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,960
- This is the final?
- Ready?

264
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,962
- This will be good.
- Two best arm-wrestlers.

265
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,363
I mean, look at our arms!

266
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,832
<i>You can see</i>
<i>the professional athlete concentrating.</i>

267
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,467
Ready?

268
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:50,302
Go!

269
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,839
- Oh wow! Huwei!
- You've got this, Izaya!

270
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,342
Huwei, Huwei!

271
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,343
Oh, he's strong.

272
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,044
<i>He won easily.</i>

273
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,348
- Impressive. Just impressive.
- That was amazing.

274
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,517
Who do you choose?

275
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,619
Let me see.

276
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,388
Hmm.

277
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,906
- I think I'll pass.
- What?

278
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,274
- What?
- <i>What did he do?</i>

279
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,975
Why not? You won, after all.

280
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,410
- For real?
- It's fine.

281
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,846
Are you sure? Is that your final answer?

282
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,215
Wait a minute, now I'm scared.
What should I do?

283
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,250
Well, then…

284
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,119
- You pass?
- I pass.

285
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,854
- For real?
- It's fine.

286
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,255
Are you serious?

287
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,191
- Is that okay with you?
- Yes, it's fine.

288
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,725
So now it's Izaya, right?

289
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:47,760
- If I may?
- Yes.

290
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,529
Then… I pick William.

291
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,665
- Okay.
- That's settled.

292
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,837
- Next is Jobu.
- Who should I choose?

293
00:13:58,804 --> 00:13:59,638
I pick Huwei.

294
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:02,608
- Okay, sounds fun.
- We haven't really talked much.

295
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,312
Next is Hiroya?

296
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,213
Well, then,

297
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:08,881
I pick Bomi.

298
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,050
Okay.

299
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,220
Then I'll go with Ryu… who's left.

300
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,189
- Okay.
- Yay!

301
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,657
Yeah!

302
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,793
- What should we do?
- I won this for us.

303
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,368
- Good night.
- Good night.

304
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:31,971
- Yay.
- Cheers.

305
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:33,505
Cheers.

306
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:38,110
- I knew Izaya would pick William.
- I was sure too.

307
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,312
- Yeah.
- Those two are already pretty solid.

308
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,347
That's for sure.

309
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,716
With the level of trust they have,

310
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:47,786
I would've thought it wouldn't matter
if Izaya had picked someone else.

311
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,723
Or maybe it means they don't have
the level of trust you think.

312
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,626
Yeah, of course. That's definitely
another way of seeing it.

313
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:54,827
I guess so.

314
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,497
Huwei decided not to pick anyone himself.

315
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,766
I was wondering why he did that.
That surprised me.

316
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,434
He should've picked Bomi or someone.

317
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,336
- It's a mystery.
- That's for sure.

318
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,905
Huwei is a mystery.

319
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:09,041
You ran the coffee truck with him, right?
You picked him.

320
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,211
I picked him…
because I was interested in him,

321
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,312
in knowing him.

322
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,682
I wanted to know about
his past relationships, so I asked,

323
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,617
I told him I was interested in him.

324
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,386
Oh!

325
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,221
- That's so cool, mister!
- You think so? Okay.

326
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,122
That's courageous.

327
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,690
Is that something that surprises you?

328
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,158
I'm definitely surprised.

329
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,295
I really had absolutely no idea at all
that you were interested in him.

330
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,597
I thought you were going to pick me.

331
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,300
- Sorry.
- Just kidding, don't worry.

332
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,068
Were you disappointed?

333
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,237
- Let's pick this up later?
- Of course.

334
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,039
- That's how it is.
- I get it.

335
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,775
Okay, let's talk about this.
Can we? Can we?

336
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,743
- Of course.
- It's a smaller group.

337
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,146
- That's fine.
- Wonderful.

338
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,350
Did you feel like you had a chance?

339
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,952
Well, it felt like…

340
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,955
- He did say, "Thank you, I'm happy."
- Mm.

341
00:15:56,021 --> 00:16:00,259
So I was kind of hoping I'd get an answer
on the next date or work shift.

342
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:01,827
But then he chose Bomi.

343
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,697
At that point,
I thought I was out of the running.

344
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,232
That's why I was pretty down that day.

345
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,600
Mm.

346
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:11,236
I gradually started to cool down
pretty fast.

347
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,539
- Mm.
- I still think you have a chance.

348
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,474
Yeah.

349
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,176
- Want a drink?
- We forgot something.

350
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,444
What'd you forget?

351
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,013
- You guys forget things a lot.
- There's a lot of stuff.

352
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:22,948
Wanna talk over there?

353
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:23,916
Maybe?

354
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,719
- I'll meet you later.
- Okay, see you later.

355
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,887
- We'll probably be up until one.
- Okay.

356
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,157
Hiroya, I really don't get you, you know.

357
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,126
I'm not good at expressing
my romantic feelings.

358
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:37,262
I don't know why you don't go for it more.
You could have asked Huwei

359
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,397
to sit with you on the bus.

360
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:39,898
- Yeah, that's a good example.
- Maybe.

361
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:42,735
But you decided
to sit next to Bomi. Why did you do that?

362
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:43,836
You have a point.

363
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,805
We all wondered for what reason
you sat next to him. It was weird.

364
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:47,873
I get it.

365
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,075
I'll have to take the initiative.

366
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,111
You have to show him
that you haven't given up.

367
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,046
Nothing'll happen if I wait around.

368
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,918
Thank you. You've helped me understand
and sort things out.

369
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:02,654
I'll set the alarm for 6:30 a.m.

370
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,923
- That's early.
- Yeah, you're right.

371
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,159
Then I'll set it for 6:35 a.m.

372
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,094
- What about breakfast?
- I wanna go.

373
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,629
We should have breakfast together.

374
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,398
Can you go? Are you okay?

375
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,066
- I want you to wake me up.
- Okay.

376
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,036
- Good night, everyone.
- Good night.

377
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,558
We're leaving now to have breakfast.

378
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:52,938
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>Wow!</i>

379
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,940
- <i>Is that okay?</i>
- <i>Will they do it?</i>

380
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,375
<i>It's morning, after all.</i>

381
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:07,286
- <i>They're holding hands.</i>
- <i>They are?</i>

382
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:28,407
He kissed his hand!

383
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,375
He kissed his hand!

384
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,912
Wow, they're moving their relationship
forward so smoothly, don't you think?

385
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,782
- That kind of lazy morning vibe is nice.
- It is.

386
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,017
Everyone else has gone,
leaving just the two of them.

387
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:40,219
It feels kind of secretive.

388
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,821
- It's kind of sexy.
- I don't know what you mean.

389
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,890
"It got quiet. No one's here anymore."

390
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,658
Yeah, you know it. It's so sexy.

391
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:50,629
- How nice of everyone to leave!
- Do it already! Just go for it!

392
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,431
- This is their chance.
- Go for it!

393
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:55,601
- It's a matter of time before they kiss.
- Yeah, that's for sure.

394
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,248
<i>At this rate,</i>
<i>he'll probably start doing jumps too.</i>

395
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,083
Oh no, I'm in trouble! It's too soft!

396
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,417
The snow here is really soft!

397
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,619
Too soft?

398
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:14,820
The view's incredible.

399
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,890
<i>Wow, he's right.</i>
<i>The view really is incredible. I wanna go!</i>

400
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,092
This is so exciting.
I love discovering stores.

401
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,994
- Do you know about glass beads?
- I don't.

402
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,996
- Glass beads are cute.
- They are?

403
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,098
- Hello.
- Hello.

404
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,132
- Hello.
- Oh wow.

405
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,634
- Hello.
- Hello.

406
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,936
- Thank you for having us.
- Here for the workshop?

407
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,337
- Yes.
- Okay.

408
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,906
There are six designs in total

409
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,141
to choose from
in our glass bead collection.

410
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,310
And for a limited time,
you can add another bead,

411
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,112
called a <i>sakura </i>bead, inside.

412
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,314
- Wait a minute.
- These are very pretty.

413
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,016
And spring isn't even that far away.

414
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:47,819
You want to heat the tip
above the invisible part of the flame.

415
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,054
If you hold it too close,

416
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,256
the difference in temperature
will make the glass crack,

417
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,424
so hold it steady.

418
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,092
Since it tends to widen,

419
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,994
every now and then,
bring it back to the middle

420
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,263
to straighten it out.
Yes, that's very good.

421
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,598
Okay, now pull it toward you.

422
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,267
- <i>He's so cute.</i>
- <i>He really is!</i>

423
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,871
- Place it on the <i>sakura </i>bead.
- <i>Just how cute is that?</i>

424
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,907
<i>- Bomi seems like he'd be good at this.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

425
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:13,312
<i>He really does look like</i>
<i>he knows what he's doing, doesn't he?</i>

426
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,980
<i>This is delicate work.</i>

427
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:20,219
Okay, everyone,
please change your jackets. Okay?

428
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,791
This might be too small for me.

429
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,760
- Wow, that's so cool.
- So cool.

430
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,863
Today, we have Monaka and Daifuku.

431
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,765
- Daifuku?
- That's right.

432
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,167
- Cute.
- Cute.

433
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,869
- I'll take Daifuku, then.
- Daifuku? I'll take Monaka.

434
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,705
That's perfect.

435
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:42,341
Monaka, nice to meet you.

436
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,776
It's just like getting up on a bike. Up!

437
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:46,478
Okay, very good.

438
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,648
Okay, everyone, come on. We're leaving.

439
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,555
- The setting is gorgeous.
- It's beautiful and so relaxing.

440
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,958
- Wow!
- Isn't this amazing?

441
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,294
- It's absolutely amazing.
- Incredible.

442
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,763
You don't see things
from this height often.

443
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,632
That's true.

444
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,100
Wow, amazing.

445
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,069
As you can see, the snow is pretty deep.

446
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:15,540
Monaka is getting a little too close,
so let's pick up the pace, Daifuku.

447
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,042
Go, Daifuku!

448
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,212
Monaka is used to always
walking right behind Daifuku.

449
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,179
I get it.

450
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:23,882
Monaka loves Daifuku
and wants to kiss its butt.

451
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,617
Now I really get it.

452
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:26,885
That's sweet.

453
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,654
- That's like Izaya.
- What?

454
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,789
He follows me.

455
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,557
Cute.

456
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,931
Okay, we're back.
Thank you very much, everyone.

457
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,334
- Thank you, Monaka.
- You're welcome.

458
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,502
Thank you.

459
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,370
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

460
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,542
How was the date?

461
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,311
- With Bomi?
- Yeah.

462
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,513
Everything went well.

463
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,649
But it wasn't anything more than that,
you know?

464
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,451
I can't believe it!

465
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:04,022
I kind of feel like I need…
to nurture my feelings, you know?

466
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:07,392
Figure things out a little more
before I can act on them.

467
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:09,895
Yeah, I get it.

468
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,831
Who are you interested in?

469
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,466
I had chosen William.

470
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,736
- It was always him?
- Yeah, it was him from the start.

471
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,372
But those two are very close.

472
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,074
- Yeah, they are.
- It's obvious.

473
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,512
I wonder how far
those two have already gone.

474
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:30,649
No idea.
I haven't really asked about that.

475
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:35,120
You know, I know nothing
about your past relationships.

476
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:39,691
My ex and I… were together
for almost three years.

477
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,927
We broke up over a year ago.

478
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,963
It was my first relationship,
and I was young.

479
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,966
So I think I was really selfish.

480
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:52,738
Do you feel like
he kind of pushed you around?

481
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:56,475
Not at all. It wasn't like that.
At the end, my partner brought it up.

482
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,144
You were thinking of breaking up
but couldn't tell him, then he did?

483
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,680
Yeah, that's what happened.
He talked about it first.

484
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:06,318
It was still tough.

485
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,820
I think I cried enough for a lifetime.

486
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:10,789
- For real.
- What? You really cry?

487
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,290
I don't usually cry.

488
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:16,294
But during that time,
I even surprised myself.

489
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,897
I never thought I could cry that much.

490
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,639
I feel really bad for you
for being paired with me.

491
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,641
There's no reason to feel that way.

492
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,844
Lately, I've been remembering things

493
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:37,482
about how my ex and I first met,
about when and how we started dating,

494
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,117
like I told you the other day.

495
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:43,255
Talking about everything
brought back memories of what it was like.

496
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,223
It made you cry.

497
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,759
- It didn't make me cry.
- Your eyes were teary.

498
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:49,694
Yeah, you're right. It was pretty bad.

499
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:51,830
Fifteen years…

500
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:55,734
There were so many things I had forgotten
until I looked back on them.

501
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,670
When we first started dating,

502
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,773
people around us would say things like,
"Why are you dating someone like him?"

503
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,341
They'd say that about me.

504
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:07,846
But if I had been the popular guy,
then people around us would've…

505
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:08,780
…been jealous.

506
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,015
Yeah, exactly.

507
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:13,385
He told me, "It doesn't matter
what people around us say."

508
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:17,689
"It will only reflect poorly on them,
and it won't change a thing between us."

509
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,357
That's so beautiful.

510
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:23,094
I want a partner like that.

511
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,335
Cheers.

512
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,439
I'm gonna be honest. I wanted to ask,

513
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:36,975
who do you really like
in our group right now?

514
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,178
Honestly, I don't think
I've gotten to the phase

515
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,180
where I really like anyone yet.

516
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:43,548
What about Huwei?

517
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:47,319
Okay, yeah.
There is Huwei that I like, but…

518
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,921
You're wondering
whether to take it a step further?

519
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,556
I can't take that step yet.

520
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,058
- Okay.
- Yeah.

521
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:56,228
For that date outing,
I, too, wrote Huwei's name.

522
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:58,263
I kind of had a feeling you had…

523
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:01,666
that you were taking
some kind of initiative

524
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,368
with regards to Huwei.

525
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,303
Yesterday as well.

526
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:08,940
I was sure Huwei was gonna choose you
as his partner.

527
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,811
The thing is, the question isn't
why he didn't choose me.

528
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:16,381
Huwei's been saying for a while
that he wants to go snowboarding.

529
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:20,652
And, apparently,
he really wants to go with Jobu.

530
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,153
Then why not chose him?

531
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,823
I'm sure it's because he had
mixed feelings about it.

532
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,492
I was there in front of him,
and you were also there.

533
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:30,295
He probably had a lot of mixed feelings
and couldn't choose.

534
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:33,431
- I guess. Yeah, maybe that's it.
- Yeah.

535
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,267
Oh, thank you very much.

536
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,637
It's a kumquat
and Shonai persimmons salad. Enjoy.

537
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:39,838
It looks delicious.

538
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:41,606
This is venison.

539
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,875
Venison? This'll be my first time.

540
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:47,145
I didn't know
venison was served in blocks like this.

541
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,747
What do you like about him?

542
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:50,549
- Huwei?
- Mm.

543
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:52,551
Well, Huwei…

544
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,687
Everyone says he's cute,

545
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:59,591
but, for me, his appeal as a person
goes way beyond that.

546
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:06,731
Right now, I know this crush is one-sided.
At least that's what I think.

547
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,802
I know it's something
I need to confirm with him

548
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,272
before I can start thinking about
or doing anything else.

549
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,843
First thing to do,

550
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,346
I need to set a meeting up with Huwei
so we can talk.

551
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,081
Is that okay?

552
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:26,117
Why are you asking me?
Of course it's okay.

553
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,220
<i>They're too good friends to be rivals.</i>

554
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:30,922
<i>Yeah, that's for sure.</i>

555
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:41,833
HEY, HUWEI

556
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,401
<i>What? Just like that?</i>

557
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:47,072
LET'S TALK TONIGHT, JUST THE TWO OF US

558
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:49,007
<i>Well, he sent the text.</i>

559
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:54,012
<i>I wonder what Huwei thinks about</i>
<i>these two having lunch together,</i>

560
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,814
<i>or rather going on a date.</i>

561
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,815
SURE!!

562
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,850
- <i>Sure!</i>
- <i>Sure!</i>

563
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,685
<i>That's so cute.</i>

564
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:01,886
What is it?

565
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,524
- No, it's nothing.
- Nothing?

566
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,036
- How are you liking the trip?
- It's going by too fast.

567
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,905
We went to sleep together
for the first time.

568
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,174
- We did.
- We've slept apart until now.

569
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:27,946
Even though we had to share
a large sleeping space with the others,

570
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,715
I got to sleep next to you
for the first time,

571
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,184
so I was restless.

572
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:38,923
It was a new feeling, wouldn't you say?

573
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,893
A fresh feeling or a fresh start feeling.

574
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:45,597
As we spend more and more time together,

575
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:51,002
I can feel that you're really expressing
your true feelings for me,

576
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,372
or rather that you're focusing on me.

577
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:57,542
At first, I was a little bit confused.

578
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,413
I didn't know if I could live up to them.

579
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:07,819
That's why I was really nervous
and a little worried too, maybe.

580
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:12,157
I don't know. I can't really describe
this feeling that I had.

581
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,191
Mm.

582
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,527
But now,

583
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,962
I'm just happy.

584
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:18,897
Aw!

585
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:21,700
<i>I trace your name in this…</i>

586
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:23,234
- When our hands touched…
- Yeah.

587
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:27,672
That… feeling has been with me all day.

588
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:28,606
Mm.

589
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:32,177
I realized today
how important physical contact is.

590
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:35,747
'Cause we've never touched
like that before.

591
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:40,518
So to spend this much time with someone
I feel so highly drawn to…

592
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,120
It's mutual.

593
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,156
I think my feelings are in motion.

594
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,460
So, Izaya…

595
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,530
I don't see myself with anyone else.

596
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:54,299
I'm happy.

597
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,868
If I feel this way, maybe I'm already…

598
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,705
I'm starting to wonder
if maybe I already like you.

599
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,909
<i>With love…</i>

600
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,845
I'm happy.

601
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,647
<i>…the sky above</i>

602
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:12,016
<i>And rise a little higher…</i>

603
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,518
I'll always be here for you.

604
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:18,223
And… once I've made up my mind on someone,

605
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:22,093
I'm confident I can make it last.

606
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:27,298
So just believe in me
and know you can trust me.

607
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,104
I hope this feeling lasts forever.

608
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,672
Mm.

609
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,276
It will last.

610
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:42,647
<i>Closer again</i>

611
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:46,484
Wow, that was so good.
It was like something out of a movie.

612
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:48,820
- Congratulations to them.
- You're right.

613
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:51,856
They both took the time they needed
to build up their emotions,

614
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:54,359
and now, "I think maybe I like him."

615
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,528
I'm glad Izaya's feelings got through.

616
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,696
- Yes!
- That was really a happy moment.

617
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:02,433
"The warmth of your hand is
still with me," even in such a cold place.

618
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,736
- Isn't that amazing?
- He could still feel it.

619
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,572
His hands were numb.
That's why he thought he could feel it.

620
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:08,873
He could feel it.

621
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:13,144
So we can't say that they're
officially together yet, right?

622
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,279
Not officially.

623
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:17,248
But once you get to that phase,
you usually want to let people know

624
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,717
that you're officially together
in a relationship.

625
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:21,953
I just want them
to graduate from the show already.

626
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,889
Yes, but let's not forget
that they have a schedule to follow,

627
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:27,959
so maybe they're planning on waiting
until the end of the show

628
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:30,028
to give their official answer.

629
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:33,565
I wonder if these two ever talk about
anything trivial when they're alone.

630
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:34,966
That's a good question.

631
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:39,037
I mean, they're always having
deep, very serious conversations.

632
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:41,372
"Hey, look, doesn't that tree
look like it has a face?"

633
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,775
Do they ever say stuff like that
to each other?

634
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,211
Or like, "No, that tree over there
looks like a face."

635
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:47,111
Something like that.

636
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:50,181
William still seems a little timid
or scared if you ask me.

637
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:53,651
It's his first time being in
a serious relationship, after all.

638
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:57,188
I liked the part where they said,
"Will this last?" "Yes, it will!"

639
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,757
When William wavers,
Izaya, bam, puts him on track.

640
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:01,593
- "Stay on track."
- "Focus."

641
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:02,594
It will last.

642
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,630
But William hasn't said
that he likes him yet.

643
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,131
- He hasn't.
- He's starting to wonder.

644
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,835
Yeah, and he also said something like,
"I don't see myself with anyone else".

645
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:14,205
The thing we all need to understand
is that, when you meet someone

646
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,908
or find something
that becomes precious to you,

647
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,910
once it's in your life,

648
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,180
you realize
it comes with the fear of losing it.

649
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:23,114
Yes, the fear.

650
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:27,218
However, to face that fear,
you need the determination to accept it.

651
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:31,923
Maybe William is trying to evaluate
if he has that determination within him.

652
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:33,725
- I'm hungry.
- Yeah.

653
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,727
- I'm excited.
- We can finally eat.

654
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:39,163
Do you think it's
that fancy building we can see over there?

655
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,165
Oh, you mean that one?

656
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,101
- This is it?
- This looks really nice.

657
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:45,536
- This is so fancy.
- This is really nice.

658
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,238
- Wow, this is amazing.
- Oh, wow.

659
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,340
- How fancy.
- Yeah, it is.

660
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,675
It's so nice.

661
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,744
- This is nice.
- It's beautiful.

662
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,680
- Cheers!
- To our last night.

663
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,982
To our last night in Niseko.

664
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:00,151
Cheers!

665
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,085
To us.

666
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,488
Something awesome is coming.

667
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:05,990
I don't know how to eat this.

668
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:07,759
We only eat the top part, right?

669
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:09,260
Yeah. Let's taste this.

670
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,296
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy your meal.

671
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:12,330
Oh!

672
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:14,866
The foie gras is amazing.

673
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,935
I love foie gras.

674
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,404
- It's super rich.
- Yeah.

675
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,176
- Who has a fond memory?
- A fond memory?

676
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:27,912
- That sounds dangerous.
- It is dangerous.

677
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,614
Do you have a fond memory?

678
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:34,352
I do. My previous… partner,

679
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:40,158
when he invited me
to his college cultural festival,

680
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:44,696
he asked me to come to his clubroom
to introduce me.

681
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,564
So I went with him,

682
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:48,266
and he introduced me,

683
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,001
and later that night,

684
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,570
I caught a glimpse of his group chat.

685
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:56,374
I saw, "Isn't he super cute?"
"Yes, he is,"

686
00:32:56,441 --> 00:33:00,912
and I was super happy
that… he was bragging about me. Yeah.

687
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,113
- That's nice.
- Cute.

688
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,081
- That's cute.
- It is.

689
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,916
That's a great story. A fond memory.

690
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,086
- That was a cute, heartwarming story.
- What a great memory.

691
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,522
Do you have a memory?

692
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:14,692
Mm…

693
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:21,265
There is one, but I can't.
Give me a moment.

694
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:25,570
<i>He's rubbing his back.</i>

695
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,172
<i>Hmm, it's a bit… Hmm.</i>

696
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,208
You don't have to force yourself.

697
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:31,275
Okay.

698
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,379
I can't share this yet.

699
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:37,682
- <i>Why is he touching him?</i>
- <i>Enough. Stop touching him.</i>

700
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:39,917
<i>William.</i>

701
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:43,988
Here we go.

702
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,357
I have to talk about it anyway
to work through it.

703
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,892
It's important.

704
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,028
A fond memory, right?

705
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:53,264
He was such a kind person.

706
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:58,002
Probably the kindest person
I've ever met in my life.

707
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:01,939
One day, it was raining really hard,

708
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,009
and he held an umbrella for me.

709
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,179
When we got to our destination,

710
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,281
he was soaking wet.

711
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:12,950
Just him, not me.

712
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:17,188
Whenever we would watch…
a movie or something,

713
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:22,994
he would… always cry a lot
at all the sad or heartfelt moments.

714
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:26,731
He would always say things like,
"That's so sad," or "That's so sweet."

715
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:27,665
I saw him cry a lot.

716
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:33,371
It was all those… little things
that made his kindness deep inside

717
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,239
shine for everyone to see.

718
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:39,677
And I remember each and every one
of those precious moments so vividly.

719
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,814
<i>Poor Kazuyuki!</i>

720
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,983
<i>I think he sees himself</i>
<i>in the man Jobu described.</i>

721
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,985
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

722
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:51,155
It just brought back
a lot of memories for me.

723
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,257
What did you remember?

724
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:56,427
I remembered the same thing used to happen
when we watched movies,

725
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,129
but I was the one who cried.

726
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,233
I'd cry, and after the movie, he'd say,

727
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:04,502
"You were crying so hard next to me

728
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:06,938
that, in fact,
I started laughing instead."

729
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:09,574
I remembered how he used to say that.

730
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,145
I don't have fond memories.

731
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:16,647
Of your last partner?

732
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,516
- Should he go there?
- Don't say anything weird.

733
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,952
Don't forget Izaya's watching you.

734
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:25,223
Does everybody know how a bad memory
can stay stuck in your mind?

735
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,958
Yeah, it just stays burned in your head.

736
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:29,660
I have bad memories
of everyone I've dated so far,

737
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:32,263
but if I focus only on the good moments,

738
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,265
there were lots of them.

739
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:37,235
But the fondest memory I have

740
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,971
is from the last partner I was with.

741
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:41,506
I decided to move

742
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:44,108
and left Japan for Barcelona
for the very first time.

743
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:47,745
Once I was there,
I didn't have any friends at all.

744
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:51,149
Finally, I ended up meeting someone
through an app.

745
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,683
He was German,

746
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,252
and, little by little,

747
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,655
he started visiting me
every weekend from Germany.

748
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,324
That went on for two or three weeks.

749
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,427
One day, he asked me
to go with him to Germany.

750
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:07,198
On that trip,
he introduced me to his family.

751
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:10,234
That was the first time it happened to me,
and I was 32.

752
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:14,772
It's always been my dream
to be introduced to someone's family.

753
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,243
So, imagine, it was the first time
my dream was coming true.

754
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:23,748
It feels like they're saying,
"Let's become a family," right?

755
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:27,151
That's when I realized
that I was accepted as family.

756
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,187
So I guess my next dream

757
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:32,790
was to introduce someone
I had really come to love

758
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,659
to my mother and father.

759
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:39,030
I wanted to be able to do that.
That's a fond memory for me.

760
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,699
I know I should focus more on them.

761
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,368
Humans are so flawed.

762
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,774
I think maybe I'm carrying
a lot of trauma inside of me.

763
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:53,411
My ex was always very expressive
with his affection.

764
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:55,947
He'd say things like, "I like you,"
or, "I love you."

765
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:59,617
He would say things like, "I love you
just as much as the day I met you,"

766
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:01,652
or, "I can't live without you."

767
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,054
His words moved me,

768
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,122
and just when I thought he was the one,

769
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,558
he completely blocked me on social media.

770
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,627
I couldn't contact him,
so I went to Germany.

771
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,798
I went to his house,
rang the doorbell, and waited,

772
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:16,367
but even after an hour,
he didn't come down.

773
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:20,137
He told me he loved me every day
until the day before,

774
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:24,242
so I didn't understand
why… he wouldn't open the door for me.

775
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,310
And because of that,

776
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,714
when someone tells me they like me, well,

777
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:33,451
I tend to not really believe
what they say.

778
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,887
I can't bring myself to trust them.

779
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,156
I think they'll do the same thing.

780
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,670
- So someone hurt him.
- That's harsh.

781
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,740
Getting blocked for no reason
must be really traumatizing.

782
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:58,109
That's why he gets anxious
when someone says they like him.

783
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:00,845
- Now I understand.
- It's a way to protect himself.

784
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:10,921
I'M AT THE BAR ON THE FIRST FLOOR

785
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:11,956
OKAY

786
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,891
- <i>"Okay."</i>
- <i>Now…</i>

787
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,661
<i>What will he say?</i>

788
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:20,231
You're here.
I didn't know there was a place like this.

789
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,866
- It's nice, right?
- Yeah, it is.

790
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:23,334
Thanks for coming.

791
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:28,239
- This is a really nice place.
- Yeah.

792
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:30,241
Cheers.

793
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,515
- It's good.
- Mm.

794
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,552
- Can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.

795
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:45,456
The other day,
I thought I had made myself clear to you

796
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,391
when I said I have feelings for you.

797
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:48,526
Mm.

798
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:51,195
But I haven't gotten a response from you.

799
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:52,496
Not a response, but…

800
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:56,067
Honestly, I have no idea how you feel
about what I told you.

801
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:56,967
Mm.

802
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:59,837
That's why I asked you here
to talk about it.

803
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,607
I'm having a hard time understanding you.

804
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,576
Like your decision last night.

805
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:08,479
You won the arm wrestling contest.

806
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:10,848
But then you didn't choose anyone.

807
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:16,454
You're right. It's confusing, isn't it?
Everyone says so.

808
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,689
I don't think anybody in the group…

809
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,293
really understands you.

810
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,261
Mm.

811
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:25,963
Well, to be perfectly honest,

812
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,399
I was torn between three people.

813
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:29,834
Mm.

814
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:34,372
There was Jobu,

815
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,240
there was Bomi,

816
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,042
and Ryuki.

817
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:41,512
Oh.

818
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:43,614
So I wasn't one of the options.

819
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:44,882
No, you weren't.

820
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:46,784
Okay.

821
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,353
Ooh!

822
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,155
Now, that's rough!

823
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:53,657
I really don't think…

824
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:58,763
…I feel that way about you, Hiroya.

825
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:02,466
So you want to focus on Bomi for now?

826
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,635
- Yeah.
- That's good.

827
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:05,536
Yeah.

828
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:09,340
You know, with Bomi,
my feelings for him are different, but…

829
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,508
I know what you mean.

830
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,610
They're different,
but there's a part of me

831
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:16,347
that's still not sure what I feel
or if I actually like him or not.

832
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,515
I need to figure it out.

833
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:22,219
- So you're not even sure if you like him.
- Yeah. I'm not sure.

834
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,455
- I wonder why.
- Okay.

835
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:27,525
I think you need to go find love.

836
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,826
I need to find it.

837
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,328
- You're right.
- I really hope you do.

838
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:34,064
Thanks, man. You're right.

839
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:40,871
- It's okay.
- Let's enjoy the time we have left.

840
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:41,772
Thank you.

841
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,908
- Good night.
- Good night.

842
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:55,419
- <i>Oh, that's so sad.</i>
- <i>Poor thing.</i>

843
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,923
- Out of the three, he wasn't one of them?
- Exactly.

844
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,624
He wasn't an option. Can you believe that?

845
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:02,793
If he had to give three names,

846
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,930
he very well could've given four
and included Hiroya's name.

847
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:09,033
Huwei, he's just
always so brutally honest.

848
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:11,202
- Yeah, he really can't lie.
- Yeah, exactly.

849
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:12,703
That was so much fun.

850
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:13,771
It really was.

851
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:16,740
- We got to do a lot of things.
- We're already leaving.

852
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,376
- It went by fast.
- I wish we could've stayed longer.

853
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:22,513
Yeah. You're right,
but I kind of miss life in the Green Room.

854
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,714
Yeah.

855
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:26,016
Today, I got 'em.

856
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,319
Hmm, where should I sit?

857
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:40,865
Hi.

858
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:54,445
- Look at the view.
- The mountains are amazing.

859
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:03,153
<i>Why is Izaya staring</i>
<i>and William not looking back?</i>

860
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:06,457
What's on your mind?

861
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:09,393
- A lot of things.
- A lot of things?

862
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,796
And are you thinking about them
in a good or a bad way?

863
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,132
In every way.

864
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:17,201
I don't know if it's in a good way.

865
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:18,936
- Okay.
- <i>He's being negative.</i>

866
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:20,971
- <i>It's his trauma.</i>
- <i>He has trauma.</i>

867
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,473
Don't start getting anxious.

868
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,275
How…

869
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:27,044
how should I put this?

870
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:30,748
I wonder if you feel this way
because of our situation.

871
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:32,016
Hmm.

872
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:33,250
Don't you wonder?

873
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:35,419
That's never crossed my mind.

874
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:41,258
What if, when you leave this place,

875
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:44,428
you suddenly realize you weren't… into me

876
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:46,730
as much as you thought you were?

877
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:51,001
Nothing is certain, you know.

878
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:54,238
I agree that nothing is certain,
but I'm willing to take that risk

879
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:56,340
in order to be with you.

880
00:42:57,808 --> 00:42:58,876
It's hot.

881
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:00,210
Mm.

882
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:06,750
It's hard to trust when someone says,
"I love you forever,"

883
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:09,019
but then they end up
losing interest in you.

884
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:17,528
Do you think that, whatever the issue
that's bothering you right now,

885
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:22,700
could eventually be… resolved
during the course of this experience?

886
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:26,036
I don't know.

887
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:29,640
I'm curious to know that as well.

888
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:31,609
I need to know if it's possible.

889
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,577
Seriously.

890
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:41,719
When something new
is about to begin in my life,

891
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:43,420
I remember things,

892
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:46,056
and the after-dinner conversation
triggered a lot.

893
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:50,661
It was something
I'd been holding in for a long time.

894
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,752
What I mean is,

895
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:17,855
you say things like, "I won't change,"
or, "I'm serious,"

896
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:23,127
and, in fact, I just wanna know
where all this… is coming from, you know?

897
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:30,267
My mother passed away when I was 21.
Since then,

898
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,970
I think that, because of her death,

899
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,773
the way I am with people has changed.

900
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:40,477
Oh no.

901
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:41,512
I think…

902
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:50,287
I regret not having been able
to express my love for her more easily.

903
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:52,122
But maybe that's…

904
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,629
…what made me who I am today.

905
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:10,808
You have no way of knowing

906
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:13,544
when someone dear to you might die.

907
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:19,316
That's why

908
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:23,287
if I have someone I care for in my life,

909
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:26,957
I want to be able to express my feelings…

910
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,063
…through both words and actions.

911
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:39,136
I need to be able
to fully express my feelings.

912
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:41,538
It comes from there.

913
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:58,756
So there are things I wanna work on,

914
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:02,292
and I was hoping
that I could work on them with you.

915
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,095
For example…

916
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:09,433
I want you to know

917
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,802
that I'm serious about this.

918
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,139
I only do it with people I like.

919
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,241
No way.

920
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:19,576
Of course it's true.

921
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:24,515
I wonder what exactly
is so great about me.

922
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,318
I guess everything.

923
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:33,123
Like… the way you express your feelings

924
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:35,993
without holding anything back.

925
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:37,828
I really like that about you.

926
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,898
I'll always be here for you.

927
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,567
Once I've made up my mind on someone,

928
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,970
I'm confident I can make it last.

929
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,207
So just believe in me

930
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:52,709
and know you can trust me.

931
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:28,879
- Intense.
- So now we understand everything.

932
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:31,448
So that's why Izaya was so straightforward

933
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:35,185
and honest about what he was feeling
with William, right?

934
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:38,488
I was wondering before
why Izaya was acting that way,

935
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:41,058
especially so early on,
but now we understand.

936
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:41,959
Seriously.

937
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,361
You can tell
that he wasn't lying about any of this.

938
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:46,630
He expressed himself
in a very clear manner.

939
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:50,300
Now, will William still feel anxious
of anything Izaya says?

940
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,636
Or will he change
and try to believe in him?

941
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,239
That will determine
where this couple goes from here.
