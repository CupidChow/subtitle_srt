1
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:15,949
- What are you doing?
- Wake up!

2
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,350
- Okay, I'm awake.
- Wake up.

3
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,052
IT COMPANY PROJECT MANAGER
IT COMPANY SALES

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,720
Okay, squeeze!

5
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:22,889
<i>He's so lovely!</i>

6
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,792
<i>Of course, you get closer</i>
<i>after spending a night together.</i>

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,028
<i>Their bond has gotten stronger.</i>

8
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:33,233
This is the ideal breakfast?

9
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,567
- It is.
- Right?

10
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:36,603
Did you sleep well?

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,973
Thank you, I did sleep well.

12
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:49,215
We ended up sleeping together
one night three years ago as well.

13
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,584
But it's been lingering
in the back of my mind

14
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,587
how he said he wasn't able
to sleep comfortably.

15
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:59,359
So, the fact that he drifted off right
away and I drifted off right away…

16
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:03,663
Things like that are very reassuring
and are what I looked for.

17
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:05,698
We trust now,

18
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:09,803
and our relationship is becoming
stronger by the day.

19
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:14,641
<i>Three years ago, we just</i>
<i>hooked up, and that was a jerk move.</i>

20
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:17,544
I didn't feel like I wanted
to cherish him or anything.

21
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,181
But this time,
I'm not in that mindset anymore.

22
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,684
<i>Last night was the culmination</i>
<i>of all the different factors</i>

23
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,820
<i>finally coming together,</i>

24
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:28,988
<i>so it was a very special moment for me.</i>

25
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:33,226
Rather than feeling a rush of excitement,
I felt relieved.

26
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:37,330
That's the difference I felt between
now and three years ago.

27
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:39,399
<i>I felt happy.</i>

28
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,969
<i>I wanted to be</i>
<i>that "someone special" to him too.</i>

29
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,972
- That's so nice.
- Oh, that's lovely.

30
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,474
Okay, so that happens.

31
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,109
It's good that he felt relieved.

32
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:50,810
Phew, I'm glad.

33
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,314
- I wonder what those two did.
- Yeah.

34
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,882
Did they share the same bed?

35
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,551
- Whoa. I wonder.
- I don't think so.

36
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,553
- Maybe they moved their beds together.
- I think so.

37
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,923
There were probably two beds,
but they slept in one bed.

38
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,726
- Oh, really?
- I don't know. It's just a guess.

39
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,361
- A guess.
- I'm sure that's it.

40
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,730
I'm pretty sure
they didn't sleep separately.

41
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,367
- Oh. They're back already.
- They're back.

42
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:17,137
- We're back.
- Welcome back.

43
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:19,906
We were just talking about you two.

44
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,575
- We were wondering what you were doing.
- What we were doing?

45
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,378
We were saying that
you didn't have to come back yet.

46
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,580
- What? Didn't you miss us?
- Well, we came back.

47
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,783
- Where did you go?
- Um, a place called Nakashibetsu.

48
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,720
- Where's that?
- On the eastern side of Hokkaido.

49
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,455
- On the east side?
- Yeah.

50
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,357
- So this is what it looks like?
- Whoa!

51
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,058
- Nice.
- I'm jealous.

52
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,961
Your faces are different. You're shining.

53
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,463
- Glowing.
- Glowing?

54
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,465
You're right, he is. He's glowing today.

55
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,534
- You're glowing.
- What happened?

56
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,270
- I want to see the pictures later.
- Same. I want to see.

57
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,140
- Okay, now that everyone's here…
- Now that everyone's here?

58
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,009
Actually, as of today,

59
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:58,278
I'm going to be away
from the Green Room for a while.

60
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,513
- What?
- For your entrance ceremony?

61
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,049
- That and a bunch of other things.
- Okay, that's great.

62
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,951
- We'll miss you.
- Yeah.

63
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,753
When will all ten of us be together?

64
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,655
- Good question.
- It really is.

65
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,223
- Who knows?
- Have a good trip.

66
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,526
- Take care.
- Thanks.

67
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,295
<i>It's going to be lonely without him.</i>

68
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,264
- <i>Especially at a time like this.</i>
- <i>He's going to miss him.</i>

69
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,091
<i>It's Hiroya…</i>

70
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,894
- <i>He's back!</i>
- <i>What?</i>

71
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:51,164
- <i>Unbelievable!</i>
- <i>Perfect timing.</i>

72
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:04,244
<i>- "Think easy," she said</i>
<i>- She said</i>

73
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,980
<i>"Forever young and so wild"</i>

74
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:10,049
<i>"Or pull a gun and then fire it"</i>

75
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:13,453
<i>- "Easy," she said</i>
<i>- She said</i>

76
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:19,459
<i>"You're never young if you don't run</i>
<i>So get over"</i>

77
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,695
<i>- We still got walls on both sides</i>
<i>- Sides</i>

78
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,297
<i>Maybe</i>

79
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:27,133
<i>- I wanna know how to climb</i>
<i>- Climb</i>

80
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,568
<i>We're blind, blind</i>

81
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,004
<i>- Blind</i>
<i>- How'd we get air all this time?</i>

82
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,106
<i>- This time</i>
<i>- These things</i>

83
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,675
<i>- These things</i>
<i>- I never thought when you were mine</i>

84
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,478
<i>We used to break it together</i>

85
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,446
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

86
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:44,617
<i>We used to dive</i>
<i>In our highest feelings</i>

87
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,620
<i>Are we growing older together?</i>

88
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,589
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

89
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:54,294
<i>I don't wanna miss anything</i>
<i>When I'm dreaming about</i>

90
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,563
<i>When we were dazed and confused</i>

91
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,868
All right.

92
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,375
- Should we wash the cups later?
- We're almost done.

93
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,277
I guess we can do it now.

94
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:14,547
It could be just an optical illusion,
like it lingers in your vision.

95
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,317
- Not sure, though.
- Maybe it's 3D-edited.

96
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,519
- What was that? Huh?
- Someone's here.

97
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:22,188
Hiroya? Hiroya's back!

98
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,956
- Who?
- He's back!

99
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,558
- What?
- I'm back!

100
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,560
- He's in the house!
- Welcome back!

101
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,962
- I missed you.
- Wait, I want to hug you too.

102
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,864
- I missed you.
- Welcome back!

103
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:34,000
That was sudden. Glad to have you back.

104
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,768
- We have new members.
- Two!

105
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:36,969
I'm a new member.

106
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,905
Have I seen you before?

107
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,173
- Who are you?
- Nice to meet you.

108
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,774
- "Who are you?"
- I'm Taeheon.

109
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,277
You're Taeheon, right?

110
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,512
- Nice to meet you.
- I didn't think I'd get to meet you.

111
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,748
- It's you! Nice to meet you.
- We finally meet.

112
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,450
- Nice to meet you.
- I hope we'll get along.

113
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,552
Nice to meet you. I'm Tomoaki.

114
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,987
Oh, thank you.

115
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:58,157
Tomoaki, I hope we'll get along.
I'm Hiroya.

116
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,293
- Oh, let's get along.
- Yes, let's get along.

117
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,463
- Glad to have you back.
- I want to catch up… Something's wrong.

118
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,432
- I want to hear about your trip.
- Huwei went away.

119
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,634
- He left today.
- He left?

120
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,703
- We traded him for you.
- He has a ceremony.

121
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,071
His entrance ceremony?

122
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,907
Too bad. So it's nine of us.

123
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,811
I'm curious what Huwei has
been up to this past week.

124
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,380
Huwei and Bomi.

125
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,549
I could ask Bomi about it. Hmm.

126
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:26,419
I'd also like to talk with Taeheon,
of course.

127
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,156
Taeheon is really quite handsome,
isn't he? Hmm.

128
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,158
He really is on another level.

129
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,860
<i>In terms of looks, too.</i>

130
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,663
Taeheon's looks are definitely
the type I like. Hmm.

131
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,302
- It's been a while.
- Yeah.

132
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:46,072
If it's a coffee truck day,
I wonder if I could be on shift.

133
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,039
I think so.

134
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,575
So today,
I have something to ask all of you.

135
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:52,412
- What? Hold on.
- Well, it's more a request.

136
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:53,346
What is it?

137
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,548
During my time here in the Green Room,

138
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,618
I've been sharing with some of you
how I've been reflecting

139
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,821
on my 15-year relationship with my ex.

140
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,590
And I've been making time
for that here and there.

141
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,460
But since I really enjoy
spending time with all of you,

142
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:11,030
I haven't been able to take
any real time to think by myself.

143
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,667
So today, I would really like
to step out of the Green Room

144
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,702
and take some time to think.

145
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:20,039
That's why, I want to ask you all
to handle the coffee truck

146
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,542
and everything
in the Green Room without me.

147
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,643
Is that okay?

148
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,378
- That's a wonderful idea.
- Yeah.

149
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,013
- It's important.
- Mmm.

150
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,315
- Thank you.
- Taking that time is important.

151
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,451
- Have a good time.
- I'll be going.

152
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:32,785
- Thank you.
- Take care.

153
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,053
- I will.
- Bye.

154
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,621
He wants to focus on this.

155
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,691
I'm really curious about
his reflections on the 15 years.

156
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:42,195
- I have something to share.
- What?

157
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,229
Well, nobody worry.

158
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,598
- It's not as big a deal.
- You scared me.

159
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:49,302
I won't be able to join the
coffee truck thing today because of work.

160
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:52,839
But I promise I'll be cheering
you on from the sidelines.

161
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,574
- Cheering us on.
- Good luck.

162
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,109
- Good luck.
- I'm rooting for you.

163
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,213
See you later.

164
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,482
- You've got this.
- Good luck with work.

165
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,852
We're a smaller group now.

166
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,061
"Here's the person
on duty for today's shift."

167
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:18,164
"For today's work shift,
Ryuki will be on duty."

168
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,599
Ryuki, huh?

169
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:24,704
"Ryuki, please choose one person
you want to work with."

170
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,515
- <i>Oh!</i>
- <i>Jobu.</i>

171
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:36,716
<i>Seriously?</i>

172
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:38,718
Let's work together.

173
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:41,487
- Have a good time.
- I know it'll be fun.

174
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,056
- Okay, let's!
- Let's go!

175
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,835
AKAN CRANE'S TERRACE ROADSIDE STATION

176
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,175
Look, it's the same color.
Not quite, but close enough, right?

177
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,343
It's really close.

178
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,445
Would you like some hot coffee?

179
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,615
- We also have chocolate milk.
- We have sweet drinks, too.

180
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:10,883
- Really?
- Yes.

181
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,652
- It comes off.
- Are you from Osaka?

182
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,854
- That's right.
- We're both from Osaka.

183
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,255
You're very handsome.

184
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,026
Good for you. I'm gonna be jealous.

185
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,061
- He's a cool guy.
- You're both cool.

186
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:25,731
- Oh, good. I'm happy to hear that.
- Seeing a cool guy makes me smile.

187
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,434
I'm happy to hear that. Thank you.

188
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:32,038
- Here's your small cocoa. Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

189
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,173
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

190
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,612
That went well.

191
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,649
Thank goodness,
now we can go home. 3,950 yen!

192
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:13,980
<i>"The day we first met."</i>

193
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,383
"Since our meeting spot
was near his place,

194
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,019
I ended up visiting his house."

195
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,557
<i>"When I arrived, there was</i>
<i>a large black Labrador retriever."</i>

196
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,792
<i>"His name was Jazz."</i>

197
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,662
<i>"He was very friendly and smart."</i>

198
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,099
<i>"Being a dog lover,</i>
<i>I think I was also attracted</i>

199
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:36,435
<i>to the fact that he raised</i>
<i>such a well-behaved dog."</i>

200
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,206
It happened to be his birthday,

201
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:42,241
but I only found out later.

202
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:46,512
When I asked him when his birthday was,
he said, "Actually, it was the other day."

203
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,983
That's why I remember the date.

204
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,719
<i>It feels like he really needs to do this.</i>

205
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:56,722
<i>"After a movie,</i>
<i>when we were sharing our thoughts,</i>

206
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,491
<i>he laughed at me and said,</i>

207
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:01,227
<i>'You were crying so much next</i>
<i>to me that it made me laugh,</i>

208
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:02,795
<i>and I couldn't cry at all.'"</i>

209
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:07,466
<i>"But I told him, 'I can't help it,'</i>
<i>and we laughed together and talked."</i>

210
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:13,673
"This came back to me when Jobu mentioned
watching a movie with his boyfriend."

211
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,174
<i>"I thought to myself,</i>

212
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,310
<i>'I remember watching a movie</i>
<i>with my boyfriend too.'"</i>

213
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:21,747
- <i>He keeps recalling moments.</i>
- <i>He was projecting himself.</i>

214
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,750
<i>"Whenever I went</i>
<i>grocery shopping on my own,</i>

215
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:28,154
<i>I would always consider</i>
<i>whether my boyfriend would eat something</i>

216
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,689
<i>before I purchased it."</i>

217
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,158
<i>"He liked yogurt,</i>
<i>which I usually don't eat,</i>

218
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,794
<i>so I bought it</i>
<i>whenever I found it on sale."</i>

219
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:41,167
When shopping for the Green Room,
we buy a lot of different yogurts.

220
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,569
<i>I don't eat yogurt that much,</i>

221
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,772
<i>but I remembered</i>
<i>that I used to buy it for him.</i>

222
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,741
<i>So, now, when I shop alone,</i>

223
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,677
I'll think, "It's on sale,
I could've bought it for him."

224
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,082
<i>It felt natural to do</i>
<i>that for him back then,</i>

225
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:58,017
<i>but, looking back now,</i>

226
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:01,053
<i>I realize it was actually</i>
<i>a pretty happy time.</i>

227
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,690
I think so. Hmm.

228
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,661
His ex-boyfriend is
in every aspect of his life.

229
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,163
He has memories with him
in all sorts of places.

230
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:15,434
It really shows that everyone uses these
two months differently, in their own way.

231
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,037
He doesn't like yogurt,
but his partner does.

232
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,705
So he buys it when it's on sale.

233
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:24,510
It's like something straight out of one
of those Yuji Sakamoto movies, isn't it?

234
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,278
That's true.

235
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:29,115
B.T.C.
US, JOURNEY, AND COFFEE

236
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:32,952
We've never really had a one-on-one
conversation together,

237
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,154
and I've been wanting to talk to you.

238
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,655
So, that's why I chose you.

239
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:40,092
Well, okay. Didn't you mention
something about coming out?

240
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,393
Yeah, I did.

241
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,462
- Do you think you will?
- I don't know.

242
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,234
I'm scared. I'm really scared.

243
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,870
But why do you want to come out?

244
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,340
I want to be accepted.

245
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,609
Hmm, okay.

246
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:01,113
My mother passed away
when I was in kindergarten.

247
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,515
Oh, really?

248
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,886
So my father's been raising me
all by himself until now.

249
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:07,820
Okay.

250
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:13,192
At first,
he probably couldn't do any housework,

251
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,394
but he worked hard for me.

252
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,030
It's hard to…

253
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:24,770
Hmm.

254
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,375
I mean… I'm about to cry.

255
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,279
Mmm.

256
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,614
Like, if I had had both parents,

257
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:39,151
even if my father didn't accept me…

258
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,620
- Maybe so.
- Maybe my mother would have.

259
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,690
So, I'd still have a family.

260
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,725
But I only have one parent.

261
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:51,163
If he rejects me,
I won't have any family left at all.

262
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,898
I see.

263
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,401
It's difficult.

264
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:59,772
So I don't want to think about it,
to be honest.

265
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,141
A parent isn't a friend.

266
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,043
Mmm.

267
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:07,513
I can't ignore the risk of not being

268
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:12,384
accepted by my father
if I were to tell him.

269
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,622
The thought of that
really makes me want to forget about it.

270
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:25,231
But ever since I realized
I was bound to run into this issue,

271
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:28,267
I haven't been able to stop
thinking about what to do.

272
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,268
Mmm.

273
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,372
You haven't been talking about it
that much, right? Like, with everyone.

274
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,208
- I started to think it was pointless.
- Oh, yeah?

275
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,944
Well, in the end,
it's up to you to decide.

276
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:43,682
If you hear other people's perspectives,
it might change the way you think.

277
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,451
It might help you make up your mind.

278
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:50,356
There are a lot of people in this house
who are in similar situations.

279
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:53,092
That's true. I could ask them.

280
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,494
I was struggling with it personally,

281
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,164
but I hadn't really tried
asking people for advice.

282
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,770
Mmm.

283
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,639
I think it's a really big hurdle

284
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:09,008
for anyone who has
this kind of decision to make.

285
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,511
Coming out as gay to a father
is a much bigger hurdle

286
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,748
than coming out as gay to a mother,
for obvious reasons.

287
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:17,016
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

288
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,352
*it's a really difficult conversation
to have with a parent.

289
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:24,857
But despite his circumstances,
Ryuki still wants to tell his father.

290
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,594
So, he should get advice from others
and listen to their experiences.

291
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,063
- Mmm.
- It won't be a waste of time.

292
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,098
When Jobu asked him,
"Why do you wanna come out?"

293
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:34,066
I think he realized,

294
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:37,269
"Oh, maybe I don't have to
officially come out in the first place."

295
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:41,440
I've always wanted to say
that coming out isn't always needed,

296
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,542
because it isn't always
a good thing to do.

297
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,613
For people who don't want to come out but
who feel like they have to do it anyway,

298
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,281
they might feel relieved to know.

299
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:52,718
- It's totally okay. Yeah.
- Not coming out is completely acceptable.

300
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,619
I agree.

301
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,955
- So now…
- Hiroya finally came back.

302
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,691
That's right.
He was supposed to be gone for two weeks.

303
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,893
He said it might take longer
depending on the situation.

304
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,362
- I didn't know that.
- But he came back in ten days.

305
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,999
- He came back earlier.
- He just said he'd be gone for a while.

306
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,133
- Right.
- Exactly.

307
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,469
But they also have
a limited time in there.

308
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:15,107
A week may seem brief to us, but for them,
this takes away from their time together.

309
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,676
- Time they won't be able to make up.
- You're right.

310
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,546
- But Hiroya must be feeling nervous, too.
- Yeah.

311
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,948
He must be wondering
what happened while he was away.

312
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,317
Yeah, he has no idea that Huwei and Bomi

313
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:29,355
have been slowly but surely getting closer
to one another over these last few days.

314
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,756
- Exactly.
- He has no idea.

315
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,191
He said he could ask Bomi,

316
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:35,094
but I think he might end up
getting his feelings hurt.

317
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,796
Izaya said that William
couldn't sleep last time,

318
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,765
but this time,
they could both sleep soundly.

319
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,967
- That I can believe.
- Has that happened to you?

320
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,504
Have you ever had one of those mornings
when, after some time apart,

321
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,474
you and someone from your past
end up together again?

322
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,576
Mister, you must've had a bunch of those.

323
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:51,877
Well…

324
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:54,480
Now that I think about it,
I actually haven't experienced that.

325
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,915
- Really? You haven't? You never reconnect?
- I mean…

326
00:16:56,982 --> 00:17:01,020
I may have experienced
the same kind of next day morning

327
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:02,654
three years after it happened.

328
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,823
- Oh, wow…
- Thank you, Mister.

329
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,092
- Now we know!
- Thank you for telling the truth.

330
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:10,029
- Yeah, now you know the truth about me.
- Okay, good to know!

331
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,100
The coffee truck team is working.

332
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,436
- And Kazuyuki left on his own?
- He needed space.

333
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,304
Why can't he sleep in the Green Room?

334
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,441
- He just wanted some time alone.
- Mmm.

335
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:25,944
And it's not really in his nature
to stay in his room by himself

336
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,113
when everyone is here.

337
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,316
It's difficult for him,
so he has to force himself to be alone,

338
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,318
- Mmm.
- Or else he can't be.

339
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,888
15 years, huh?

340
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,823
That's something I'm not familiar with.

341
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,325
It's almost as long
as Ryuki's has been alive.

342
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,562
That's right.
They started dating when he was five.

343
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,798
That's nuts,
when you think about it like that.

344
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:47,766
It's hard to last that long.

345
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,269
I'd like to talk with him about this,
just the two of us,

346
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,837
but talking with him is…

347
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:54,573
- Yeah. I get it.
- You know? You get it, right?

348
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,475
- To go out of your way…
- I thought about asking.

349
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,010
But to be honest,

350
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,647
I felt like I wouldn't have been able
to really relate to his story.

351
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,949
I have little experience with love,

352
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,685
and I've never dated
the same person for 15 years.

353
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,021
Well, I did ask him and he said,

354
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:13,058
"Talking with everyone has showed me
that there are many perspectives."

355
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,027
<i>"It's not about how long</i>
<i>you're with someone."</i>

356
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,595
<i>"It can be two, three or 15 years."</i>

357
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:17,696
<i>He's right.</i>

358
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,798
<i>He said, "I'm feeling a lot of things."</i>

359
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,600
- "And it's really helping me."
- Oh.

360
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,035
He said he wanted to talk more.

361
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,805
It must be difficult to talk about that
kind of thing with everyone, right?

362
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,674
- It must be emotional.
- Yeah.

363
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,176
- The group shouldn't be bigger than three.
- You're right.

364
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,812
When we all talk together,
there's one conversation over here,

365
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,180
another over there…

366
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,950
You get upset and say,
"Hey, share that with everyone."

367
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,487
- Tomoaki is starting to fit in.
- He's speaking up.

368
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,088
- Starting to fit in.
- Yeah.

369
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,991
<i>- Huh?</i>
- <i>Is this Omotesando?</i>

370
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,693
<i>Is this where Huwei is?</i>

371
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,496
Today, let's celebrate your enrollment.

372
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,131
CELEBRATING ENROLLMENT WITH FRIENDS

373
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:55,100
- Thank you so much.
- <i>Oh, he's with friends!</i>

374
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,401
Good luck to you.

375
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,636
I'm good at motivating people.

376
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,738
RISAKO FUKAMI, IKUMI OEDA
THAI NATIONAL JUDO TEAM

377
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,607
- It comes down to drive.
- Drive?

378
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:04,109
- Okay, it's about drive.
- Yeah, it all comes down to drive.

379
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,513
- So, what's new with you?
- Mmm.

380
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,947
Well…

381
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,251
I met someone who piqued my interest.

382
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,485
- Ooh!
- What?

383
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,187
Come on, show us.

384
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,323
Come on, I wanna see.

385
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,793
The one in green is Ryuki,
and the one in red is Bomi.

386
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,862
- One of them?
- It's one of them, yeah.

387
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,230
The one in green, then.

388
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,431
Red, the one in red.

389
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,933
- In red! But…
- It's Bomi.

390
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,034
- Bomi.
- Oh, I see.

391
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:32,204
So, why him? What do you like about him?

392
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:36,341
Well, you know,
in fact, before we met here this time…

393
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:37,709
You knew him?

394
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,145
We went out to dinner once last year.

395
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,614
- Oh.
- Did you approach him back then?

396
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,782
Well, he did.

397
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,816
Hmm!

398
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,952
That's such a popular guy thing.

399
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,188
- I'm not popular.
- No, that's seriously amazing.

400
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:50,656
Of course you're popular.

401
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,626
Anyway, after a year,

402
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,029
we met again in the Green Room.

403
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,164
You didn't know
you were going to meet there?

404
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,732
- We found out there.
- That's crazy!

405
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,768
So the minute you saw him,
you were like, "What?"

406
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:06,405
- I'd be like, "This must be destiny."
- I was like, "What are you doing here?"

407
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,807
- Of course you would. You'd think that.
- Of course you would.

408
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,676
You know there are date outings?
A matchmaking…

409
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,945
I was just about to ask
if you went on a date yet.

410
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:16,048
- I've gone on two.
- You've gone on two? Wow!

411
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,652
- He's having fun.
- He has great friends.

412
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,222
- The ladies are excited. That's nice.
- It's nice.

413
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,656
He has fun friends.

414
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:29,261
I told him, "I said before
I was interested in you, but recently,

415
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:33,665
I realized there might be a little
part of me that can say I like you."

416
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,401
If I were Bomi, I'd be happy.

417
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,170
- You'd be happy?
- For sure.

418
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,505
I'd be super excited.

419
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,407
So what are you planning?

420
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,509
- You'll give him the mug and…
- I'm not sure…

421
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:48,480
Once you like someone,
what are you supposed to do after that?

422
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,015
What are the rules?

423
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,685
Once I like someone,
I would get together with them already.

424
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,054
- Okay.
- Your only option is that. Yeah.

425
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,857
- The only one? That's surprising.
- What? Isn't that the case?

426
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,694
It's simple. Are you having
second thoughts about getting together?

427
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:09,101
I mean, I think it's a big commitment
for both of us to take, you know?

428
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:13,805
So I can't help but think
about how much we can

429
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,375
really focus on each other.

430
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:20,145
Yeah, but you can't know
how much you can focus on each other

431
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,647
unless you get together, right?

432
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,348
- Absolutely,
- I guess you're right.

433
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:27,519
So, you should get together
as a means to see

434
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,355
if you two can really talk
things through together.

435
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,557
- Right?
- Oh, okay, I get it.

436
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:37,796
Being apart made me think about him more.

437
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,867
And because I can't see him,
I was reminded of my feelings.

438
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,935
"I really do like this person."

439
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:45,737
Yeah, but…

440
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,240
But it's just like you said.

441
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,976
It might also be an option to go back

442
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:53,412
and just get together for now.

443
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,415
I get that, but I also wanted to see

444
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,718
how much we can talk about things.

445
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:04,489
So, what are his… Bomi's views,
on relationships? What are his…

446
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:08,360
So, apparently,
he's never dated a guy before.

447
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:09,795
- What? Are you sure?
- Yeah.

448
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,998
So I can understand that we might
clash when certain things happen,

449
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:16,735
but since he lacks that experience,
it's like building from scratch.

450
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,170
- That's good.
- But that's fine too.

451
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,906
- Sounds fun.
- You can show him all sorts of fun things.

452
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,507
Setting the standard yourself…

453
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:26,011
That's why you set the standard for him.
You'll be his reference.

454
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,379
- That's intense.
- Right.

455
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,682
- <i>She's so funny!</i>
- <i>Good line. "Set the standard."</i>

456
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,918
Is he the kind of person
you can talk with?

457
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:36,054
- Yeah, I think so.
- Then that's good.

458
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:39,658
If you can talk things out
when problems arise…

459
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:45,330
I mean,
you do realize that all of his firsts…

460
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,967
- Will be yours.
- That's right. Whoa!

461
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,103
Whoo!

462
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,772
- "Will be yours!" Big responsibility.
- Thank you very much, ladies!

463
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,742
- Just go for it, like an <i>o soto gari.</i>
- You want me to flip him over?

464
00:22:56,808 --> 00:23:00,746
- If you hesitate, you always get thrown.
- That's true and you know it!

465
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:04,883
Going for it without hesitation always
leads to the best outcome, right?

466
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,151
Anchor yourself.

467
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,553
- Go for it.
- Anchor yourself.

468
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:12,057
- I'll go for it.
- You'll be a winner for sure.

469
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,559
I love how they talk in judo terms.

470
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,828
- Wow. An <i>o soto gari </i>of romance!
- Yeah.

471
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:26,705
- Oh, that's…
- Oh, stop.

472
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,774
- It's even lit up.
- Yeah, it's lit up.

473
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,808
Who did this?

474
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:34,346
- I thought it'd be lonely without him.
- It can stay until he comes back.

475
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:38,617
- Where is Ryuki?
- Taking a day off because he has school.

476
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:39,851
- I get it.
- I see.

477
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:43,155
Oh! I guess I'll read it.

478
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:45,891
Oh!

479
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,693
"For today's work shift…

480
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:51,830
Izaya will be on duty."

481
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,566
Okay.

482
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:59,204
- Who will he choose?
- I wonder.

483
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:10,782
Let's work together.

484
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:14,519
It's William? Hurry up and go. Go, go.

485
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:15,921
Have a good time.

486
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:29,701
- There are pictures I want to take.
- What kind?

487
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:34,239
I want this half and this half,
so when you put them together…

488
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,441
It'll be one picture. Sounds good.

489
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:39,911
Say cheese.

490
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,183
It's tight.

491
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,486
Three, two,

492
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,187
one.

493
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:53,024
Hello.

494
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,294
- One small café latte…
- A café latte.

495
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:57,729
One small, okay.

496
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,031
- Two small hot chocolate milks.
- Two.

497
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,167
- Wanna go together?
- Mmm.

498
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:03,168
Mmm.

499
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,505
- Sorry.
- Oh, no problem. Thank you.

500
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:09,474
- Take care. Thank you.
- Okay, thank you. Thanks.

501
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,111
- It's cold.
- Yeah.

502
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,951
- No one around.
- Look.

503
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,356
That's cute. I'll take a picture.

504
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,592
- That looks great. Look.
- It looks great.

505
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,394
TODAY'S SALES
4,000 YEN

506
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:32,597
- <i>Oh, they drew a heart.</i>
- <i>They're in a great mood.</i>

507
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:35,267
I'm glad it's the original members.

508
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,168
I know, right? It's been a while.

509
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:38,970
- Memories!
- The good ol' days!

510
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,939
- So, how have you been?
- I've been good.

511
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:43,975
- It really has been a while.
- We have a lot to talk about.

512
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,777
- Yeah. We do.
- Let's talk.

513
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,179
- Let's all talk openly.
- Okay, let's talk.

514
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,115
What should we talk about first?

515
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:52,017
- How about Taeheon?
- Sure.

516
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:55,487
- He's originally our favorite, right?
- Yeah, yeah, he is.

517
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,723
The question is, can your favorite idol
become an actual love interest?

518
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,792
- We're starting there.
- First, yeah.

519
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,127
- Why not?
- Let's.

520
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:03,795
But before we get into that specifically,

521
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,898
I had my own rollercoaster
romance to deal with.

522
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:09,801
I was pursuing romance
in the first half of this experience,

523
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,904
but now, in the second half,
I was supporting everyone here.

524
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:15,807
But just as I was deciding to do that,

525
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,276
two guys showed up.

526
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,679
- Interesting.
- I mentioned this on day one.

527
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:21,980
- Right.
- You did.

528
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,281
- That he's my type.
- True.

529
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,217
- And he shows up.
- I was overwhelmed with happiness.

530
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,720
- I bet you were.
- He really was. He was nervous.

531
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:31,089
- Super nervous, like, "What should I do?"
- Jobu was nervous.

532
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,224
- I wish I could have seen that.
- Yeah.

533
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,427
We ran the coffee truck,
and it was gloomy.

534
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:38,663
- It made me feel down. It wasn't exciting.
- Things don't always work out.

535
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:42,667
I was like, "What do I do?"
Just earlier I was sitting there, right?

536
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:45,971
- You were.
- Then he came and sat behind me.

537
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:49,574
- My guess is he's on a plane.
- Around noon?

538
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,643
I thought Kazu would be back around noon.

539
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,877
- He's not back.
- <i>What?</i>

540
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,080
- <i>What is going on?</i>
- Get in touch?

541
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:56,948
I don't know. I'll try texting him.

542
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:59,884
- After he did that…
- He's so sly.

543
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,586
Naturally, I was like, "Huh?"

544
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:04,723
- It would make anyone go, "Huh?"
- It sure would make me go, "Huh?"

545
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:05,857
I'm overwhelmed.

546
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,426
So stop it! Stop it!

547
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,832
Yeah… I want to run the truck
with him one more time.

548
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:16,768
I think you should. I think you should
show him more of yourself.

549
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,738
- Really? True.
- You should be the one to choose Taeheon.

550
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:23,608
- Choose him and tell him, "I see you."
- I'll tell him, "I'm focused on you now."

551
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,143
- Tell him, "I see you."
- True.

552
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,646
I don't think that part has
gotten across yet, but…

553
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:29,714
Yeah, but there's one thing
you're not considering.

554
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,650
Taeheon chose Huwei
when it was his turn, right?

555
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:35,286
Mm-hm. I thought maybe that was
the type he goes for at first.

556
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,288
And that made me think,
"Maybe I'm not his type."

557
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,557
But he also said he dated
someone shorter than him before.

558
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,359
Yeah, he said that recently.

559
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:43,428
I've dated people of different heights.

560
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,798
- I even dated someone who was 1 meter 62.
- Really?

561
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:48,733
So you're not picky about height?

562
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:52,704
I tend to prefer people
with defined features.

563
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:53,772
Mmm.

564
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,340
Okay.

565
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:58,476
In my heart…

566
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:00,912
- No, I…
- So you thought you had a chance?

567
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:01,980
Well, yeah, I did.

568
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:03,748
He likes people with defined features.

569
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,450
- I definitely qualify.
- You qualify.

570
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:09,154
- I was like, "I fit his checklist."
- Yeah.

571
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,524
Like you said earlier, my short-term goal
is to convey "I see you."

572
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,359
- You need an "I see you" time.
- Yeah.

573
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,595
Yeah. Please, go next.

574
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:20,565
I'm going to tell you everything,
no holding back. Okay?

575
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:21,499
- Sure.
- Wait.

576
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:23,468
- I'll be completely honest.
- Tell us.

577
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:27,672
I sensed that you two were talking
the day we went to Niseko.

578
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,541
- At night.
- Yeah. Well, yeah.

579
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:32,110
And, as you know,
I had feelings for Huwei too.

580
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:33,878
- Mmm.
- I don't know.

581
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:37,282
I mean, Hiroya, you're good-looking too.

582
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:39,417
You never know.
You never know in life.

583
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:41,119
- Right?
- Did you hear that? "Too."

584
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:43,822
- You're good-looking too.
- "I'm good-looking too."

585
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,758
- Wait. I mean…
- "You're good-looking too."

586
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:49,194
- You're good-looking too. You never know.
- You said "too."

587
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,395
- You never know.
- Yeah.

588
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,197
- You never know how people feel.
- Sure.

589
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:55,066
So, after that,
when we came back, I called Huwei.

590
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,801
- Oh, you did?
- And told him.

591
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,704
But all he said was, "I'm happy."

592
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,072
Ah. Hmm.

593
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,441
Then you left, right?

594
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,610
And after that, we went on a date.

595
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,078
Mmm.

596
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:11,182
And now,
he told me that he might like me a little.

597
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,753
- Okay, I see. Okay, okay.
- He said he might like me a little.

598
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:18,256
- Well, it's up to his feelings now.
- You're right.

599
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:21,960
- Yeah, I'm ready whenever he is.
- Yeah, he's kind of hard to read.

600
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:24,696
<i>I know it's really crazy.</i>

601
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:29,267
But you'll never guess
who showed up in my dream last night.

602
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:30,368
Huwei.

603
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,539
We were traveling somewhere,
and we were laughing together.

604
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,443
Mmm. I was really happy.

605
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:41,012
Wow, he showed up in his dream!

606
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:45,450
- It was cold today.
- Yeah, it really was.

607
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:49,320
- This is nice.
- Oh, nice. It was a good idea, right?

608
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,289
A great idea. It's like a good luck charm.

609
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,824
That's <i>what he wanted to do.</i>

610
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:56,227
I'll keep this picture of you,
and you'll keep this one of me.

611
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,862
It looks really great.

612
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,564
<i>That is so sweet.</i>

613
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,268
I know we talked about it a little
during our overnight date,

614
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,036
but what's your take on our future?

615
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:08,540
Are you more anxious
or more excited about it?

616
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,743
Excited, but it's like…

617
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,779
My parents…

618
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:17,415
are strict.

619
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:21,152
I don't think that they imagined
that their son would

620
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,822
turn out to be like this.

621
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,493
So, it won't be easy.

622
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,061
But…

623
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:33,932
with you,
I think I might be able to overcome it.

624
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:34,899
Mmm.

625
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:39,737
I mean, you obviously won't be a woman…

626
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:43,074
like my parents would have expected.

627
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:49,981
Mmm. But I want them to know
that their son is happy

628
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:53,484
and that they can rest easy
about his future.

629
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:58,223
I also want to be able to tell
them how much I care about you.

630
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:05,063
Yeah, I really want to tell them how
much I love you and put them at ease.

631
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,901
- It might not be easy.
- You're right.

632
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,070
But that's…

633
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:15,340
okay.

634
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,344
But even if it's not okay,

635
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,347
I know I'm not alone,
and that's reassuring.

636
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:23,348
Yeah.

637
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:26,684
I know that I have someone by my side

638
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:28,820
who supports me.

639
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:29,721
Mmm.

640
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:31,189
If I'm thrown out, then…

641
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,726
- You'll just have to keep trying, right?
- Yeah.

642
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:38,596
We'll get through this.

643
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,798
I'm sure we can.

644
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,269
<i>I'd be so happy</i>
<i>if someone said that to me.</i>

645
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:45,970
- <i>I know.</i>
- Thanks.

646
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,248
It felt like a long time.

647
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:59,250
It stirred up a lot of emotions.

648
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:03,688
I mean, this was
a whole new experience for me.

649
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:07,759
Focusing on myself
and on the person I like,

650
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,428
all day and every day going forward.

651
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:15,833
So while it seems short-lived
when you measure it in time,

652
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,469
each day was extremely packed.

653
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:22,907
So it felt long, but in a good way. Mmm.

654
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,045
- Mmm.
- Very well said.

655
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,647
I don't think you see many dating shows

656
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,683
where people imagine their future

657
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,985
after they get together
with the person they find.

658
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:36,621
- Getting together is almost like the goal.
- Yeah.

659
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:40,725
I'm very interested in how they'll
nurture their relationship afterwards.

660
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,727
Since he had been
with another guy before,

661
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,696
William had already been concerned

662
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:47,498
about what his parents might think
of this situation.

663
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,467
Well, this is a problem
that everyone faces.

664
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:52,503
Despite the circumstances,
William and Izaya told each other,

665
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,039
"I believe I can overcome
this problem with you."

666
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:58,309
- Being able to do that is truly wonderful.
- That's amazing.

667
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:01,112
- That would make anyone happy.
- It would.

668
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:05,183
Because of those worries, he probably
wanted to hear something reassuring.

669
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:08,486
To feel a sense of certainty
and stability in his life.

670
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:12,357
Meanwhile, Bomi, Jobu, and Hiroya
were catching up with each other,

671
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,325
but I didn't know Taeheon
did such a thing.

672
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:17,228
He's really messing with Jobu.
What's he trying to do?

673
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:21,733
So, Jobu backed off once already, right?
He said he couldn't go for it anymore.

674
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,468
Maybe that made Taeheon feel lonely.

675
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:27,839
Like, "He was approaching me,
but now he's not and it's a bit lonely. "

676
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:29,674
- Such a princess.
- "Don't give up."

677
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,309
- A princess.
- A grand princess.

678
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,877
That's a grand princess thing to do.

679
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:36,014
But it made Jobu's heart flutter.
It made him go, "Huh?"

680
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,584
It made him want to invite Taeheon
to run the coffee truck with him again.

681
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,586
I hope that Taeheon

682
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:45,189
will start to change his
romantic attitude little by little.

683
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,325
- At least for Jobu's sake.
- Yeah.

684
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,061
- Then there were Huwei's wonderful…
- Those two were awesome.

685
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:53,264
- They were awesome. So funny.
- I really liked them. Even a brief scene.

686
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:57,301
They said, if he goes for the <i>o soto gari,</i>
he shouldn't hesitate at all.

687
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,038
- His mentors were just awesome.
- That was such great advice.

688
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:02,673
- Huwei was worried about that? Who knew?
- Yeah.

689
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,911
Because it's Bomi's first time, he didn't
know how things should move forward.

690
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:10,581
We also got to learn something
deep about Huwei, thanks to them.

691
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:12,650
You could tell that
he really trusts his friends.

692
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,986
- He's close to both his mentors.
- For sure.

693
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,723
Those two were great. I'd love
to go to a bar in Ebisu with them.

694
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,660
I wonder if he'll come back today.

695
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,263
- I hope he comes back.
- He's been gone two nights.

696
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:28,266
Seriously.
I didn't think he'd be gone for this long.

697
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,568
- I thought he'd be gone one or two hours.
- So did I.

698
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,470
- Have something hot to drink, and then…
- Oh!

699
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:35,940
- Welcome back!
- Welcome back.

700
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:36,974
I'm back!

701
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,177
Wait! Is that the guy in the picture?

702
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,112
- What?
- The guy in the picture!

703
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,247
It's because everyone missed you so much.

704
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,750
- Oh, you did?
- We ate meals with this picture.

705
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:47,585
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back!

706
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:49,821
- Tell us all about it.
- I'm back.

707
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:52,290
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back, my friend.

708
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,959
- Thank you for giving me so much time.
- So where did you go?

709
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,627
- Thank you.
- Where did you go?

710
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:59,697
- You took time.
- I took time to think.

711
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,834
- Were you able to sort things out?
- To an extent, yes.

712
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,268
- That's good.
- Really?

713
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:08,005
I'll squeeze the rest of my thinking
into the time I have left here.

714
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:09,674
- <i>That's good.</i>
- <i>I'm glad.</i>

715
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,908
That's good.

716
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,378
Hey, it's Huwei!

717
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,747
- Huwei's back!
- Welcome back.

718
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:18,716
- I'm back.
- All ten of us are here.

719
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,419
- You're right.
- Oh, Hiroya's back.

720
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,821
- I'm back. Welcome back.
- Welcome back.

721
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:26,424
- He's really back.
- "I'm back. Welcome back!"

722
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:28,292
- Tell us, how was it?
- Good to be back.

723
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:31,028
- Did you have fun?
- What? Fun? Yeah, it was fun.

724
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:34,298
- You weren't there for fun!
- How was it?

725
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:37,835
Uh, it felt like I was
back in the real world.

726
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,403
You returned to reality?

727
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,773
Yeah, it must feel odd to go
back in the middle of this experience.

728
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,809
When did you come back, Hiroya?

729
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:47,512
- Today's my third day back.
- You came back the day Huwei left.

730
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:50,148
- Apparently, we missed each other.
- You left the same day.

731
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:52,416
Yeah, you really should
work on your timing.

732
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,420
Hey, I feel like we should have a party.

733
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,490
- Let's do it today.
- All ten of us, finally.

734
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,993
- Finally, we're all here.
- Yeah. Let's celebrate!

735
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,063
- Hey, um…
- What is it now? What is it?

736
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:07,632
Well…

737
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,136
I want to share
something important with someone,

738
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:15,873
so is it okay if I go out for a bit today?

739
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,209
Of course.

740
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:20,311
Thank you.

741
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,848
- Let's go.
- Huh?

742
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,149
- Now?
- Yeah.

743
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,518
- Are you coming back tonight?
- Yeah, we'll be back.

744
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,954
- Have a good time.
- See you later.

745
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,889
- See you.
- Go have fun.

746
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:34,692
- People are leaving again.
- We can't keep together.

747
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,128
- We really can't.
- We finally got all of us together.

748
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,396
You're leaving? No!

749
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:40,198
It happens when you have ten people.

750
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:42,300
Will seemed surprised when Izaya told him.

751
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,903
- He probably didn't know.
- Will didn't seem to know either.

752
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,407
Are you using the pot?

753
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,011
Oh.

754
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:56,614
We have to wash it.

755
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,354
- Hey!
- What?

756
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,191
Hey, did your thighs get bigger?

757
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:08,759
No, they didn't.

758
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:10,194
Maybe it's just me.

759
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,931
- Did you have fun?
- I did.

760
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:16,567
- Really? Did you see your mom?
- I did.

761
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,872
How long were you there?

762
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:25,876
Hmm. About two days. Why do you ask?

763
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,913
- I thought it was a short trip.
- Ah.

764
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,115
I made it short.

765
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:34,051
You came back early? You came back
to see me? You came back to see me?

766
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:35,987
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

767
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:40,157
- Oh! Oh, wow, oh, wow, oh, wow!
- Wait a minute!

768
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,827
- This is verbal expression, isn't it?
- Yeah.

769
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:46,597
- It's sunny today. Yeah.
- It's super sunny.

770
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:49,734
I'm surprised we're back
here at Lake Mashu again.

771
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,701
Yeah, surprise.

772
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,603
<i>The weather was terrible last time.</i>

773
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,473
- Wow, it's so beautiful.
- It really is.

774
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,243
- A lake that's not frozen.
- Totally different from last time.

775
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:00,711
Crazy.

776
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,513
Totally different from the first time.

777
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,449
- There was no visibility, remember?
- We couldn't see anything.

778
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:10,154
- Look, way back there.
- Amazing.

779
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,823
- And the lake is super blue.
- It's super clear.

780
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:13,858
Yeah.

781
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,160
LAKE MASHU

782
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:18,029
- So, today…
- We finally made it. Yeah.

783
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:21,632
I wanted to share this view with you.

784
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,101
It came as a surprise.

785
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:27,338
- Did I surprise you?
- Yeah. But I'm glad you did.

786
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:30,174
This is the shot from
the opening sequence.

787
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:31,842
- I thought so!
- Right!

788
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:34,512
- You're amazing. Well spotted!
- Oh, it's those two!

789
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:38,182
It's the scene that plays when
the tune goes "da-da, da-da-da."

790
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,486
It's been about a month and a half now,

791
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,857
since we moved into
the Green Room all together.

792
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:51,896
Even now, I still remember
the first day very vividly.

793
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,965
<i>Who would've thought, right?</i>

794
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:56,167
<i>Yeah.</i>

795
00:38:56,233 --> 00:39:00,137
<i>I never thought that</i>
<i>the person I liked three years ago</i>

796
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:03,341
<i>would show up here, in this experience.</i>

797
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:07,011
At first,
I regretted my decision to come here.

798
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:10,514
But, little by little, the more I discover

799
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:15,686
the different sides of you
I hadn't seen three years ago,

800
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:19,623
the more attracted I became
to the person you are today.

801
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:25,496
Also, my feelings for you
gradually grew stronger,

802
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:29,166
and the stronger my feelings grow
for someone,

803
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:32,970
the more I tend to lose sight of things

804
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,272
happening around me.

805
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,908
I'm sorry, but it's just the way I am.

806
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:43,881
I decided that, even if
my feelings were never met,

807
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:47,718
I'd still give it a shot
so I wouldn't have any regrets.

808
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:53,224
I would accept whatever would happen,
whatever the outcome would be.

809
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:57,795
After making that decision,
I was able to focus on you,

810
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:01,866
and only you,
and I let you know how I felt.

811
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,508
In the first weeks,
there were a lot of issues,

812
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,210
<i>or incidents that arose.</i>

813
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:19,550
<i>But when I told you how I felt</i>
<i>about all these incidents, calmly,</i>

814
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:23,120
<i>you told me exactly</i>
<i>what was going on, honestly.</i>

815
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:28,392
I truly believe that conversation is
what created this bond we have today.

816
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:29,994
Hmm.

817
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:34,765
Coincidentally, the moment I saw you cry,

818
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:39,069
I realized, without you saying anything,

819
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:42,506
<i>that you had gone through</i>
<i>painful experiences</i>

820
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:43,908
<i>and that you had been hurt.</i>

821
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,678
<i>From that moment on,</i>

822
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:51,348
I wanted to be by your side,

823
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:55,286
supporting you every day.

824
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,188
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

825
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,026
I believe it really was fate

826
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,529
that led me to find you here.

827
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,097
Mmm.

828
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:11,602
Thank you for meeting me again here.

829
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:16,474
Thank you as well.

830
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:20,344
I do think it was fate that we met again.

831
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:26,484
So, now, I want to leave.

832
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:29,920
I want to leave this place.

833
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:33,591
I want to move our story
to the next level.

834
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:36,694
That's why,

835
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:38,729
today,

836
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:43,968
I really want to leave
the Green Room with you.

837
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:48,906
Mmm.

838
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,041
Mm-hm.

839
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:53,878
Mmm.

840
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:55,379
Mmm.

841
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:58,449
Mmm.

842
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,756
- We're leaving together today.
- That's right.

843
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:07,591
- Oh, wow.
- Are you ready?

844
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:09,093
- I am.
- You are?

845
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,861
I'm more excited about
what comes after here.

846
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:11,996
So am I.

847
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:14,532
- I'm not worried at all.
- I'm glad you feel that way.

848
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:17,835
<i>I'll be waiting for</i>

849
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:19,970
<i>I'll be waiting for you </i>

850
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,405
<i>Now hold my hand </i>

851
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:24,241
- Thanks. Thank you.
- No, I should be thanking you.

852
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:30,114
<i>I hear your voice</i>
<i>In the most quiet song</i>

853
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,016
<i>Fading like…</i>

854
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:33,317
I'm glad we met again.

855
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,885
- Really?
- It's fate.

856
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:37,655
- It's fate.
<i>- I'll be waiting for</i>

857
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,090
<i>I'll be waiting for you</i>

858
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:41,959
<i>- Now hold my hand</i>
- I finally got to say it.

859
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:43,894
<i>I promise that</i>

860
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:48,499
<i>With love</i>

861
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:53,170
<i>I can change the sky above</i>

862
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:58,075
<i>And rise a little higher </i>

863
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:03,414
The thing I'm looking for in life

864
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:05,482
is someone to love.

865
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:09,720
No matter what, Izaya,
you've always been here for me.

866
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:13,157
And when I feel that, I realize
that I'm really loved by someone.

867
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:18,362
So when we leave, I hope
we can say those words to each other

868
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,464
and know how powerful they are.

869
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:21,498
I hope so too.

870
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:24,234
- Let's nurture this bond together.
- Mmm.

871
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:27,871
<i>Wish for a miracle</i>

872
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:31,775
<i>Wish for a miracle</i>
<i>When the flowers bloom </i>

873
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:35,746
<i>And you'll be by my side </i>

874
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:43,954
- Oh!
- Oh, look who it is.

875
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:45,656
- We're back.
- Welcome back.

876
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:48,559
- Welcome back. That was quick.
- It was quick, right?

877
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,728
There was a view we wanted to see,
so we went there.

878
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,630
- Oh.
- We just went for a bit.

879
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:55,332
- Was it cold? You look warm.
- No, it was really warm out.

880
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:56,700
It was warm. It wasn't cold.

881
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:59,370
- We'll go change.
- See you.

882
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:11,215
- They are taking a long time!
- Yeah, they are.

883
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:14,184
They said they were
changing their clothes.

884
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,854
Well, they're always late, those two.

885
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,522
Will… Will and Iza.

886
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:20,724
Williza is late.

887
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,431
- Huh?
- Huh?

888
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:29,433
What's going on?

889
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,772
Today, the two of us…

890
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:37,441
are leaving the Green Room together.

891
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:39,309
We're leaving.

892
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,418
Today,

893
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:53,057
I told William once again
how I feel about him.

894
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:58,529
Together,
we decided that it was time for us

895
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:01,732
to take our story to the next level.

896
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:07,071
So, we decided to leave
the Green Room today.

897
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:13,410
- It's sad to leave everyone. It really is.
- It's sad.

898
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:20,451
All those evenings we've spent together

899
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:23,654
have become very precious memories to me.

900
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:31,061
So I really want everyone
to enjoy and treasure

901
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:35,632
the time you have left in here.

902
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,768
We'll miss you.

903
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:39,336
Mmm. We'll miss you too.

904
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,310
Thanks, Hiroya.

905
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:50,748
Thank you.

906
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:54,284
This is so sudden. Yeah.

907
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,620
A lot happened, huh?

908
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:01,058
- I'm glad I met you.
- I'm glad I met you too.

909
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:02,960
- Take care.
- Thanks, Huwei.

910
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:04,862
- Take care.
- Yeah.

911
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,164
I wish you all the best in your life here.

912
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:08,265
Thank you.

913
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,568
- Kazuyuki!
- Oh, you're leaving.

914
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:16,039
- Thank you.
- Please, be happy with him.

915
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,008
Good luck.

916
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:21,044
I'll miss you.

917
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,981
- Take care.
- Don't cry.

918
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:26,383
- Let's say goodbye with a smile.
- No, sorry. Okay.

919
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:43,467
No crying. We're gonna
see them off with a smile, 2right?

920
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,436
Watching you cry makes me tear up too.

921
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:47,671
I can't help it.

922
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:51,074
<i>- "Think easy," she said</i>
- Aah!

923
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:54,645
- We're off.
- Safe travels.

924
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:56,980
- We'll see you.
- Good luck.

925
00:46:57,047 --> 00:47:00,250
- Take care.
<i>- "Think easy," she said</i>

926
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:04,688
- Oh no.
<i>- "You're never young if you don't run"</i>

927
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:06,657
<i>"So get over"</i>

928
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:10,160
<i>- We still got walls on both sides</i>
<i>- Sides</i>

929
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:11,628
<i>Maybe</i>

930
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:12,796
<i>I wanna know…</i>

931
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:14,765
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye!

932
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,400
<i>We're blind, blind</i>

933
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:19,269
<i>- How'd we get air all this time?</i>
- Goodbye!

934
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,838
- Take care.
- Bye-bye.

935
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:22,840
I love you!

936
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:25,642
<i>We used to break it together</i>

937
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:27,811
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

938
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:31,782
<i>We used to dive</i>
<i>In our highest feelings</i>

939
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:35,052
<i>Are we growing older together?</i>

940
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:36,753
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

941
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:41,258
<i>I don't wanna miss anything</i>
<i>When I'm dreaming</i>

942
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:44,228
<i>We used to break it together</i>

943
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:46,263
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

944
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,298
<i>We used to dive</i>
<i>In our highest feelings</i>

945
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,700
<i>I know one thing,</i>

946
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:53,937
<i>I'm sure there will be a lot of difficult</i>
<i>and painful things in the future,</i>

947
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:57,808
<i>but I have a lot of confidence now,</i>

948
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:01,144
<i>and I know I can overcome them</i>
<i>with William.</i>

949
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:06,250
<i>I want to always be by his side</i>
<i>as his life partner forever.</i>

950
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,858
<i>I want to always cherish</i>

951
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:18,095
<i>the pure feelings</i>
<i>we felt for each other here.</i>

952
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:21,832
<i>I want to remember them</i>
<i>even if we have problems or fights,</i>

953
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,433
<i>and overcome them together.</i>

954
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,868
<i>That's my goal.</i>

955
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:27,371
<i>In our highest feelings</i>

956
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:30,440
<i>Are we growing older together?</i>

957
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:31,675
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

958
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:36,079
MARCH 21 (ANNIVERSARY)
TENTH COFFEE TRUCK SHIFT

959
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,650
<i>We used to break it together</i>

960
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:41,451
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

961
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:46,223
<i>We used to dive</i>
<i>In our highest feelings</i>

962
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,859
<i>Are we growing older together?</i>

963
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,794
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

964
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:55,632
<i>I don't wanna miss anything</i>
<i>When I'm dreaming about</i>

965
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:58,268
<i>When we were dazed and confused</i>

966
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:04,041
Wow!

967
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,677
- That was so moving! I loved it.
- Congratulations

968
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:07,878
That was a great ending.

969
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,647
The farewell came
so suddenly, don't you think?

970
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:13,016
- William and Izaya got together.
- Yeah.

971
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:17,187
But there really is a kind of love that's
built by exchanging words over and over,

972
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:20,590
even to the point where you would think
it would be more than enough.

973
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:22,426
- Right?
- That's what I thought.

974
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:23,727
When you become an adult,

975
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:27,197
you think you don't have to bother
and show that kind of dedication anymore.

976
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:29,933
You have work and other things
going on in your life.

977
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,569
But because William and Izaya
went through that process,

978
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:36,139
they were able to strip away
all the different things, one by one,

979
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:38,308
and face each other as their true selves.

980
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:41,945
What's really amazing is that it happened
on this show and that we got to see it.

981
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:43,480
- It really is.
- It's amazing.

982
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:46,550
- The scene with Jobu crying really hit me.
- Yeah, it was bittersweet.

983
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:48,685
- So sad. Heartbreaking.
- He was hunched over.

984
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,821
- He kept smiling until they left.
- Poor baby.

985
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:53,824
- He's so sweet. He has such a big heart.
- Then he couldn't hold it and cried.

986
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:56,426
- It's not like he hates him or anything.
- That's right.

987
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,763
He wasn't deeply in love with him,
but he did have feelings for him,

988
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,532
so it's only natural for him
to have mixed feelings.

989
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:04,234
Yeah, that's true.

990
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:07,904
I really felt like they were able
to make friends for life there.

991
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:11,208
In a sense, it feels a little like
the first chapter of this season

992
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:12,642
has just closed here.

993
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:15,345
I think this served
