1
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:12,112
We're home.

2
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,980
- Here we are.
- We're home.

3
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:16,449
I've missed this place. I'm happy.

4
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,684
I'm glad I'm back.

5
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,320
- It already feels like home.
- It's so warm.

6
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:23,056
- It's relaxing. Like being home.
- I'm tired.

7
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:30,263
- Are you tired?
- You look sleepy.

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,165
IT COMPANY SALES WORKER

9
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,868
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

10
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,040
IT COMPANY PROJECT MANAGER

11
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,294
What's wrong?

12
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,796
- Hmm?
- What's wrong?

13
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,199
Nothing. I'm just thinking.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,468
<i>Don't start getting anxious.</i>

15
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:11,304
I wonder if you feel this way
because of the situation we're in.

16
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,606
- Hmm.
- Don't you wonder?

17
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:17,911
Do you hate me?

18
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,013
- Don't ask that!
- Oh, come on!

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,782
- It's not all or nothing.
- Of course he doesn't hate him.

20
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,087
- Why would I hate you?
- Hmm?

21
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,354
Why would I hate you?

22
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:31,057
Because your eyes look dead.

23
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,327
I mean, after what you said,

24
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,830
of course, I feel anxious.

25
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:42,936
<i>Oh no, it's an anxiety chain reaction.</i>

26
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:49,342
I can't help but think we're heading into
a place where there's nothing I can do.

27
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,111
It's really…

28
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:53,313
Let's talk again later.

29
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,082
- Let me explain properly.
- Hmm.

30
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:21,608
<i>- "Think easy," she said</i>
<i>- She said</i>

31
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,344
<i>"Forever young and so wild"</i>

32
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,413
<i>"Or pull a gun and then fire it"</i>

33
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,817
<i>- "Easy," she said</i>
<i>- She said</i>

34
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:36,823
<i>"You're never young if you don't run</i>
<i>So get over"</i>

35
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,059
<i>- We still got walls on both sides</i>
<i>- Sides</i>

36
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:41,661
<i>Maybe</i>

37
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,497
<i>- I wanna know how to climb</i>
<i>- Climb</i>

38
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:45,932
<i>We're blind, blind</i>

39
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,368
<i>- Blind</i>
<i>- How'd we get air all this time?</i>

40
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,470
<i>- This time</i>
<i>- These things</i>

41
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:53,039
<i>- These things</i>
<i>- I never thought when you were mine</i>

42
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,842
<i>We used to break it together</i>

43
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,810
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

44
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:01,981
<i>We used to dive</i>
<i>In our highest feelings</i>

45
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,984
<i>Are we growing older together?</i>

46
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,953
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

47
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,658
<i>I don't wanna miss anything</i>
<i>When I'm dreaming about</i>

48
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:14,928
<i>When we were dazed and confused</i>

49
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,801
MARKETER, ART DIRECTOR

50
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,970
Look. Lake Akan is so beautiful.

51
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,139
You're right. I kind of wanna skate.

52
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,975
<i>Both guys who had their hearts broken.</i>

53
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,743
<i>Oh, you're right.</i>

54
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,780
This is nice.
I think I'll just sleep here.

55
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,348
Just take in the sun.

56
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,518
- That night, I talked with Huwei.
- Yeah, I noticed.

57
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,054
And I asked him
the same way you asked Will.

58
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,889
"Are you interested in me in that way?"

59
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,524
- "Yes or no?"
- You said that?

60
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:48,895
But, in fact, I asked him,
thinking that he'd say he didn't know.

61
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:52,865
But then, surprisingly,
he very clearly said,

62
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,834
"I'm not romantically interested
in you."

63
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,536
- Oh!
- He said no.

64
00:03:56,603 --> 00:04:00,840
- That's harsh. We're in the same boat.
- I realized how similar we are right now.

65
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,576
If we're being honest,

66
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:07,680
there's a part of us that thinks
there's still a 0.2% chance, right?

67
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,650
I really understand
where you're coming from.

68
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,053
- Maybe 0.02%?
- More like 0.01.

69
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,923
- 0.01? That's like my eyesight.
- Mmm. That's bad!

70
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,893
Our chances are as good as my eyesight.

71
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,397
If things finally work out
between Izaya and Will,

72
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,432
it'll make it easier for you to let go.

73
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,067
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

74
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:31,738
I thought things did work out
between them during the trip.

75
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,073
- They were smiling so much.
- I think they're a done deal.

76
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,075
But today, it didn't seem like the case.

77
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,478
What do you think we should do next?

78
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:41,347
Good question. What shall we do?

79
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,783
I think I'm gonna take
a little break for a while.

80
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,487
Sounds good.
Maybe I'll take a little break too.

81
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,323
- Everyone's having a hard time.
- Yeah.

82
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,731
That's right,
are we going to make a new menu?

83
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,533
Yeah, some items need to be taken off.

84
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,169
We don't need the whipped
cream option either, do we?

85
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,872
- We don't. No one buys it anyway, right?
- Yeah.

86
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,007
- No one will buy it now
- I forgot it existed.

87
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:11,077
- Everyone forgot about it.
- Whipped cream. Who suggested that?

88
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,247
- What are you doing?
- Updating the menu.

89
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:19,052
Izaya, can I talk to you for a second?

90
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,119
Yeah.

91
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,556
Apple juice.

92
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:46,813
The reason I asked you out today
is because, on the bus the other day,

93
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:49,749
we didn't finish our talk,

94
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,952
and I realized I wasn't able
to explain myself properly.

95
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,224
I really couldn't understand why

96
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:02,962
you were being so negative
and suspicious of me.

97
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,632
That really bothered me a lot.

98
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,004
I felt like I'd been pushed
off from a rooftop.

99
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:18,778
Well… It's not that my feelings for you
are wavering

100
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,948
or that I'm having second thoughts.

101
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,016
It's just that…

102
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:29,188
because of what happened in my past,
I'm more guarded than most,

103
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:32,191
and I can't help but find
it hard to trust people.

104
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,361
I was afraid things could end
once we leave this place,

105
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,031
and that's why I told you
all those negative things.

106
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,569
However, the way you look at me

107
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:46,239
and constantly reassure me,

108
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,307
tell me that you're not lying,

109
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,477
that much I know is true, I really do.

110
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:56,616
But there's also a part of me
that doesn't want to get hurt again.

111
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,085
That's why I think

112
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:05,224
it's almost become second nature for me
to stop myself from falling in love.

113
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,928
I'm sorry for making you feel anxious.

114
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,830
Thanks.

115
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,566
One thing you need to know.

116
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,271
I'm very happy
you decided to tell me this.

117
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,841
But there's one thing
I want you to promise me.

118
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,578
We both know that people

119
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,880
will always be flawed,

120
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:33,119
and there will certainly be times
when we both have negative thoughts.

121
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,489
So, if one day,
you start to feel that way,

122
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:39,192
I don't want you to worry by yourself,

123
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:43,396
think you're alone,
or come to some conclusion on your own.

124
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:49,869
I want to be with you when you're worried
and help you figure things out.

125
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:55,875
That's why if one day,
in our future, you feel that way…

126
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,545
I want you to talk to me right away.

127
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:04,617
In my opinion,
that's what it means to be partners.

128
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,224
No one's ever said that to me before.

129
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,932
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

130
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,412
Thank you. For the first time,

131
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,382
you've really made me feel
like I'm not alone.

132
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:43,623
You're not alone.

133
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,994
<i>The road is winding</i>

134
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,231
- Thank you.
<i>- It always leads me back</i>…

135
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,432
I'm here.

136
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:56,702
Thank you.

137
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,105
I'll never forget these words.

138
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:05,378
- You need to know, I feel the same way.
<i>- I'm done with the cold</i>

139
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,816
<i>I can see the sunlight…</i>

140
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,884
- Thanks.
- Don't cry.

141
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,656
If you cry, you're gonna make me cry too.

142
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,192
Mmm. Mmm.

143
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:26,632
<i>I'm coming home to you</i>

144
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,635
<i>To settle me down</i>

145
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,577
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

146
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:44,150
<i>I wanna stick around</i>

147
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,718
Give me a hug.

148
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:50,856
<i>And I don't wanna let you go</i>

149
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:56,228
<i>You're all I got</i>

150
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:02,301
<i>We would have found a home </i>

151
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,705
<i>You're my courage, you're my soul</i>

152
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,440
- Aah.
- Are you okay?

153
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,644
You know, I feel very relieved too.

154
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:19,785
<i>And I'm coming home</i>

155
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,455
- Thank you.
- No, I should be thanking you.

156
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,891
I'm glad we got to talk today.
I'll never forget it.

157
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,927
Neither will I. I won't forget any of it.

158
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,795
<i>To you</i>

159
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,801
YOSHIMI, CHIAKI, MEGUMI, THELMA, DURIAN

160
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:37,870
- That was great.
- That was amazing.

161
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:41,173
- Wasn't it the best speech you ever heard?
- That was an amazing speech.

162
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,943
- It really struck a chord in him.
- Yes, that's it, it struck a chord.

163
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,978
It really pulled at his heartstrings.

164
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:49,148
You know, there's this weakness
that William has…

165
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,451
because he's handsome and
it's easy to make assumptions about him.

166
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,754
- "He must be a player, must be popular."
- Exactly.

167
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,790
And I'm sure that was probably
true when he was young.

168
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,526
He's probably lived his life like that
for a while,

169
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:03,663
meeting a lot of people in bars
and through apps as well.

170
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:06,232
But he actually has very deep scars,

171
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:10,403
and he probably doesn't have a safe space
where he can talk about them.

172
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,773
I think it's probably the first time
he's ever said those things

173
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,208
to someone he's about
to start a relationship with.

174
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,978
He really showed
the deepest parts of his heart,

175
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:22,782
and he's probably very relieved
to be accepted for who he is.

176
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:26,619
It's really all about having
an emotional connection first, right?

177
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,654
And then he said,
"I want you to promise me."

178
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,356
- Unexpectedly moving.
- Incredible.

179
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,658
- So very powerful.
- A great, uplifting speech.

180
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,360
He said, "Don't worry about it alone."

181
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,929
"I want someone
to whisper those words to me."

182
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:40,266
- "It's the only thing I long to hear…"
- "…tonight before you go away."

183
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:44,570
Feels weird we're only seven.

184
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,106
- It's like something's missing.
- The group feels smaller.

185
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,775
- Ryuki's sick today.
- He's got a fever.

186
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,613
Hmm!

187
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,184
"Today's shift leader will
be on a volunteer basis."

188
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,686
- Ooh!
- Hmm.

189
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:04,323
"If more than one person volunteers,
talk it over to decide the shift leader."

190
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,224
Talk it over?

191
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,993
"Who will then choose
one person to work with."

192
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:12,031
Okay, so who wants to be the leader today?

193
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:15,167
- Hmm, I want to think about it.
- Yeah, let's take a minute.

194
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,636
I wouldn't mind taking the lead.

195
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,905
- As leader?
- Are you sure? Anyone else?

196
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,441
- Me.
- I'm good not going.

197
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,877
- But we have to talk about it.
- That's right.

198
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,446
I'd like to go, but if there's
someone who really wants to go…

199
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:30,149
Hmm, yeah. Fine, that was good.
I feel that way too.

200
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,718
- Hiroya volunteered first. He should go.
- True.

201
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,887
- Yeah, that's true.
- Yeah.

202
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,222
- That's true.
- Is that okay?

203
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,590
I think it's totally fine.

204
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,292
Okay. I'll go, then.

205
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:41,794
Go for it.

206
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,902
Sorry. I bumped into you. Sorry.

207
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,037
<i>What's Hiroya up to?</i>

208
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,840
- <i>Who will he choose?</i>
- <i>Who's he gonna choose?</i>

209
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,718
<i>Oh, he chose Huwei?</i>

210
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,754
- Will you work with me?
- Yes, with pleasure.

211
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,727
Have fun.

212
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:16,929
Yeah, we will.

213
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,704
What should I do now?

214
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,774
- Is he going into overtime?
- Getting alone time with him.

215
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,976
- Wait a minute.
- Is he trying to run the clock?

216
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,445
- We have to wonder why he chose him.
- Yeah.

217
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,782
<i>I always try to be better</i>

218
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:41,754
<i>But some days, I feel like</i>
<i>I change just like the weather</i>

219
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,057
<i>I know it's me and I care</i>

220
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:49,995
<i>Saw a part of my soul</i>
<i>That you hoped you'd never </i>

221
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,935
Wow, do you think we can get on that?

222
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,337
Who knew we'd end up going to Abashiri?

223
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:02,007
- Wow, cool.
- Don't you want to get on board?

224
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,542
I always wanted to go on one.

225
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,778
- Or rather, to see the drift ice.
- Same for me.

226
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,214
- I'm happy.
- I'm from Hokkaido.

227
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,916
But I've never been
here before in my life. Is that drift ice?

228
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,185
<i>Wow, I've never seen that before.</i>

229
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,887
- There you go.
- Thank you.

230
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,125
- Okay, perfect.
- Where should we stand?

231
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,262
- Let's take a picture with the ice.
- With the ice in the background?

232
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:25,965
Three, two, one.

233
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,534
Let's do this.

234
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,704
- Would you like some coffee?
- Oh, would you like some coffee?

235
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,073
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Yes.

236
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,009
One small Americano.
It's hot, so be very careful.

237
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,377
Thank you very much.

238
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,814
- Where are you originally from?
- Oh, I'm just from around here.

239
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,815
- Oh, okay.
- Yes.

240
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,618
- It's a feather!
- I wanted to try it today.

241
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,152
Wow, you really are amazing.

242
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,421
- Thank you! Nice to meet you.
- Thank you!

243
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,123
- Nice to meet you.
- Enjoy.

244
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,627
Big cleaning day, huh?

245
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,006
How have you been doing lately?

246
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:13,779
Lately, I've been going through
a whole bunch of different emotions.

247
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,681
Have you sorted things out?

248
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,050
I'd say things…

249
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,519
- Are moving in the right direction?
- They are.

250
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:24,323
It didn't turn out exactly as I thought,
but in the end, it was good.

251
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,791
That's all that matters.

252
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:27,559
What about you?

253
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,095
Me? Well…

254
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,232
- I don't know what to do.
- Hmm?

255
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,435
- I don't wanna get in the way here.
- Mmm.

256
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:39,305
So, I don't know what to do.

257
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,050
- Your sighs are contagious.
- Sorry.

258
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,420
I can't help sighing.
My happiness is leaking.

259
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,795
I really like the relationship
I have with William now.

260
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:06,799
I really do think I'm becoming
a good friend for him here.

261
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:10,135
But the problem is
I still have feelings for him.

262
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:15,140
And if I tell him I still have feelings
for him, that'll ruin our friendship.

263
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,109
It would just destroy it right away.

264
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:21,080
So it's true,
I really don't know what to do.

265
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,183
Did I just get too loud?

266
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,953
- It's moving.
- It's here.

267
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,990
I'm really excited
to go see the drift ice.

268
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,025
I've always wanted to see it too.

269
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,060
- My dream's finally coming true.
- Yeah.

270
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,029
It's a bit exaggerated to call it a dream.

271
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,798
- It was on my bucket list.
- It's more like a wish.

272
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:40,966
- Honestly.
- Really?

273
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,468
- Yeah, really.
- Yeah, me too.

274
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,073
- Are you cold? Need a blanket?
- I'm totally fine.

275
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,676
- Don't worry, I'm fine.
- Okay. Don't get seasick.

276
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,346
- Do you get seasick?
- No, not at all.

277
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:55,781
- Good.
- I actually like it.

278
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,317
- You like being seasick? You're nuts.
- Or should I say…

279
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,888
- Liking to be seasick is nuts.
- I kind of like the rocking.

280
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,523
Here we go!

281
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,926
- <i>Look how beautiful that is. Wow!</i>
- <i>What a breathtaking view.</i>

282
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,428
- They're huge.
- <i>Wow.</i>

283
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,930
The blue of the drift ice is so beautiful.

284
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:14,666
Wow, it really is blue.
It's because of the ocean.

285
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,669
That's how it gets
that beautiful shade of blue, right?

286
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,905
- Yeah. Whoa!
- Yeah. Oh!

287
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,507
- A seagull.
- A seagull!

288
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,977
- So this whole area is frozen, right?
- That's right.

289
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,980
- The whole horizon is frozen.
- Yeah.

290
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,316
I'm really moved by seeing this.

291
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,088
Nice.

292
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:39,358
- Really nice photo. Looks great.
- Yeah. Looks great.

293
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,928
- Wow, this is so impressive.
- Yeah.

294
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:46,265
I have to thank everyone for
giving me the chance to come here today.

295
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,500
I might never get another
chance to come here again.

296
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,568
Yeah.

297
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:58,644
The main reason
I chose you to work with me today

298
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:02,181
is because I wanted
to tell you something first.

299
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,515
Hmm?

300
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,219
I'm going to leave
the Green Room for a while.

301
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,589
I'll be leaving the day after tomorrow.

302
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,958
- For real?
- Yeah.

303
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,227
Are you coming back?

304
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:18,564
I'll be back,
but I'll have to be away for a while.

305
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:21,200
- For how long?
- A pretty long time.

306
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,001
- <i>A long time?</i>
- <i>A while?</i>

307
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,903
You know, we'll miss you.

308
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,105
You'll miss me?

309
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:31,110
Yeah. Well, anyway, I had a lot of fun,

310
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,680
focusing on you during
the first half of this experience.

311
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:40,519
Despite my efforts, I know this has
only been one-sided on my part,

312
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,922
but I'm still glad I was able
to get to know you, yeah.

313
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:47,826
I'm grateful, and this has turned
into a really great memory.

314
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,699
<i>He laughed really hard</i>
<i>at all my silly jokes.</i>

315
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,070
<i>And he very kindly wrapped a blanket</i>
<i>around me when I was cold.</i>

316
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,740
<i>It really made me happy</i>
<i>that he did those things for me</i>

317
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,277
after having such a serious conversation
with him at the bar.

318
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:09,381
It could have gotten awkward
for some people,

319
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:13,385
but I really appreciate the fact
that Huwei did those things for me.

320
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,386
Mmm.

321
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:59,531
COULD WE TALK DOWNSTAIRS
FOR A BIT RIGHT NOW?

322
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,546
- Sorry for the sudden request.
- What's up?

323
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:18,550
I was wondering…

324
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,852
It's been a month
since we've been here, right?

325
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,121
- Yeah.
- We even visited Niseko.

326
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,490
I don't know.

327
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:30,395
I thought I had expressed myself
to you in my own way.

328
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:35,667
- My bad if I didn't come across clearly.
- It did come across.

329
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,868
- It did?
- Yeah.

330
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:38,437
So, what are your feelings now?

331
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:42,140
I was wondering
how you're feeling right now.

332
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,977
- Can I be honest?
- Please, go ahead.

333
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,616
Remember the very first time
we went out for a meal?

334
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,717
Mmm.

335
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:55,754
Since then, my impression of you
gradually changed.

336
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,457
And… looking at you,
I see how cute you are.

337
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,425
- Really?
- But…

338
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:01,393
Hmm.

339
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:03,195
Well…

340
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:08,066
The thing is, I'm not really sure
if I'm interested in you in that way

341
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,402
or even if I have feelings for you.

342
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,070
That's how I feel right now.

343
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:13,605
I see.

344
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:16,842
Hmm.

345
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:20,779
That night in Niseko, we were sitting
next to each other on the couch.

346
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,481
<i>- And you were on your phone.</i>
- <i>Hmm.</i>

347
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:25,651
<i>I caught a glimpse of your phone</i>
<i>and saw your chat with Hiroya.</i>

348
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:29,388
<i>I thought, "Oh, there's something</i>
<i>going on between the two of them."</i>

349
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:35,694
My feelings increased even more,
and I kind of got anxious.

350
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,329
So, I was wondering…

351
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:43,135
This is really embarrassing, but I was
thinking, "What if Huwei goes for Hiroya?"

352
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,305
Because I really don't want to lose you.

353
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,981
I wanted you to know I have feelings…

354
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,552
for you, Hu-chan.

355
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:02,888
I'm serious about them.

356
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:13,031
- Maybe you could say something?
- Like what?

357
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,200
- I'm kind of at a loss for words.
- What, really?

358
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,840
- My feelings are a bit…
- You're not sure?

359
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,410
Well… I feel like I know.

360
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,879
- Okay…
- But I don't. I don't really know.

361
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:31,483
I don't, uh… I'm not sure.

362
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:38,690
Okay. I just wanted
to let you know how I felt.

363
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,425
- Okay, thanks for telling me.
- Sure.

364
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:41,560
I'm not…

365
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:46,331
expecting an answer right away.

366
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:48,967
We still have time.

367
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:55,006
One more thing. I have this glass bead.

368
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,208
Hmm.

369
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,643
I wanted to give this to you.

370
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,546
- That's so cute.
- You like baby birds, right?

371
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,915
- Wow, it's so cute.
- I thought I'd give this to you.

372
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,752
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- <i>I made it with you in mind.</i>

373
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,720
- <i>What, really? Thanks.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

374
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,322
It's super cute.

375
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,792
Since you read a lot of books,
I decided to make a bookmark.

376
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,198
- Oh no, right now, I feel so…
- What?

377
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,435
I think I'm really happy.

378
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,807
You never expressed yourself
this clearly to me before.

379
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,709
But…

380
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,712
This is a first for me too.
I'm a little nervous.

381
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,051
I want to focus on you.

382
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,589
Only you… much more.

383
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,097
I can't find the words.

384
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:55,667
What do I do? What do I do?

385
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,406
I should go.

386
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,113
- Oh!
- Goodnight.

387
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,481
- Goodnight.
- Yeah.

388
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,394
Aah…

389
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,034
- <i>I can relate.</i>
- <i>Nice.</i>

390
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,603
- Great! That was great.
- Well played.

391
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,639
- Bomi is great!
- It was great. It was a textbook example.

392
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:36,641
- It was, sensei.
- Of simple seduction.

393
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,743
And the key is to leave the room first.

394
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,912
- It's not easy, trust me.
- Get the upper hand.

395
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,648
- That's smart.
- Clumsy people don't know when to leave.

396
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:46,084
- They don't.
- Then it gets terribly awkward.

397
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,520
- That's awful!
- I wonder what made him do that?

398
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:50,355
It feels like he's checking on him.

399
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:53,525
- This is Bomi's first time dating guys…
- It's his first time.

400
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:57,062
- He was nervous expressing his feelings.
- It must really be in his nature.

401
00:24:57,128 --> 00:25:00,265
He went to his room and kicked his legs.
Another ten points for that.

402
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,335
He really wasn't as calm as he seemed.
You can see how excited and happy he is.

403
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,003
Yeah, he's so happy!

404
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,976
- We're all in jeans.
- Oh yeah, how funny.

405
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,078
- So many jeans.
- Wow.

406
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,013
True.

407
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,848
- It pinged.
- I'll read it.

408
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,083
Go ahead.

409
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,960
"Today's shift leader
will be on a volunteer basis."

410
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,095
Volunteers again?

411
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,231
"If more than one person volunteers,

412
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:35,400
talk it over to decide
who the shift leader will be,

413
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,036
then let them choose
one person to work with."

414
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,205
I think I want to go today.

415
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:41,840
- Good idea.
- Great.

416
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:44,075
I want to go.

417
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,511
- I want to go.
- You want to go too, right?

418
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:49,014
Well, I want to go, but I went yesterday,

419
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,018
so I think I should let someone else
go and have fun selling coffee today.

420
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,452
Yeah, same here.

421
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:58,857
I've been going through
some personal changes lately,

422
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:01,893
so I think I need to express my feelings.

423
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,966
I want to go now too.

424
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,236
I feel like it might be too late
in three days.

425
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,905
I really feel like I should go
as soon as I can.

426
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,674
I feel that way too.

427
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,244
I haven't been on a date either.
Talking might change something.

428
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,580
- I get that.
- That's how I feel.

429
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,014
- Okay.
- That's valid.

430
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,249
Yeah, it is.

431
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,985
Honestly, how do you feel about this?

432
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:32,357
Honestly… we might not get
an opportunity like this again.

433
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,461
I want to have a deep conversation too.

434
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:43,568
<i>I like it.</i>
<i>Everyone's feelings are getting stronger.</i>

435
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:44,536
<i>Yeah.</i>

436
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,041
- What should we do?
- We can't decide.

437
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,776
So, how do we make a decision?

438
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,312
What if the other four decide?

439
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,580
Eh…

440
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:59,250
Based on what was said,
Jobu sounded quite convincing.

441
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,519
Yeah. I thought so too.

442
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,561
I think all three of you
really want to go,

443
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,830
so it'd be tough to decide
among yourselves.

444
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:14,733
It'd be hard to give up
this opportunity to someone else.

445
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,970
Having someone else judge my feelings,

446
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:23,375
when they don't understand how I feel,
doesn't feel right.

447
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:24,542
That's fair.

448
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:31,282
I think Jobu's feelings are strong,
but mine are strong too.

449
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,752
I don't think mine are weaker.

450
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,288
- <i>Everyone is so strong-willed.</i>
- <i>Yeah, they are.</i>

451
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:38,857
<i>What will they do?</i>

452
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:42,994
Tell us, is the conversation
you want to have today special

453
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,996
compared to the ones you've had before?

454
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:49,367
Until now, I haven't been able
to sort out my feelings.

455
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,569
But now, I've finally
been able to do just that,

456
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,139
so I want to be the one to ask him out.

457
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,275
- I see.
- Yeah.

458
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:02,313
- I'll stay and enjoy the sauna.
- <i>Oh no!</i>

459
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,782
- That's what I'll do.
- <i>Jobu!</i>

460
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,784
- I'll relax today.
- <i>This is so sad!</i>

461
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,018
- Why?
- Sure?

462
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:10,288
Yeah, I'm fine now.
I feel like using the sauna.

463
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,956
- Are you really okay?
- I'm fine.

464
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,592
I'm good.

465
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,066
Do you want to talk it over?

466
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:25,670
I completely understand
how you feel too,

467
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,072
so…

468
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:29,507
I'll step back.

469
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:35,113
Okay, it's decided.

470
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:37,749
Thank you.

471
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:41,019
<i>I suppose asking someone</i>
<i>to work with you is special for everyone.</i>

472
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:44,289
<i>I suppose so.</i>
<i>It's a way of making a statement.</i>

473
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,697
<i>But what could he possibly say?</i>
<i>He's already expressed himself to Izaya.</i>

474
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:54,032
<i>I bet Izaya's nervous.</i>

475
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,334
<i>- "What's he gonna tell me?"</i>
- <i>"What's this about?"</i>

476
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,814
- Let's work together.
- Let's work together.

477
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:13,585
- Shall we?
- Mmm.

478
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,688
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

479
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,922
See you later.

480
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,893
Have fun.

481
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,728
We're leaving.

482
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,835
- Is the banana good?
- Mm-hmm.

483
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,470
- <i>Oh, Jobu…</i>
- I love it.

484
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:36,508
<i>This is so painful.</i>
<i>But I'm sure one day he'll find happiness.</i>

485
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:43,281
<i>I've been trying, I've been trying</i>
<i>I've been trying to change your mind </i>

486
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,717
<i>While I'm fixing mine, yeah, you </i>

487
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,653
<i>You, yeah, you always let me down</i>

488
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,355
<i>You always let me down</i>

489
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:53,892
<i>I've been trying, I've been trying</i>
<i>I've been trying to dry my eyes</i>

490
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,394
<i>While you're wasting time, yeah, you</i>

491
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,197
<i>You, yeah, you always let me down</i>

492
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,366
We haven't run the truck in a while.

493
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:03,134
- Yeah, you're right.
- Yeah.

494
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,336
If you need help, just let me know.

495
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,343
- What?
- It's all twisted.

496
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:16,514
- How did it get like this?
- I just focused on the front.

497
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,019
- Okay.
- Okay.

498
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:24,189
- Hello and welcome.
- Hello.

499
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:25,757
Let me give you a menu.

500
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:30,795
We'll have five hot drip coffees, please.

501
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,430
- Okay. Five.
- Five. Yeah.

502
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,798
Thank you very much.

503
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:36,801
- Sorry.
- Go ahead.

504
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:39,304
- Hmm.
- You need this, right?

505
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,239
I only need the one in the center.

506
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:42,874
Then I'll go to this side.

507
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,083
- Hey, look.
- Wow, that's cool.

508
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,052
- Looks like a flower.
- A flower!

509
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:56,054
- Serve it already!
- <i>It's getting cold!</i>

510
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,656
- <i>They're waiting!</i>
- It's pretty. I'll bring it.

511
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:01,125
- <i>William looks</i>…
- It's getting really sunny.

512
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,827
<i>More so than Izaya.</i>

513
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:06,064
- Sorry for keeping you. Thank you.
- Thanks. Don't worry, it's fine.

514
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,635
- We did it.
- We're finished.

515
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,638
TODAY'S SALES:
7,400 YEN

516
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:21,112
Where are we going now?

517
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,349
- Can you guess where?
- I have no idea.

518
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,220
One day, we were running the coffee truck.

519
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:32,223
<i>- A customer showed us Lake Mashu.</i>
- It's so beautiful.

520
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,726
- <i>I've wanted to visit it since.</i>
- Wow, that's amazing.

521
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,334
- This is…
- It's all foggy.

522
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,473
- <i>Foggy Lake Mashu.</i>
- <i>Oh, Lake Mashu is foggy.</i>

523
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,510
I'm sure it must be beautiful
when the fog…

524
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,446
- When it clears up?
- When it clears up, it must be beautiful.

525
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:58,283
I guess that means we have to come back.

526
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:01,619
- Let's sit down?
- Good idea.

527
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:15,833
You know, this morning, it was a show
of hands… but I really wanted to go.

528
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,834
Mmm.

529
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:20,038
I was hoping we could go together,

530
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:21,773
so I'm glad it worked out.

531
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:22,840
Mmm.

532
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,809
Me too.

533
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:31,649
<i>I think your determination to go</i>
<i>was clear for everyone there.</i>

534
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,685
- <i>Really?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

535
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:37,922
These last couple of days,
I've been able to sort out my feelings,

536
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:42,727
and I'm starting to see
what I'm actually looking for right now.

537
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,296
But I never thought
I'd end up feeling this way.

538
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,767
And what are you feeling?

539
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,073
The thing is, well…

540
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:58,776
when we were all talking together,

541
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:02,113
you mentioned what gift
would make you happy, remember?

542
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,581
Of course I remember.

543
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,017
Yeah, you said, what would make you happy,

544
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,186
<i>more than any memory or present,</i>

545
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:11,122
<i>would be something you could keep,</i>
<i>like a letter.</i>

546
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,191
That's something
that has always stayed with me.

547
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,027
So, in fact, a while ago,

548
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,930
as I was sorting out my feelings…

549
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:20,865
Mmm.

550
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,533
…I wrote you a letter.

551
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,236
- Hey! No way!
- I wrote you an actual letter.

552
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,704
No way!

553
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:28,539
It's embarrassing.

554
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,043
You really did.

555
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:37,915
<i>I wrote it because I've been</i>
<i>wanting to make you happy.</i>

556
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:42,020
<i>No wonder he was so insistent</i>
<i>on running the coffee truck today.</i>

557
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,455
- Can I read it?
- Please do.

558
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:49,660
"Ever since we met again
in the Green Room,

559
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:52,363
I've been searching for
the meaning behind our reunion."

560
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:57,235
"Only now do I finally understand
the reason why."

561
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,004
"Because of my past experience,

562
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:03,408
I've had a hard time trusting people
in my private life."

563
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:07,678
"But you didn't give up, and kept
approaching me with an open heart."

564
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:13,317
<i>"At first, I was very confused</i>
<i>by your sincerity,</i>

565
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,887
<i>and honestly, I had my doubts."</i>

566
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:20,725
<i>"But, on the bus, when I found out</i>

567
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:24,162
<i>that your feelings came</i>
<i>from your past experience,</i>

568
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,198
I finally understood
that you never once lied

569
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:30,001
about any of the feelings
you said you have for me."

570
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:35,039
"My father always supports my mother."

571
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:39,310
"He expresses his love for her,
and makes her smile at all times."

572
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:44,482
"Having grown up watching
my father be that kind of man

573
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:47,585
has given me the ability
to sincerely care about someone."

574
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:48,986
"Ever since I was little,

575
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:52,890
I've dreamed of finding someone
I could cherish with all my heart,

576
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:57,128
who I could stand by and who could
stand by me just like my parents do."

577
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,866
"I believe that,
with your unwavering feelings

578
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,836
and my sincere and wholehearted feelings,

579
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:09,540
this dream we both have, the one
to be happy, can finally come true."

580
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:15,913
"Now, I truly believe
that the reason I came to the Green Room

581
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:19,750
was to once again meet you,
and that this was meant to be."

582
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,290
"I really like you, Izaya."

583
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:33,197
<i>- I believe I fell in love</i>
- I really like you too.

584
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:35,800
<i>With you this summer</i>

585
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,202
- I'm so happy.
<i>- I believe you gave me</i>

586
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,671
<i>Will to change the weather</i>

587
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:43,808
<i>I believe in every little thing</i>…

588
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,810
I really like you now,

589
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:51,048
but very soon, I want to turn
this strong affection I have for you

590
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:52,383
into feelings of love.

591
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,653
<i>You and me causing every pleasure</i>

592
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,688
<i>- I believed</i>
- Thank you.

593
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:00,725
<i>We could live</i>
<i>Through this hell together</i>

594
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:04,462
<i>I believe you'd stay</i>
<i>You'd stay, you'd stay </i>

595
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,397
<i>But still </i>

596
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:10,134
<i>I've been thinkin' about you</i>

597
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:12,069
Finally,

598
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:14,739
our feelings align.

599
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:18,075
- You're right.
<i>- I've been thinkin' about you</i>

600
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:20,945
Thank you.

601
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:22,880
Thank you.

602
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,918
<i>Forever, ever, now</i>

603
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:30,555
<i>Forever, ever now</i>

604
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:33,491
<i>Our time is true </i>

605
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,726
<i>You know it's true</i>

606
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:38,262
<i>Can't slide it through</i>

607
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,698
<i>So hard to move</i>

608
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:43,534
<i>I'm tired of this blue</i>

609
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,636
<i>You know it's true </i>

610
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,040
- We finally did it.
- We finally did it.

611
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:55,746
I think this might be
the happiest time of my life.

612
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:00,885
Thank you.

613
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,056
Does this mean we're…

614
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,225
<i>I do, I do, I do</i>

615
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,693
<i>Forever, ever now </i>

616
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:09,927
…together?

617
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:13,030
Yeah.

618
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,268
- I think so. Yeah.
<i>- I've been thinkin' about you</i>

619
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,370
- Thank you.
- So embarrassing.

620
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:22,873
<i>- I've been thinkin' about you</i>
- Come on.

621
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:25,943
<i>- Forever, ever now</i>
- This is great.

622
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,278
- Let's go.
- Good idea.

623
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:30,147
<i>Forever, ever now</i>

624
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:32,917
<i>- I've been thinkin' about you</i>
- Let's take our time.

625
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:37,722
<i>I've been thinkin' about you</i>

626
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:43,060
<i>I've been thinkin' about you</i>

627
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:47,131
<i>Forever, ever now </i>

628
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:50,868
<i>Forever, ever now</i>

629
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,106
This is just the start.

630
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:56,240
<i>Forever, ever now</i>

631
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,776
Don't worry, I'll make you feel safe.

632
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:00,978
Thanks.

633
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:06,684
Why was Lake Mashu so foggy!

634
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:08,052
It really was!

635
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,188
- Yay!
- Congratulations!

636
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:14,258
- I'm glad for them.
- That was beautiful.

637
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:17,295
- That was really amazing.
- That was truly wonderful.

638
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:19,597
- "Our feelings finally align."
- I know, right?

639
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,399
- That was so poetic!
- Who says that?

640
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:24,769
- They say truth is stranger than fiction…
- Well, this was the case.

641
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:26,270
If it was a scripted drama?

642
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,773
- The words wouldn't resonate.
- You wouldn't write that.

643
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,341
Did you see that video clip?

644
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,743
- What was that?
- The video with their lips touching!

645
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,679
- In the blizzard.
- Off to the side.

646
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:36,647
- They were in the fog!
- It's a good shot.

647
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,983
I mean, no wonder
he insisted on going today,

648
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,485
even if it meant pushing
everyone else aside.

649
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:43,521
- Now we know why.
- That was a good reason.

650
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:46,691
I was wondering, "Why does he want to go?"
But he was very determined.

651
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:49,860
And wasn't his letter just
the most amazing thing ever?

652
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,395
- Right?
- It was good.

653
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:55,166
His words almost sounded like a proposal.

654
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:58,369
I mean, this was good.
They gave us a very memorable scene!

655
00:38:58,436 --> 00:38:59,603
Absolutely perfect.

656
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,372
I think it's added a few years to my life.

657
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:02,940
- Thank you.
- Really well done.

658
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,710
- And then there's Jobu.
- That was very sad.

659
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:08,045
- It was nice of him.
- I feel so sorry for him.

660
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:11,182
That scene when the two of them were
like, "I'll stay home" and "I need to go."

661
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:12,550
- Powerful.
- Yeah.

662
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:15,386
<i>But I also wonder</i>
<i>what Jobu could have wanted to say.</i>

663
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,588
- Maybe he wanted to try again.
- That's it.

664
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:21,859
Maybe he wanted to try and tell William
how he felt one last time.

665
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:24,995
- Before deciding to give up entirely.
- I wonder what would've happened.

666
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:28,799
But it's still sad, because the person
he wanted to confess his feelings to

667
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,235
was pushing so hard
to leave with another guy.

668
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,770
That's exactly what happened!

669
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:36,540
It really showed just how much
Jobu was in control of his feelings.

670
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,976
What kind of cruel twist of fate was that?

671
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,812
Izaya and William are really late.

672
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,982
- I wonder what they're doing.
- Yeah, I wonder where they are?

673
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,318
- What if they're having a huge fight?
- What?

674
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,320
- What if they had a huge fight?
- For real?

675
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,622
- A huge fight?
- A fight that takes hours.

676
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,225
Or they went somewhere far.

677
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,895
Phew.

678
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:00,064
- Careful, don't slip.
- What?

679
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,766
- Careful. Don't slip here.
- Yeah.

680
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,601
- It's slippery.
- I won't slip.

681
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,774
But, every time… Oh, they're back.

682
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,142
They're back?

683
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:13,244
Welcome back.

684
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,612
- We're back!
- You're late.

685
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,680
- We're back! It's late.
- Everything okay?

686
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,049
- Yeah, we're late.
- We started without you.

687
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:20,684
- What are you eating?
- <i>Jingisukan.</i>

688
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:21,685
Ooh!

689
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,688
- I thought I smelled something delicious.
- We have plenty for both of you.

690
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,991
- That's great.
- Wonderful.

691
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:30,261
- Ryuki still hasn't recovered?
- No.

692
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:31,262
Okay.

693
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:33,564
How was it today?

694
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:37,668
This morning, we ended up
running the coffee truck

695
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:39,370
after talking it over, right?

696
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,304
Mmm.

697
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:43,541
I know I wasn't able
to explain it at the time,

698
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:47,912
but my feelings and my mind
were already made up.

699
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:52,750
And because I had these feelings in me,
I was determined to run the truck today.

700
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:57,521
I wrote a letter to Izaya
about how I feel right now.

701
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:04,061
And, in this letter, I finally reveal
all the feelings I have for him.

702
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,765
That's so lovely. Oh man, how romantic.

703
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,767
- And…
- Oh, no, and what?

704
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:12,837
- And? Tell us what happened.
- And? Did something happen?

705
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:15,973
And today, we decided we're together.

706
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:16,974
- What?
- Congrats!

707
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:19,109
- So that's what.
- We're together.

708
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:20,845
Congratulations.

709
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:23,380
- That's what I wanted to hear.
- That's great news.

710
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:25,950
- We all want to celebrate.
- Look at you squirming!

711
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,585
- We're friends!
- A toast!

712
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,487
- It's embarrassing.
- A toast?

713
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:32,590
I'm happy for you.

714
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,091
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm really happy.

715
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:38,762
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Why are you crying?

716
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,764
<i>Kazu has a high level of empathy.</i>

717
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,933
<i>Because</i>
<i>he's been through a lot in his life.</i>

718
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,101
<i>You're right.</i>

719
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,370
- I'm thinking how happy I am for you.
- You okay?

720
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:48,239
- Kazuyuki.
- Kazuyuki.

721
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:51,242
- I'm just so glad for you both.
- Thank you.

722
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:52,476
Congratulations.

723
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:57,014
- This was so unexpected. Are you okay?
- I'm just so glad.

724
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,918
Thanks, Kazuyuki. When you start
to cry, it always makes me tear up too.

725
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:02,119
Don't mind me!

726
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:05,055
It makes me happy that you care so deeply.

727
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:07,758
All I can say is I'm very happy.

728
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:09,660
On anniversaries like this,

729
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:13,664
it's rare to actually
be celebrated on the day itself, right?

730
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:15,866
- It's rare.
- This doesn't happen to me.

731
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:18,536
- This is definitely a special day for me.
- <i>Is Jobu okay?</i>

732
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:20,004
<i>Is Jobu okay?</i>

733
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,873
<i>- His emotions… Oh, is he okay?</i>
- <i>Oh, he froze up.</i>

734
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,981
What color do you want?

735
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,883
- Draw a heart in the center.
- Mmm.

736
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,418
- Use the same color.
- Good idea.

737
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:35,719
- You like that?
- Yeah.

738
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:38,188
You do it.

739
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:40,558
- You sure I can do it?
- Yeah.

740
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,459
This is embarrassing.

741
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:44,261
Great.

742
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:47,631
We've changed.
We changed little by little.

743
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:49,300
- We did.
- This was the first time?

744
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:51,835
Our very first time. The day I asked you.

745
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:55,973
- In the end, I asked you out.
- You did. Thank you.

746
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,274
Thank you too.

747
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,847
Mmm…

748
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:05,950
Oh, thanks.

749
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:11,255
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

750
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,794
- Are we allowed?
- I don't know. I think it's okay today.

751
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:20,798
- Goodnight. See you tomorrow.
- <i>They don't want to leave.</i>

752
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:22,132
- <i>But have to</i>.
- <i>Separate.</i>

753
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,568
<i>- The day they get together!</i>
- <i>They'll live together.</i>

754
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:26,937
- <i>Yeah, but…</i>
- <i>Yeah, but this is nice too.</i>

755
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,709
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

756
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,446
<i>Aaah!</i>

757
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:37,214
<i>And the rooms are so far apart.</i>

758
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,884
<i>They didn't close the door</i>
<i>for a while either. Oh, this is nice.</i>

759
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,088
Hey, Hiroya isn't here.

760
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:47,291
- It's hard to get everyone together.
- Right. It's like…

761
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:48,759
I guess you're right.

762
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:50,060
But I'm glad.

763
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:52,429
- Ryuki is back.
- Welcome back.

764
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,431
- It's been two or three days.
- Are you okay?

765
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:56,567
- How are you feeling?
- I'm okay. I'm good.

766
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:58,669
Well…

767
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:01,872
We're officially together.

768
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:03,874
What, already?

769
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:06,043
- That was fast.
- That was fast!

770
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:08,979
This isn't the kind of progress
I'm used to.

771
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:10,347
There's no such thing.

772
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,516
- It happened yesterday.
- Wow.

773
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,120
- That's why today we are celebrating.
- That's why we're celebrating.

774
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:18,222
- All day.
- We'll celebrate tonight.

775
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:19,623
Sounds good.

776
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,463
- Oh? Huh?
- Huh? Huh?

777
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,165
- What's going on?
- Huh?

778
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:29,366
Where are you going?

779
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:31,368
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

780
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:34,138
- Just for a while…
- That startled me.

781
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:36,140
I'm leaving the Green Room. Yeah.

782
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:39,243
- You're leaving today?
- For a short while? You're coming back.

783
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:40,944
I'm going on a business trip abroad.

784
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,112
- Really?
- Is that so?

785
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,782
The project I've been working on
so hard the past few years

786
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:45,916
is finally coming together.

787
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:46,850
Mmm.

788
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:49,653
So I want to be there
for that final moment. Yeah.

789
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:52,156
I won't be back right away.

790
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:56,360
So, while I'm gone,
to remind you of my time here so far…

791
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:58,929
- You printed these for us?
- Wow, there are so many!

792
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,398
- These are really nice.
- Photo stands? Cute!

793
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:03,333
- How cute.
- I made photo stands.

794
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,703
- Put them up somewhere and add your photo.
- Awesome.

795
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,538
- These are great.
- So nice of you.

796
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:09,606
- Thanks guys.
- Thanks.

797
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,109
- I've gotta go.
- See you soon.

798
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:14,311
- Take care of yourself.
- Good luck.

799
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:18,115
- Bye! See you soon.
- We'll miss you.

800
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:20,584
- See you soon!
- Take care!

801
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:21,752
See you!

802
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:25,956
- <i>How long is the trip?</i>
- <i>He's coming back?</i>

803
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:27,925
<i>- He's not leaving?</i>
- <i>I think it's a week?</i>

804
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:28,826
Honestly?

805
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,428
I have one less rival.

806
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:34,064
- <i>Well, that's true.</i>
- <i>No wonder Bomi's laughing.</i>

807
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:35,999
I mean, I shouldn't be
thinking this way,

808
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:40,270
but I feel like I don't have
to rush the situation anymore,

809
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:42,806
and I can take my time talking to Huwei.

810
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:47,311
<i>Well, I did have</i>
<i>a rather sad experience in Niseko,</i>

811
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:50,781
<i>but if it's not too late</i>
<i>when I get back to the Green Room</i>…

812
00:45:50,848 --> 00:45:51,915
TANCHO KUSHIRO AIRPORT

813
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:55,586
<i>…I want to focus my efforts</i>
<i>on Huwei once again.</i>

814
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:57,054
<i>He wants to try again?</i>

815
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,159
<i>Someone new is here.</i>

816
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,730
<i>Ohh!</i>

817
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:08,265
<i>What? Is that Taeheon?</i>

818
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:10,768
<i>Is that Taeheon?</i>

819
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:12,936
- What?
- Why? What is he doing here?

820
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:14,772
- This is crazy!
- What's going on in this show?

821
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:17,708
- Taeheon!
- Taeheon's coming back?
