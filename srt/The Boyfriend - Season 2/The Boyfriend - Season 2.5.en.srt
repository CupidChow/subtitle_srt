"Here are the names of the people
who can go on one-on-one dates."

2
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:29,396
"Pair one."

3
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:39,639
"William."

4
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:52,986
"Izaya."

5
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:55,989
Nice.

6
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,124
Have fun.

7
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:04,864
"Pair two."

8
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:13,740
"Huwei."

9
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:24,417
"Bomi."

10
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:35,762
"That's all."

11
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,566
- Yes!
- What should we do?

12
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:40,967
Aren't you going to celebrate?

13
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,070
- Yay!
- Yay!

14
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,448
I wonder why he chose
to go on a date with Izaya.

15
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:58,118
- You're right.
- Maybe there wasn't anyone else.

16
00:01:58,184 --> 00:01:59,152
Yeah, that's it.

17
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,990
- We're off.
- See you later.

18
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,826
- See you later.
- Have fun.

45
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,126
You know,
it's pretty rare to see a landscape

46
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,729
so completely white nowadays.

47
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:50,997
Mm.

48
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,705
- Ooh, wow!
- Wow, amazing.

49
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,442
It's entirely made out of ice, right?

50
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:04,844
Amazing.

51
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,180
Oh, an ice bar.

52
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,450
- Hello.
- Hello.

53
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:11,417
Hello.

54
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:15,488
- This is how you make these, right?
- Yes, that's right. Cocktail glasses.

55
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,390
Triangles and other shapes.

56
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,370
That's big.

57
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,717
Well, what do you think?

58
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,119
- Yeah. It's good.
- Yeah?

59
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:51,958
Cheers.

60
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,295
- It's good.
- Mm.

61
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:12,111
- Okay, shall we?
- Yeah, let's walk around a little.

62
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,613
- Good idea.
- Mm.

63
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,551
<i>The mood is heavy between them.</i>

64
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,187
<i>They're on a date,</i>
<i>but they're not talking, right?</i>

65
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,221
Let's go.

66
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,724
US, JOURNEY, AND COFFEE

67
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,293
- Who did you pick?
- I had picked William.

68
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,196
What are your… thoughts about that?

69
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,398
I can work in the coffee truck
with anyone.

70
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,434
- I get it.
- I didn't mind going with someone else.

71
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,870
But when choosing a date,
I realized I wanted to go with William.

72
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,039
I didn't overthink it.
I just wrote his name.

73
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:40,940
Mm.

74
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,610
At first,
I thought Huwei had feelings for Izaya.

75
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,645
I'm sure he does.

76
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:50,883
So naturally, I thought Huwei would try
to sort out his feelings for Izaya first.

77
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,387
That's why I thought,
"Fine, sort out your feelings for Izaya."

78
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:58,725
But I was able to tell him he was the one
I was interested in, out of everyone.

79
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:00,960
And Bomi likes Huwei too, right?

80
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,128
Mm, probably.

81
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:06,032
Yeah, and Huwei decided to choose Bomi
as his date.

82
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,168
He didn't choose Izaya,
and he obviously didn't choose me.

83
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,536
- Yeah.
- He chose Bomi.

84
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,006
So I was like, 'Oh, I get it.'

85
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:18,778
- I really wanted to go.
- Of course you did.

86
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:20,646
Arf!

87
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:22,248
Womp womp.

88
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,317
- <i>How cute.</i>
- <i>He's cute.</i>

89
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,418
<i>That's so cute.</i>

90
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,820
I don't care anymore.

91
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,790
I won't do anything today.
I won't even make dinner tonight.

92
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,360
That gives a bad impression.

93
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,530
- Come on, let's make dinner.
- Okay.

94
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,599
<i>I like how Jobu stays positive.</i>

95
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,101
<i>Yeah, he was funny</i>
<i>when he said "arf" like that.</i>

96
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,609
- Are you still angry?
- Hmm?

97
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:55,314
If I'm angry? I think I might be feeling
something a little different than anger.

98
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,517
- Okay.
- Yeah. It's like…

99
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,018
Um…

100
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,454
It's complicated.

101
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:03,723
You know?

102
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,302
This is nice.

103
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:22,742
Hmm.

104
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,111
<i>It's so tense.</i>

105
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,779
<i>It's really tense.</i>

106
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,489
Something still bothering you?

107
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,090
Yeah, you're right.

108
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:42,962
I really have… mixed feelings
about what happened.

109
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,331
- Yesterday?
- Yesterday.

110
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,499
Mm.

111
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:50,369
I mean, it's not like our relationship has

112
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,939
developed into anything yet.

113
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,576
That's why I don't think
it's right for me to get mad.

114
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:57,477
Mm.

115
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:58,377
But

116
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,413
it does

117
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,348
make me nervous.

118
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:03,683
Mm.

119
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,921
Yes, it was someone
I used to be in touch with.

120
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,124
But… I didn't contact him at all,

121
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,228
not when I'm focused on someone else.

122
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,964
I really don't want you to worry
about things like that.

123
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,031
Mm-hmm.

124
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,701
I think you're an honest person, William,

125
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,036
and that you wouldn't lie
about something like that,

126
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,204
so I'm not worried.

127
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,139
No, I'm not lying.

128
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:28,774
Mm.

129
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:33,312
But it's possible you could get
more messages like that

130
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,814
in the future, right?

131
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:39,685
When that happens, I wonder,
what's the best way for us to handle it?

132
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:44,056
Should I ask about it when it happens
until I'm satisfied with the answer?

133
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,025
I think so, yeah, until you're satisfied.

134
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:51,197
You can always tell me how you feel,
and I'll always give you an honest answer.

135
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,300
I don't want this to be a problem for us.

136
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,169
- Yeah, neither do I.
- Mm.

137
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,439
Hey, look at the view.

138
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,143
- It's amazing.
- I didn't notice it.

139
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,411
You're right.

140
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:09,415
<i>With love</i>

141
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:14,620
<i>I can change the sky above…</i>

142
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,123
It's amazing.

143
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,824
It's like

144
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,361
all the fog has lifted,

145
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:26,799
and now I can finally see
the whole view clearly.

146
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,502
<i>With love</i>

147
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:34,173
<i>I can change the sky above</i>

148
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,676
<i>And rise a little higher…</i>

149
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,044
I'm happy.

150
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,284
- Our memorable first time.
- Our first date.

151
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:48,621
It's a little bittersweet though.

152
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,891
You know, that kind of incident
could possibly happen again.

153
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,759
Mm. Well, if it does,

154
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:56,295
I really want us to talk it out

155
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,231
and to work towards
finding the best solution…

156
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:00,900
for both of us.

157
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:01,968
Mm.

158
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,104
That's how relationships
move forward, after all.

159
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,440
You're right. That kind of relationship

160
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,711
is really important…
when building a future with someone.

161
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,447
Yeah. I think so.

162
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,249
I guess today was

163
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,885
a really important day.

164
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,455
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

165
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,790
<i>I want you to be with me…</i>

166
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,459
- Shall we?
- Let's head back.

167
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,327
Yeah. Everyone's waiting.

168
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,261
Yeah.

169
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:30,763
Let's go.

170
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,633
<i>You're still a shadow…</i>

171
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,668
The snow's so fluffy and pretty.

172
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,804
<i>I'll be waiting for</i>

173
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,173
<i>I'll be waiting for you</i>

174
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,742
<i>Now hold my hand</i>

175
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:46,479
<i>I promise that, that, that, that…</i>

176
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,881
He's not running away.

177
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,251
He's facing things head-on
and working through the issues.

178
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:57,523
I could tell that he really does have
feelings for me and that he was sincere.

179
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:00,926
Well, I'm

180
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,897
feeling slowly drawn to him.

181
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,933
<i>With love… </i>

182
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,502
I feel better.

183
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,437
You feel better?

184
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,509
<i>And rise a little higher…</i>

185
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,277
I thought he was so cute.

186
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,379
I just wanted to touch him.

187
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,449
Wait, what's this feeling?

188
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:26,452
People don't normally meet like this.

189
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,323
Most of the time, people will meet
through a dating site or on a dating app

190
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,360
and get close in a short period of time.

191
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:40,499
But, for me, I've never experienced
my affection slowly building over time.

192
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:43,235
It's frightening because it's new to me.

193
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:46,972
<i>Closer again</i>

194
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:52,645
- Amazing. That's so interesting.
- That was an unexpected development.

195
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,981
So, in fact, things are going really well
between William and Izaya.

196
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,950
I feel a little bad about what I said.

197
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:01,120
- I assumed William was like me, but…
- That's right, sensei.

198
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:02,988
It turns out
he's a much better person than me.

199
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,990
- Absolutely.
- I apologize, William.

200
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,126
You said it was an excuse
to say no to Jobu.

201
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,861
I did, and I'm so embarrassed.

202
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:09,929
Please stop.

203
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,864
He turned out to be
on a much higher level.

204
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:15,568
William was just afraid
because this feeling was new to him.

205
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,203
It's also because we live in an era

206
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,638
where it's easy
to make instant connections,

207
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:23,008
and being popular makes it difficult
to slowly build relationships,

208
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,344
so he hasn't experienced that until now.

209
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,313
Maybe Izaya's direct approach,

210
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,849
the conversation he had
in the gym, worked.

211
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,184
He took charge from the start,
and it actually worked.

212
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,352
For the longest time,

213
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,589
I had no idea what William was
really thinking or feeling,

214
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,624
but now we know he's attracted to Izaya.

215
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,026
- We can assume things are going well.
- Things are going well.

216
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,195
Are they waterproof?

217
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,865
No, they're not. Today might be
the worst day for my shoes.

218
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,435
- You okay?
- <i>Ah!</i>

219
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,337
<i>- </i>Be careful.
- <i>Oh, that's cute.</i>

220
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:54,039
- <i>That was really nice of him.</i>
- That startled me.

221
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,142
Let's walk on this side
where there's no snow.

222
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,246
- Here?
- Here it is. The Ainu Kotan.

223
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,715
Really? This is kind of… nice.

224
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,150
The atmosphere is nice.

225
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,385
- It has its own style.
- For sure.

226
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,188
Let's visit.

227
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,557
- Let's buy something.
- Mm.

228
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,528
I don't think I've ever seen
anything like this before in my life.

229
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,563
- Carvings?
- Yeah, like the wooden bear carving.

230
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,998
It reminds me of someone.

231
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:20,633
- Of who?
- Of you.

232
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,902
No, it doesn't. It doesn't look like me.

233
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,470
There are so many of you.

234
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,674
Have you ever worn
something matching with someone else?

235
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,777
- Let me think about it.
- It's okay.

236
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:33,879
I've never worn anything matching.

237
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,514
- You've never?
- Never.

238
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,184
Should we get something that matches?

239
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,852
- Should we?
- Maybe?

240
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,160
- Let's keep looking.
- Yeah. Or we could get matching mugs.

241
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,562
- They're nice.
- They are.

242
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,064
Wooden mugs aren't something
you see every day.

243
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,433
Are these the only mugs they have?
Are there others?

244
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,101
Do you see anything else you like?

245
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,871
Other than the mugs,
what do you think would be nice?

246
00:13:58,938 --> 00:13:59,972
What do you think?

247
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:01,974
Let's see.

248
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:06,278
Why don't we both…
You choose something that looks like me,

249
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,747
and I'll choose
something that looks like you.

250
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,951
- Okay.
- And then we can open them when we eat.

251
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,219
- Okay.
- Okay.

252
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,087
- Let's do that.
- <i>How fun.</i>

253
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,089
- <i>Nice idea.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

254
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,365
Which one should I get?

255
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,740
- This is what a date should be like.
- Yeah.

256
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,842
The other date was so tense and serious.

257
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,178
It's nice to be able to create
an activity out of nothing.

258
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,112
That's true.

259
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,015
If they come back with matching items,
everyone else will be like…

260
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,317
- It's a form of marking.
- "A form of marking"!

261
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:50,789
That chat about romance earlier was fun.

262
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:53,559
Like being dependent. Really?

263
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:56,829
- Being dependent isn't good.
- So you understand it's not good?

264
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,197
Yeah, I know it's not good.

265
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,266
- Okay.
- Like, becoming obsessed with someone?

266
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:03,269
Yeah,
like "dropping out of college" obsessed.

267
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:04,970
That's crazy!

268
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,106
So if your boyfriend said,

269
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:10,009
"Hey, I wanna hang out with you today,
so ditch class,"

270
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,110
you would ditch class?

271
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,078
- I'd skip class.
- That's a bad boyfriend.

272
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,614
- That's not good.
- Yeah, but I like bad boys.

273
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,485
Yeah, I get what you mean.

274
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,620
- Bad boys are nice.
- Bad boys are nice.

275
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,790
- Bad boys are attractive. I get it.
- They're nice. I get it.

276
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:28,460
That indifference they have…
is incredibly attractive.

277
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:32,331
- Yeah, I get it.
- I get it.

278
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,701
I don't want them to use exclamation marks
in their texts.

279
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:37,836
Man, that's specific.

280
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:40,205
So you want them
to be indifferent toward you?

281
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,573
Not to show any interest at all?

282
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,976
"Okay," "yeah,"
that's enough for me. Or "LOL."

283
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,446
- That's funny.
- You're a masochist? What's your deal?

284
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,816
- So you want them to be indifferent.
- And I wanna stress over that.

285
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,419
Wait, what do you mean?
I don't think I get it.

286
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:54,820
Sorry, I don't get it.

287
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,089
I don't think I get
the "wanting to stress" part.

288
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,958
- Hilarious.
- Super hilarious.

289
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,327
I wanna tell my friends
that he's indifferent…

290
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,996
- Ah.
- But he does this and this for me.

291
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:08,200
And then your friends would be like,
"You should leave him."

292
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,803
"Ryu, you really shouldn't be dating
someone like that, you know."

293
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:12,671
But I never break up with him.

294
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,641
- You don't break up with him.
- You tell them, "But I still like him."

295
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,646
- Is that okay? I'm so worried about you.
- Well, that's what I wanna stress over.

296
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,115
Well, okay, then,

297
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,285
you can have dreams like that.
It's fine. I get it.

298
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,325
TELECOM SALES WORKER

299
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,661
Dating again is really hard when

300
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,464
you haven't done it for so long.

301
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,799
All I've known is familial love

302
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,401
for the past 15 years.

303
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:46,038
I devoted myself completely to it,

304
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,374
so, in a lot of ways, I'm kind of stuck.

305
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:53,178
I very clearly remember the day
we officially decided to be together.

306
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:56,715
I met my ex when I was 24 years old.

307
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,651
He kept telling me
that he wanted to be with me,

308
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,654
and I kept telling him
to wait a little bit longer,

309
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:04,289
that I wasn't ready yet.

310
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,693
Then, finally,
one day, after about three months,

311
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,929
I said to myself,
"Okay, I'm gonna be with this guy."

312
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:14,066
I decided I would tell him
the next time we met.

313
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,737
Coincidentally, the day I went to see him
turned out to be

314
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:24,743
the very same day… he decided
that he wouldn't wait for me any longer.

315
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,578
Our decisions overlapped.

316
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:30,716
But I had truly decided to tell him
that day that I wanted to be with him,

317
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,919
that I wanted… to officially be with him.

318
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:37,689
So, when he told me that,
I ended up crying a lot.

319
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,693
But then he said, "Oh, I see.
I'm sorry. Let's be together, then."

320
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,595
That's how we officially got together.

321
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:46,965
That's so good.

322
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:49,234
Talking about it
made me wanna cry a little.

323
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,571
<i>He almost started to cry</i>
<i>when he talked about it. That's so pure.</i>

324
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:57,176
Talking about it to someone like you…
brings back memories.

325
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,878
Yeah. That's how
our life together started.

326
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:04,983
- What a really great start.
- It made me remember how it was.

327
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:09,088
Yeah, come to think of it,
that's how it all started.

328
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:10,689
It just hit me again.

329
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:13,959
I remember it well.

330
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,962
I remember where we were
when we talked about it.

331
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,665
I also remember myself crying.

332
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,001
I cried so much that day.

333
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,741
Remembering everything
that happened that day

334
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:33,312
is very… emotional for me.

335
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:39,184
- <i>Fifteen years is a long time.</i>
- <i>It </i>is <i>a long time.</i>

336
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,453
- I think I'm super happy.
- Mm.

337
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,989
- Right now is the happiest moment.
- Mm.

338
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,227
We wrote each other's name
to go on this date, right?

339
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,529
- Mm.
- Why did you…

340
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,933
Tell me what was on your mind.

341
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,636
Honestly, at first,

342
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,205
I have to say, I was interested in Izaya.

343
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,707
- I knew that.
- You did?

344
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:03,375
Mm.

345
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,644
I was watching you the whole time,
so I knew.

346
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,247
- I saw you were interested in him.
- I was interested.

347
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,716
And? I shouldn't have said that. Sorry.

348
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:11,850
So I was interested in him,

349
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,620
but then I suddenly lost interest
a little while ago.

350
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:15,521
Why is that?

351
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,257
When I saw
how close Izaya and William were,

352
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,093
I realized that I didn't have
the same romantic vibe

353
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,061
that William seems to have naturally.

354
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:23,996
Mm.

355
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:25,797
I also realized I wasn't his first choice.

356
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:26,999
- I see.
- So, yeah.

357
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,101
And then, when they announced
the one-on-one dates…

358
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,068
Mm.

359
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,671
…you seemed to pop into my head.

360
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,140
- Is that what happened?
- Mm.

361
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,442
Also, because you chose me

362
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,912
on your first day
running the coffee truck,

363
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,948
I thought, "I hope he writes my name down
for the date."

364
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,684
Well, for me, you were my only choice.

365
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:46,785
Really?

366
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,988
That's why I wanted to read the tablet.

367
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:53,525
I wanted to be
the first to see the results.

368
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,527
I'm glad I was able to…

369
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:56,528
Um…

370
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,298
…go out

371
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,134
with you like this…

372
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,404
because, honestly,
I didn't think I'd be able to.

373
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,139
You know what I mean?

374
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,575
I never thought you'd be here.
That was a surprise.

375
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,311
And if I had missed this opportunity,

376
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,313
I'd never be able
to get to know you better.

377
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,081
That's why

378
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,651
I chose you for the coffee truck

379
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,120
and wrote your name down for the date.

380
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,124
And that's all.

381
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,494
Awkward.

382
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,297
At first, I have to say, I was also…

383
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,167
My impression of you now
is completely different

384
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,468
from when we first met.

385
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,837
- Is that a good thing?
- It's getting better.

386
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:39,871
Oh, really?

387
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,673
I'm glad to hear that.

388
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,209
Yeah.

389
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,079
I'm too embarrassed
to look you in the eyes.

390
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,881
- <i>That's cute.</i>
- <i>That's cute.</i>

391
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,583
<i>I think his approach is the best.</i>

392
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,985
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

393
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,120
Oh, should we open them?

394
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,258
This is kind of embarrassing.

395
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,660
- Here.
- Here.

396
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:04,630
- It's big.
- It's kind of big.

397
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,398
- This one's big too.
- This one's also big.

398
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,969
Wait. This is super cute.

399
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,305
- I thought he looked like you.
- Oh, really? A fox?

400
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,107
So I'm a fox, then.

401
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,847
Hey, isn't it cute? It's cute, right?

402
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,349
I wanted the bigger one,
but I didn't have the money.

403
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,317
Hang on.

404
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:27,319
- Wait
- Wait for what?

405
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,988
- Never mind.
- What is it? Do you have a story to share?

406
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,256
No, it's nothing.

407
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,160
- <i>It's the same!</i>
- <i>Oh, I thought so.</i>

408
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,796
<i>I guess people just wanna give him</i>
<i>things like that.</i>

409
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:39,931
I really wanted this.

410
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,733
- It's cute, right?
- It's cute.

411
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,102
It's really cute.

412
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,204
- It's cute, right?
- It's cute.

413
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,040
What's up? What's with your reaction?

414
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:50,242
- No, it's really cute. Yeah.
- It's cute, right?

415
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,544
I won't let you say anything else
than it's cute.

416
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,647
- There's just one thing.
- Tell me.

417
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,950
I have a smaller version of this one.

418
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:00,352
Oh, you do?

419
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,422
Well, it's a…
it's a little different from this one,

420
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,589
but Hiroya gave it to me.

421
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:05,657
No way.

422
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:09,027
<i>- No way he could've guessed.</i>
- That's why I laughed.

423
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,028
But it's really cute.

424
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:12,264
Everyone knows that I love these,
don't they?

425
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:13,899
- You like it?
- I love it.

426
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:16,034
- That's good. I'm glad.
- It's my favorite.

427
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,536
Good. I really struggled over it.

428
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,739
I thought I might as well get
the biggest one they have.

429
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,507
- A bigger one?
- One with more presence.

430
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,876
This fox is cute. I'll put it on later.

431
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,112
Maybe I can attach it to my phone.

432
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:30,248
Don't you think it would get in the way
if you were to do that?

433
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,551
It's fine. Everyone can see it.

434
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:37,089
I can say, "Huwei got it for me. Look!"

435
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:38,857
Should I not show it off?

436
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:41,326
It's fine. You can show it off.

437
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,396
This chicken curry is gonna be delicious!

438
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:45,897
I'm sure.

439
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,266
- It's ready.
- I'm getting ready to smile.

440
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,370
Thanks to everyone, I think I've been able
to get myself under control.

441
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:52,270
Really?

442
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:55,574
- I smell something.
- It's coming from here?

443
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:58,410
If Huwei were here,
he'd want to add some apples

444
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,045
or some cola as a secret ingredient.

445
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,713
- He'd add cola.
- He would for sure.

446
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,950
- Gross.
- Let's add some cola to the dish.

447
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,252
He'd say it would give richness
to the flavor.

448
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,121
He always adds stuff to his cooking.

449
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,158
I don't think it will get any less watery.

450
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,727
- Something smells good.
- You're right.

451
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,362
- Yeah.
- Was this what we smelled outside?

452
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:18,597
Oh, maybe it is.

453
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,799
What is that?

454
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,968
- We're back.
- Welcome back.

455
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,203
- So we're back.
- <i>Oh no! Hide it!</i>

456
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,605
Welcome back.

457
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,173
<i>He's not hiding it at all.</i>

458
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,674
- Hey.
- Welcome back.

459
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:30,976
<i>Bomi is shielding him.</i>

460
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,477
- Something smells good.
- It does.

461
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:35,514
- We're making curry.
- Curry today. Butter chicken curry.

462
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,282
- That looks delicious.
- Wow, that looks good.

463
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,851
Hiroya hasn't noticed yet, right?

464
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,253
I don't think he has yet.

465
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,522
I think a store detective
might have noticed.

466
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,123
Yeah. "Stop right there, sir!"

467
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,093
- Let it simmer for ten minutes.
- It smells really good.

468
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,398
Hey, you have something on you.

469
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,500
- It's a fox.
- Did you buy that?

470
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,103
- He got it for me.
- Did you see one? Did you see a fox?

471
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,238
- No, I didn't. It's from the store.
- You didn't?

472
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,444
Bomi seemed to be in very high spirits.

473
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,647
He had a new fox keychain on his phone.

474
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,550
I had mixed feelings about that. Yeah.

475
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,122
We're back. That was really a fun day.

476
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,592
- We made good memories.
- Yeah.

477
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:25,397
- They're back.
- Hi.

478
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,132
- We're back.
- Welcome back.

479
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,535
- Dinner's ready.
- Dinner's ready?

480
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,471
I thought I smelled something good.

481
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,073
- I'll start serving.
- Mm.

482
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,908
- Did you have fun?
- How was it?

483
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,143
- Yeah.
- We had fun, right?

484
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,011
We did. What about you two?

485
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,180
- So did we, right?
- What? Yeah, we did.

486
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:44,382
- Hey, hey.
- Tell us all about it later.

487
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:46,351
It felt like I was forcing him
to say that.

488
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,620
What's on your phone?

489
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,023
- It was a gift.
- A fox keychain.

490
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,560
I attached it to my phone
so I could show it off.

491
00:24:58,463 --> 00:24:59,397
It's cute.

492
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:00,465
Ruff-ruff.

493
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:10,809
Oh, this is so complicated!

494
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,310
That's understandable though.

495
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:15,547
I think our impression of Bomi
has started to change a lot, right?

496
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:16,615
It has.

497
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:19,184
It feels like
he's really becoming a wonderful person

498
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,119
who can clearly express his thoughts now.

499
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,022
The way he said, "I'm so embarrassed,
I can't look you in the eyes,"

500
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:26,658
that was an old-fashioned move,
but it was a nice touch.

501
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:27,893
It was sweet how he did it.

502
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,828
I thought that was
the right move for him to do.

503
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,696
- "I can't look."
- Yeah, the fanning,

504
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:34,900
That was cute. This always shows
how much it affects you.

505
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,935
I think it really suits his character.

506
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:40,805
What is it about Huwei that makes people
want to give him a toy bird?

507
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:44,242
Yeah, especially this one,
because it's a long-tailed tit,

508
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:47,279
and one thing about the long-tailed tit
is that when they form a pair,

509
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:49,881
they leave the flock together,
and they stay really close

510
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,349
and become a couple.

511
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,985
- That's lovely!
- Yeah. That's their story.

512
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,022
But, you know, Hiroya had given him
a red-crowned crane.

513
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,591
- A red-crowned…
- That's why there was red there.

514
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,059
So it's a red-crowned crane.

515
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:04,863
So both Hiroya and Bomi gave Huwei
a bird plushy

516
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,999
knowing very well that plushies
are something he likes a lot.

517
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,668
But Hiroya's having mixed feelings.

518
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,637
- He asked Bomi if he had seen a fox.
- Yeah, his question was weird.

519
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,973
- It was really weird.
- He was saying something weird.

520
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,344
But after what he said, don't you think
Kazuyuki is a pure-hearted person?

521
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:23,648
Would you get teary-eyed
by talking about your past relationship?

522
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,750
Would you remember how you first met,

523
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:28,286
get all sentimental,
and say, "I'm gonna cry"?

524
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:31,957
- I don't think I would cry.
- You wouldn't, right? He's a pure soul.

525
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:33,825
- He's a lovely person.
- He's lovely.

526
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:36,628
It would be great to be in a relationship
with someone like him.

527
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,830
- I'm sure it's the case.
- He's really great.

528
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,366
- Maybe he hasn't moved on yet.
- Yeah, maybe so.

529
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,436
When you break up with someone
you've been with for 15 years,

530
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:45,971
you've gone through everything, right?

531
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:47,906
- You might be right.
- Yeah, I guess so.

532
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,212
- I'll read it today.
- Go ahead.

533
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,680
"Good morning."

534
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,182
Good morning.

535
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:00,719
Huh? Now, I'm scared.

536
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,587
"Here's the person on duty
for today's shift."

537
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:03,722
That startled me.

538
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,323
"For today's shift…

539
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:09,995
Ryuki will be on duty today."

540
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:11,329
Oh.

541
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:12,864
- My first time.
- Your turn.

542
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,400
"Ryuki, please choose the person
you want to work with."

543
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,301
Okay.

544
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:19,304
"Once you've decided,
please turn over that person's nameplate."

545
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,684
- <i>Izaya?</i>
- <i>Izaya!</i>

546
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:35,220
- Let's work together.
- Let's work together.

547
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:42,360
- See you later.
- See you later. Good luck.

548
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,797
He's coming in between those two.

549
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:47,866
Is he going to shake things up
between them?

550
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:49,434
- This is great!
- Incredible.

551
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,336
This is what a dating show is all about!

552
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:54,039
<i>This might stimulate William a little.</i>

553
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,943
I can't believe how few people
there are here. It's a little sad.

554
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,279
- There's no one here.
- Yeah.

555
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,915
We'll have to bring them in.

556
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:11,256
Excuse me, we're selling coffee here.
Please come if you'd like some.

557
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:13,425
We're selling coffee. Would you like some?

558
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,261
That's the first time
I've heard that voice.

559
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,229
- I spoke too loudly.
- It was good.

560
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,032
Did someone come? Hello and welcome.

561
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,033
Hello.

562
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,735
How many hot chocolates would you like?

563
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,770
- Three hot chocolates.
- Three.

564
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:27,806
It'll take a little time. Is that okay?

565
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,574
- That's okay.
- Thank you so much.

566
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:30,875
You've got this.

567
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,378
Yeah, that's it.

568
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:36,648
Um, here you go.
Here are your three hot chocolate milks.

569
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,917
- I'm so cold.
- These'll warm us up.

570
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,820
- Here's your change. Fifty yen.
- Okay, let's go.

571
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:45,724
7,450 yen.

572
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,392
- That's pretty good.
- Yeah, you're right.

573
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:50,228
- Good work.
- Good work.

574
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,464
- This was great.
- Yeah, it was.

575
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:56,334
7,450 YEN

576
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,637
I didn't think
I'd be chosen by someone today,

577
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:00,705
so I was really surprised.

578
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:01,740
You were surprised?

579
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,776
When I first got here

580
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:06,945
and met everyone,

581
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:11,883
the one person
who stood out to me the most was

582
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,552
you, Izaya.

583
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,888
From that moment on,

584
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:21,626
I knew… that you would be my first choice.

585
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:25,196
- Thank you. I make a good impression?
- You made a good impression.

586
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:29,267
But it… took a lot of courage
to choose you.

587
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:32,270
- I can imagine. I totally understand.
- I was really nervous today.

588
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:33,171
Mm.

589
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,106
I was really nervous.

590
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:40,044
I mean, I'm probably the first person
you've talked to one-on-one, right?

591
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:43,648
So you haven't talked to many of them
one-on-one yet,

592
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,650
- I have to talk to them. Mm.
- Am I right?

593
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,086
It would be great for you
to make that happen

594
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,788
so you can get to know everyone better.

595
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,389
- Of course.
- Yeah.

596
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,692
There are things you can only understand
when you're one-on-one,

597
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:58,062
like sides of a person
you wouldn't normally see.

598
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:02,000
I hope you'll get to see
the hidden sides of our roommates.

599
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:04,068
Mm. I'd like that.

600
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,208
Are we still going at 4:00 to the sauna?

601
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:11,176
Uh, yes.

602
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,145
You can't change your mind
right before we go, okay?

603
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:15,079
Yeah, okay.

604
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,022
Oh man.

605
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:27,692
Being here makes me… feel bad
for the truck team.

606
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,494
- I totally get that.
- Right?

607
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:32,664
Did you have fun yesterday?

608
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,666
Yeah, I had fun.

609
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,436
I wish I could have gone.

610
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,471
With everyone?

611
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:41,806
Just with you.

612
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,379
If the next shift…

613
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:51,516
You haven't been shift leader yet,
so when it's your turn,

614
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,551
will you choose Izaya?

615
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,421
Yeah.

616
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,191
- <i>Hot place to talk about that.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

617
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,260
<i>In case they start crying,</i>
<i>the sweat will hide it.</i>

618
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:03,528
<i>Oh, that's why.</i>

619
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:06,064
When we talked last time,

620
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:10,101
it felt like you weren't telling me no,

621
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:15,406
but you weren't… saying yes… either.

622
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,642
So I'm confused about what to do.

623
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,912
I know. I expressed myself that way
after everything that happened,

624
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,814
but that's how I really felt at the time.

625
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,115
Mm-hmm.

626
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,618
…to work through my feelings,

627
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:29,254
and I'm still very unsure.

628
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,154
You don't know.

629
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:34,225
But I know I can't face both of you
at the same time.

630
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:35,193
Mm.

631
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,797
So if we had
the same conversation again now,

632
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,132
you'd answer no?

633
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,137
It would be a lot easier if you could
just be straight with me, okay?

634
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:47,872
Of course.

635
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:49,841
It's a no.

636
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,042
Thank you.

637
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:55,213
I think… it makes things easier for me.

638
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:06,791
Can we end with a hug?

639
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:09,861
Of course.

640
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,063
Thank you.

641
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:21,773
This is sad.

642
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,309
You're right. Sometimes things have to end
this way, don't they?

643
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,843
- This does last two months.
- Yeah.

644
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,279
- It's over for now.
- Yeah, it's over.

645
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,181
- Okay.
- We're good.

646
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:31,249
Let's go.

647
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,390
We're back.

648
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,759
- Welcome back.
- Hi, guys, welcome back.

649
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,227
What are you making?

650
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,896
Pot stickers.

651
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,031
- It's a pot sticker party today?
- That's right.

652
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,666
There's gonna be a lot to eat.

653
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:51,102
Yeah. We were thinking
of making one with just wasabi

654
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,004
or something really spicy in it.

655
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:53,972
Let's do it.

656
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,641
So the person who gets it
asks a question and everyone answers?

657
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,010
So you get rewarded instead of penalized.

658
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,311
It's not sticking.

659
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,247
- I don't want this one.
- Which one is that?

660
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,149
- How much did you put in?
- I put in a whole one.

661
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:06,784
A whole one? Isn't that a lot?

662
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,187
- It looks good.
- Looks delicious.

663
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:10,388
Don't they look good?

664
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,958
Enjoy your meal.

665
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:20,765
The pot stickers are good.

666
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:25,603
No one's gotten the spicy one yet?

667
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,071
No one yet.

668
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:31,576
Hold on.

669
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:34,045
- Huh?
- The chili pepper is spicy.

670
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:35,446
Did you get the spicy one?

671
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,547
Oh no.

672
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,017
- Oh no.
- Oh no.

673
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,319
Who put the chili pepper in?

674
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:42,453
I did.

675
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:45,289
- It's Hiroya's fault.
- That's not okay.

676
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:48,026
- See, I told you not to do it.
- No, you didn't.

677
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:50,728
- You were enjoying it.
- Yeah.

678
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,297
Do you wanna ask your question?

679
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,370
I wanna know if everyone… is in love now.

680
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,940
- Hmm.
- Whoa.

681
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,576
- I like it.
- Me too.

682
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,078
It's just a yes or no..

683
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,413
And no passing.

684
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:10,415
No passing?

685
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:12,517
We all have to answer yes or no?

686
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,287
Who should start?

687
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,623
Let's go around quickly, then. Yes or no.

688
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,858
Let's go this way. Boom, boom, boom, boom.

689
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:22,427
- No time to think.
- Okay.

690
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:23,728
One, two, three. Yes.

691
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,696
Yes. I jumped the gun.

692
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,799
Forget it. You didn't hear anything.

693
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,901
- Hey, we're going this way.
- Yes, yes, yes.

694
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:34,138
- Oh wow. You lost your turn.
- Let's go the other way.

695
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:35,606
- Yes.
- Yes.

696
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,444
Uh, yes.

697
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,445
No.

698
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:42,313
Yes.

699
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:44,615
Um, no.

700
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:47,251
<i>It's over.</i>

701
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:48,352
Wait a minute.

702
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,855
Momentum is important. You can't hesitate.

703
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,490
You have to go with the flow.

704
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,394
It's a yes.

705
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:59,997
<i>Thank goodness. If he said no,</i>
<i>it would've been a different story.</i>

706
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:02,767
- It was a good question.
- Good question.

707
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,605
- Let's do our best.
- Let's do our best?

708
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,708
People who said no, let's do our best.

709
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,110
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

710
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:13,344
I'll do my best.

711
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:24,088
- Oh, Jobu!
- Jobu did his best.

712
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,623
He did his best, yeah.

713
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,960
- Ryuki asked a great question.
- It really was a great question to ask.

714
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:30,361
Yeah, it was.

715
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,233
Oh, here it is.

716
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:40,171
"For today's work shift,
William will be on duty."

717
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:43,941
- That's a full circle.
- Has everyone gotten their turn?

718
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:45,109
Yeah, they did.

719
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,934
- Let's work together.
- Let's do it.

720
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,136
I know you worked yesterday,
but let's do this.

721
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,638
- That's true.
- It's okay.

722
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:20,011
- Everyone's had a turn now.
- That's right.

723
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:24,148
That means we can do something
to celebrate, right? As a reward.

724
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:29,053
Any ideas… for what we could do
all together, as a group,

725
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,323
after we've each run the coffee truck?

726
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,491
A trip.

727
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:36,327
- I'd like to go on a trip.
- How about an overnight trip?

728
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:38,429
- I like that idea.
- An overnight trip?

729
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:40,364
- Niseko!
- Niseko, yes!

730
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:43,100
Niseko sounds great.
It has to be Niseko.

731
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:46,003
Niseko, Niseko.

732
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,171
Snowboarding.

733
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:49,006
- The hot spring.
- I want that too.

734
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,742
I wanna have fun with everyone.

735
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:54,111
<i>I bet he's thinking,</i>
<i>"Maybe I won't go after all."</i>

736
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:55,846
<i>Yeah. It's really painful.</i>

737
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:01,085
Here.

738
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:04,255
Today is bad.

739
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:05,756
- Huh? Today is bad?
- Today is bad.

740
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:07,124
Because there's nobody?

741
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,460
Because there's almost nobody,
and it's cold.

742
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:10,728
It sure is cold.

743
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:13,497
We're open.

744
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:17,835
Hello and welcome.

745
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:21,505
One hot caffe latte
and one drip coffee, medium, please.

746
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,242
- Right away. Thank you very much.
- Okay. Thank you very much.

747
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:31,515
- What are you doing there?
- This is just… Wait, this is…

748
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,150
Do it over here.

749
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:37,755
I couldn't help but think it was cute.

750
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:42,393
Seeing him trying to work as close to me
as possible, even though it was cramped,

751
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,929
just made me think,
"There's more space over there."

752
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,731
But he was so close to me,

753
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:49,467
and I realized
I liked how natural he was with me.

754
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:52,336
- Where are the coffee beans?
- I just thought that was really cute.

755
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,708
- Are you on a trip?
- We are.

756
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,111
- Oh, that's nice.
- We went to Lake Mashu.

757
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:02,346
Lake Mashu? That's nice.
I've never been there.

758
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:06,784
- Wow, that's so beautiful.
- The weather was perfect too.

759
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:09,887
- Wow, that's amazing.
- All the lakes we went to were frozen.

760
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:14,225
- Well, thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

761
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,761
- Enjoy your trip. Thank you.
- Enjoy your trip. Thank you.

762
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:20,064
Lake Mashu, I've never heard of it.

763
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,134
It must be nice
to go on a trip as a couple.

764
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,037
- I'd like to go on trips. Yeah.
- I'd like to do that.

765
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:30,608
5,700 YEN

766
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:33,544
The weather's crazy.
It suddenly got so bad out.

767
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:34,879
- It's a blizzard.
- Yeah.

768
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:35,913
Yeah.

769
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:39,850
- This was interesting in its own way.
- This'll make a great memory for sure.

770
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,852
No doubt about that.

771
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,356
You know, little by little, day by day,

772
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,259
we get more time alone together.

773
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:51,662
And some things we just can't talk about
at other times, right?

774
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:56,667
So by using these moments
to tell each other what we truly value,

775
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,738
I feel like our relationship
is able to move forward,

776
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,473
step by step, one at a time.

777
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,641
I think so too.

778
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:09,980
It's also getting harder for me
to hide my true feelings these days.

779
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:13,651
Of course, I wanna be
mindful of others. However…

780
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:15,486
Mm.

781
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,789
…I'd like to stop
holding myself back as much.

782
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,759
- You're always natural, Izaya.
- Thanks.

783
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:30,801
And I think
I've started to see things differently.

784
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:31,902
Mm.

785
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:33,537
I'm glad to hear that.

786
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:36,874
I see you in a completely different light
than before,

787
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:42,713
and I wonder just how much
my feelings will continue to grow.

788
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:47,218
I know they're in the right direction,
and that actually scares me a little.

789
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:50,287
At first,
I wondered which way it would go, but now…

790
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:52,590
It's going in the right direction.

791
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:20,551
<i>I trace your name</i>
<i>In this cold, freezing air</i>

792
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:24,955
<i>You're still a shadow</i>
<i>I know you were there…</i>

793
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:28,793
Since we finished our work shift,
we can go out and have fun.

794
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,228
To Niseko, right?
I'm looking forward to it.

795
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:33,364
Let's make some more memories.

796
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,337
<i>I hear your voice</i>
<i>In the wind's quiet song</i>

797
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:45,209
<i>Fading like echoes whenever so long</i>

798
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,845
<i>I'll be reaching for</i>

799
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:50,481
<i>I'll be reaching for you</i>

800
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:51,816
<i>Now hold my hand</i>

801
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:53,951
<i>I promise that</i>

802
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:58,522
<i>With love </i>

803
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:03,294
<i>I can change the sky above </i>

804
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:08,299
<i>And rise a little higher</i>

805
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:14,538
<i>Until the stars feel closer</i>

806
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:18,542
<i>With love</i>

807
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:23,514
<i>I can change the sky above </i>

808
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:28,319
<i>And rise a little higher</i>

809
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:34,225
<i>Until the stars feel closer</i>

810
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,093
<i>Again</i>

811
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:43,601
Do you think Jobu is okay?

812
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,370
- He won't leave, will he?
- What? I don't want that.

813
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:49,373
Well, it would be understandable
if he did leave, don't you think?

814
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,442
He wouldn't wanna go to Niseko
in this situation.

815
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,944
That's the last place
he'd wanna go right now.

816
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,680
He was just told no, straight to his face,

817
00:41:56,747 --> 00:42:00,784
even though he asked William to be
brutally honest with him for his own good.

818
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,687
But, still,
hearing the truth always hurts.

819
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:05,689
And then they had a naked hug.

820
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:08,092
- A sweaty, naked hug.
- Yeah, that was also…

821
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:10,294
Yeah, the hug he wanted so badly
became the last hug.

822
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,430
- Oh, you're right!
- That makes it even worse!

823
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:16,700
- It's just too sad.
- Oh no!

824
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:18,168
It was sweaty, but it was good.

825
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:21,906
Yeah, I mean, I guess it would have
been weird if they got out of the sauna,

826
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,407
took a shower, got dressed,

827
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,676
and then hugged each other
to say thank you.

828
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,411
That was the only moment they could do it.

829
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:28,746
The only moment.
