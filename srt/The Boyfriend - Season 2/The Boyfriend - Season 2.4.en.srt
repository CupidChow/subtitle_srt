00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:21,388
IT SALES WORKER

2
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:29,729
IT COMPANY PROJECT MANAGER

3
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:34,434
- Who goes first?
- Hmm?

4
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,270
- What's wrong?
- Well…

5
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,939
It's because
of what we were talking about.

6
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:43,043
- Yeah.
- Did I say something weird?

7
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:48,181
No, but, I was just thinking,
"So William is someone who cheats."

8
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,351
It got me wondering a little.

9
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,090
No, there was a reason for it. Seriously.

10
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:01,261
It wasn't exactly cheating,
it was just kissing.

11
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:07,967
So, we kissed, and then…

12
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,503
it ended up turning into a big deal.

13
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,638
Mmm.

14
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:17,644
Somehow, he found out,
and decided to cheat for real.

15
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,713
But if he had trusted me
and not done anything,

16
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,149
things wouldn't have turned out like that.

17
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,251
- Hmm.
- It wasn't that simple.

18
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,620
So you're saying
it wasn't all your fault.

19
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:30,757
It wasn't my fault at all.
Well, it was both our faults.

20
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:34,360
You also said there was a reason
that you did what you did, right?

21
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,897
Well, let's drop this.

22
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:39,866
Yeah, but I'm glad I got to hear about it.

23
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,768
Let's talk again.

24
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,407
- So don't get turned off.
- Don't worry. I feel better now.

25
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:50,043
I was surprised
by how affected you were by this.

26
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,946
Can I be the one to start?

27
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,749
I feel better now.

28
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,887
But hearing something like that
makes you think, doesn't it?

29
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,623
- Mmm.
- I've grown from this.

30
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:08,495
I've analyzed my mistake
and reflect on myself objectively,

31
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,665
because I never wanna repeat
something like that ever again.

32
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:17,871
- It might not be a big deal, though.
- No, it is a big deal.

33
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:20,106
Wow, he's putting him on the spot.

34
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,641
- He really is.
- He does that.

35
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:25,612
Each person defines
their own personal values, right?

36
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:26,980
- Including cheating.
- Mmm.

37
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:30,583
Yeah, but I don't think
the definition matters.

38
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,420
I think it depends on whether or not

39
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:37,957
you really offended the person
you were dating.

40
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,325
Mmm. Mmm.

41
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:42,061
That's why I can say I've grown.

42
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,564
Mmm.

43
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,735
He's using the mirror to stare him down,
he won't let him get away.

44
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:53,706
He talked about
how it wasn't like he cheated,

45
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,842
in the sense
of sleeping with someone else.

46
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,745
So that was really a huge relief.

47
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:02,348
I mean, I feel like
I got to know William a little bit better.

48
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,851
<i>On the contrary, I was impressed.</i>

49
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,253
Usually, people try
to avoid talking about something

50
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,522
that happened to them like that to others.

51
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:13,059
But he talked about it honestly
without hiding anything,

52
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,929
and I thought he sounded very sincere.

53
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:20,667
I can tell that what he experienced in
that relationship has really changed him.

54
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:34,180
<i>- "Think easy," she said</i>

55
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,916

56

66

67

00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,554
<i>We used to dive</i>
<i>In our highest feelings</i>

69
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,557
<i>Are we growing older together?</i>

70
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,525
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

71
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:24,230
<i>I don't wanna miss anything</i>
<i>When I'm dreaming about</i>

72
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:27,500

UNIVERSITY STUDENT

74
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,172
TELECOM SALES WORKER

75
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:36,743
- How's it going lately?
- Lately?

76
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:40,446
- Yeah, I'm worried about you, Kazuyuki.
- Really? Thanks.

77
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,216
- Yeah, I'm worried about myself, too.
- Why is that?

78
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,151
What do you mean?

79
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,920
Are you still nice to everyone?

80
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,224
- Hmm, well…
- Like, I want to have a chat with you.

81
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,394
Yeah, I wanna talk to you too.
I wanna talk with everyone.

82
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,928
- I get that.
- The thing is…

83
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,331
- Let's talk in private today.
- Sure.

84
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,536
- I'm really worried about you.
- Hmm.

85
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,105
I feel like you're still being
considerate around everyone,

86
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,674
and everyone's worried about you.

87
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,108
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

88
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:10,009
I see.

89
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:13,212
It's like, you don't need
to be so considerate.

90
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,116
Being considerate, that's just
part of my personality, you know.

91
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,618
"Am I good enough?"

92
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:22,255
That question's always in my mind,
no matter what. I always ask myself that.

93
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,024
- Yeah, that's what I do.
- Did you lose confidence?

94
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,360
Hmm, I wasn't that confident
to begin with.

95
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:30,363
Hmm, I mean… yeah, I don't know.

96
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,732
Everyone here is
fairly talented, aren't they?

97
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,267
Yeah, I guess.

98
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,804
Yeah, they are.
But I seriously can't do anything.

99
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,807
Seriously,
I just want you to know one thing.

100
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,009
I don't know much
about academic backgrounds,

101
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,611
but if you look at it that way,
yeah, they're all very impressive.

102
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:49,015
- Yeah.
- But you also have lots of good qualities.

103
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:52,819
You're really thoughtful,
you have a broad outlook,

104
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:56,489
you can take initiative,
like to do the dishes and stuff.

105
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,991
<i>You have a lot of wonderful qualities.</i>

106
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:03,696
So far, I'm just
really enjoying living with everyone.

107
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:04,997
- Good, that's good.
- Yeah.

108
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,499
- I'm glad you feel that way.
- Yeah.

109
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,901
I'm having a blast, and it's fulfilling.

110
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,338
Don't worry. Time will take care of it.

111
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:17,910
Yeah. Little by little, I think
my true self will start showing.

112
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:21,080
Yeah, I hope that happens,
and I'll be attracted to someone,

113
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,982
and he'll be attracted to me.

114
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,917
That's my ideal situation, since I'm here.

115
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,552
Yeah, that's why you're here, after all.

116
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,554
- <i>That's right.</i>
- Let's do our best.

117
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,790
<i>I'm glad</i>
<i>they were able to talk about this.</i>

118
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,796
What kind of person are you attracted to?

119
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,465
I love it when someone can
laugh wholeheartedly.

120
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:42,902
I get that. And, on the contrary,
what is it that you can't stand?

121
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,904
- Besides cheating.
- Besides cheating?

122
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:49,041
- Sounds like a warning.
- He doesn't want to talk about cheating.

123
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,011
Uh…

124
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,780
Being lied to.

125
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,481
Yeah, of course.

126
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,518
Yeah. In my opinion,

127
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,654
even if it's hard to say,

128
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:07,894
it's better to be honest
about something rather than lie about it.

129
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,062
Yeah, I hate lies too.

130
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,332
Because when you lie,
it destroys the trust.

131
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,368
You don't know what to believe.

132
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:20,640
- But there are times when you have to lie.
- That's true.

133
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,775
Maybe it's the lies
that make the world interesting.

134
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:23,709
Yeah.

135
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:27,513
I think the kind of person
I'd really like as my next partner

136
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,716
is someone with experience.

137
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:35,121
And I know this might sound weird,
but when I was younger,

138
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,824
I always preferred someone
who didn't have much experience

139
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,026
or hadn't been influenced too much.

140
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:43,663
But now I want someone with experience.

141
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,832
Someone who is tired of playing around.

142
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,767
- Someone who's serious.
- Mmm.

143
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,902
I might feel more reassured.

144
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,472
- I know that's also what I'm looking for.
- Mm-hmm.

145
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,407
- You don't want the excitement anymore.
- Exactly.

146
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,375
- You don't. You really don't.
- Yeah, you're right.

147
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,412
Mmm.

148
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,215
Mmm.

149
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,153
I'll work on my legs now.

150
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,356
MARKETER AT MANUFACTURING COMPANY

151
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,961
- Thirty minutes, right?
- If you're going to the bath.

152
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,829
- You're not going, right?
- No, I'm not.

153
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,598
Izaya and William are going, you know.

154
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,899
Take a bath.

155
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,602
- I don't want to. Go!
- <i>That's true.</i>

156
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,872
If those two are taking a bath,
they can go first. I don't really want to.

157
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,340
I'm planning to go, though.

158
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,842
I'll finish in 30 minutes, then.

159
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,511
This'll be an intense session.

160
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,279
Lately, I've been working out

161
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,115
just to get jacked up before going
to the sauna or the bath.

162
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,417
- Oh!
- It's really pointless.

163
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,628
I like push-ups.

164
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:50,830
Hey.

165
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,968
- See you later.
- Uh-huh.

166
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,071
Enjoy the gym. Bye-bye.

167
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,949
Sorry to keep you waiting.

168
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,286
- It's okay.
- We going to the bath?

169
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,154
- Thinking about it.
- Yeah.

170
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,556
Okay, so, let's go.

171
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,291
You don't want to?

172
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:23,796
What time is it now?

173
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,033
It's around 4:30. Maybe 4:35.

174
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,002
- You wanna stay here?
- Mmm.

175
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,504
- You don't wanna go?
- Huh?

176
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,339
You don't want to go?

177
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,942
- Izaya, do you want to go?
- Maybe not today.

178
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,277
You don't wanna go? Why not?

179
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,447
- Well, we don't have much time.
- Oh, is that why?

180
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,857
I'm sorry I made you rush in the gym.

181
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,460
It's okay. If you're not going,
I'll go back to the gym.

182
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,696
- Is Kazuyuki working out?
- Yeah, he's not going.

183
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,531
- You should go.
- Yeah, you should go.

184
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,399
So you're not going today? Okay.

185
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,201
- Let's go another time.
- Let's.

186
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,136
- We can go whenever.
- Okay.

187
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,074
So, as I was saying…

188
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,011
<i>Oh, that's tough for Jobu.</i>

189
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,549
<i>That is tough. Jobu has been</i>
<i>going through a lot of tough experiences.</i>

190
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,189
- They're no longer going.
- Neither one?

191
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,559
- Because it's late?
- Maybe.

192
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,694
Maybe they didn't feel like it.

193
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,229
I feel so bad.

194
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,698
They were having a serious conversation.

195
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,567
- Really?
- Mmm.

196
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:38,104
- They were, while preparing dinner.
- A serious conversation?

197
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,940
They looked real serious, so I don't
know what they were talking about.

198
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,476
But they were like, "Maybe not today."

199
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,113
"Okay… no problem."

200
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,482
That's what happened.

201
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,785
I don't know what they were talking about.

202
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,121
Okay.

203
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:08,034
I think my previous experience
has made me a little anxious.

204
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,804
Or, should I say,
it's made me cautious of people.

205
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:15,107
- Hmm.
- Now I think twice before dating anyone.

206
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,344
Mm-hmm. That's understandable.

207
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:23,115
I was wondering, what would make you feel
you could take a step forward?

208
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,987
- I have no idea what would make me.
- Mmm.

209
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:34,293
<i>It's trust, right? I need</i>
<i>to prove to him that he can trust me.</i>

210
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,162
<i>Therefore, from now on,</i>

211
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:39,432
I need to figure out
the best way to approach William

212
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:42,201
so he can understand how serious I am.

213
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:47,773
To do that, I think that
the best way is to show him my true self.

214
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,741
Mm-hmm.

215
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,343
YOSHIMI, CHIAKI, THELMA, DURIAN

216
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,345
- Yeah, he's right.
- Mmm.

217
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:56,515
I did feel sorry for Jobu just now.

218
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,050
- It made my chest hurt.
- Yeah.

219
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:01,053
- He got jacked up for nothing.
- He was all sweaty, too.

220
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,023
Yeah. Even William was like,
"Why don't you go to the gym?"

221
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,926
- That was so sad.
- To hear someone say "You go" is tough.

222
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,228
Well, they were having
a pretty serious conversation,

223
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,931
even if Jobu suddenly appeared
all jacked up out of nowhere.

224
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,500
- I understand why they'd say, "Not now".
- I guess so.

225
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,603
- That's what happened.
- That was difficult to watch.

226
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,004
Miss, today, you're…

227
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,539
- What is it?
- Oh.

228
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,241
You're really dressed up today.

229
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,043
- You're right!
- What?

230
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,978
- Oh, I didn't notice.
- It's impressive!

231
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,580
Your wig is really impressive.

232
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,281
- I'm flattered.
- Amazing!

233
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,784
Now I finally feel like
I have time to catch my breath.

234
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,819
Oh, good. So you were feeling restless?

235
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,888
Up until now, it felt
like I was trying to show off.

236
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,823
- I felt embarrassed.
- Oh, stop!

237
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,860
- You look so glamorous. Fabulous.
- You look wonderful.

238
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,794
Thank you very much.

239
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:45,564
So, regarding the reason William
cheated in his past relationship.

240
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:48,167
- Is kissing considered cheating?
- Oh my.

241
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:51,070
- I don't know. If he kissed someone…
- Yeah.

242
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,672
- I don't know if that's cheating.
- Right.

243
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,075
- I don't like it.
- It would make you sulk a little.

244
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,843
Izaya was also leaning
on the gym equipment,

245
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,246
like, "You're never getting
away from me."

246
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,815
He was staring at him so intensely
through the mirror.

247
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,951
William said, "Not a big deal."
Izaya's like, "Yes, it is."

248
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,820
Earlier, we were watching the episode.

249
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,556
- You said we didn't need the truth.
- That's right, you did.

250
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,258
Right? Do you really think so?

251
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:15,427
Yeah, I really think so. For example,
you know,

252
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:18,397
if you want to know
absolutely everything about your partner,

253
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,600
then you would have to look through
their cell phone and everything they own.

254
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:25,471
You have to accept that there are things
you don't know about, and that's fine.

255
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:29,742
If you try to uncover everything
that is hidden in your partner's life,

256
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,545
it'll never end,
so you need to consciously realize that.

257
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:33,546
- Yes.
- True.

258
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:37,082
If you know 60 or 70%
of who they are, that's enough.

259
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,351
The leftover percentage is
made up by trusting them.

260
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,120
- I get it.
- Wow!

261
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,688
- That sounds good!
- I agree.

262
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,456
Excuse me, some white wine, please?

263
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,025
That sounds great!

264
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,828
- <i>Beautiful.</i>
- <i>Wow!</i>

265
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:51,530
<i>Love and snow really do go well together.</i>

266
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,171
Your eyebrows are light.

267
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:02,474
- <i>Those two joke around like that.</i>
- <i>Yeah, they seem pretty close.</i>

268
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,643
- You should draw them.
- I'll draw them.

269
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,213
- Draw them?
- Yeah. You have to tell the barber.

270
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,048
- I tell them right away.
- I was surprised.

271
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,016
I tell them not to trim them.

272
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,952
If you don't tell them,
they make them thinner.

273
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,054
- I ask them not to trim my facial hair.
- Yeah, yeah.

274
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,489
- Who'll do it?
- I've never drawn eyebrows.

275
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:20,559
I'm good at drawing eyebrows.
Your skin is super smooth. Seriously.

276
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:23,329
- Yeah, it's so smooth.
- You don't have any wrinkles.

277
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:26,198
- I thought so too.
- That's really amazing.

278
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,133
- Are you drawing them?
- Yeah.

279
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,603
I wanna draw the right eyebrow!

280
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:31,570
One side each?

281
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,440
You have no taste.

282
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,909
No, I'm just getting started.
Isn't this how you do it?

283
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,510
Oh, looking good.

284
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,013
Okay, look over here.
Look over here. Okay.

285
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,982
- You see? You see?
- It looks good.

286
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:47,152
But I can definitely do better.
I have a certain style in mind for you.

287
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,488
- Oh, really? But…
- Wait, what is it?

288
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,458
- A style?
- It won't suit me!

289
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:55,227
- A certain style!
- Make sure it's even.

290
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,529
- Keep the balance.
- So, this part, the start, is important.

291
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,431
- The start of the eyebrows right.
- Yeah!

292
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,700
But the eyebrows!

293
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,603
- Starts thicker.
- Bolder?

294
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,172
- Both brows are uneven?
- Totally uneven.

295
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,644
They look like Sei Shonagon's eyebrows.

296
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,813
Wait a second. This might help a little.

297
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,550
No, no, no.
The start of the eyebrow looks weird.

298
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,554
Let's have him decide
which one he likes better.

299
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,223
Face this way properly.

300
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,727
- <i>Cute!</i>
- It's pretty bad.

301
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,095
I'll take a picture for you.

302
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,730
- It's bad.
- This is bad.

303
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,232
This way, face this way.

304
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,071
- Hey, it looks super delicious.
- Yeah. It tastes good.

305
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:41,273
No way this doesn't taste good.

306
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,977
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy your meal.

307
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,314
- Mm, it's good.
- Delicious.

308
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,749
- You like Kazu's mom's soup?
- It's good.

309
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,651
- Kazu's mom's soup?
- It's delicious.

310
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,388
- It's okay.
- It's good! The miso soup is super good.

311
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,123
- Good.
- Kazu's soup?

312
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,893
- There's a bit of sugar in it.
- So that's it!

313
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,530
B.T.C.
US, JOURNEY, AND COFFEE

314
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,098
<i>No way!</i>

315
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,001
- Someone new!
- Yes, yes!

316
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,703
- Now?
- Nice!

317
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:17,409
- It's a lot of rice today. A bit too much.
- It's a bit too much.

318
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,244
It's a new bodybuilding diet?

319
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,984
- <i>A new member. How exciting!</i>
- <i>Hey, isn't he handsome?</i>

320
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,653
- Sorry, I served too much rice.
- Not at all.

321
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,755
- Did you serve the rice, Bomi?
- Yeah.

322
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,558
- Too much.
- You only apologized at the end.

323
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,927
I know.
I thought I could get away with it.

324
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,437
- We made eight cups of rice.
- Is it gone?

325
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,538
Is all the rice gone?

326
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,140
- No.
- Oh.

327
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,175
You really cooked a lot.

328
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,344
If there's any left,
someone can have it for breakfast.

329
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:55,114
- Yeah, of course.
- We'll eat it, don't worry.

330
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,582
Good evening.

331
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:58,584
Huh?

332
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,089
I'm Ryuki, and I'll be
living with you, starting today.

333
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,257
- Now?
- Hi, guys.

334
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,792
<i>He's the cute type!</i>

335
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,794
- Nice to meet you.
- Glad to be here.

336
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,896
- Glad to have you.
- Welcome in!

337
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,965
- We didn't know.
- What a surprise!

338
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,301
This is so unexpected.

339
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:20,706
I'm Ryuki, I'm 20.
I'm in my second year of college.

340
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,474
I work part-time at a café.

341
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:27,112
<i>My most recent relationship</i>
<i>was pretty painful.</i>

342
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:32,317
What I'm looking to do here
is regain the trust I lost in guys.

343
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:36,422
I want to talk to different people

344
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,158
<i>and develop my way of thinking.</i>

345
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:43,595
I hope this will help me
take a step forward

346
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:47,332
towards what I hope will be a new start.

347
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:53,272
<i>I think my dad would be really sad</i>
<i>about not being able to see my kids.</i>

348
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,873
<i>I think he'd be disappointed.</i>

349
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,644
- Take a seat.
- Excuse me.

350
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,546
- Excuse me.
- Stuff like this happens?

351
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,948
- <i>Huwei seems</i>…
- <i>There's something going on.</i>

352
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,284
- <i>They know each other.</i>
- <i>Do they?</i>

353
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,820
- I came from Osaka.
- Osaka?

354
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:09,988
Another person from Kansai.

355
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,491
- Strange timing?
- Someone new?

356
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:13,659
Strange timing.

357
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,527
- I'm Jobu.
- Hi.

358
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,629
Jobu. I'm from Osaka too.

359
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,332
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm William.

360
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,000
- I'm Izaya.
- Hi.

361
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,703
- Uh, I'm Kazuyuki. I'm from Osaka.
- Hi.

362
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,538
- Hi, I'm Bomi.
- Nice to meet you.

363
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,675
- I'm Hiroya. I'm from Osaka.
- So many people from Osaka.

364
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,745
- Do you two…
- We've hung out together before.

365
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,848
- Oh, really?
- With Huwei?

366
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:36,748
You two hung out?

367
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,485
I wouldn't call it hanging out.
We just went out for dinner.

368
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:40,919
- That's right.
- Yeah.

369
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,656
We just went out to dinner twice.

370
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:49,328
And after that, we were like,
"See you again soon."

371
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:52,831
But then he kept ghosting me,
and it's been like that until now.

372
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,000
So, yeah, it was a little awkward.

373
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,635
<i>I was like, "What are you doing here?"</i>

374
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,237
<i>And the other thing is that</i>

375
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,940
I didn't get a chance to meet
very many new people last year,

376
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:07,045
so the fact that two of them have ended
up here has taken me by surprise.

377
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,815
- How old are you?
- I'm 20.

378
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,550
Wow, you're so young!

379
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,186
- He's the youngest now.
- You're right, he is.

380
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,488
You look a bit like…

381
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,559
I can't believe he's half…
he's half my age.

382
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,829
- Yeah, he's half your age.
- That's so crazy.

383
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,231
- Don't be so nervous.
- I'm super nervous.

384
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,033
- Understandable.
- I really am.

385
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,301
It'll be okay.

386
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,003
- Right.
- We should have a toast.

387
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,804
- He hasn't had dinner yet.
- Oh.

388
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,140
- Let's give him something.
- You haven't?

389
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:39,611
I could make more <i>oyakodon.</i>

390
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,812
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

391
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,481
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

392
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,851
That was a big surprise, wasn't it?

393
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:54,660
- You must be nervous.
- I'm so nervous I can't talk.

394
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,896
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Thanks.

395
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,565
Here. Welcome to the Green Room.

396
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,266
Welcome to the Green Room!

397
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,402
Cheers!

398
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,206
Champagne and <i>oyakodon </i>don't go together.

399
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,309
- They don't.
- But this is good.

400
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,045
- It's delicious.
- <i>Oh no, he's flustered.</i>

401
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,013
<i>Oh my gosh, he's flustered!</i>

402
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:16,848
Is it good?

403
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,084
- It's very good.
- I'm glad.

404
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,954
What's up with you two?

405
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,656
What do you mean? What?

406
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,694
- You're so nosy.
- No, I mean, I'm just curious.

407
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,997
- Nothing. We just had dinner.
- You just had dinner.

408
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,232
Hmm.

409
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,000
Do you remember what you ate?

410
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,369
Um, it was Italian, right? Yeah.

411
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,571
Hmm.

412
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,840
Did you make the reservation, Huwei?

413
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,775
- There was no reservation.
- Not really.

414
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,311
It was kind of
a spontaneous dinner, wasn't it?

415
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,180
Yeah.

416
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,253
- When did you go?
- Hmm?

417
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,687
When did you go out to eat?

418
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:57,389
Um…

419
00:20:58,457 --> 00:20:59,891
In September.

420
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,095
- And December.
- December?

421
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:06,098
And yet you left me
waiting for a dinner invite,

422
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:08,567
Even though you said, "Let's go."

423
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,235
- <i>Aah!</i>
- Well, whatever.

424
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,971
- <i>So that's what happened.</i>
- <i>There, there. It happens.</i>

425
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,207
<i>Seriously, too much information.</i>

426
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,575
They met twice.

427
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,211
He said they met up twice for dinner.
He could've seen me.

428
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,648
They had Italian food.
Who cares about what they ate?

429
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:25,217
But he didn't make a reservation.

430
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,618
So I won there.

431
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,625
I don't know, maybe I do like Huwei.
I really don't know.

432
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,927
Yeah, it did make me a little jealous.

433
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,997
Ohh!

434
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:43,568
- A new member.
- Ryuki, about to shake things up.

435
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,237
And Hu-chan seemed pretty flustered

436
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,739
about seeing two of his ex-flirts
in the Green Room.

437
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,809
- Understandably so.
- I'm surprised Huwei can get flustered.

438
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:55,180
We thought Hu-chan was the perfect human
being, after all. He's always so composed.

439
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:58,417
But with everything that happened,
he got champagne all over himself.

440
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:02,854
- He spilled it.
- Maybe he had feelings for Ryuki?

441
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,891
They had dinner together twice.
He probably felt attracted to him,

442
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:07,893
and maybe asked him out a third time.

443
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,429
But he kept being ghosted
and was like, "What's going on?"

444
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,530
But now they've met again.

445
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:15,367
And then Bomi is like,
"But he made a dinner reservation for me."

446
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,135
- That was really cute.
- He was like, "I win!"

447
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:19,971
That was cute.

448
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,341
Now that he's the youngest
member of the group,

449
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:26,611
the fraternal relationships are
going to drastically change.

450
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,680
For sure.
They were worried if he had eaten.

451
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,449
They asked "Do you want something to eat?"

452
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,118
- All the attention focused on him.
- True.

453
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,721
I wonder what Bomi,
the former youngest one, feels about this.

454
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:40,959
Yeah, and especially since he, too,
had something special going on with Hu.

455
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,096
I was impressed that everyone introduced
themselves pretty quickly.

456
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,397
"Hiroya." "Jobu."

457
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:50,035
But Kazuyuki introduced himself carefully,
like, "I'm Kazuyuki."

458
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,604
- He's a wonderful human being.
- You're so observant.

459
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:53,872
- I'm impressed.
- He is.

460
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:57,642
- Wow! There's so much snow.
- Yeah, the weather is nice too.

461
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:58,677
It's crazy!

462
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:01,380
Does it usually snow this much?
Hu, you can do throws.

463
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,014
You can do shoulder throws.

464
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,283
- Doesn't look like it would hurt.
- Right?

465
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,887
- Let's do this.
- You ready?

466
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,258
Yaah!

467
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,672
No. Izaya, Izaya. Stop.
The two of us get Izaya.

468
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,574
We all get Izaya! We all get Izaya!

469
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:32,210
<i>Aw, how cute!</i>

470
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,546
<i>- Nice.</i>
- <i>This is what youth is all about!</i>

471
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,014
Ready, go!

472
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:43,221
What are you spacing out for?

473
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,963
- <i>The way the snow flies up!</i>
- <i>It's nice.</i>

474
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,666
<i>It's the winter version</i>
<i>of splashing water at the beach.</i>

475
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:56,268
- <i>Exactly.</i>
- <i>I get it.</i>

476
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,069
<i>…feel it another time</i>

477
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,939
<i>No matter what</i>
<i>Don't you stay in the line </i>

478
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,041
<i>You'd better stay alive </i>

479
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,744
<i>And try to listen, listen, uh-oh </i>

480
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,747
<i>No matter what</i>
<i>Don't you stay in the line </i>

481
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,749
<i>You'd better stay alive </i>

482
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,385
<i>And try to listen, listen, uh-oh </i>

483
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,222
Oh.

484
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,524
- Oh, here it is.
- How scary.

485
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:22,661
You should show him.

486
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,165
Yeah. Press that.

487
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,000
Please read it aloud.

488
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,636
- "Good morning."
- Good morning.

489
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,739
"Here's the person on duty
for today's shift."

490
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,243
- "For today, Kazuyuki will be on duty."
- Finally!

491
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,144
Oh!

492
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:41,246
Congratulations!

493
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,282
I'm getting applause
just for being chosen.

494
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,751
Okay.

495
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,654
- Hardest to guess.
- Yeah.

496
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,156
Who will it be?

497
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,757
<i>So, who will it be?</i>

498
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,860
<i>If it's someone he's close to, it's Jobu.</i>

499
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,395
<i>Or will he choose someone</i>
<i>he's interested in romantically?</i>

500
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:58,897
<i>Who will he choose?</i>

501
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,903
- <i>It's Jobu!</i>
- Let's go.

502
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,772
I have no choice! Just kidding.

503
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,175
- It's been a while. Let's do this.
- Have fun.

504
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,514
I will. Bye, everyone.

505
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,429
Do you think we can make 7,000 yen today?

506
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:32,430
We can do it.

507
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:35,033
Okay, that's our goal.

508
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,770
If you really want
to enjoy the taste of coffee,

509
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:41,506
I would recommend the drip coffee, yeah.

510
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:44,242
The beans are carefully selected
and absolutely delicious.

511
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,711
- So please give the drip coffee a try!
- I see.

512
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:49,481
When it's ready,
I'll go like, "Beep, beep!"

513
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,515
Like, "Beep, beep, beep."

514
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:51,750
- Got it!
- Thanks.

515
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:54,386
- <i>His skills are amazing.</i>
- <i>He's a great salesman.</i>

516
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:56,087
<i>He's really impressive.</i>

517
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:00,025
Excuse me, sorry for the wait.
Here's your chocolate milk.

518
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:01,092
Thank you very much.

519
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,595
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

520
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:06,097
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.

521
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,400
- Eighteen cups?
- Isn't that a new record?

522
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:09,334
Maybe.

523
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,470
- Shall we close up?
- Yeah, good idea.

524
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:13,939
- <i>See?</i>
- <i>Impressive!</i>

525
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:15,707
TODAY'S SALES:
8,800 YEN

526
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,913
WHAT'S EVERYONE UP TO?
DON'T GO TO THE SAUNA WITHOUT ME.

527
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,482
- <i>He's texting.</i>
- <i>Is he texting William?</i>

528
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,151
- <i>A group chat?</i>
- <i>Maybe.</i>

529
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:27,752
<i>Did they make a group chat?</i>

530
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:33,525
I thought I could probably have the most
fun and best vibe with you, Jobu.

531
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:34,926
- That's true.
- Yeah.

532
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,395
So, that's why I wanted to work with you.

533
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,733
Last time, you went with Will.

534
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:43,935
Did you have a good talk?

535
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,571
I could only say about half
of what I wanted to say.

536
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:50,375
I always end up joking around
and laughing. I can't be serious.

537
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,345
- Say what I want to say in an honest way.
- Is it because you're embarrassed?

538
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:57,816
I think Will prefers serious things to be
discussed seriously in a serious context.

539
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:59,684
- Yeah, I got that impression too.
- Definitely.

540
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:02,454
So even if it's a little embarrassing,

541
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,523
I think it might be best
to talk to him seriously.

542
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,292
I have to talk to him seriously.

543
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,794
Hmm, so I'm thinking
of talking to him today.

544
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:12,764
Tonight? What are you going
to tell him tonight?

545
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:13,832
Hmm?

546
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:18,003
- That I really like him.
- Oh, right, right.

547
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:20,739
I don't want things to end
without having said anything.

548
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:23,875
As far as I'm concerned,

549
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:26,845
I can't say that I've gotten
to that point either.

550
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:28,647
You're still too considerate.

551
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:32,317
Well, that's just normal for me.
Everyone has kind of started teasing me.

552
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:34,285
Oh yeah? Well, that's
a lot more playful, right?

553
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:36,021
- It's better.
- It's definitely better.

554
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:39,524
You know, among all the members,
you're the one I feel most at ease with.

555
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:40,725
Oh, that's good.

556
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,460
Older guys are easier to talk to.

557
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,863
They're easier to talk to,

558
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:49,034
and I think they're interesting
because they know things I don't know.

559
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,636
Like, you were in a relationship
for 15 years.

560
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:54,205
- Yeah.
- I've never met anyone like you.

561
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:57,842
- I think that's amazing.
- 15 years passed before I realized it.

562
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,945
But that's not easy to do.
I don't think it's easy to do.

563
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:04,449
- Especially for people like us.
- Yeah. I guess not.

564
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:08,253
A new relationship,
it'd be nice if that could happen.

565
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,021
Do you like someone?

566
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:13,992
Hmm, no, I… I haven't thought
about it that much, not in that sense.

567
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:16,761
- But you haven't given up?
- No.

568
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,930
Then that's fine.
If you think you don't have a chance,

569
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,398
you have to stop thinking like that.

570
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:21,800
Mmm, mmm.

571
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,136
Well, yes, I do hope it happens.

572
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,838
Good. Then that's fine.

573
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,908
You have two months
to focus your thoughts on this.

574
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:33,144
With two months,
you can think about a lot of things.

575
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,859
William and I are going
to step out for a bit.

576
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,828
- Okay.
- Be right back.

577
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,196
See you later, guys.

578
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:57,135
- Where are we going?
- Just over there.

579
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:58,770
- Outside?
- Outside.

580
00:28:58,837 --> 00:28:59,838
<i>To the igloo?</i>

581
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,207
<i>Oh, do you think so?</i>

582
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:04,509
<i>Close the blinds properly.</i>

583
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,080
This way.

584
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:10,949
Ta-da!

585
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:14,119
What is this? It's super nice.
Oh, there are even lights!

586
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,690
- This is our first date in an igloo.
- Oh, it's cute.

587
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,959
- After you.
- <i>He called it a date.</i>

588
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,560
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>He sure did.</i>

589
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:25,063
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- It's my first time. Can we fit?

590
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,198
We can fit. Watch your step.

591
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,967
- Oh!
- Are you in?

592
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:34,172
- Wow! This is nice.
- It's not that cold.

593
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,507
- It's not cold!
- Right?

594
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:37,642
- It won't collapse, will it?
- It won't.

595
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:40,278
- This is awesome.
- I know, right?

596
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:42,413
So this is what you worked so hard on.

597
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,382
Yeah, I worked hard
shaving the snow like this.

598
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,020
<i>Because I wanted to go in here with you.</i>

599
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,489
I was thinking of you while digging away.

600
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:54,392
- During all that time?
- Of course.

601
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,295
So, since the weather's been nice lately,

602
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:00,632
I thought it might melt and
we wouldn't be able to come here,

603
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:01,833
and I would really regret it.

604
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,368
So I wanted to ask you out quickly.

605
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,703
Oh, I get it.
That's what was on your mind?

606
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,005
That was on my mind.

607
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:11,543
I was worried someone else might want
to come here with you for the first time.

608
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,812
Your first time,
I wanted to be with you for that.

609
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,717
I didn't want someone else to take you
first. That was on my mind too.

610
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:22,453
I want to take action
when the idea comes to me.

611
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:26,891
So, that's why I asked you out quickly.

612
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,035
I'm happy, but…

613
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:43,007
Um, I don't know, but people who do that
kind of thing do it to everyone, you know?

614
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:46,377
People who are good at keeping in touch
are the same with everyone.

615
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:48,913
I only do it with people I like.

616
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:51,015
No way.

617
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,418
Of course it's true.

618
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:58,957
<i>You're still a shadow</i>
<i>I know you are there</i>

619
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,192
<i>I'll be waiting for</i>

620
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,761
<i>I'll be waiting for you</i>

621
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:06,197
<i>Now hold my hand, I promise…</i>

622
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:09,734
I wonder what exactly
is so great about me.

623
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:10,768
Hmm.

624
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,105
How should I put it?

625
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,508
I guess everything.

626
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:21,880
Like the way you express your feelings

627
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,116
without holding anything back.

628
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:26,918
I really like that about you.

629
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,588
I like you. Yeah, I like you.

630
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,291
Oops, I said it. Oh well. And…

631
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:37,629
<i>With love</i>

632
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:40,531
<i>I can change the sky above</i>

633
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:43,201
You have a surprisingly
sensitive side too.

634
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:47,405
<i>And rise a little higher</i>

635
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:51,142
<i>Until the truth is</i>…

636
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:55,280
I'm looking at everything about you.

637
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:03,288
But the thing that scares me
is the way things are progressing.

638
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:07,025
Or, should I say, the speed
at which things are progressing.

639
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:09,761
That's what makes me a little nervous.

640
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:14,232
I worry a lot about
whether I can live up to your feelings.

641
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,036
I'm concerned that your emotions
are getting ahead of you,

642
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:21,606
that they're spilling over,
and that you're letting things slip out,

643
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:25,310
just like you accidentally
let your feelings slip out earlier.

644
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:26,210
Hmm.

645
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:30,048
It's not like I feel pressure, but…

646
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:36,921
I do want to meet your feelings,
of course, but I'm conflicted.

647
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:42,226
Well, with regards to that, I obviously
don't want you to feel pressured at all.

648
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,497
All I really want is for you to think
things through

649
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:50,969
as we share moments together
and spend time here together.

650
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:53,604
<i>I want you to be with me…</i>

651
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,840
Thank you. I was surprised.

652
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:57,608
- You were surprised?
- Yeah.

653
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,510
- I'm happy.
- Are you happy?

654
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:02,347
Are you embarrassed?

655
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,515
<i>I know you are there</i>

656
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:06,985
<i>I'll be waiting for</i>

657
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:09,320
<i>I'll be waiting for you</i>

658
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:10,989
<i>Now hold my hand</i>

659
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:13,024
<i>I promise that, that… </i>

660
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:17,028
Wow, the lights are amazing.
Were they always here?

661
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:20,098
- Yeah.
- Maybe I never noticed.

662
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:25,203
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa! My sweater's caught.

663
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:30,274
Huh? Wow, it feels like
there's no one here.

664
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:33,945
Hello, guys, welcome back.

665
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,314
- Welcome back.
- Hi. We're back.

666
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,082
- Hello.
- Here they are.

667
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,084
Where are the others?

668
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,988
- Where are the other two?
- They went somewhere.

669
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,524
- Said they had something to do.
- Oh, I see.

670
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,360
Could you grab the oil for me, please?

671
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:52,330
- <i>Oh! No! Don't go there!</i>
- <i>He's going to see them.</i>

672
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:53,765
We should clean up?

673
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:56,968
Yeah, let's clean up, since
there's nothing else for us to do here.

674
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,471
There's not much… Oh!

675
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,141
What?

676
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,979
They're having a chat.

677
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,581
That's such a great place to talk.

678
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,360
- Was it fun?
- It was fun.

679
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:23,494
That's good.

680
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,130
About the cake flour,
maybe we don't need it.

681
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:28,066
Just give me some regular flour.

682
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,734
Mix it with water.

683
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:32,470
If you need me to clean
that up, I'd like to do it.

684
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:34,639
- [Yeah, let's clean it up.
- Okay.

685
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,144
Okay, shall we wash up?

686
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:54,492
We're back.

687
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,961
- Oh, they're back.
- They're back!

688
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:59,330
- We're just cleaning up.
- How'd it go?

689
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,299
- It was fun.
- It went well and it was fun.

690
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:02,900
Was it fun? Did you fight?

691
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,536
We'll fight later.

692
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,840
- Looking forward to your stories.
- Yes, with pleasure.

693
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:11,042
- Our stories.
- Our stories.

694
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,246
This thing is getting a lot of
bubbles in between these things.

695
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:18,916
- Should we still use this towel?
- What did we use it for?

696
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:21,319
Um, it was on the trash can.

697
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,454
<i>He's really discouraged.</i>
<i>He can't stand up.</i>

698
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,690
<i>- He has to lean on the wall.</i>
- <i>He's really down.</i>

699
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:27,792
- You still gonna talk to him?
- Hm?

700
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,494
- Are you gonna talk to him?
- No way.

701
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,162
- Why not?
- I won't talk to him.

702
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,897
You're kidding. Why not?

703
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:36,200
- There's no time.
- Not true.

704
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,240
I think you should talk to him.

705
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:45,042
- You'll regret it if you don't.
- No way.

706
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:52,717
- Pork miso soup?
- Pork miso soup.

707
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:53,851
It's really good.

708
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:57,355
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy your meal.

709
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,458
This looks good.

710
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,660
It's a complete pork miso soup.

711
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,128
How were your sales?

712
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:07,865
- Today, we made 8,800 yen!
- Wow, that's amazing!

713
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:10,101
- Amazing.
- That the highest sales so far.

714
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,003
- It is.
- You broke the record.

715
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,205
- We broke the record with 18 cups. Was it?
- Yeah.

716
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:15,439
- Amazing!
- 18 cups?

717
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,408
Okay, tell us. What's your secret?

718
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,177
- Our vibe?
- Our vibe.

719
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:20,645
- Vibe?
- That's great.

720
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,247
What did you guys do?

721
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:26,484
Well, we shoveled snow.

722
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:28,286
- And we shoveled snow.
- I see.

723
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:31,722
And then,
all three of us went to the sauna.

724
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:33,157
An impulse decision?

725
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:34,358
<i>It was.</i>

726
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:37,628
<i>- He got shirtless on his second day here.</i>
- <i>It was nice. I was shirtless.</i>

727
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,631
<i>They went even though he texted them.</i>

728
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,099
<i>The truth comes out!</i>

729
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,801
- Did you talk?
- I think so.

730
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,503
- You talked, right?
- Yeah.

731
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,771
SEEN BY: BOMI, HIROYA, KAZUYUKI

732
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:47,905
It went by so fast.

733
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,274
It was a good opportunity to talk to Ryu.

734
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:51,609
True.

735
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,477
- He's "Ryu" now?
- Yeah.

736
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,546
- Really?
- Yeah, we call him Ryu.

737
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:57,748
- It's easier.
- Please call me Ryu.

738
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,386
I thought you were doing
a coffee training session with Ryuki.

739
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,822
- We did that.
- We did that after you left.

740
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,557
- Sorry, I forgot.
- We did.

741
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,194
- He wasn't a beginner. He had experience.
- Yeah, he did.

742
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,530
- Of course.
- He picked it up right away.

743
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:13,764
He does latte art.

744
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:16,367
- He's ready for work.
- I can feel the pressure!

745
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,605
Yeah, don't worry.

746
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:24,075
<i>This is so painful.</i>

747
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:28,012
- <i>I know.</i>
- <i>Yeah, this is so sad.</i>

748
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,314
- I'd go to my room and cry.
- I'd cry.

749
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:32,550
- I would totally cry.
- I can feel his pain.

750
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:34,785
Maybe, by the time Jobu sent that text,

751
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:37,488
they had already decided to go
to the sauna, or had already gone.

752
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:40,057
It could be something as simple
as what you're saying,

753
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:45,096
but the fact is that Jobu still felt
a little left out of the group activities.

754
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,431
And then he comes back
and sees the two of them,

755
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:49,500
chatting away outside,
all cozy in the igloo.

756
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,102
That's a double-strike to the morale.

757
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,337
It's hard enough to see
the person you like

758
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,973
walking around town with someone else.

759
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,375
But they're in the igloo together!

760
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,111
- My jaw would literally hit the floor.
- It's so cozy!

761
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:02,546
It's too much, It's way too shocking.

762
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,548
The igloo might be destroyed
the next morning.

763
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,017
Absolutely.

764
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:08,953
- Jobu could hit it with a shovel.
- "Take that! Yeah!"

765
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,855
- In the middle of the night.
- He might.

766
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:16,661
- This person is really cute too.
- Who was it again?

767
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:19,730
This person is the cute type,
unlike the previous one.

768
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,066
Oh, have you watched the TV show?

769
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,335
<i>- Smiley, </i>right? Yeah!
- <i>Smiley!</i>

770
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,837
What's <i>Smiley?</i>
There's a TV drama called <i>Smiley.</i>

771
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:29,273
- TV drama? A gay drama?
- Set in Barcelona.

772
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,676
- I see.
- Set in Barcelona. It's cute!

773
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:35,146
- Super cute.
- This drama made me like this person.

774
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:38,082
But these people probably have
their own thing going on, right?

775
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,518
- Yeah, probably.
- Yeah, who knows? Probably.

776
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:44,188
Their own issues,
or non-issues, more likely

777
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:52,697
Wait, who was that?

778
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,471
<i>He's done it now. Yep, that did it.</i>

779
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:03,674
Nothing good ever comes
from looking at someone's phone.

780
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,609
- Learn from season one.
- Never look!

781
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,812
- Leave it in your room.
- You see Izaya's face?

782
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,451
- Once I start, I do a bit every day.
- What's on your mind?

783
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,252
- Hmm?
- What's on your mind?

784
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:17,755
- Why?
- Because you're like this.

785
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:18,789
Izaya] Hmm.

786
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,559
Hmm. It's nothing.

787
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:33,471
I was looking at William's phone with him,
and he received a heart emoji.

788
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,474
And I was taken by surprise.

789
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:39,944
<i>I couldn't help but jump to the conclusion</i>

790
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:43,180
<i>that he probably has</i>
<i>multiple connections like that.</i>

791
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,084
Mmm.

792
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,087
<i>It's like, you know…</i>

793
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:53,824
- This is tough.
- Huh?

794
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,025
It's tough.

795
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:08,139
It was a text someone sent me.

796
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:10,975
It was from someone
I used to message with.

797
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,244
A person from my past,
meaning that it's someone I knew

798
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,179
before I came here to the Green Room.

799
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,115
Nothing at all has happened
since I got here.

800
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:20,284
If you want,
you can even look at the dates.

801
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,522
- No more looking at phones!
- Come on!

802
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:00,491
Please turn your phones off.

803
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:03,527
- Or better, throw them away. Am I right?
- He should turn it off.

804
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:06,263
When you're looking at your phone
with someone, you get a text!

805
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,233
- It's scary. You're so right.
- That's so true.

806
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,268
It's like destiny is
playing a trick on you.

807
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:13,838
Understandably, Izaya started sulking

808
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:16,073
and decided to go back to his room.

809
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,875
I understand why he did.

810
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:20,544
But the mood got so dark
and negative once again.

811
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:23,581
I'm sure William feels
somehow responsible for that.

812
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,316
- And they're not dating yet.
- Yeah.

813
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,384
- They're not dating yet.
- Exactly.

814
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,520
And until now, he's been holding it in.

815
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:32,790
But then the words "It's tough"
finally slipped out, and we knew.

816
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:36,393
I think that's how William has always
felt, all along, from the beginning.

817
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,328
Yeah.

818
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,241
- Is everyone leaving?
- I'm leaving.

819
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:52,309
- We should sleep.
- Going to bed.

820
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:55,579
What is it?

821
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,215
Do you mind if we talk for a bit?

822
00:41:58,282 --> 00:41:59,450
I don't mind at all.

823
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:01,619
Goodnight.

824
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,654
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

825
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:05,456
See you tomorrow.

826
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:11,428
Well, actually,
I had made up my mind yesterday.

827
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:14,565
I was planning on having
a private chat with you today.

828
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,734
- Really?
- Yeah, I was…

829
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:21,605
Okay, wait, I'm really not good
at talking one-on-one like this.

830
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:24,275
You probably noticed that
when we talked last time.

831
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:25,476
Yeah, I did notice.

832
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:29,613
Yeah, I've never had the experience of
sharing my feelings one-on-one like this,

833
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,448
so I'm not very good at this at all.

834
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,018
Yeah, and, um…

835
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,120
What I want to say is…

836
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,823
I'm really attracted to you.

837
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,894
Um, you have a very unique charm
that attracts me.

838
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,631
You have a playful side
and like to have fun.

839
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:51,068
When you take the time to explain
and talk about your work,

840
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,404
you talk about it with passion,

841
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:57,675
and I think people who are passionate
about the work they do

842
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,843
are cool in so many ways.

843
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:04,081
I wanted to let you know
I'm really attracted to you.

844
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:08,018
- Thank you.
- Sure!

845
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,654
I don't know if "thank you"
is the right thing to say, but…

846
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:12,022
I'm glad I told you.

847
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:17,428
Well, I'm kind of confused after
having talked about so many things.

848
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:18,329
Of course.

849
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:22,199
Yeah, I'm being chosen by two people.

850
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:25,669
I know that this might sound weird.

851
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:28,772
- But I knew Izaya before here.
- Yeah.

852
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:33,310
So, yeah, and I actually have
a past with him.

853
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:34,712
Izaya and I.

854
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,513
- I see.
- So, there's that.

855
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:39,783
We didn't just meet up once or
twice casually with some friends.

856
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:45,055
When I went out with Izaya,
we actually went out on proper dates.

857
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:50,494
- Then it kind of faded away.
- Mmm.

858
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:53,130
But I was the one who initiated that.

859
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:55,132
Izaya just accepted it.

860
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:59,269
Honestly, I don't remember
what the reason was.

861
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:03,240
But when I ran the truck with Izaya,

862
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,410
he told me how he felt,
and from that moment,

863
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,545
the way I look at Izaya changed.

864
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:11,382
Yeah. But to be honest, I'm still trying

865
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:13,751
to work through my feelings,

866
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,487
and I'm still very unsure.

867
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:17,621
You don't know.

868
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:21,358
But I know I can't face
both of you at the same time.

869
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:22,292
Mmm.

870
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,342
Thank you.

871
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:39,943
Yes, thank you.

872
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:44,181
- We should go to sleep.
- Let's go to sleep.

873
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:06,697
Oh.

874
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,401
Let's see.

875
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:17,040
- "Good morning."
- Good morning.

876
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:21,345
"You will now be going
on a one-on-one date."

877
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:22,513
Huh?

878
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,816
- For real?
- I see.

879
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:28,118
- That's sudden.
- What? All of a sudden?

880
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:29,987
Okay, then.

881
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:34,424
"Write the name of the person
you want to go with on a piece of paper."

882
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:36,493
"You can only go on a date
if your feelings,

883
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,763
and the feelings of the person
you've chosen, are mutual."

884
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:20,163
- What? No way!
- Wait a minute. Hey!

885
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,665
- Don't end here!
- Not fair!

886
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,767
- This is unbearable!
- This is awful!

887
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:26,503
- This is unbearable!
- They really like doing this, hey?

888
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:30,574
- A date night, with all that's going on?
- It's too much.

889
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:33,777
Damn, every cell in my body
is just freaking out now!

890
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:36,213
With so much happening,
you can't help but freak out.

891
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,548
- It's overwhelming!
- They really did it this time. Right?

892
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:42,719
So, Jobu asked to speak to William,
said he had something to say,

893
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:44,588
and confessed his feelings.

894
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:47,224
- What's your take on this, sensei?
- What's your take?

895
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:50,093
It's not easy being approached
by two people at once.

896
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,962
So, if he's not into Jobu
in the first place,

897
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:53,830
he wants to shut it down right away.

898
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:54,932
Oh!

899
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:57,000
But William is a happy kind of person,

900
00:48:57,067 --> 00:49:00,037
and I think he's really uncomfortable
turning people down.

901
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,104
I see.

902
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:06,743
So, in my opinion, I think he might have
used the whole past situation with Izaya

903
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:09,947
as an excuse to make it easier
for him to say no to Jobu.

904
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:14,384
- That's based on your own experience?
- Oh no! What gave me away?

905
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:17,487
- It was the passion.
- So intense.

906
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:19,756
- You hit the nail on the head.
- It was very deep.

907
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:21,325
That's how it looked to me.

908
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:25,228
It didn't seem like he wanted
to deal with either of them, to be honest.

909
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:28,031
He's already having a hard time
dealing with Izaya,

910
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:30,801
and after what's happened,
I don't think there's any chance left.

911
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:32,336
No!

912
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:33,804
That's what I think.

913
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,106
Do you think
I'm turning into a bad person?

914
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:38,575
Most definitely.

915
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,210
- You're very convincing.
- Yeah.

916
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:42,012
I can tell you've been through this.

917
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,514
- We know it's true.
- It's based on your experience.

918
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:46,483
To understand a criminal, ask a criminal.

919
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,719
You're absolutely right.
