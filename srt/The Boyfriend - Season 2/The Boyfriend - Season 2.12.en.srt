1
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:18,885
<i>Everybody's talking about you</i>

2
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,960
<i>Everybody's talking about you</i>

3
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,628
A little more…

4
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,363
I'll crouch down, so… Yeah. Oh!

5
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,166
- If you crouch down, we'll all have to.
- No, Taeheon, stay there.

6
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,403
- Bomi, put your head down above mine.
- Do you want me to stay here?

7
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:37,604
- Yeah.
- Okay.

8
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:39,639
Three, two, one.

9
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,343
- Nice.
- It kind of looks fun.

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,145
- Yay.
- Everyone looks cute.

11
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:48,214
If they're in Sapporo,
they might get swarmed by customers.

12
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:50,316
- You're right. And they have Taeheon.
- Yeah.

13
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,218
Welcome.

14
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,354
Do you have the Japanese menu?

15
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,457
- Oh, Taeheon!
- You recognize him? She knows you.

16
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:58,992
- Thank you.
- <i>This is kind of…</i>

17
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,962
I saw this truck and had a hunch,
so I came back to see.

18
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:04,998
Thank you very much.

19
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,802
- You were on the show, right?
- Oh, uh…

20
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,704
Wow! My eyes are sparkling.

21
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:13,540
- Wow, wow, wow.
- Thank you.

22
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:14,574
Thanks.

23
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,344
What… what do you say to…

24
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,914
to customers in situations like this?

25
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,249
Do you ask them what they like or not?

26
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:24,717
Oh, about the menu?

27
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:27,020
No, I mean… Never mind. Hot!

28
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,156
- Sorry. Sorry. Are you okay?
- <i>Did some coffee get on him?</i>

29
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,826
<i>It's always funny when someone</i>
<i>gets something hot on them.</i>

30
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,661
How much did we make?

31
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:43,536
This much.

32
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,940
We need to work harder for another hour.

33
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,610
- Those two are about the same height.
- Yeah, they are.

34
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:53,680
I didn't think Taeheon would choose him.

35
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,117
You really can't tell
what people are thinking.

36
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,385
US, JOURNEY, AND COFFEE

37
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,488
- They're English speakers.
- English?

38
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,356
- Americano?
- Americano?

39
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,291
- What size would you like to get?
- Small.

40
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,893
- Small one?
- I'll make it.

41
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,329
- Where are you from?
- Indonesia.

42
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,231
- Indonesia? Oh.
- Yeah.

43
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,099
Uh, my name is Tae.

44
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,370
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

45
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,906
- Here's the two Americanos.
- Okay.

46
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,441
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

47
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,576
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

48
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,946
I'm studying Malay,
but I can't speak very fluently yet.

49
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:27,881
Oh!

50
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:29,782
- You're not fluent yet?
- Thank you.

51
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:32,852
- That's amazing.
- That's amazing. Hey, hey!

52
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,021
How many languages can he speak?

53
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,723
He's superhuman.

54
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:41,928
How about some coffee?
Would you like some coffee?

55
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,130
<i>Bomi is speaking in Korean.</i>

56
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,298
<i>That's amazing.</i>

57
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,201
- The menu.
- The menu.

58
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,502
Oh, please take a look.

59
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,804
What size cup of coffee would you like?

60
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,973
- The smaller one.
- The smaller one? Understood.

61
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,544
- Americano? Regular?
- Drip coffee, small.

62
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,846
The man's from Korea.

63
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,415
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

64
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,317
Bomi called him over.

65
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:05,752
How's it going?

66
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,322
- It's 100 times more fun than last time.
- Can you talk to him now? Good.

67
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,990
<i>Oh, he's dancing!</i>

68
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:14,160
I changed underwear after it was decided.
I was like, "Hold on," and dashed.

69
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,162
I changed underwear so fast.

70
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,498
You changed underwear like this.

71
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,934
- Your lucky underwear.
- I changed into my lucky underwear.

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,835
- <i>Oh, that's great.</i>
- <i>How cute.</i>

73
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:23,770
It was fun.

74
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:27,273
- <i>24,100 yen!</i>
- <i>Sapporo is different, isn't it?</i>

75
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,577
I wonder what they're doing in Sapporo.

76
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,613
I bet they're gonna be super popular.

77
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,715
I mean,
people would recognize Taeheon, right?

78
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:36,749
That's true.

79
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,153
Something came to mind
that's completely unrelated,

80
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,287
but can I bring it up?

81
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,355
Mm.

82
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:47,427
I have a lot of prejudice
against gay culture, if I wanna be honest.

83
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:48,494
Okay.

84
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:52,398
Which means I don't like going to places
like Shinjuku Ni-chome.

85
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:53,733
Mm.

86
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,237
- But you visit that area often, right?
- Mm.

87
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,305
Hmm.

88
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:04,043
I like it
because it's a really great area to visit.

89
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:04,978
I see.

90
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:06,246
I spent my whole life

91
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:10,083
thinking I was nothing more
than a gross and crazy person.

92
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,919
But when I went there,

93
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,455
I felt like everyone was my friend,

94
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:20,593
and that was something
that really… saved me.

95
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,996
- I see.
- Yeah, that's how I feel.

96
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,433
So is it to build that sense of community
and expand their connections?

97
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:31,304
that everyone… fools around like crazy,

98
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,072
does flashy activities

99
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,209
and stuff like that?
Do you think that plays a part?

100
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,577
Hmm.

101
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,246
Who knows? I don't know.
I don't know what you're imagining.

102
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,216
- When I look at the gay community…
- Mm.

103
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,119
I often have the feeling that

104
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:50,523
they communicate in a way
in which I don't see myself fitting in.

105
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,626
Wait, what do you mean
by "the gay community"?

106
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,228
Hmm.

107
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,298
For example, people who go to barbecues

108
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:02,368
and go to Sakura viewing parties
in a large group and get all rowdy.

109
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,971
- Do you have to be gay to do that?
- No, I guess you don't.

110
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,639
I get a strong sense

111
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:10,777
you really don't wanna be lumped together
with other gay people.

112
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,613
I guess that's true. I suppose so.

113
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,449
You know,
discussing this right now with you

114
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:20,353
makes me think
my parents probably feel the same way.

115
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,889
- Is that so?
- Mm.

116
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,464
<i>This was supposed to be</i>
<i>a lighthearted conversation.</i>

117
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:34,867
<i>Hiroya can't help but ask</i>
<i>uncomfortable questions.</i>

118
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,537
Wait, was that kind of upsetting?

119
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,873
- Yeah, it is upsetting.
- Okay.

120
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,975
I want you to explain everything.

121
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:48,648
I'm not sure how this conversation…
ended up creating these feelings.

122
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:51,217
I don't even know for sure
what I said that upset you.

123
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,153
If you want to know what upset me,
it was what you said at the beginning.

124
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,855
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

125
00:05:56,356 --> 00:06:01,194
If someone said to you that they hated
the place that actually saved you,

126
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,197
I'm sure it would upset you too.

127
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:05,298
Oh.

128
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,535
<i>Hiroya didn't mean to offend him,</i>
<i>so that's always delicate.</i>

129
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,671
<i>He's clumsy</i>
<i>in the way he expresses himself.</i>

130
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,606
<i>Yeah, he's clumsy and cute.</i>

131
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,542
Yeah, you're right.

132
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,314
I didn't mean that I feel disgust
by the place, just to be clear.

133
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,550
I just meant
that I made no effort to understand it.

134
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:26,986
To be honest, it came across

135
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,057
as if you felt disgust toward me.

136
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,726
Sorry,
that's not at all what I meant to say.

137
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,240
I was just really curious about the things

138
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:50,576
that have shaped your personality
and your character,

139
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,445
and I wanted to ask you about them.

140
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,281
I realize I chose my words poorly

141
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:58,084
and that… I ended up hurting you.

142
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,486
Sorry.

143
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,656
If we hadn't met here

144
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:08,094
in the Green Room,
but had met outside, in society, instead.

145
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:13,833
I have a feeling that you would have…
probably looked at me the same way

146
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,436
as those people who thought
I was nothing more

147
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,971
than a gross or crazy person
used to look at me.

148
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,377
I really just…

149
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,848
wanted… to learn about a world

150
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,417
that was unfamiliar to me,

151
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,719
and since you have

152
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,590
a lot of friends
who are very different from me.

153
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,260
I thought I could…

154
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,197
…treasure our meeting here.

155
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:53,673
I wanted to make sure to clear up
our misunderstanding little by little.

156
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,643
That's how I feel.

157
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,884
- I think I'll go work.
- Mm.

158
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:43,256
<i>- "Think easy," she said</i>
<i>- She said</i>

159
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,591
<i>"Forever young and so wild"</i>

160
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,728
<i>"Or pull a gun and then fire it"</i>

161
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:52,331
<i>- "Easy," she said</i>
<i>- She said</i>

162
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:58,137
<i>"You're never young if you don't run</i>
<i>So get over"</i>

163
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,307
<i>- We still got walls on both sides</i>
<i>- Sides</i>

164
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,808
<i>Maybe</i>

165
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,745
<i>- I wanna know how to climb</i>
<i>- Climb</i>

166
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:07,413
<i>We're blind, blind</i>

167
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,516
<i>- How'd we get air all this time?</i>
<i>- This time</i>

168
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,051
<i>- These things</i>
<i>- These things</i>

169
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,287
<i>I never thought when you were mine</i>

170
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,989
We used to break it together

171
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,858
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

172
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:23,529
<i>We used to dive</i>
<i>In our highest feelings</i>

173
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,165
<i>Are we growing older together?</i>

174
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,134
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

175
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,838
<i>I don't wanna miss anything</i>
<i>When I'm dreaming about</i>

176
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,741
<i>When we were dazed and confused</i>

177
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,949
- Oh, that looks delicious.
- Yeah, it does.

178
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:43,983
I like it.

179
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,653
Cheers.

180
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:53,559
How did you feel this morning?

181
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,128
- This morning?
- About the two-day trip to Sapporo.

182
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,964
- I was really surprised.
- You were?

183
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,864
Yeah.

184
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,000
I never got to do
something like this before,

185
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,769
even though there were opportunities
for one-on-one dates.

186
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,939
- Come to think of it, neither have I.
- Oh, really?

187
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,709
I never had the chance before,
so I was super happy.

188
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,677
I was happy too.

189
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,980
If I'm gonna be honest,

190
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,482
the first time we ran the truck…

191
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,717
I mean together, right?

192
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,720
That day, in the truck,
was it fun for you?

193
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,824
He took the sausage out of his mouth.

194
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,993
- He took it out.
- All he had to do was chew it.

195
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,095
He already had
half the sausage in his mouth.

196
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:30,730
It was normal.

197
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,633
Normal? I'm glad it was normal.

198
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,635
I mean, it wasn't fun.

199
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,436
- It was normal.
- It wasn't fun? It was normal?

200
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,405
That was really

201
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,907
kind of bothering me.

202
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,978
I didn't understand
what you were hoping for

203
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,913
when you chose me.

204
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,881
Mm.

205
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,483
I got the impression

206
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:53,052
that you weren't someone
who was very talkative.

207
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,020
Mm.

208
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,224
For some reason,
I wasn't sure how to talk to you,

209
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,126
and I ended up acting that way.

210
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,094
Yeah.

211
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:06,932
I've wanted to talk with you again
and have another private conversation.

212
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,235
I've wanted to… not exactly start over,

213
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:11,470
but, given the chance to be alone,

214
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:14,974
I definitely wanted
another private outing.

215
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,276
I understand.

216
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:24,950
Yeah, what you said really left
a strong, uh, impression on me.

217
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,386
You said that it's <i>your </i>life,

218
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,555
so you should decide for yourself.

219
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,692
You said something like,
"It's okay to be more self-centered."

220
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,594
I cut ties if I was rejected.

221
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,264
Because it's my life.

222
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,702
Because it's your life.

223
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,071
You're the main character of your life,

224
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:46,906
and you're the one
who makes the final call.

225
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:50,176
- So I think you should be self-centered.
- Yeah.

226
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:53,112
When I heard you say that yesterday,
I completely agreed.

227
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:55,981
I'm glad you did.

228
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,285
- But I'm glad.
- About what?

229
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,454
Huh? That we could go out together.

230
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:07,126
Saying "I see you in a new light"
might not be the right way to put it,

231
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,929
but with everyone leaving one by one,

232
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:15,201
it really seemed like
you… cherished the bonds

233
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,203
you had with all the members here.

234
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,337
Mm.

235
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,707
I could tell you got along well with them,

236
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,075
and that impressed me.

237
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,779
That's why I decided
to write down your name.

238
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,981
Oh, good. I'm happy.

239
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,251
I mean, from my perspective,

240
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:36,255
there were only two members
I wanted to focus on.

241
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,624
Jobu and Hiroya.

242
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:44,797
But I don't feel like
Hiroya really needs me that much,

243
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:45,865
or rather…

244
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,134
Hmm, how should I put it?

245
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,535
I think Jobu…

246
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,536
Somehow,

247
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:55,574
I felt like…
I just couldn't leave Jobu alone.

248
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,350
GRADUATE STUDENT
MEMBER OF THE THAI NATIONAL JUDO TEAM

249
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,317
UNIVERSITY STUDENT

250
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,620
- Wow!
- Oh, wow.

251
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:08,921
It's so beautiful.

252
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,991
- It's so beautiful.
- This is crazy. I'm really moved.

253
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,760
It's nice
that they're having dinner separately.

254
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,296
This is really amazing.

255
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,566
It's like a date.

256
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,170
- Let's make a toast.
- Yes, let's. What are we toasting to?

257
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,939
- Our visit to Sapporo.
- Our night together?

258
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,008
No, no. That's not what I mean.

259
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,277
Not the night. Never mind.

260
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,779
- Coffee truck, Sapporo,
- Good work.

261
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,147
- Good work.
- Yeah.

262
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,121
- Mmm.
- It's light.

263
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,192
If you had a boyfriend,

264
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,661
what kind of life
would you wanna have with him?

265
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,465
Just being together is enough.

266
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,668
Oh. I get that.

267
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:56,802
But, I mean…

268
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,407
I think,
rather than doing something special…

269
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:08,814
I would much rather
want to… live together and…

270
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,683
You wanna live together?

271
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,552
Hmm, yes, I do want that.

272
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:14,820
Mm.

273
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,623
I would also want to show my mom,

274
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:22,828
"Look, this is the kind of life I'm living
and who I am."

275
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,463
Mm.

276
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,132
I understand.

277
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,469
Here are your desserts.

278
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,704
Wow.

279
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,606
- It looks delicious.
- Shaved ice? Yes.

280
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:34,974
You like shaved ice, right?

281
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,443
It's sakura gelée and strawberry mousse.

282
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,879
- Oh, looks delicious.
- Wow.

283
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,449
- Hold on, I need to go to the restroom.
- What?

284
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:44,917
Right now?

285
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,019
- Wait a minute.
- Okay.

286
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,296
Huh? What's this?

287
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,464
<i>What is it?</i>

288
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,065
Oh, it's cute.

289
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,371
Coffee.

290
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:06,939
It's cute.

291
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:10,209
I tried drawing
one of those long-tailed tits.

292
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,610
Wait, you made this?

293
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,047
When we first went on our date,
you said you wanted to buy a mug.

294
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:18,450
That's when I figured
you might like to have matching things.

295
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:22,087
So I thought I'd make matching mugs,
and I made them in Tokyo.

296
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,088
- In Tokyo?
- Yeah.

297
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,391
- <i>He was thinking about Bomi?</i>
- This makes me happy.

298
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:26,425
<i>Wow!</i>

299
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,027
Thank you.

300
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,697
Look on the bottom.
I wrote our names on each of them.

301
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,265
- So cute.
- I made matching mugs.

302
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,835
Hold on. Wait, so what does it say
on yours? Does it say "Bomi"?

303
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:40,172
- No way. What's going on here?
- Did you see?

304
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,206
What's going on?

305
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,842
When I left for the entrance ceremony,

306
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,178
I was only away
for more or less three days,

307
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,514
but I found myself thinking about you.

308
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,817
I was like,
"Is this how it feels to like someone?"

309
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,519
That's how I felt.

310
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:57,189
And I wanted to convey my feelings
with these mugs.

311
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,223
I'm happy.

312
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,592
<i>That's really a lovely present.</i>

313
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,527
Thank you.

314
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:05,331
I'm happy with how it looks,
but the fact that you went out of your way

315
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:08,067
to make this for me in Tokyo
makes me happy.

316
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,669
Right now, I'm moved by that.

317
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:11,603
A lot.

318
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,873
- I know.
- You don't have to say, "I know."

319
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,777
I didn't know you had this side to you.

320
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,947
- What a surprise.
- I like surprises a lot.

321
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,015
Oh, you do?

322
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:24,883
Do more.

323
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:26,485
Do more.

324
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,587
If you tell me to do it,
I won't wanna do it.

325
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,556
Then I won't say it.

326
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,025
They're super cute.

327
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:36,161
- Good. They're not ghosts.
- Ghosts? They don't look like ghosts.

328
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,798
If someone made something for you
when they're away, it'd make you happy.

329
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,768
You'd think, "They were thinking about me
at that moment."

330
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,450
<i>You can feel the tension.</i>

331
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,419
<i>Since they're having chicken wings,</i>

332
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,287
<i>at least it lets them focus on eating.</i>

333
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,089
<i>It's still really tense.</i>

334
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,091
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

335
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,435
I'm sleepy.

336
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:17,770
Let's sleep.

337
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:20,939
I'm tired.

338
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,375
You're tired? But it was fun.

339
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,312
It's spacious.

340
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,647
- Huh?
- It's spacious!

341
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,082
<i>They're sharing a room?</i>

342
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,651
- <i>They definitely are!</i>
- <i>It's an overnight stay.</i>

343
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,420
It really feels like the city.

344
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,789
- It's been a while for me.
- How nice.

345
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,924
This is nice.

346
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,693
- Okay.
- I'll put this here.

347
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,333
- This is cool.
- Yeah, you're right.

348
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,253
We can relax here.

349
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,427
Would you prefer to be by yourself
or with someone?

350
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,096
Do you wanna be in a relationship?

351
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:19,498
Hmm.

352
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,101
I need someone in my life.

353
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,168
Mm.

354
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,571
Uh, to spend the rest of my life with.

355
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:26,538
Mm.

356
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:30,509
- Not that I "want" someone.
- Oh, okay.

357
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,712
- I think I "need" someone.
- I get it.

358
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,587
Hey, can I put my head here?

359
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,556
- <i>Oh!</i>
- <i>Oh, he's making his move.</i>

360
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,726
- <i>Jobu's the type to go for it</i>.
- <i>Jobu's good at being endearing.</i>

361
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,795
- The way you asked that.
- Huh?

362
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,930
I can totally ask here.

363
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,233
Is it "elbow"?

364
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,367
- "Knee"? "Knee"?
- Huh?

365
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,302
- You mean this?
- What do you call this part?

366
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,805
- This? The thigh.
- So a thigh pillow.

367
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,141
That's what I want. I wanna try it too.

368
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:06,311
- <i>He wants to do it too?</i>
- <i>No way!</i>

369
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:18,624
- <i>He's looking up.</i>
- <i>He's stroking his hair!</i>

370
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,092
<i>He's stroking his hair!</i>

371
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,928
- <i>Wait, what's he looking at?</i>
- <i>What's going on?</i>

372
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:24,997
Let's go to bed.

373
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,801
- Good night.
- Good night.

374
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,338
Good night.

375
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,778
<i>But when I think about you</i>

376
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:45,117
<i>I can leave the dark behind</i>

377
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,519
- <i>Huh? He's on top?</i>
- <i>What's happening?</i>

378
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,757
<i>A massage?</i>
<i>He's already giving him a massage.</i>

379
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:03,035
<i>The world is spinning right on time</i>

380
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,537
- What time is it?
- Are you awake?

381
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,539
Already.

382
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,143
Can I come in?

383
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,078
Hmm? Sure, sure.

384
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,347
Jobu, that's great!

385
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:17,216
- Way to go!
- Nice, Jobu!

386
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:20,919
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

387
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,323
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

388
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:25,924
That's good.

389
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,461
Oh!

390
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,964
- Doing that in the morning is great.
- It really is great.

391
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,332
- I like it.
- The morning is great.

392
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,467
Compared to that hellish time
at the beginning,

393
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:38,303
things have really mellowed
and opened up between them.

394
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,905
When things don't click with someone,

395
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:43,141
you tend to mentally put them
in the "we don't click" category, right?

396
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:46,211
But when it suddenly does click,
don't you feel a huge rush of energy?

397
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:47,746
That's so true.

398
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:50,716
That's why when Jobu asked,
"Can I come in," it was a sudden…

399
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:52,951
I think Jobu started to figure out

400
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,187
how to interact with Taeheon
to some extent.

401
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,355
- That's right.
- You're right.

402
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,024
I don't think Taeheon's the type
to make the first move.

403
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:03,662
So if Jobu keeps approaching him
with his innocent and open personality,

404
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:07,032
Taeheon will be like, "Sure, sure,"
and gradually accept him.

405
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,801
Yeah. Jobu was stroking Taeheon's head
while staring at the ceiling.

406
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:10,802
He looked blissful.

407
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,738
He was blissful. "Wow!"

408
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,940
- "Hmm, this is…"
- Yeah, that's it.

409
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,175
- "…blissful."
- Oh yeah.

410
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:18,877
He was blissful, but at the same time,

411
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,880
he was quickly running through options
about what to do next.

412
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,949
- And wasn't Huwei cute?
- He was so cute!

413
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,384
Those mugs were so cute.

414
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,854
- What was the deal with those mugs?
- What was with those drawings?

415
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,789
- Yeah.
- He made them while he was in Tokyo.

416
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:33,425
That's the sweetest thing
he could've done for Bomi.

417
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,494
He was thinking about him
while he was away,

418
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,596
and he made him something by hand.

419
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,264
That's the ultimate gift.

420
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:40,599
That's touching.

421
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,035
The mood among the three members
in the Green Room was a bit…

422
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:45,504
- Hiroya and Tomoaki were a little distant.
- Yeah.

423
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:49,841
It really showed just how tricky
communication between people can be.

424
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,610
Everyone has different personalities,

425
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:54,846
and Hiroya, of course,
didn't mean to offend him.

426
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:57,049
Speaking on behalf of gay people,

427
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,651
I don't think
most of them go to Shinjuku Ni-chome.

428
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,554
There are plenty of people
who want to distance themselves

429
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:05,257
from that kind
of flamboyant gay community.

430
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,959
The way Hiroya feels about it
isn't a problem at all,

431
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:11,530
but, as you said, it has to do with
the way he talked about it.

432
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:14,566
After that, he asked,
"What did I say that was wrong?"

433
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,835
And he did apologize in tears.

434
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:20,305
He's actually really
a kind person at heart.

435
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:24,009
I get the sense that they're not
just pursuing romance here.

436
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:28,013
They're also learning how to be
better human beings in their community.

437
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:41,226
I was just thinking to myself.

438
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,062
Humans are all the same, right?

439
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:45,697
Mm.

440
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,866
How are our types decided?

441
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:52,003
- Good question.
- What do you think determines our types?

442
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:57,242
I think it's probably shaped or influenced
mostly by the people we meet.

443
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,246
So, to you, that's what you find cool.

444
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:02,681
Mm-hmm.

445
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:09,221
I don't especially like handsome guys,
but I'm very particular.

446
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,491
For me, it's not about looks.

447
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,093
It's about muscles.

448
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,795
- Huh? What?
- Oh, just that?

449
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,230
- Really?
- Wait a minute.

450
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:19,698
Not the heart, but the muscles?

451
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,734
Judging by his tone, I thought
he was going to talk about the heart.

452
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,370
- Were you on the swim team?
- Yes, I was.

453
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,740
Swim teams have
a lot of people with nice bodies

454
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,909
and just the right amount of body fat,
don't they?

455
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,613
When I hear someone was on the swim team,
I think, "You too?"

456
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,449
In the end, it's baseball players.

457
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,484
- Baseball players?
- Baseball players are the best.

458
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,854
The thighs and buttocks
of baseball players.

459
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,623
Okay,
because they're nice and firm, right?

460
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:50,529
Wow, all the snow has actually melted.

461
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:01,173
Welcome back.

462
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,477
- We're home.
- Welcome back.

463
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,112
- Hi, guys.
- Welcome back.

464
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:11,883
<i>There's so much tension.</i>

465
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,421
What did you have?

466
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,890
It must've been a long trip.
We already finished eating.

467
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,025
Let me sit down.

468
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,662
How was it?

469
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,365
- It was fun. We really had a great time.
- We did.

470
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:29,301
- Yeah.
- It was a valuable experience.

471
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:32,437
- Where did you sell coffee?
- At a place called Sapporo Factory.

472
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:33,872
You went to the Factory?

473
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,141
- Is it famous?
- Yes, it's really well known.

474
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,909
There's even a movie theater.

475
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,146
How much did you make?

476
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:42,547
I'm curious.

477
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:44,649
24,100 yen.

478
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,284
Only 24,100 yen.

479
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:48,487
- Wow. Wonderful.
- That's it.

480
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,922
- You sold a lot.
- Wonderful.

481
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,792
What did you guys do?

482
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,695
We did eight times less
than you can imagine.

483
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:58,396
Eight times less?

484
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:01,032
- <i>Eight times is a lot.</i>
- I went to the sauna.

485
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,869
And Ryuki taught me
a few workout routines and tips.

486
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,036
We went to the gym.

487
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:08,039
I think this is the first time
I've talked this much with Ryuki.

488
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,709
- I thought your complexion looked better.
- Mm.

489
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:13,612
- Yeah, it does look better.
- I was just sitting the whole time.

490
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,849
I didn't go to the gym or the sauna.

491
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,117
- Oh, you didn't?
- No.

492
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:21,853
- <i>That's sad.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

493
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,822
<i>Jobu can be pretty sensitive.</i>

494
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,594
- Hu-chan!
- What?

495
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,196
What's the matter?

496
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,832
I'll be leaving here tomorrow.

497
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:35,934
- Really?
- For about a week.

498
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:39,404
- Really?
- Yeah. I'll miss you.

499
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,174
You look cute.

500
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:45,010
Squish, squish, squish.

501
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,613
What's that?

502
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:52,484
- I'll miss you. I'll really miss you.
- You'll miss me, right? Oh.

503
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,386
<i>Oh, how cute!</i>

504
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:57,155
- <i>This is like…</i>
- <i>Hey, Huwei's acting cute.</i>

505
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,189
You're so cute.

506
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,461
Are you going to the university?

507
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:06,131
Yeah, I'm going to talk a little
with my professor.

508
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,634
I also scheduled a few classes
here and there.

509
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,771
So I'll take those too,

510
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:14,439
I guess.

511
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,473
Hmm.

512
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,245
- <i>Look.</i>
- <i>Come on!</i>

513
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:21,980
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

514
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:28,353
They had so many chances
to go for it! Come on!

515
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,721
Oh, come on!

516
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,323
They didn't go for it.

517
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:33,525
I wanted them to kiss.

518
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,027
They're so cute.
At that moment, they were like,

519
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,831
"Wait, if we go for it now, how will
our noses and our mouths line up?"

520
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:41,433
We've all had that thought before.

521
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:45,203
- It was like the <i>Spider-Man </i>kiss.
- "Will this work if I do it this way?"

522
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,339
"How will this puzzle come together?"

523
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:49,708
- You're right. That's it.
- Yeah.

524
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,343
"Maybe it'll work."

525
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,879
- Did you have fun?
- I had fun.

526
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,615
It was the worst over here.

527
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:58,249
- What happened?
- It was seriously bad.

528
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:59,417
What happened?

529
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:02,787
It might have been around noon
the first day.

530
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,391
I was talking with Hiroya
in the living room.

531
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,128
We didn't exactly argue, but it got weird.

532
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:11,796
Oh, I get it.

533
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,765
And we haven't talked since.

534
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,800
For real?

535
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,506
Should we throw this away?

536
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:25,343
- <i>The way he changes the subject.</i>
- <i>He's really good at doing that.</i>

537
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,946
I'm just gonna throw this away.
It's too much.

538
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:31,282
You should throw it away.
It wouldn't fit in the freezer anyway.

539
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,956
You look really tired. Are you okay?

540
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,492
I mean, you look down.

541
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,327
Like…

542
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:46,631
Well, in fact,
something happened with Tomoaki.

543
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:49,467
We kind of got into some sort of argument.

544
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:50,468
What?

545
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,637
So it's really awkward now.

546
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,072
Wait, really?

547
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:57,676
I had no idea.

548
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:58,977
<i>Oh, Ryuki didn't know.</i>

549
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,612
You guys were getting along so well.

550
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,579
You were getting along,

551
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:03,548
so I never would've thought
that would happen.

552
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:08,420
I couldn't clear up the misunderstanding,
and we haven't talked since.

553
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,792
It's all my fault,
so I wanna talk with him.

554
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,194
But I don't know what to do anymore.

555
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,530
What to do?

556
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:20,799
Do you want to talk with him alone, or…?

557
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:21,900
Mm.

558
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,104
I do want to talk with him, but

559
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,274
if he doesn't want to talk with me,

560
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,177
I don't think
we can even have a conversation.

561
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:38,249
How about you just say, "I think
things turned out this way between us

562
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:40,452
because of what I did wrong,

563
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:43,521
but I really didn't mean it like that."

564
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:46,424
You said what you did
because you wanted to get closer to him.

565
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,395
You didn't mean any harm by what you said.
So you should apologize by saying,

566
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:51,930
"I'm really sorry about that,"

567
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,132
and, "Can you explain
so I can understand?"

568
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,266
Yeah.

569
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:58,636
Otherwise, your relationship with him
will continue to be strained.

570
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:02,340
I don't know anymore.
I don't know. What should I do?

571
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:04,876
Don't force yourself.

572
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:06,878
You don't have to make things right today.

573
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,613
- I think that's fine.
- It's okay.

574
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,581
Yeah.

575
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,951
Wait, but you were chatting
like good friends the other day!

576
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,120
Yeah, maybe that's why
it's gotten this bad.

577
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:16,187
Oh, you think so?

578
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,890
It felt like he was rejecting
a major part of me.

579
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:22,127
- Regarding that topic?
- Yeah, that and other stuff.

580
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:23,962
So you're saying you were rejected?

581
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:25,663
Well, I wasn't rejected.

582
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,299
He didn't exactly say no,

583
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,368
but it just felt like he did.

584
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,003
Mm.

585
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:36,975
It felt like he was indirectly saying,
"If we weren't living together like this,

586
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:40,812
we would have never been friends."
That's how it felt.

587
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,948
But, in fact, he knows nothing about it.

588
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:48,052
So maybe you should tell him
that it's not like that.

589
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,023
Well, I'd rather not talk to him.

590
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,158
I get it.

591
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,396
But maybe his words…
Maybe he didn't express himself well.

592
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,699
After living with him for six weeks,
I know he's not that kind of person.

593
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:03,935
Because you've been living here that long.
I haven't.

594
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:07,505
And that's why I'm saying
he's not that kind of person.

595
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:11,309
I know he wouldn't reject someone,
so I want you to talk with him again.

596
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:12,877
You might have misunderstood him.

597
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:15,346
You two seemed to be
getting along so well,

598
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:17,315
so it'd be a real shame

599
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:22,620
to let this one incident
determine your relationship from now on.

600
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:26,758
And if, after spending
a few days with him, you realize

601
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:30,328
that you can really understand each other
in a different way,

602
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,764
then you should bring up
the topic again with him.

603
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,894
- <i>Is he going out?</i>
- <i>Going out alone?</i>

604
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:20,879
- <i>He needs to think.</i>
- <i>It's hard, isn't it?</i>

605
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,201
- There are so few of us.
- Today, yeah.

606
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,670
- Tomorrow, I have to go to my university,
- Oh no.

607
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,138
- So I'll be away
- What?

608
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,574
- But only for a little while.
- Okay, then.

609
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:53,544
We heard about Ryuki, but I didn't know
Bomi would be gone too.

610
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:55,713
Do you know anything, Huwei?

611
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,715
- Huh?
- Bomi.

612
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:00,752
- Don't you know?
- Hey, no need to play dumb.

613
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,489
Can you just tell us
if you know anything or not?

614
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,694
- So it's just the five of us left.
- Huh?

615
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,195
- That's right.
- Seriously?

616
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,299
Excuse me,
can I just add something quickly?

617
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:15,466
- Sure.
- Huh?

618
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,902
Oh, it's not anything like that.
It's just…

619
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:23,241
When you guys went to Sapporo
on that two-day trip,

620
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,510
I really ruined the mood here.

621
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,614
I've been feeling really sorry about it,

622
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:34,519
but I didn't get a chance
to apologize to everyone.

623
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:38,022
And, well, yeah, the fact is,

624
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:41,092
I feel really bad toward Hiroya.

625
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,760
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>Good for him.</i>

626
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:46,397
I know apologizing in front of everyone
like this is cowardly.

627
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,499
- No, it's not.
- Even I realize that.

628
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:51,235
<i>If I hadn't gotten so emotional</i>
<i>the other day,</i>

629
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:55,306
<i>if I'd expressed my feelings properly</i>
<i>using my words,</i>

630
00:32:55,373 --> 00:33:00,278
<i>I don't think things would have turned out</i>
<i>at all this way.</i>

631
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:03,514
It's because I'm a very stubborn person,

632
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:07,318
and I couldn't bring myself
to talk to you.

633
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:11,723
I ended up making you feel really awful,

634
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,426
and I regret that.

635
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:17,395
I'm sorry.

636
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:20,131
- <i>Good for him!</i>
- Thank you… for saying that.

637
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:24,435
I didn't know
how to resolve things either.

638
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:29,340
I was worried I wouldn't be able
to enjoy the rest of my time here.

639
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:33,044
But you approached me… and apologized.

640
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:34,579
But I was equally at fault,

641
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:38,316
and there were many things
that were misunderstood.

642
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,551
So I wanna talk things out.

643
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,086
You brought it up,

644
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,922
and that made me… really happy..

645
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,392
Sorry.

646
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,199
There might still be
some things that are bothering you.

647
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:58,202
- No, no, no, it's fine. It's fine.
- We should still talk.

648
00:33:58,269 --> 00:33:59,137
It's fine.

649
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,972
I wanna go over that topic again

650
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,307
when we're both more relaxed.

651
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,977
He's caught in the middle.
You're caught in the middle.

652
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,547
- Taeheon, join us.
- Different things.

653
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,249
<i>Oh, I'm glad he did that.</i>

654
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:14,652
- Thank you.
- <i>Nice. They're such good friends.</i>

655
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:17,789
Okay.

656
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:18,923
<i>"Okay"!</i>

657
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,692
- Okay, wonderful.
- Sorry. Sorry for the morning drama.

658
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:23,227
Thank you, everyone.

659
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,863
- Sorry. Sorry.
- No worries.

660
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:31,335
Since we have such little time left
before we have to leave,

661
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,738
I realized what I wanted to do.

662
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,373
I wanted to talk with him.

663
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:37,642
And in order to do that,

664
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:42,980
the only thing I could do
was apologize to him in front of everyone.

665
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:47,085
The main thing was
that I felt I would stay the same

666
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:48,753
if I didn't do something.

667
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,588
<i>The thing to do is apologize.</i>

668
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,356
- <i>I learned something.</i>
- That's true.

669
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,225
We all learned that as kids, didn't we?

670
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,593
Yeah, to apologize.

671
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:00,731
You were the one to bring it up,
and I was glad.

672
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:01,732
- Really?
- Yeah.

673
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:06,437
I really think
I made the wrong choice of words

674
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,739
during that conversation.

675
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:11,809
The more we talked,
the worse things kept getting.

676
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:16,781
I feel like I said a lot of things
I didn't need to say at all,

677
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,117
and those things hurt you even more.

678
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,455
Yeah, I feel bad about that.

679
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:25,957
<i>Oh, good for him.</i>

680
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,792
- Mm.
- Mm.

681
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:34,098
- Until I came here to the Green Room…
- Mm.

682
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,734
…I've really been neglecting
my relationships with people.

683
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,635
Mm.

684
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:40,304
I assumed I could only get along
with certain people.

685
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,074
I mean,
I don't have a lot of friends either.

686
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:44,942
I see that as a flaw

687
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,612
and something I really need to work on.

688
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:50,148
That's why I came to the Green Room.

689
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:52,884
When I talk with everyone,

690
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:56,154
I realize how different everyone is.

691
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,956
Still, I really enjoy
talking with each person.

692
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,259
I really enjoy the whole experience.

693
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:05,763
Everyone has
their own different communities, right?

694
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,466
So, that's why I wanna ask

695
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:11,669
what kind of activities everyone does
in their communities

696
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:14,705
and what kind of… friends they have.

697
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:15,706
Mm.

698
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:18,609
Of course, like I said,

699
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:22,280
I might have had some prejudicial ideas
at one point,

700
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,415
but I regret them
and want to get rid of them.

701
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:27,752
If I'm wrong,
I want people to tell me that I'm wrong.

702
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:34,125
The old me would have
already cut all ties with you.

703
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,360
I would have gone back
to my room right away too.

704
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:37,461
Well, there you go.

705
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:40,831
I'm glad I was able to face that.

706
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,236
- Oh, that's very good, Hiroya.
- I'm so glad for you.

707
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,237
I'm glad.

708
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:49,574
- They finally made up.
- Wow, Tomoaki was impressive.

709
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:54,245
Technically, he was the one who got hurt
in that conversation. Isn't that right?

710
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:58,649
But he came to terms
with everything he was feeling

711
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,284
and apologized.

712
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:03,287
That's not always
an easy thing to do, is it?

713
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:04,956
Maybe the others wouldn't have been able

714
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:07,358
to be this empathic
in the real world either,

715
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:10,561
but we'll never know for sure.
I feel like everyone in the Green Room

716
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:13,898
has had a chance to grow
through the experience they've had here,

717
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,500
and that makes me really happy.

718
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,902
It's wonderful.

719
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:19,170
There's really a lot to learn

720
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,472
about human relationships
on this show, isn't there?

721
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:22,573
Absolutely.

722
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,742
- Not just about romance.
- Yeah, you're right.

723
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,844
It shows you
how to overcome certain problems

724
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:27,845
and stuff like that.

725
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,214
And Ryuki didn't notice anything!

726
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:32,216
He was so surprised.

727
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,151
- He was surprised.
- He was.

728
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:36,587
He must've been thinking,
"These chicken wings are so good!"

729
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:39,223
"How come they're so tasty?" Yeah.

730
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:46,030
I realize it's a small group right now,
but

731
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:48,633
I have something to say.

732
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:50,368
Go ahead.

733
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:54,772
The bowling privilege
that big brother Kazu left for me,

734
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,275
I think I'll make use of it today.

735
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:58,643
Oh, you're using it?

736
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:00,578
Who will it be?

737
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,950
- Taeheon.
- <i>Oh wow!</i>

738
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,219
So where are we going?

739
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,521
I'll show you around.

740
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:11,889
Is it a surprise?

741
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,325
Mm. It's a surprise.

742
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:15,293
Huh.

743
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:17,261
See you later.

744
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,664
- We're off, guys.
- Have a good time.

745
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,133
- <i>Jobu must be feeling uneasy.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

746
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,336
Oh.

747
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:28,072
- I'll read it.
- Yes, please do.

748
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,775
"For today's work shift,

749
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:33,744
please discuss and decide who will go."

750
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,280
- Let's go together. That's all.
- That's all?

751
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:39,717
- Let's all go together.
- Let's all go together.

752
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:41,052
- Yay!
- Let's do our best.

753
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:42,720
Sure you don't wanna make chocolate cake?

754
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,855
- It doesn't matter.
- You can make it tomorrow.

755
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:46,691
Yay!

756
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:48,726
- I'm excited.
- Let's do it.

757
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,861
We've arrived.

758
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:52,563
Where are we?

759
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:56,200
Kushiro City Museum.

760
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:58,369
- Wow, it's grand.
- It's a museum.

761
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:04,842
This building was designed by an architect
from Kushiro called Kiko Mozuna.

762
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:08,112
- His creations have very unique shapes.
- Oh, really?

763
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,047
- Oh.
- Oh.

764
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:11,882
- How exciting.
- Yeah.

765
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:13,918
It looks like a machine or a factory.

766
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:17,254
- It's a double spiral staircase.
- Oh, it's a double?

767
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,990
- See?
- Oh yeah. It's really double.

768
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:22,360
Right? When will we meet?

769
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,228
- Oh, it's here.
- How strange.

770
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:25,963
This is really amazing.

771
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,532
It's super cool.

772
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,201
Stand in the center.

773
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:33,504
- Yeah.
- This is scary. This is actually scary.

774
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:34,438
Really?

775
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:38,642
- Yeah.
- It's actually fun to take close-ups.

776
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,149
- Yeah, it was fun.
- Was it fun?

777
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,218
- Thank you.
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.

778
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:48,219
Thank you.

779
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,356
I feel… so supported by everyone.

780
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:54,558
That's what living together is all about.

781
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:55,760
- Yeah, you're right.
- Yeah.

782
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:58,562
I've made things right with Tomoaki,

783
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,998
and I went out with you today.

784
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:05,936
Thanks. I wanted to talk with you
one-on-one as well.

785
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:06,871
Really?

786
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,740
Regarding the trip to Sapporo.

787
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,075
- Mm.
- Mm.

788
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:15,913
Actually, I was torn
until the very last minute.

789
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,949
I didn't know whose name to write
until the very end.

790
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,418
- Mm.
- Mm.

791
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:24,522
<i>When my name was called on that morning,</i>

792
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,925
<i>I couldn't… bring myself to look at you.</i>

793
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,727
<i>Mm.</i>

794
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:34,965
I was really having mixed feelings
at the time.

795
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:38,602
I see.

796
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,039
You know, I wrote down your name.

797
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,073
Mm.

798
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:45,509
At the end of the day,

799
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:48,012
what I really like about you

800
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,882
is the fact that you have a great balance

801
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,586
between being serious and playful.

802
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,155
I'm mostly playful, aren't I?

803
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:01,091
- No, you have a serious side too.
- Yeah.

804
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:02,993
<i>It makes you happy to hear that.</i>

805
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,396
There isn't much time left,

806
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:10,034
but I just wanted to make sure
you still knew exactly how I felt.

807
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:12,803
So if ever we get…

808
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:18,843
…the chance to write someone's name down
for things like running the coffee truck,

809
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:21,178
I would be happy if you chose me.

810
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,781
Hey, that's all I hope for.

811
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:27,151
That's how I feel, just so you know.

812
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,653
Thank you.

813
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:36,227
What made me kind of happy was finding out
he was a bit torn about the Sapporo trip.

814
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:39,663
He said something
about feeling guilty about me,

815
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:42,800
so I realized it's not like
he wasn't thinking about me at all.

816
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:47,171
Yeah, as a date, it was the best ever,
in my opinion.

817
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,441
Is it just me, or has Hiroya shed a layer?

818
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,042
- Yeah.
- I think it's good.

819
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:54,111
I feel like his expression has changed.

820
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:55,980
Okay, let's do this!

821
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:58,582
- Let's go!
- Okay.

822
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,055
It doesn't look like
anyone's coming. Is this place okay?

823
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:06,357
We'll have to work hard.

824
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,425
Let's look at the river.

825
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:12,162
- The fog here is so beautiful.
- For real?

826
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:15,332
I thought the water
was usually pretty clear here.

827
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:16,634
- Hey,
- Huh?

828
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,904
I've just been notified,
I have to go back to Thailand, right away.

829
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,772
- Right away? Oh no.
- Yeah.

830
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,074
- So I'm going to leave for a bit.
- Mm-hmm, okay.

831
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:25,576
- <i>Why?</i>
- <i>Right away?</i>

832
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:26,911
- Okay. See you.
- Good luck.

833
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:28,145
- See you.
- Thanks.

834
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:29,580
Have a safe trip.

835
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:31,282
<i>Did something happen?</i>

836
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:35,152
Back to work.

837
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:43,794
SOMETHING CAME UP,
SO I HAVE TO RETURN TO THAILAND FOR A BIT

838
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,029
This morning,

839
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:47,831
I learned that my grandmother passed away,

840
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:50,067
so I thought I should go.

841
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,670
- <i>Of course.</i>
- <i>He should definitely go.</i>

842
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:08,218
- I wonder what time they will be back.
- You're not getting jealous, right?

843
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:09,153
No, I'm not.

844
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:10,754
Even if he says, "I had fun."

845
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:14,325
"I had so much fun today.
It was the best time I ever had,"

846
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:15,492
you won't feel anything?

847
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,628
Hey, you know what? I hate it.

848
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,164
- Of course, I hate it.
- That's jealousy.

849
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,700
- I hate it. I hate it.
- So you don't mind that he went out?

850
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,568
Oh, he can totally go out.
He can totally go.

851
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:28,372
I don't have any resentment
about that at all.

852
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,240
But I'm sad about having
less time with him.

853
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:33,477
If he came back and straight-up told me,

854
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:36,013
"I seriously had a great time,"

855
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,681
I'd be like, "He had fun, huh?"

856
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:41,852
"Did he have more fun than with me?
Maybe Hiroya's a better match for him."

857
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:42,920
I don't know.

858
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:45,956
I think you can go on another date.
There'll be another event, right?

859
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,424
I hope so, but I don't know.

860
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,927
Maybe they'll end up
getting really close today.

861
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,931
If that's how things turn out, so be it.

862
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,069
It calls for salt and pepper.
Shall we give it a try?

863
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:01,438
Lemon…

864
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:04,241
You really like this Krazy Salt, huh?

865
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,076
We're back.

866
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:08,078
They're back!

867
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:11,281
<i>What just happened?</i>
<i>What are they trying to do?</i>

868
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:12,383
<i>A prank?</i>

869
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:14,251
<i>Probably trying to scare them.</i>

870
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,220
Huh? They're not here.

871
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:17,755
- They're not here?
- Nope.

872
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,394
Ah!

873
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:27,965
<i>It's been so long</i>
<i>since I've seen something like this.</i>

874
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:30,634
Pretend to be surprised.

875
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:32,336
- Give us a bigger reaction.
- Huh?

876
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:36,507
Okay.

877
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:39,743
- Enjoy your meal.
- - Enjoy your meal.

878
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,247
- He said he'd throw it away.
- Hot!

879
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:44,148
Hot!

880
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:45,683
- It got on my hand.
- Oh no.

881
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,318
- Are you okay? I guess this isn't cold.
- I'm fine.

882
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,487
It might be a little cold.

883
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:53,157
I'll go get that thing.

884
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:54,725
<i>That's hard.</i>

885
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,827
<i>He can't help but notice.</i>

886
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:01,298
- That's sweet.
- Oh, thanks.

887
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,234
Sorry for sitting cross-legged
next to you, eating pollock roe.

888
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:06,837
- I'm worried about you.
- <i>Oh, Jobu!</i>

889
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:09,173
- <i>He's super bothered</i>.
- <i>That got to him</i>.

890
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:11,542
<i>It's obvious the dynamic</i>
<i>between them has changed.</i>

891
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:12,776
<i>Yeah.</i>

892
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:15,946
Let's toast again.

893
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:18,248
Cheers. Delicious.

894
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:19,950
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

895
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:22,419
Isn't that it?

896
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,722
Huh?

897
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:27,191
- Bomi!
- Oh, welcome back!

898
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:29,359
- I'm back.
- Welcome back.

899
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:35,499
- Sorry. Welcome back.
- I came back early.

900
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,834
Hey, why didn't you tell us?

901
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,770
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- We were just drinking together.

902
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:43,674
We're drinking together, so come join us
when you've put everything down.

903
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:44,575
Are you hungry?

904
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:45,542
I haven't eaten.

905
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:48,078
- Well, we have food.
- Good thing we have curry.

906
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:52,416
Finally.

907
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,836
Ah… dear…

908
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:24,047
I HAVE TO RETURN TO THAILAND.
I MISS YOU. I WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE.

909
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,483
<i>Oh, "I really miss you.</i>
<i>I wanna see your face"!</i>

910
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,051
<i>Oh!</i>

911
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,953
<i>It's sad, but…</i>

912
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:34,758
TODAY IS AN OUTING DAY.

913
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:37,528
- This is tough.
- Aren't these discussions tough?

914
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:40,397
- <i>Discuss?</i>
- <i>Form groups of two and three?</i>

915
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,200
Interesting.
If anyone wants to go with someone,

916
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:45,302
we should prioritize that, shouldn't we?

917
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,738
Does anyone have a preference?

918
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:52,876
I want to go with everyone,
so I'd be happy to go with anyone.

919
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,481
Well…

920
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:00,517
Hu-chan isn't here, so…

921
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:02,619
- Yeah.
- Hu-chan isn't here.

922
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:04,221
What about you, Hiroya?

923
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:07,991
Of course, I wanna go out
with everyone, too,

924
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:10,727
but I also want to go out with Taeheon.

925
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:14,531
I'm going with Taeheon.

926
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:18,902
I wanna go. I wanna go.

927
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:35,018
You can take your time to think about it.

928
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:37,988
He's thinking really hard.

929
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:48,131
Right when we're all together, this…

930
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:50,133
this is awkward.

931
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,769
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

932
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:54,805
<i>He really has to choose.</i>

933
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:03,280
This is tough.

934
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,115
He's thinking hard for us.

935
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:22,933
The person I want to go out with today is…

936
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:39,349
Come on!

937
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,984
Seriously?

938
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:44,021
- Come on!
- That's so mean!

939
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,957
- It's a super simple question. Right?
- Which one will you choose?

940
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:48,358
Which one will you choose?

941
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:51,295
- We're going back to the basics now.
- Right!
