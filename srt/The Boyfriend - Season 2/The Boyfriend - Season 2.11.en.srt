- Morning.

MARKETER AT MANUFACTURING COMPANY

4
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,988
- You're up early.
- I know, right?

DESIGNER

6
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,442
- Oh, cute.
- Morning.

7
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,310
- Good morning.
- Morning.

8
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:48,815
Oh, you said you'd be here
around 8:00 or 8:30, right?

9
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,151
- Yeah.
- So I came to roll in at 8:30.

10
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,685
- But you're late.
- I'm sorry.

11
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:55,121
- It's totally fine.
- Sorry!

12
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:57,223
I was just so sleepy.

13
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,463
<i>I said, "Let's have breakfast together."</i>

14
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,134
I said I'd be there at 8:00 or 8:30
in the morning, but I overslept.

15
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:11,471
When I came downstairs,
everyone had already eaten.

16
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,273
I was like, "Sorry."

17
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:15,675
He's just running late.

18
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,745
But they're getting comfortable
talking to each other now.

19
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,081
- Oh!
- Oh!

20
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,849
- Ryu-Ryu.
- Huh?

21
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,818
- Really?
- Don't you wanna do it?

22
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,986
- It's fine.
- You were practicing.

23
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:29,489
- Vocal warm-ups.
- Vocal… vocal training.

24
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:32,625
- All right, then. Okay, here I go.
- All right.

25
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:34,861
"Good morning."

26
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,529
Good morning.

27
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:40,767
"For today's shift,
Hiroya will be on duty."

28
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,036
- Been a while.
- I know, it has.

29
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:47,307
- <i>Who's he going to ask?</i>
- <i>Who, in this situation?</i>

- Let's go together.
- Let's go.

34
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:06,626
Yay.

35
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:24,744

00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,978

51

KUMAYAKI

55
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,569
Okay, let's do this.

56
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,171
Have you ever worked at a café?

57
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,339
- Nope.
- No?

58
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,841
Just <i>izakaya </i>type places.

59
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,777
But you look like you'd fit right in.

60
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,546
I wanted to try working there,
but for some reason, never did.

61
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,149
Honestly,
the <i>izakaya </i>vibe doesn't suit you.

62
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,251
- You worked in a café before?
- Yeah, I have.

63
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,652
Oh, where? When?

64
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,855
In South Korea, and in the UK.

65
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,692
- Wow, that's an advantage.
- I don't know about that.

66
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,760
- A big advantage.
- That was a long time ago.

67
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,296
Makes you dependable. Stickers…

68
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,167
We have delicious coffee.

69
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,370
- Drip coffee, Americano, café latte.
- Oh, can I have a small café latte?

70
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,538
A small café latte.

71
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:01,975
- Here's 550 yen in change.
- Thank you.

72
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,509
Thank you very much.

73
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,445
- How old is he?
- He's two.

74
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:06,646
Oh, two.

75
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:10,083
- He has such pretty hair.
- He says you have pretty hair.

76
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,285
I'm jealous!

77
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,587
TODAY'S SALES:
8,950 YEN

78
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,693
I might ramble a bit,
but do you mind if I talk?

79
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,329
Um… I often…

80
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,268
When people ask me,
"What's your type?" in daily life,

81
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:31,237
I often say I like people
who are cultured.

82
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,939
- Hmm?
- Cultured.

83
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,041
- Aah!
- Mmm.

84
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:40,079
I think that's because
I deeply love culture.

85
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:47,620
And if the partner I love can relate
to this part of me even a little,

86
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,423
I think that would be wonderful.

87
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,026
It's sort of an ideal for me, you know?

88
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,427
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

89
00:04:55,662 --> 00:05:00,900
Sharing this might make me sound like
I'm floating in my own world right now,

90
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:05,705
but I… you know,
want to talk more with you, Taeheon.

91
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:09,809
I also want to get to know more
about your sensibilities.

92
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:15,782
If we could design something together,
like a gift for everyone,

93
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,216
I think that'd be fun.

94
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,452
Yeah, that sounds fun. Yeah.

95
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,088
Honestly, I'd be happy if I could do

96
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,024
something like that
with you, together, I think.

97
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,292
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

98
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:34,200
Compared to Jobu on the last shift,
Hiroya on today's shift was

99
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,636
easier to talk to and more fun.

100
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,306
I could talk more calmly with him.

101
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:42,842
It felt like that.

102
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:47,880
I think it might be worth
giving him a chance.

103
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,583
Hmm.

104
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,853
I wasn't sure how Taeheon would react,

105
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,023
but he said he had more fun with Hiroya
than with Jobu.

106
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,592
- I don't want him to compare.
- I just don't know anymore.

107
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:04,263
Yeah. So, I guess Taeheon didn't find
Jobu very easy to talk to, huh?

108
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,633
Right? Well, Hiroya is a bit calmer,

109
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,736
while Jobu is a bit more energetic.

110
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:12,872
So maybe Taeheon was put off
by that energy?

111
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,174
Maybe they just didn't click.

112
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,376
I guess that happens.

113
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,745
- Vibe compatibility.
- Maybe Jobu was too energetic.

114
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,482
These headphones are just…

115
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,416
Huh? I mean…

116
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,851
…scattered everywhere.

117
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,754
Whose hat is that?

118
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,988
Mine.

119
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,991
- You wear hats?
- Sometimes.

120
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,059
Cute.

121
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,194
Super cute.

122
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,033
So, when you go back to China sometimes,
is that to see your dad?

123
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,637
To see your grandpa and grandma?

124
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,974
Them too, and to see my dad.

125
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:52,078
But honestly,
just a quick visit is enough for me.

126
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,247
- I don't wanna be with them for too long.
- Oh, I see.

127
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:55,948
I've also got friends there.

128
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,351
Are you closer to your mom?

129
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,189
I mean, I'm closer to my mom than my dad.

130
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:07,760
Mmm, I'm not on bad terms
with either of them.

131
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,964
- But I'm not close to them either.
- With both? Your mom too?

132
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:15,168
Yeah.
It's not like I can tell her everything.

133
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,271
My mom is a super emotional person,

134
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,840
so I can't have a rational
conversation with her.

135
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,309
Ah, same here.

136
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,380
How would you even come out, then? Huh?

137
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:32,051
I mean, my ideal would be
to find someone important to me,

138
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:36,756
then with that person…
we move in together and stuff.

139
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:40,993
Living together is one of my dreams,
you know?

140
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,728
I wanna live together.

141
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,965
And then I want to include
my mom in that space.

142
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,435
Sort of like a family.

143
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,007
That's why I wanna tell her.

144
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,645
Hmm?

145
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,614
What? What is it?

146
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,616
- Huh? Nothing.
- Your emotions…

147
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,117
- Huh?
- It's nothing… Yeah, no.

148
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:10,356
Like…

149
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,461
This visit…

150
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,232
- You saw your mom, right?
- I did.

151
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,668
- I told her then.
- You told her?

152
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,270
<i>Oh, this visit?</i>

153
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,738
I came out to her.

154
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,373
<i>That's a big deal!</i>

155
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,641
So, was it okay?

156
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,113
Hmm…

157
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:40,820
Well, I was hoping that
she'd accept it in the end.

158
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,321
Mmm.

159
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:50,796
But she said, "I'm shocked to hear that."

160
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,498
<i>Aah.</i>

161
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,672
She also said, "Can't you fix it?"

162
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,917
But… I can't fix it.

163
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,221
What I thought was,

164
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,724
if I had a "normal" sexuality,

165
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:24,964
like… it would have been easier.

166
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:29,135
But if I… if I fall in love with someone,

167
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:35,675
"fixing" that feeling means completely
erasing how I feel, right?

168
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,445
It felt like she was saying that

169
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:43,449
the person I've lived as until now
doesn't need to exist anymore.

170
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:45,284
Right.

171
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,256
I can't fix it,
or, more like, I don't want to.

172
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:55,761
Mmm.

173
00:09:58,764 --> 00:09:59,765
But

174
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,535
it was kind of like

175
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:07,239
I ended up burdening my mom

176
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,109
with some of the weight
that I'd been carrying this whole time.

177
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,277
Mmm.

178
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:15,982
Like, for me, it took
a very long time to fully accept myself.

179
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,384
It took a very long time.

180
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:23,389
But she has no time to process it.
She was just suddenly told.

181
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:27,193
I figured she must be feeling confused.

182
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:33,299
So it might take her
some more time to get it.

183
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,700
You did really well.

184
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,709
<i>I don't wanna know how it ends</i>

185
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,278
<i>Wanna leave it to the night</i>

186
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:49,348
<i>I don't wanna break any promises</i>

187
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,218
<i>But wanna love you tonight…</i>

188
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,320
But in the end,

189
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,823
she said,
"No matter what, you're still my son."

190
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,759
"That part will never change."

191
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,596
"You can talk to me about anything."

192
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,770
You were carrying that by yourself
all this time? Since you came back?

193
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,737
Mmm.

194
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,741
That must've been tough.

195
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:17,710
Are you okay?

196
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,051
I'm fine…

197
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,088
<i>Take me anywhere</i>

198
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:34,460
<i>Take me everywhere you go</i>

199
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,230
<i>'Cause I don't wanna sleep alone</i>

200
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,833
<i>Take me anywhere</i>

201
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:46,205
<i>Bring me everywhere you go</i>

202
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:49,508
<i>And then we make love</i>

203
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,445
<i>I don't wanna know how it ends…</i>

204
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:55,314
Why are you crying? It's okay.

205
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,351
<i>I don't wanna break any promises…</i>

206
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,854
You don't have to cry.

207
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,394
But…

208
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,698
I know that she won't
ever fully understand,

209
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:17,470
but I'm sure everyone knows
what it is to love someone.

210
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:22,074
So I think she'll understand
that feeling someday.

211
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:23,909
Mmm.

212
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:31,751
<i>Remember the love from me</i>
<i>That you were given</i>

213
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:36,789
<i>I love everything you every showed </i>

214
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,358
<i>Take me anywhere</i>

215
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,295
<i>- Take me everywhere you go</i>
- It's okay. It's okay.

216
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,764
It's okay.

217
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,434
- It's okay.
<i>- 'Cause I don't wanna sleep alone</i>

218
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,103
<i>Take me anywhere </i>

219
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:56,575
<i>Bring me everywhere you go</i>

220
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,985
<i>And then we make love</i>

221
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:20,099
- Ohh.
- Mmm.

222
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:23,369
- So that's what happened.
- I see.

223
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,404
He never shows anything on his face.

224
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,373
- Yeah.
- I had no idea.

225
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,943
That's why, when Bomi asked Huwei right
after he came back if he saw his mom,

226
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,045
<i>Huwei only responded with "Mmm."</i>

227
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,915
<i>Now I get why his reaction was a bit off.</i>

228
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,686
The way he thinks of his mom's feelings,

229
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,622
about how he burdened her
with his own struggle…

230
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,191
Yeah, that's the Huwei we know.

231
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,692
I thought that was amazing.

232
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,995
When your coming out wasn't received
in the way you had hoped for,

233
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:53,599
many people end up regretting
coming out in the first place,

234
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,801
or even just blaming their parents.

235
00:13:56,602 --> 00:14:01,106
But he was able to take this perspective,
and I really think that's amazing.

236
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,776
I think seeing the way
Huwei confronted the situation

237
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,313
was something Bomi just couldn't
hold back from his emotions about.

238
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,215
- And that's beautiful.
- Right.

239
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:12,117
When his mom asked, "Can't you fix it?"

240
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:16,155
it was a hurtful thing to say,
as if she was saying he was broken.

241
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:19,625
But he knows that his mom
didn't mean any harm.

242
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,994
She just happened to use the wrong words,

243
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:25,130
and Huwei seemed to be
able to understand that calmly.

244
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:29,168
That acceptance he showed his mom,
that shows his real emotional maturity.

245
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:33,205
And his mom was still able
to assure him that he's still her son.

246
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,741
- That he'll never change, no matter what.
- True.

247
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,109
It's really rare

248
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,678
for a coming out story to be accepted

249
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:43,015
in all the ways
you hoped for or you had imagined.

250
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,550
In life,

251
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,819
even if you're related by blood,

252
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,655
there are some things
you just can't relate to each other about.

253
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,123
- There are.
- Right?

254
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:56,962
But there are times when I think you
don't have to be bound by those rules.

255
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:02,701
With family, you want them to understand
and accept you twice as much.

256
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,970
But I think it's completely okay

257
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:10,476
to build your own kind of family
with friends or partners who cry with you.

258
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:11,744
Truly.

259
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,514
For someone like Huwei,
who rarely shows emotion,

260
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,217
<i>having someone</i>
<i>he can share his pain with,</i>

261
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:22,087
and who he can say, "It hurts," to,
must be really reassuring.

262
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,389
That's so true.

263
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:26,025
I think it must have been
incredibly reassuring

264
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,760
to have someone who could cry with him,

265
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:30,429
sharing this same pain
as if it were his own.

266
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:38,504
Hey, the other day, Taeheon said we should
make Green Room hoodies with everyone.

267
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,205
Right, right, he mentioned that.

268
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,042
I had some free time yesterday.

269
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,879
- So I came up with an idea.
- Wow, impressive. You're quick.

270
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:47,846
I want you to see it.

271
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:52,451
It has a Green Room vibe,
and it feels like me.

272
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:53,719
<i>So pretty!</i>

273
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:55,220
Oh, I see.

274
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:59,992
I thought a big print like this
on the back would be cute too.

275
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:04,296
Well, I was thinking more along
these lines than having text on it.

276
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:08,968
But how about adding a motif to the side?

277
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,671
- And the names?
- Right, we could remove the names.

278
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,940
Even without the names,

279
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:18,077
I think it still works if everyone
knows their own flower.

280
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,914
- Oh, there's no red.
- Yeah, I wasn't sure who would be red.

281
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,284
But that red…
it won't come out very well anyways.

282
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,287
You're right.
It's hard to print a nice red color.

283
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,690
<i>When he said,</i>
<i>"That red won't come out very well,"</i>

284
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,526
<i>I was like, "That's such</i>
<i>a professional thing to say."</i>

285
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:38,664
If there's a date event,
I'd have to write down Taeheon's name.

286
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,266
Mmm. I wouldn't hesitate to choose him.

287
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,470
I'd love to see some art
or architecture with Taeheon.

288
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,807
- His tone is so funny.
- So funny.

289
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,809
- He's nonchalant.
- That's Hiroya's style.

290
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:51,777
BOWLING TOURNAMENT!

291
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,546
- I'm so excited!
- Bowling! Bowling!

292
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,815
- Hey! Bowling…
- <i>Ah, in a Sazae-san style.</i>

293
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,151
PALACE BOWL

294
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,887
The winner
of the individual match gets a date.

295
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:04,289
You get to choose
your partner for the date.

296
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,824
- Sounds good!
- I won't be able to go.

297
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:08,727
- Why not? You never know.
- You never know! Anything could happen.

298
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:11,797
There it goes!

299
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,766
- Oh, that's super good!
- Looking good!

300
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,571
<i>Hey! I'm done caring 'bout…</i>

301
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,874
- Oh, nice.
- Beautiful.

302
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,843
There you are!

303
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,181
I know, right?
He's way ahead so far, but…

304
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,786
- Hey! Wow!
- Wow.

305
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,954
Huwei's really good at it too.

306
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,460
I'm so bad. Maybe I should go home.

307
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,863
- You were so hyped.
- I'm going.

308
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,900
<i>Oh, boy, I'll take</i>
<i>Everything on the menu…</i>

309
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,768
Nice! Very good, very good!

310
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,237
- Whoa!
- Wow, amazing.

311
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,473
- I think I can hit 140.
- For sure.

312
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,378
- Yay!
- Nice.

313
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,286
Those went down in such a crazy way!

314
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,188
How do you even knock them down?

315
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,490
<i>I don't care about what others say</i>

316
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,826
<i>Hey! Don't worry…</i>

317
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:16,962
- Aah! Finally got a strike.
- Wow! Amazing.

318
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,597
- That was amazing.
- Good job.

319
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,699
Kazuyuki's really good.

320
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,735
- All right!
- It's over for me.

321
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,637
- Did you hit 170?
- I hit 170.

322
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,406
- That's high!
- Go home!

323
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,075
- You're too good at this.
- Go home!

324
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,077
Go home?

325
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,480
No words. I am completely defeated.

326
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,582
- Congratulations!
- Thanks!

327
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,550
<i>Kazuyuki has a hidden talent.</i>

328
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,052
- You're too good.
- Yeah.

329
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,906
"It became routine for us
to spend Christmas

330
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,709
and New Year's together every year."

331
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,978
<i>"Pre-ordering a Christmas cake together,</i>

332
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,514
<i>and then going out to buy</i>
<i>Christmas chicken on Christmas Day,</i>

333
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,415
<i>fully expecting a long line."</i>

334
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,285
<i>"We'd talk about what to make</i>
<i>for Christmas dinner each year,</i>

335

<i>whether to buy chicken or not."</i>

<i>"One year, we made cream stew."</i>

<i>"I fell asleep watching him do that."</i>

342
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,809
<i>"He told me he was thinking</i>
<i>about buying a house."</i>

343
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,013
<i>"Come to think of it,</i>
<i>I think the realtor asked us,</i>

344
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,447
<i>'What's your relationship?'"</i>

345
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:46,251
<i>"At the time, I smiled and answered,</i>
<i>'We're like family.'"</i>

346
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:51,290
<i>"That might've been the first time</i>
<i>I used the word 'family' to describe us."</i>

347
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,396
And I think…

348
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,365
This is the last page. This is a bit…

349
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:07,706
Um… "Around the time
the Labrador retriever turned 14…

350
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,375
he started eating less and less."

351
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,444
"When he couldn't eat anymore,

352
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,514
the thought that it was almost time
crossed my mind."

353
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:22,087
"He also said quietly,
'He might only have a few more days.'"

354
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,625
"A few days after he stopped eating,

355
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:30,495
he said,
'I'm going to sleep with Jazz tonight.'"

356
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,298
"When I woke up in the morning,
he was already awake,

357
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:36,501
and it seemed like he had
been watching over him all night."

358
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,938
"At around 10:00 a.m. that day,

359
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:45,544
I heard, 'Jazz! Jazz!'
coming from the second floor."

360
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:48,247
"When I hurried up to the second floor,

361
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,720
he said to me through tears,
'He just stopped breathing.'"

362
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:03,695
"He cried for a while
as he stroked Jazz's body."

363
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,065
"I cried just like him,

364
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:10,469
but when I thought about how much more
time he had spent with Jazz,

365
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,704
and how it must've
hurt more for him,

366
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,474
I couldn't say anything to him
at the time."

367
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,545
"It was the first time
I had ever seen him cry so hard."

368
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:26,184
When it comes to relationships,

369
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:31,356
my top non-negotiable is that
my partner must love animals.

370
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,759
And in that regard,

371
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:40,132
I think he loves animals more than
anyone else I've ever met.

372
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,967
Yeah, more than anyone else.

373
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,703
Mmm. He really was…

374
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,408
He really is a very loving person.

375
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,509
Mmm.

376
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:58,417
- Wanna do a random clothes swap?
- Sure, let's do that.

377
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,787
And in the morning,
we'll sit down and be like, "Huh?"

378
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:05,557
"We've switched places!"

379
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,826
<i>Tomoaki? Tomoaki?</i>

380
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,062
- All together. "Huh?"
- <i>I'm so happy.</i>

381
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,763
"We've switched places!"

382
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,067
Tomorrow morning,
we'll wear whatever's hanging in your room

383
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,201
and come here.

384
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,235
Got it.

385
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:23,275
<i>Hey! Make way for some madness</i>

386
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:26,278
<i>Move over</i>

387
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,316
- Here.
- <i>Did they swap?</i>

388
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,685
<i>Everyone's wearing each other's clothes.</i>

389
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,123
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

390
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,559
- Wait…
- Everyone looks different.

391
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,627
- You change your look?
- Different!

392
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:48,100
The fashion witch Tomoaki went ahead
and changed the clothes.

393
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,801
<i>Fashion witch Tomoaki?</i>

394
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,503
- This is fun.
- Thank you!

395
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,471
<i>Looks fun.</i>

396
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,539
- Thank you, witch.
- Witch.

397
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,975
- Rally good.
- This was fun.

398
00:22:57,075 --> 00:23:00,011
- Aki the Witch.
- Every once in a while.

399
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,381
I hate to interrupt the fun,

400
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,850
but there's something
I wanna share with everyone today.

401
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:05,917
Huh?

402
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:08,954
Well, um…

403
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:13,592
The initial reason that I came here,
or my motivation,

404
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:16,695
was to put to an end
my 15-year relationship

405
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,864
and start a new one.

406
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,665
I wanted to feel excitement.

407
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:25,604
And even at 40, I wanted to be able
to express my feelings honestly.

408
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,939
That's why I came here.

409
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:31,977
But I did a lot of thinking
while living here with y'all,

410
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:37,549
and I began to feel it would be good
to look back on the 15 years.

411
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:40,185
Mmm. And, for example…

412
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,355
Um, I made miso soup here pretty often,

413
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,191
<i>and you'd all drink it</i>
<i>and tell me how good it was.</i>

414
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:49,661
I used to make it often
when my ex and I lived together,

415
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:53,298
and I remembered how he used
to tell me it was really good too.

416
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,501
When Jobu talked about
watching the movie with his ex,

417
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:59,070
<i>I could really relate</i>
<i>to what he was saying.</i>

418
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:02,574
I remembered how happy we were,
laughing together.

419
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:06,344
When Taeheon talked about love,

420
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:11,349
you said that enduring and forgiving
are also forms of love.

421
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,752
<i>I could really relate to that,</i>

422
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,254
and when I thought about it,

423
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:19,891
I realized that my partner
had done that for me too.

424
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:24,095
When I told him that I needed to be alone,

425
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:27,499
he… he really… he hardly said anything.

426
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:31,770
He said, "Okay, I understand.
Let's both be alone and think."

427
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:35,574
Looking back, I've come to realize

428
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,710
that he accepted all of me.

429
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,046
I was able to realize that.

430
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,916
So I decided…

431
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:49,454
to continue the 15-year relationship.

432
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,057
To try one more time.

433
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:54,593
Mmm.

434
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:58,230
That's the conclusion I came to. Yeah.

435
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:02,701
And since I was able to come
to a solid conclusion,

436
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,705
I don't get
the grand princess prize at all.

437
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:09,574
Today, I will…

438
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,180
graduate from the Green Room.

439
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,557
Nice to meet you.
I'm Kazuyuki. It's good to be here.

440
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,992
It's good to have you.

441
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:29,227
I was in a relationship for 15 years.

442
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:32,697
The thought "Am I good enough?"
just won't go away.

443
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:36,234
A new relationship…
It'd be nice if it could happen.

444
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:40,005
"Let's be together, then."
And that's how we got together.

445
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:41,473
Wow, that's so nice.

446
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:44,509
Talking about it made me
want to cry a little.

447
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:49,381
<i>"You were crying so much next to me</i>
<i>that I started laughing halfway through."</i>

448
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,883
I remembered how he used to say that.

449
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:56,254
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Why are you crying?

450
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,290
- What? Hey!
- You're so emotional.

451
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,860
- I was thinking how happy I am for you.
- Kazuyuki!

452
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:04,396
After listening
to everyone's stories here,

453
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,365
I'm starting to think

454
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:11,303
that our relationship was
already in its final form.

455
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:13,705
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

456
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:18,310
<i>We used to dive</i>
<i>In our highest feelings </i>

457
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,845
<i>Are we growing older together? </i>

458
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,414
<i>Oh, oh, oh…</i>

459
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,083
I CRIED SO MUCH

460
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:30,689
I was able to come up with
a solid answer for myself.

461
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,792
I hope y'all can find
your own answers too,

462
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,660
so you don't end up with regrets.

463
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,997
I'm rooting for you.

464
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:42,467
- I'm rooting for you too.
- Thanks.

465
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:46,504
Ugh, I really picked the worst
time for our outfit change.

466
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:49,307
- I was thinking the same.
- I'm embarrassed. I'm really sorry.

467
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,675
Not at all, not at all.

468
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:53,845
What was the point of bowling then?
It doesn't matter now, does it?

469
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,348
I'll give my spot to Hiroya
who came in second.

470
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:59,618
Thanks. Yeah. Thanks.

471
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:02,854
But I'm glad you came
to that conclusion in the end.

472
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:05,957
- It's a huge decision, after all.
- Mmm.

473
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:08,059
Well, no matter how things turn out,

474
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,861
I think it's great
you're at peace with it.

475
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,564
<i>"Forever young and so wild"</i>

476
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,734
<i>"Or pull a gun and then fire it"</i>

477
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,070
<i>"Easy," she said</i>
<i>She said…</i>

478
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,939
- Thanks, Kazu.
- Thanks.

479
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,375
<i>"You're never young if you don't run</i>
<i>So get over</i>…<i>"</i>

480
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:26,678
- I'm glad you could come to a conclusion.
- Yeah, thanks.

481
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:29,080
- Bomi!
- Thank you.

482
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,148
Thank you.

483
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,483
Huwei.

484
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,551
- Good luck.
- Yeah, thanks.

485
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:37,022
B.T.C.
US, JOURNEY, AND COFFEE

486
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:41,326
<i>- These things</i>
<i>- I never thought when you were mine</i>

487
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:43,294
<i>We used to break it together…</i>

488
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:45,864
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you too.

489
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:49,668
I'm glad.

490
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:51,569
- I don't know, um…
- Um…

491
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:57,008
If you hadn't been there,
I think things would have been different.

492
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:00,478
- Thank you for worrying about me. Yeah.
- No problem.

493
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:02,647
- Sorry I've been roasting you a bit hard.
- Not at all.

494
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:06,184
But I'm happy you were
able to make a decision.

495
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:07,585
I'm off.

496
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,721
- Thank you, for real.
- Thank you.

497
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,256
Take care.

498
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:13,992
Oh no.

499
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,862
Well, good luck, everyone.
I'm rooting for you.

500
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:20,465
- Bye-bye.
- I'm rooting for you.

501
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,833
Thank you so much.

502
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:32,410
<i>I don't think I would have been</i>
<i>able to reflect on things so seriously</i>

503
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,946
<i>if I hadn't come here.</i>

504
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:36,081
<i>Yeah.</i>

505
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,749
I think it's become…

506
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:38,683
Mmm.

507
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,421
…a major starting point in my life.

508
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:47,492
Well, I don't know how things will turn
out after I go back to talk to him.

509
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,062
But regardless of the outcome,
it's a decision I made myself.

510
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:54,032
Yes, so I want to accept it.

511
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,534
And I will move forward.

512
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,642
That was amazing, again.

513
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:07,445
I didn't know
things could turn out like this.

514
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:10,014
Even though we're only seeing
one side of the story,

515
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,485
it feels like we've gradually started
to see the other person too.

516
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,820
Every time he reads his diary or notes,

517
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,356
I really get a sense
of what his partner was like.

518
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,725
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

519
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:25,430
People always say that in love,
you have to keep moving forward.

520
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:28,032
There's this idea that it's better
to meet someone new

521
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:31,169
than to stay with someone
you've spent your past with.

522
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:35,273
But in this season, there were many people
who had already met each other.

523
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,408
Wow, truly.

524
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:41,713
And after 15 years with his partner,
when everything had become routine,

525
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,383
Kazuyuki decided it was enough,
and he said goodbye.

526
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,586
And then he realized how precious
that routine actually had been.

527
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:51,856
All the memories he talks about
are just everyday moments, right?

528
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:55,593
But when you think about how these
ordinary days piling up

529
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,095
turn to something priceless…

530
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:59,297
- So true.
- That's really how it is.

531
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,232
He's going to tell him how he feels.

532
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,901
- After this.
- Right after this?

533
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,936
No matter what the outcome is.

534
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:07,906
- I really hope it works out.
- I hope it goes well too.

535
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,474
Right? I hope things go well.

536
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,243
And I want them
to watch this broadcast together.

537
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,312
He can be like,
"This is what I was a part of."

538
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,683
We're a smaller group now.

539
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,785
The older ones keep leaving.

540
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,755
- Next is Taeheon, then me.
- Why would you say that?

541
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,191
- I want Taeheon to stay.
- That's how it is.

542
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,693
- I want you to stay too.
- Speaking of which…

543
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,130
I have to work today.

544
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:33,865
I see.

545
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:36,034
- You scared me, don't do that.
- Thank goodness.

546
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,136
- Hope you have a good day.
- Thanks.

547
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:39,137
Have a good day!

548
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:43,308
He said we should do hoodies.

549
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:46,644
- Oh, here it is.
- That made me jump just now.

550
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:51,783
Today's shift leader will be
whoever volunteers.

551
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:53,218
I see.

552
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:57,422
"Anyone who wants to be the shift leader,
please put your hand up."

553
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:58,857
I wanna go.

554
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:00,158
Oh!

555
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:02,060
I wanna go too.

556
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,462
- You wanna go?
- Anyone else?

557
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:07,065
- Are you good?
- Mmm.

558
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:09,534
- What's your reason?
- My reason…

559
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:13,638
Well, when I first got here,
I was really nervous

560
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:17,408
and I couldn't get used to this life here.

561
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:20,278
But living with everyone like this

562
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:24,649
has really helped my mindset
become more positive.

563
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,620
So now, the reason
I'm putting my own hand up…

564
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:31,656
because I want to do this.

565
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:35,393
So I want to cherish this

566
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:39,831
feeling of my personal growth.

567
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,402
That is how I feel.

568
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:45,970
<i>That's a really good reason.</i>

569
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,239
- What about you, Bomi?
- Fair enough.

570
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,074
I'll let you go. It's fine. Go for it.

571
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:52,810
- That was quick!
- No objections from me.

572
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:54,746
- No objections whatsoever.
- Oh, are you sure?

573
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,750
<i>Wonder who he'll choose.</i>

574
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:02,453
<i>It's the first time we'll be able</i>
<i>to see how he feels in that way.</i>

575
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:09,894
- <i>Ooh!</i>
- <i>Hiroya!</i>

576
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,462
<i>Really?</i>

577
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:12,664
Let's work together.

578
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,732
Let's do it.

579
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,235
- Have a good time.
- Thanks. We're off.

580
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:19,370
So interesting!

581
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,339
Things getting exciting around Hiroya.

582
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:23,408
Hiroya's getting busy.

583
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:29,113
I actually like
that other rectangular one too.

584
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,014
Got it.

585
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:34,585
I just made a really weird face.
A really weird face.

586
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:35,920
Here we go.

587
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:39,390
How's that?

588
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,627
- It might have been too close to me.
- What, really? Let's take it again.

589
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:45,430
This is gonna take all day!

590
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:47,799
Okay, shall we clean up?

591
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:49,667
- Let's clean up.
- Let's close up.

592
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:51,769
We even took a Polaroid photo.

593
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:54,505
No, no, zero yen!

594
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,507
- We can't leave with zero sales!
- That's hilarious.

595
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:59,010
- <i>But they're having fun.</i>
- <i>Looks really fun.</i>

596
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,079
AINU KOTAN

597
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:04,215
- Oh. Would you like some coffee? Please?
- Would you like some?

598
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:05,883
- Could I get one?
- A coffee?

599
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:06,851
Thank you.

600
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:09,587
- Are you comfortable with pour-over?
- I can make that.

601
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,056
- I'll leave the drip coffee to you, then.
- Sure.

602
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:17,495
When I'm making pour-over coffee,

603
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,864
it makes me feel centered.

604
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:23,501
I know what you mean. It makes
me think, "I could do this for life."

605
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,803
- It gets you in the mood, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

606
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,905
Thank you very much!

607
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:29,907
- Thank you!
- Thank you very much.

608
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:32,477
- Can we just celebrate for now?
- Yay, we pulled it off.

609
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:34,379
- Not just "yay," but yay!
- Yay!

610
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:38,182
TODAY'S SALES:
4,850 YEN

611
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,519
- Yay.
- Good job. Cheers.

612
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:44,355
What was it? You were trying
to say something earlier, right?

613
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,791
I have this childhood friend who's a girl.

614
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,726
We've been really close since we were six.

615
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:49,660
That's rare.

616
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:52,196
And she just got married last year.

617
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,699
I felt a real shock.

618
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:58,770
Well, you see,
the reason why I felt that way is

619
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:01,739
because when I went to her wedding,

620
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:05,777
I realized that this is a kind
of happiness that I can never have.

621
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:09,013
- Because you're gay?
- Well, yeah, pretty much.

622
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,483
- The thing is, I haven't told my family.
- Oh, is that so?

623
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,452
- Yeah.
- I see, I see.

624
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:17,522
Are you worried that
your family might be prejudiced?

625
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,392
My family…

626
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,694
I don't think my family

627
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,798
will accept my sexuality.

628
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:32,170
I may not be able to get married

629
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,439
or even have children,

630
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:36,741
but I want them to know

631
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:40,211
that I'm just like anyone else
people call "normal."

632
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:44,649
I fall in love,
I have good days and bad days,

633
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,184
and I'm just…

634
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:48,853
I'm just a regular person like that.

635
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,322
That's honestly what I want most.

636
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:55,593
I just want them to understand that.

637
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:58,463
Like…

638
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:02,834
I really hope that prejudice
can shrink even a little,

639
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:06,904
so we can live more openly
in this society as we are,

640
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:09,307
You know, right?
That's what I really want.

641
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,675
Mmm. I agree.

642
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:15,379
I really wish all the painful experiences
could end with our generation.

643
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:18,749
I really hope so.

644
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:25,690
When I just talk honestly
about how I'm feeling,

645
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:29,327
he really, really gets it
and relates with me.

646
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:35,867
Today's coffee truck shift was honestly
just pure fun from the bottom of my heart.

647
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:38,236
- <i>That's wonderful.</i>
- <i>It was really natural.</i>

648
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:42,140
Hmm?

649
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,509
What's that?

650
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,410
I CAME TO SEE YOU
I'LL WAIT AT THE FOOT BATH

651
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,945
- What's going on?
- What?

652
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:48,880
Wait a second.

653
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:50,948
- <i>Wait a second.</i>
- <i>Who is it?</i>

654
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,316
Wait, wait, wait.

655
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,252
Hmm?

656
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,220
Foot bath?

657
00:35:58,055 --> 00:35:59,090
Foot bath?

658
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,893
Huh? What?

659
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:04,762
- <i>Wait, what's going on?</i>
- <i>Yeah, who is it?</i>

660
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:12,203
- <i>A sister?</i>
- <i>Older sister or younger?</i>

661
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,510
No way!

662
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:21,312
It's been a while!

663
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:22,713
Oh!

664
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,648
Aah!

665
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:24,815
<i>Is it his mother?</i>

666
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:26,450
- <i>Is it his mom?</i>
- <i>Maybe.</i>

667
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,718
Too fast, too fast.

668
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:29,020
YUKA
JOBU'S MOTHER

669
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,489
I already cried once just
thinking about coming here.

670
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:35,726
You surprised me! Wait, hold on.
Just sit down. It's all soaked now!

671
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:39,363
- Anyway, so? How is it?
- What do you mean?

672
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,332
So Kansai!

673
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:43,201
Jumping to, "So? How is it?"

674
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:46,470
Is there anyone here
you can bring back to Osaka?

675
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,572
No. Not at the moment.

676
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:50,341
In the first half, there was
someone I was hitting it off with.

677
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:52,677
Or rather, someone I was interested in,
but that ended.

678
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:56,147
He went back home. And just as
I was giving up, someone new came in.

679
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:57,615
This person.

680
00:36:58,115 --> 00:36:59,483
Oh, and this one…

681
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,285
- You watched season one, right?
- Mmm.

682
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:03,854
It's Taeheon. Taeheon-san.

683
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,489
Actually, can I come to your room today?

684
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,592
- Don't come! Please don't come.
- Can I just come?

685
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:11,028
- His mom wants to see him too.
- I want her to come, though.

686
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:13,431
Naturally, I got excited. I was so hyped.

687
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,132
- I was so hyped,
- Because he came.

688
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,535
- And then, we went to the coffee truck.
- Oh?

689
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:21,138
And it was painfully dead.
I was shocked, like, "What?"

690
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:24,308
Wait, but isn't he kind of like that
with everyone?

691
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:27,345
- He never gets excited with other people.
- Ah, well, I mean…

692
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,713
Oh, well, yeah.

693
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:32,083
Right, but listen! I made <i>oden </i>today.

694
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:34,352
What? There it is!

695
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,121
- How long has it been?
- I don't know if everyone will like it.

696
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:38,689
- I've separated the eggs and…
- Yeah.

697
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:39,957
<i>This is so homey!</i>

698
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:42,093
<i>- Konjac </i>jelly in this container.
- <i>Homey vibe!</i>

699
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,028
<i>Moms always bring food in Tupperware.</i>

700
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,796
<i>And then she bags them too!</i>

701
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,665
- I'll have a bite.
- Go ahead.

702
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:50,167
<i>This is the best.</i>

703
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:52,670
It's delicious.

704
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,072
- I feel energized now.
- Oh, I'm glad.

705
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,109
I want to ask you something
out of curiosity.

706
00:37:58,175 --> 00:37:59,677
It's not like some super heavy topic.

707
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:03,814
Remember we had dinner
with the guy I used to date.

708
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:08,219
But before that, I never really told you.
I never said out loud that I liked men.

709
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,187
Ah. Oh, oh, oh.

710
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:13,124
- I don't think we'd ever talked about it.
- You never did.

711
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,226
I just thought you knew,
like, from birth.

712
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,094
Since you were born?

713
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:18,362
I was sure you'd found out.

714
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:21,299
Well, not exactly found out, but you
must've known since elementary school.

715
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:24,535
- So you knew from elementary school?
- My first year of junior high.

716
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:31,942
Wait, what? I thought you knew.

717
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:34,979
- I mean, we never really talked about it.
- That's not it.

718
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:38,716
You know, when I found out,

719
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:42,553
the main thing I wanted to say
was that, um…

720
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:48,326
I thought you must have really struggled
when you realized you like boys.

721
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,396
You must have struggled all alone.
And that…

722
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:57,702
And I just… I really didn't want you
to have to go through that by yourself.

723
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:59,503
That was what hurt me the most.

724
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,038
Oh.

725
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,040
That much?

726
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:04,575
I might have struggled more

727
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:07,912
if I thought that telling you
would ruin our relationship.

728
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:10,648
But I figured nothing would
change even if I told you.

729
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:14,518
You're right.
No one in the family would change.

730
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:15,886
Nope, not at all.

731
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,123
So I felt like there was
no real need to say it,

732
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,359
and I didn't struggle that much.

733
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:22,927
- Oh, is that so?
- Like…

734
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:24,562
Then I guess I didn't have to cry, huh?

735
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,264
- I guess not!
- Right?

736
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:29,233
Of course, it's not like
I didn't struggle at all.

737
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:33,904
Back then, I used to wear pink clothes
at photo studios. And Hello Kitty…

738
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,173
Sorry, I was the one who
made you wear pink outfits.

739
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,242
It was you? Isn't that why?

740
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,510
- What? No way.
- Who knows?

741
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:42,313
Maybe that's why I ended up liking pink.
I feel better now.

742
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,081
- Really?
- Yeah, I feel great.

743
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,517
Then maybe I'll stick close to you
before you go.

744
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:49,053
I still have this mission left,

745
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,722
to talk one-on-one in the next two
to three… two to three weeks.

746
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:55,226
Oh, good luck.
Cheering for you. You've got this.

747
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:57,528
You're going to cry again.

748
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,897
- But you made me feel better.
- Jo-chan, Jo-chan!

749
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:01,198
So great to see you.

750
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,634
- I'll come home again soon.
- Okay.

751
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:06,036
Bye-bye. Thanks. See you.

752
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:07,972
- Take care.
- Okay.

753
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:09,740
- Thanks.
- Uh-huh.

754
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:13,577
- There really are all kinds of families.
- Yeah, really.

755
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:15,646
I'm back.

756
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,348
- Welcome.
- Where were you?

757
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,485
- I was with my mom.
- Really?

758
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,053
- Oh!
- My mom came to see me.

759
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,623
- Oh, that's what it was?
- Yeah, it's been a while.

760
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:29,360
Yeah, we were just chatting.
Are you guys making dinner already?

761
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,195
My mom makes <i>oden </i>very often.

762
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,631
- Wait, she made some for you?
- She made a batch.

763
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,966
- Your mom came here?
- That's amazing.

764
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:39,136
- She brought it all the way here.
- Wow.

765
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:40,971
- That's a long way.
- I know.

766
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:43,140
- This is love.
- It is love.

767
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,644
- That's a lot,
- There's so much.

768
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,145
- We'll never finish it.
- Wow.

769
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:49,113
Wow.

770
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,283
She probably already had it all cooked.

771
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:55,553
- We just reheat it.
- I wonder where she made it.

772
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:59,089
- She made it in Osaka and brought it.
- It's amazing that she brought it.

773
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:00,257
So sweet.

774
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:04,728
That's love, pure mother's love.

775
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:07,431
- Let's dig in.
- Let's dig in!

776
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,167
- Thank you.
- We have to thank Jobu's mom.

777
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:11,235
So grateful.

778
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,937
Okay, please try some.

779
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,572
Thank you, Jobu's mom.

780
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:17,908
- This is delicious. It's sweet.
- Is it sweet?

781
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,744
It's totally different from
the <i>oden </i>I grew up with.

782
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,013
- I'm glad.
- Super yum.

783
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,448
It's really good.

784
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,450
Weren't a lot of people out today?

785
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,253
We talked a lot, just the two of us.

786
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,522
- About coming out.
- Oh, yeah, about coming out.

787
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:32,656
Yeah.

788
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,627
Who else has come out? You? Three people?

789
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,332
Since I was in university,

790
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:43,367
I've been doing
these kinds of art projects,

791
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,569
and I held a photo exhibition.

792
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,439
The theme was LGBT.

793
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:53,744
It made the front page of the newspaper,
and that's how I ended up coming out.

794
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:55,946
How did your family react?

795
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,716
The night the newspaper came out,
my mom said,

796
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:00,251
"Let's have a family meeting."

797
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:04,855
Each of my family members gave me
words of support. It was nice.

798
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:07,258
- They were all very supportive.
- I see.

799
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:10,294
- Everyone said, "We'll walk together."
- So you had a proper meeting.

800
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:13,531
For me, I really feel

801
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:16,300
this expectation

802
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,470
that my dad wants me

803
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:21,906
to have kids.

804
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,874
Does he actually say that to you?

805
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,676
Sometimes he does.

806
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,045
Coming out…

807
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,248
isn't just about me

808
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:34,385
being attracted to men,

809
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:37,488
it's more about the fact that I won't,

810
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:41,025
um, be able to give him grandkids.

811
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:43,060
Yeah, so…

812
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,765
Mmm.

813
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:49,767
<i>He's really struggling with it.</i>

814
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:52,403
<i>They're all in the same boat.</i>

815
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:55,406
I think my dad

816
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,641
would be really sad

817
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:00,377
about not being able to see my kids.

818
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,080
I think he'd be disappointed.

819
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:09,386
I can't tell him.

820
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:15,292
It's not like I think anyone is to blame.

821
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,395
I don't think there's anything
wrong with me either.

822
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:21,265
But when I think about coming out,

823
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:25,035
I think about what my parents
had done for me.

824
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,938
When I was little,
I'd get sick and had a high fever,

825
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:29,940
and my parents would try
to stay up all night,

826
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:32,209
holding my hand until I fell asleep.

827
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:37,014
And when I accomplished something,
even something small,

828
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:40,317
they would celebrate
as if it had happened to them.

829
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:45,255
When those faces pop into my head,
I just feel so guilty.

830
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,025
It's not that anyone's to blame.

831
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:53,464
I'm open about it now.
I learned how to be open about it, so…

832
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:57,401
I don't want you to feel like you have
to live up to someone's expectations.

833
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:03,307
You might feel guilty,
but that's because of who you are.

834
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,175
You're a kind person.

835
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:08,979
I mean, just because
you were born from them,

836
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:12,850
doesn't mean we have to live up
to the expectations of our parents.

837
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,253
We're human beings, not objects.

838
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:19,556
So, I came out.

839
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,193
I'd cut ties if I was rejected.

840
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,496
- <i>Mmm.</i>
- <i>That's how it was for Taeheon.</i>

841
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,165
Because it's my life.

842
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:32,870
Mmm.

843
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:38,208
Yeah, this society sucks, doesn't it?

844
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,080
I don't want to be defeated by this.

845
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:46,784
Right now, like…

846
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:52,322
the fact that Jobu's mom cooked <i>oden</i>
and brought it all the way here,

847
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,325
and that she's accepting him like this…

848
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,162
I don't know.

849
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,832
That reality, to me, is

850
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:04,835
honestly like a miracle.

851
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,739
But still, yeah, it's difficult.

852
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:13,343
No matter what I say, I feel like
I'm talking from a place of privilege.

853
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,245
Because our situations
are completely different.

854
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,815
- Yeah.
- Right. But…

855
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:23,287
I can really feel how much everyone
here cares about your parents.

856
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:26,290
But I think all parents

857
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,259
care about their children just as much.

858
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:33,263
Mmm.

859
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,531
But still,

860
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:37,434
after hearing everyone's stories,

861
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:41,071
I just can't say, "Here's how I did it,"
or "You should tell them,"

862
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:42,906
because it's not that simple.

863
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:45,809
Mmm.

864
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:49,179
Yeah, I really feel how complicated it is.

865
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:55,319
Mmm.

866
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:56,653
Right.

867
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:00,524
And with Ryuki too,
I really get that feeling of,

868
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,127
"I can't show them my kids,
or his grandkids."

869
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,428
He knows what they want.

870
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,296
- He's afraid to disappoint them.
- He's only 20.

871
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:10,000
But before that, I think
any parent would absolutely hate

872
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:12,936
to see their child standing
in front of them looking sad.

873
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:17,541
Like Taeheon said, I don't think
they have to torture themselves that much.

874
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,476
- Even though I get why they do.
- True.

875
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:24,815
That dilemma of "I haven't done anything
wrong, but I might still hurt them,"

876
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:27,417
must be crushing everyone's feelings.

877
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:30,687
At the core of it, I think it all
comes from loving their parents.

878
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:33,423
- Exactly.
- Not wanting to see their parents sad.

879
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:37,194
Wanting to live up to their expectations.
That's because they love them.

880
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:41,331
Yeah. So the mothers, fathers,
and the sons, everyone.

881
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:43,066
- They care about each other.
- Yeah.

882
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,868
That's why I loved what Taeheon said.

883
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:47,137
"The guilt you feel is actually
a sign of your kindness."

884
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:49,840
- He said that. So true.
- I thought that was so beautiful.

885
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:56,847
Oh, here it is.

886
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:00,551
- "Good morning."
- Good morning.

887
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:05,622
"Today, the coffee truck will be going
on a two-day trip to Sapporo."

888
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:07,424
- Huh?
- Wow.

889
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,059
For real?

890
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:11,361
- Okay, okay, okay. I see.
- That's wild.

891
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:14,698
"Write down the name
of the person you want to work with."

892
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:17,601
I'm dying. Wait a sec.

893
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,605
"You can only go on the trip
if both of your feelings are mutual."

894
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:22,539
Seriously?

895
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,308
I want to go to Sapporo.

896
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:26,276
- I mean…
- I want to go to Sapporo.

897
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:28,512
"We'll announce the pairs shortly."

898
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:30,781
- So does that mean we're leaving now?
- Right?

899
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:34,952
- Oh, I want to work in Sapporo.
- I wanna go.

900
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:41,024
- <i>It's an overnight date, too.</i>
- <i>Exactly.</i>

901
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:43,427
<i>- They're spending the night together.</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

902
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:07,618
Here we go.

903
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:10,520
Here we go.

904
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,360
I'll read them out.

905
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:19,263
<i>So, who's going with who?</i>

906
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:23,300
"We'll now announce the pairs
who get to go on the trip."

907
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:26,536
"First pair."

908
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:35,145
Uh, "Huwei."

909
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,652
- Uh, "Bomi."
- <i>Mmm.</i>

910
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:45,322
- <i>Their bond is getting stronger!</i>
- <i>Have a good trip!</i>

911
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:49,760
"Second pair."

912
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,863
<i>A second pair!</i>

913
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,097
<i>Who is it?</i>

914
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:56,066
"Taeheon."

915
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:10,147
"Jobu."

916
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:17,621
<i>Taeheon!</i>

917
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:27,030
Are you serious?

918
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:28,632
That's awesome!

919
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,767
- Wait a minute!
- What?

920
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:33,971
I don't get his princess act at all!
