1
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,218
It says they have an announcement.

2
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:22,989
"For today's work shift,
Jobu will be on duty."

3
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,458
- It's been a while.
- Jobu, good.

4
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:29,729
"Jobu, please choose one person you want
to run the coffee truck with today."

5
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,466
Your hair's fine.

6
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,402
It's fine. You look totally cool.

7
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:36,770
I hate my hair so much.

8
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:39,873
IT PROJECT MANAGER

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,008
DESIGNER

10
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:45,378
MARKETER AT MANUFACTURING COMPANY

11
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,153
- Let's work together.
- Let's work together.

12
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:57,457
- Oh, I'm excited. I can finally go.
- Yay.

13
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,895
- It's been a while.
- Yeah, I haven't gone for over ten days.

14
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:06,099
- Have fun, you guys.
- Thank you.

15
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,667
Nice!

16
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,968
- Finally!
- Good luck!

17
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:11,471
Is he okay?
He might be too shy to sell coffee.

18
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:33,593
It's raining pretty hard.

19
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,963
- It's cold today, isn't it?
- Yeah, it's cold.

20
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,699
Hello.

21
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:43,236
Would you like some coffee?

22
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,005
Hello.

23
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,608
Would you like some hot coffee?

24
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,078
Last time,
quite a few people stopped by here.

25
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,021
<i>Impressive that he can put his head there.</i>

26
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:03,289
<i>Yeah.</i>

27
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,296
- <i>They're not talking.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

28
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,765
- <i>Maybe they're too shy.</i>
- We're selling coffee.

29
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:13,933
Would you like some?

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,636
We have drip coffee, caffe latte.

31
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,938
We also have chocolate milk
and other stuff.

32
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,741
- Chocolate milk.
- The chocolate milk is super good.

33
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,812
Three medium chocolate milks,
if you please.

34
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,814
- Three mediums.
- Yes. And…

35
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:31,284
Do we have three?
Can we make three more chocolate milks?

36
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,719
We can…

37
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:35,488
Okay, we can. Three medium milks and…

38
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,658
One medium caffe latte, if you please.

39
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,026
- Okay.
- Check.

40
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,127
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

41
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:46,099
What's this?
The espresso isn't coming out.

42
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,134
But it came out earlier, right?

43
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:50,837
They've been waiting so long.

44
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,679
It's coming out a little, but this is…

45
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:02,682
- I think we might need to taste it first.
- Really?

46
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,151
Maybe we should just refund
the four drinks.

47
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:08,121
I'm sorry,
but we have to refund your money.

48
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,356
Oh, so we can't order
the regular blend either?

49
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:14,160
- Oh, we can make drip coffee, but…
- I'm okay with drip coffee.

50
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,995
I'll give you this and order drip coffee.

51
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,131
Are you sure?
We'd have to start making it now,

52
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,266
so you'd be waiting in the cold
for a little longer.

53
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,101
- <i>It must be so bitter.</i>
- <i>No!</i>

54
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:23,336
<i>Blegh!</i>

55
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,104
2,200YEN

56
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,507
<i>Well, yeah, they had trouble.</i>

57
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:30,643
Hmm.

58
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,949
I wanted to talk with you, Taeheon.

59
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,550
I'm happy to hear that.

60
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,986
You don't really talk much about yourself.

61
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,822
You mean I don't talk
when I'm with everyone?

62
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,325
Hmm…

63
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,495
I don't know. That's the impression I get.

64
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,332
Hmm. Then maybe you should ask me things.

65
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,800
I'll gladly do that.

66
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,469
I promise I'll ask.

67
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,706
That's what I mean.

68
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:00,673
Mm.

69
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,810
<i>Oh, what's wrong?</i>
<i>Jobu's not acting like himself.</i>

70
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,445
<i>Maybe he's nervous?</i>

71
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,548
<i>He tends to get like this</i>
<i>around people he likes.</i>

72
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:13,219
- Hmm.
- Um, I was wondering what to talk about.

73
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,826
I've been wanting to meet you
for a long time.

74
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,361
- Mm.
- Mm.

75
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,464
Who would've thought
we'd get to meet here?

76
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,000
I know, right? That's why I was surprised.

77
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,303
I was planning to choose you
when my turn came.

78
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,840
Mm. I'm glad.

79
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,809
I'm glad we got to talk one-on-one
for the first time.

80
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,427
- <i>Taeheon's not his usual self.</i>
- <i>Yeah, something's off.</i>

81
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:06,339
- Anything else you want to say?
- Anything else?

82
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,808
You said you wanted to talk with me,
right?

83
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,680
We still have a month left,
so I'd be happy if we could talk again.

84
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,082
- Let's talk again.
- Hmm.

85
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:34,967
<i>- "Think easy," she said</i>
<i>- She said</i>

86
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,303
<i>"Forever young and so wild"</i>

87
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,406
<i>"Or pull a gun and then fire it"</i>

88
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:44,077
<i>- "Easy," she said</i>
<i>- She said</i>

89
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:49,882
<i>"You're never young if you don't run</i>
<i>So get over"</i>

90
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:53,019
<i>- We still got walls on both sides</i>
<i>- Sides</i>

91
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,520
<i>Maybe</i>

92
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:57,457
<i>- I wanna know how to climb</i>
<i>- Climb</i>

93
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,158
<i>- We're blind, blind</i>
<i>- Blind</i>

94
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:02,261
<i>- How'd we get air all this time?</i>
<i>- This time</i>

95
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:03,830
<i>- These things</i>
<i>- These things</i>

96
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,032
<i>I never thought when you were mine</i>

97
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,701
<i>We used to break it together</i>

98
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,570
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

99
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:15,241
<i>We used to dive</i>
<i>In our highest feelings</i>

100
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,910
<i>Are we growing older together?</i>

101
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,812
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

102
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:24,484
<i>I don't wanna miss anything</i>
<i>When I'm dreaming about</i>

103
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,420
<i>When we were dazed and confused</i>

104
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,528
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven?

105
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:36,863
- Seven is fine.
- Seven?

106
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:37,997
Then let's use seven.

107
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,134
- What is it?
- Why do you look so sleepy?

108
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,102
- Huh?
- Because it's cold today.

109
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,838
Why? Because the heater was turned off?

110
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,740
Yeah, that's part of it.

111
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,609
It's okay. I'll cook.

112
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:51,277
Move over.

113
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,845
- I don't have to do anything?
- Mm.

114
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,982
Vegetable oil.

115
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,361
I'd like to talk about our future together
in more detail.

116
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,797
I wanna know
whether we wanna get married or not.

117
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:14,801
It's not necessarily about us. There are
things you want for yourself, right?

118
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,804
But you never know. People change.

119
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,272
Mm.

120
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,644
<i>It's about now versus the future.</i>

121
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,446
<i>He wants to know.</i>

122
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:33,252
<i>My favorite book I leant you </i>

123
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,623
<i>Can't he be content that they're together?</i>

124
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,792
<i>I guess it's not enough for him.</i>

125
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,597
Why did you just stop smiling?

126
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,133
It's not that I stopped smiling.

127
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,369
I was wondering if I was too optimistic.

128
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,940
Isn't it better to be optimistic?
I'm optimistic.

129
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,876
You're pessimistic too. You were like,
"What'll happen once we leave here?"

130
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,177
No. Once we leave… No.

131
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,379
I have an idea
of what it'll be like once we leave,

132
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,216
but I'm saying I'm not sure
since we're not actually there yet.

133
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,686
With all the thinking
we've been doing lately,

134
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,255
we haven't had
that much physical intimacy yet.

135
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:12,124
Normally, that's the kind of thing
you worry about

136
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,460
after spending more time with each other,

137
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:18,130
sleeping together at night,
and doing that over and over.

138
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,234
But we're already thinking too much
about the future,

139
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,302
and that's throwing everything else off.

140
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,837
I hear you. We're missing those steps.

141
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,473
Yeah, that's exactly it.
We should be making out a lot,

142
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,709
sleeping together,
and spending time together, you know?

143
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:30,610
I get it.

144
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,613
I think it would work
if we did that over and over, right?

145
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,881
Mm.

146
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:38,317
So far, our relationship hasn't changed
that much since we got together.

147
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,252
You're right.

148
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,420
You want that excitement, you know?

149
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:42,588
Mm.

150
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:46,225
With how I feel right now,
I can't reach that level you're at.

151
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,728
- Mm, mm, mm.
- I want you to understand that.

152
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:49,662
I understand now.

153
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,933
- I understand perfectly.
- Okay.

154
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,704
<i>They can't feel that excitement,</i>
<i>even if they want to.</i>

155
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:01,974
That's it.

156
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,717
Oh, they're back.

157
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:12,818
- Oh.
- So soon?

158
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,320
Welcome back.

159
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,522
- We're back.
- Welcome back.

160
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,224
- Hi there.
- You're back so soon.

161
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,306
- Wait, are you putting all of it in?
- Is it too much?

162
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:35,841
Isn't it going to be too salty?
It's too much.

163
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,383
<i>I don't understand</i>
<i>what happened to these two.</i>

164
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,361
- Huh?
- Six.

165
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,697
It's seven, right?

166
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,199
- No, it's six, six… Six. Seven.
- I was counting.

167
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,300
It's eight.

168
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,970
Stop it already. Eight.

169
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,871
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

170
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,207
How are you? Are you doing okay, Ryu?

171
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,442
I'm good, thanks.

172
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,378
This is awkward. Oh no.

173
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,016
Usually, you'd say something, right?

174
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,953
I don't know if he's mad
or if he doesn't like me,

175
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,155
but it was seriously

176
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,693
the least fun I've ever had
in the Green Room.

177
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:29,829
It was like…

178
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,598
I don't know what he was hoping for.

179
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:38,170
Even the questions he asked me
weren't very memorable at all.

180
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:44,644
I was like,
"How exactly did he want to get to know me

181
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,113
when he turned my nameplate around?"

182
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,082
- What does he…
- Really?

183
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,117
Oh…

184
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,619
- That's being difficult.
- Wait, Taeheon…

185
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:54,687
Taeheon!

186
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,957
We'd never seen him
in a romantic situation before,

187
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,660
so this side of him is pretty shocking.

188
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:01,827
It really is quite shocking.

189
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:03,663
It's the first time
we've seen him like that.

190
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:06,399
Jobu probably wanted to have
a lively, lighthearted chat,

191
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,901
but maybe he couldn't pull it off today.

192
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:09,835
That's true.

193
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,271
Maybe it looked like
Jobu was trying too hard,

194
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,707
or maybe he didn't understand
and took it the wrong way.

195
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,443
Maybe Taeheon felt, "If you chose me
because you were interested,

196
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,011
you should've asked questions."

197
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,880
Maybe Taeheon's princess side
really came out.

198
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,848
- Maybe so.
- His princess side showed.

199
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:23,783
Maybe.

200
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,751
Like, "You're the one who picked me,
so go on."

201
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,688
- Oh, that sounds about right!
- That's what princess types are like.

202
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:31,557
Wow, he's way more of a princess
than I thought he'd be.

203
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,759
That puts him on a whole other level.

204
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:34,794
Oh wow.

205
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,796
We saw an unexpected side of Taeheon.

206
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,331
- I wanna see a bit more.
- It's really hard to read him.

207
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,534
- It's hard to judge.
- It's too early to tell.

208
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,537
So Izaya feels reassured
when William says things like that.

209
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,272
Yeah. Once he gets some information,

210
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,475
he goes, "If that's the case,
then I'll put away my sword." Yeah.

211
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,243
That's very nicely put.

212
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,380
But the problem between those two
became very clear, didn't it?

213
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,449
- They haven't done it yet.
- That's true.

214
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:58,250
Since they haven't gone all the way,

215
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,719
William can't feel the excitement.

216
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:03,122
He's not ready to talk about things
like that before feeling connected.

217
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,391
Are those two going to be there
for another month?

218
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,325
That's the problem.

219
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,493
If that's gonna be the case,

220
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,563
they'll never be able to sleep together
while they're still there.

221
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:13,833
If they could have a proper conversation,
including topics like that,

222
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,470
they could also discuss whether to leave
in a week or to stay for another month.

223
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:18,471
But if that's the case,

224
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,606
wouldn't it be better
if they just left for a while?

225
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,241
I mean, they can have discussions,

226
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,311
but they won't really know
unless they go out and give it a shot.

227
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:26,846
Otherwise, it's just in their heads.

228
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,015
So, you think they should finally leave
for a while to be able to intimate?

229
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,283
Yeah, just for a while.

230
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,086
How's the miso soup?

231
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,722
- You put sugar in it?
- It gives it a bit of richness.

232
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,157
TELECOM SALES
UNIVERSITY STUDENT

233
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,396
- The miso's good, right?
- Yeah, it's good. It's good.

234
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:47,266
Kazuyuki,
your miso has seriously gotten good.

235
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,402
- I used to make miso at home.
- You're really good at it.

236
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:54,340
I think the taste is the same as before.
I don't think it's changed much.

237
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,510
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy your meal.

238
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:00,146
Thank you for this food. It's good.

239
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,081
Did you make this miso, Kazuyuki?

240
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,717
- It's good, right?
- I can recognize Kazu's miso.

241
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,619
- It's good.
- It's really good.

242
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,554
- Delicious.
- It's like a taste of home.

243
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,889
A taste of home.

244
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,357
GRADUATE STUDENT

245
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:12,358
Yeah, it's good.

246
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,961
Um, can I bring up a topic?

247
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,563
- Go ahead.
- Of course.

248
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,499
For each one of you,
what do you think love is?

249
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,368
- Love?
- That's heavy.

250
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:26,639
So what does it mean to love someone?
What is love?

251
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:29,141
- Whoa!
- What kind of question is this?

252
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,177
He just asked
one of the biggest questions of all.

253
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,746
Not expecting anything in return.

254
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,914
Hmm.

255
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,383
It's like when you see a beautiful view,

256
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,519
and you wanna take a picture
to send it to someone.

257
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,388
- That's nice.
- So sweet.

258
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:44,990
- That one was good.
- Yeah?

259
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,259
Taeheon, what's your take?

260
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:52,364
The ability to forgive someone and endure.

261
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:56,168
Without love, if the person
you share your life with lies to you,

262
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,169
it's done.

263
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:03,342
But it's because you love them
that you want to give them another chance.

264
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,313
Can I give an abstract answer?

265
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,214
Mm.

266
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,650
When I think about what love is,

267
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:14,820
I feel like it's a metaphor
for an individual story.

268
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,857
What I mean is… I don't know…

269
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,526
Try again.

270
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,762
I feel like it's a metaphor
for an individual story.

271
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,097
A metaphor.

272
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,333
It represents an individual story
as a metaphor.

273
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,469
It's the substance
that is represented by that word.

274
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,474
Like, there are things all over the world
that are justified by love.

275
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,476
But no one can criticize the word "love"

276
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:41,146
because everyone… has
their own version of it inside themselves.

277
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,450
It could be a love in your daily life,
a mother's love for her child,

278
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:48,020
or even the love
for the person you've grown to be.

279
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:51,857
But conflicts arise
when one love clashes with another.

280
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:55,794
So I feel like love is included
in everything that can make me happy

281
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:58,163
or even that can make me sad.

282
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,735
You might not understand what I'm saying,
but that's my perception.

283
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:03,936
That's how I feel.

284
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,450
That was complicated.

285
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,288
We all thought the same thing.

286
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,590
But he said there's love in everything,
and that's true.

287
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,158
There's love in everything.

288
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,764
"The work shift leader
for today will be Bomi."

289
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,450
Let's work the coffee truck
together again.

290
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,619
- <i>He looks happy.</i>
- <i>Look at that smile.</i>

291
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,554
<i>We haven't seen that expression before.</i>

292
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,156
<i>Yeah, that's the first time.</i>

293
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:02,194
<i>There's so much snow on that road.</i>

294
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,797
- <i>Whoa.</i>
- <i>It's so beautiful.</i>

295
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:12,104
- My first time at a ski resort.
- Yay.

296
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,412
- There you go.
- Okay.

297
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:22,648
Thanks.

298
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:27,586
<i>You make everything sweet</i>

299
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,056
- Wanna go down the slope later?
- Huh?

300
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,225
- Wanna go down the slope?
- No, I really don't.

301
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,660
- You don't want to?
- You want to?

302
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,564
The way you laugh!

303
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,666
- Hey.
- You wanna go down the slope, right?

304
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:41,567
Mm.

305
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,902
We have juice and chocolate milk as well.

306
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:47,072
- Oh, chocolate milk!
- I want chocolate milk.

307
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,776
- Who wants chocolate milk?
- Me. Is that three so far?

308
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,246
- I'll make it.
- Make the caffe latte.

309
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,214
You want me to make it?

310
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,248
- Yeah.
- Okay.

311
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:57,449
I'll heat up the milk.

312
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,890
You're so big.

313
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,059
Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for being big.

314
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,594
- I was kidding, okay?
- Sorry.

315
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,862
No, I didn't say anything.

316
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,563
- Sorry for being big.
- Don't be like that.

317
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,233
<i>They've gotten closer, haven't they?</i>

318
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,536
- I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
- It's okay. Thank you.

319
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,738
- It's hot.
- Mommy will hold it for you.

320
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,140
- Say thank you.
- Thank you.

321
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:25,878
- We're doing pretty well today.
- We had a lot of sales. I'm glad.

322
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:31,316
- So you don't wanna go skiing?
- You wanna ski, right?

323
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,352
- I don't mind either way.
- But you wanna go.

324
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,487
- No, it's not like…
- If it's skiing, then I'll go.

325
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,123
I don't think I can ski.

326
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,793
You wanna snowboard, right?
You wanna snowboard?

327
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:44,563
- I might want to. I don't mind either way.
- See? You want to.

328
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,265
You just said you wanna snowboard.

329
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,300
- You want to?
- You don't want to, right?

330
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,902
I don't mind either way.

331
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,638
So which is it?
You said you don't want to.

332
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:55,374
Well, I don't mind either way,
but I don't want to.

333
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,076
- Once--
- I don't mind, but I want to.

334
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:58,410
I know. I know that.

335
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,413
- I'll take a video of you coming down.
- No, no. You can't take a video.

336
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,382
I'll be there to greet you,
so you should go.

337
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,251
- Do you want me to join you?
- Not really.

338
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,253
- That's not it?
- I'm fine either way.

339
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:11,957
<i>What's going on?</i>

340
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:15,094
- <i>They are just so cute!</i>
- <i>They made over 10,000 yen!</i>

341
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,161
<i>They did well.</i>

342
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,831
<i>That's the first time</i>
<i>sales went over 10,000 yen.</i>

343
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,566
You're getting muscular.

344
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:23,068
- Really
- I can see your abs a little.

345
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,970
- I lost weight.
- You lost weight?

346
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,405
Yeah, after coming here.

347
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,574
- What about me?
- You have a spoiled body.

348
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,442
But still, It's not bad.

349
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,744
- It's not bad.
- I think it's fine.

350
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:36,215
- So how was it?
- Yeah, I wanna hear about it.

351
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,083
- My day in the truck?
- Yeah.

352
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,885
It was the least fun I've ever had.

353
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,154
- Hey?
- Seriously.

354
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,789
I don't think he would've acted that way

355
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:47,259
if he had had even the slightest desire
to go with me.

356
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,027
- Really?
- I think he was tired too.

357
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:52,598
He was either really exhausted and sleepy
or I wasn't even remotely his type.

358
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:55,400
It's one or the other.
Not remotely his type.

359
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,502
That sounds pretty tough.

360
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,404
Well, you know,
I'm pretty sure that's what it was.

361
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,206
Do you think you'll go again?

362
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,376
If he chooses me,
I'll go, but I won't choose him again.

363
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:05,277
Are you serious?

364
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:08,113
Yeah, that was really rough.
I can't choose him again.

365
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,850
I mean, he's probably
just a shy and reserved person.

366
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,852
There's a good chance
he just hasn't opened up yet.

367
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,154
Yeah, okay, maybe.

368
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,289
He seems to have a difficult personality.

369
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,325
He comes off as being somewhat detached.

370
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,861
Maybe if you pushed a bit,
you'd have seen another side of him.

371
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:25,898
He's just indifferent to everything.
Like, "I don't care," that kind of vibe.

372
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:27,065
I see what you mean.

373
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:29,668
But I think he's like that
with everyone, isn't he?

374
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:30,903
It does kind of feel that way.

375
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,604
I don't think
he's only like that with you.

376
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,240
Yeah, that's true. Give it another shot.

377
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:36,508
But, um, I guess so,

378
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,710
because there's no one else
I'm interested in right now,

379
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:41,647
and I wanna make the most
of this opportunity to find love.

380
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,482
We don't even have a month left.

381
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,651
- Yeah, that's not a lot.
- It's crazy.

382
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:46,685
Go for it.

383
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,624
- <i>They finally did it.</i>
- <i>They went for it, after all.</i>

384
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,493
- Ooh!
- Whoa, whoa.

385
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,261
Are you okay? Did you hurt yourself?

386
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,699
Can you go down?

387
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:01,733
It's scary.

388
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,005
<i>They're kind of forced to hold hands now.</i>

389
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:08,807
- <i>Aw.</i>
- <i>That's the nice part.</i>

390
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,042
Step into it.

391
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,977
- Yeah.
- Is that good?

392
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,178
Perfect. You did it.

393
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,247
Can you make it?

394
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:16,848
I'll try.

395
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,287
Push more on the inside.
Push more on the inside.

396
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,822
That's it. That's good.

397
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,991
Stop, stop. That's it. Keep it up.

398
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,995
Hey, you did it.

399
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,464
Isn't this the scary part?

400
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:34,967
- You can go ahead.
- You go first.

401
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,369
- You go first.
- You go first.

402
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,205
Fine, I'll go first if you really insist.

403
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,881
<i>Oh no, watch out! He's going too fast.</i>

404
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,416
<i>That was so reckless.</i>

405
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,852
<i>He was going so fast</i>
<i>that he couldn't stop himself.</i>

406
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,920
Oh no.

407
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:56,989
Are you okay?

408
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,727
- Are you okay?
- I might not be okay.

409
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,198
Look, it's so pretty.

410
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,166
<i>Come on.</i>

411
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:10,035
<i>Well, he's right. It is pretty.</i>

412
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:11,903
Should we chat here?

413
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:17,709
It's so pretty.

414
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,180
- It's been a month already.
- Hmm.

415
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,448
It went by fast.

416
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:25,917
Yeah, it did. Really, very fast.

417
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:30,088
It felt fast, and at the same time long.
A lot has happened.

418
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,457
At first, when I arrived,

419
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,560
I wasn't sure
if I had made the right choice to come.

420
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,662
Mm.

421
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,167
But now I'm really glad that I did.

422
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:43,602
Really?

423
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:47,472
Mm. My way of thinking has changed a lot.

424
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,076
It's really just one more month.

425
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:52,744
Mm.

426
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,780
Is there something you wanna do
over the next month?

427
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:55,981
Hmm.

428
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,383
What I wanna do…

429
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:03,255
I wanna know
the side of myself I don't know yet.

430
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,624
The one you don't know yet?

431
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,760
I'm not sure, but I think
I'm getting in tune with that side

432
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,029
more than when I first got here.

433
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,198
I think you've changed, Huwei.

434
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,434
Especially recently.

435
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,835
- You think so?
- Mm.

436
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,874
- I think we should head home.
- You're right.

437
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,783
That was fun.

438
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,719
That was really fun.

439
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,088
You're such a liar.

440
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:39,124
Seeing Huwei and Bomi
is kind of comforting.

441
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,192
It's cute.

442
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,662
They even made 10,000 yen in sales.
Not bad.

443
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,831
I suppose the vibe
really does make a difference

444
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,399
when you're attracting clients.

445
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:50,736
We can feel the tense vibe
between Taeheon and Jobu.

446
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,204
Maybe that's why the machine broke.

447
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,573
Apparently,
the electricity can be affected

448
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,575
by human energy as well.

449
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:59,177
What do you think about
their discussion on love?

450
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:00,579
The metaphor.

451
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:04,316
When they were like, "What's a metaphor?"
Bomi explained, "It's a figure of speech."

452
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,217
Yeah, he did that.

453
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,853
Huwei might have felt,
"This person gets what I'm saying,

454
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,722
even though all the other people
around the table don't."

455
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,959
That was a great gesture.
That just shows you who Bomi is.

456
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,694
But they all lost their appetite.

457
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,830
- They put their chopsticks down.
- William was so funny.

458
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,499
Even though dinner looked delicious.

459
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,067
We didn't know he was a philosopher.

460
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,368
- But he is.
- He's really smart.

461
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,203
Really? Maybe he is super smart.

462
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,338
On the other hand,

463
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,340
I think he's not good at being in love

464
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,943
and losing himself in something,
for that very same reason.

465
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,013
That could be true.
When he's in romance mode, he talks like,

466
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,850
"I made caramel custard. Let's eat now."
He's quite dry and says few words

467
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:39,751
I get that.

468
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:43,588
But then when he gets into logical stuff,
he starts to talk super fast.

469
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:46,057
He goes like, "This is like this,
and this is like this."

470
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,693
- That's funny. Yeah.
- True.

471
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,630
It's funny.
It's like he uses his brain differently

472
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:53,832
for things that aren't romance-related.

473
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,134
He's like,
"What is this warm feeling inside me?"

474
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:59,471
- Is he observing himself?
- He's like, "What's this a metaphor for?"

475
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,441
Then I hope he gets to know
that side of himself quickly.

476
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,580
Good morning.

477
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:11,082
- I have a little favor…
- Huh?

478
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:13,852
- What is it?
- …that I wanna ask of you all.

479
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,720
- Oh, that startled me.
- Is that okay?

480
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,822
Of course.

481
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:20,358
William and I both wanna get
a deeper sense

482
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:24,796
of what it would really be like
for us together

483
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,665
after leaving the Green Room.

484
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:32,637
If it's okay with you,
we would really appreciate the chance

485
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:34,906
for the two of us to go out.

486
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,008
- Of course.
- That's totally fine.

487
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,544
Of course. Will you be back for dinner?

488
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,680
We'll be staying out tonight.

489
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:43,682
- Oh!
- Is that what this is about?

490
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,016
- That's a bit…
- Yeah.

491
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,287
I can come with you.

492
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:52,891
- You do realize you'd be the third wheel!
- Will you go?

493
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,025
We'll be going.

494
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,428
- Oh, so you're going now? I get it!
- Yeah.

495
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,897
See you. Have fun. See you.

496
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:01,466
That sounds like a great idea.

497
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:02,367
Yeah, good.

498
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,769
They should change things up
and go for it.

499
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,605
I'll sit in the middle.
Let's move closer.

500
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,807
Yeah, let's move closer.
It feels lonely over here.

501
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,042
Is it an important talk?

502
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,844
Like, "Let's get married?"

503
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,113
No, wait, isn't it too soon for that?

504
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,848
I'll read it.

505
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,953
"Today's work shift leader will be chosen
on a volunteer basis."

506
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,988
Oh.

507
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:28,760
"Anyone who wants to be the shift leader,
please raise your hand now."

508
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,631
You're already raising your hand.

509
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,899
<i>That's the spirit.</i>

510
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:35,867
- It's about time.
- You wanna go?

511
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,168
- I thought you might.
- Of course.

512
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:38,436
- It is.
- <i>Good for him.</i>

513
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:40,238
Is everyone okay with that?

514
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:44,776
Well, I figured I shouldn't raise my hand
since you decided to.

515
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:45,744
Oh yeah?

516
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,513
Okay, in that case, I'll go today.

517
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:51,349
- Go for it.
- Thanks. Thank you very much.

518
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:52,817
Okay.

519
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,786
- <i>Who will he go with?</i>
<i>- Huh?</i>

520
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,055
<i>I wonder what his criteria will be.</i>

521
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,001
Let's go again.

522
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,270
- Let's go again. Okay.
- Let's work together.

523
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:15,340
- Let's work together.
- We'll be going, then.

524
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:24,416
It's been a while
since we've worked together.

525
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,184
- What?
- How long has it been?

526
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:29,020
- I think it's been about three weeks.
- Wow.

527
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:31,890
It's been so long.

528
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,113
Oh, it's a border collie.

529
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,616
A border collie.

530
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,253
Hello. It's a border collie, right?

531
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,657
- It's a border collie.
- I used to have a border collie.

532
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,759
You're so cute.

533
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,362
- Oh, it's cute.
- Hey.

534
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:13,264
- How old is it?
- Good. It's already eight years old.

535
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:14,399
It's already eight?

536
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,035
- It's been a while since I pet a dog.
- Me too.

537
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,638
I had a dog until last year.
It was a border collie.

538
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,006
A black and white one.

539
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,108
- Oh, really? How old was it?
- It was like…

540
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:25,977
It was 15 years old,
and it passed away last year.

541
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,312
It's a long time.

542
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,748
For a border collie,
it lived quite a long life.

543
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,951
We were lucky. Yeah.
So I haven't seen one in a while.

544
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:33,918
It's cute.

545
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:36,154
I hope this one lives a long life too.

546
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:38,890
You will, won't you?
You still have a long life ahead of you.

547
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,725
You still have a long life.

548
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,927
- So cute.
- We'll go around and come back.

549
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,429
- Okay, please do, thank you.
- Okay.

550
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,330
Let's go.

551
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,902
- <i>This might bring back memories.</i>
- <i>He's going to cry.</i>

552
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,509
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you very much.

553
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,678
- Thank you.
- Sorry to keep you waiting. Thank you.

554
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:03,548
- We made 5,350 yen.
- Oh.

555
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:05,583
Should we close up?

556
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:12,757
- A lot of people are wearing plaid today.
- Yeah, you're right.

557
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:15,527
- Maybe I should change into plaid too.
- Yeah, you should.

558
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:21,866
IT COMPANY PROJECT MANAGER

559
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:25,136
- Looks good.
- We all look cute. Let's take a picture.

560
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:26,771
Come on, hurry up!

561
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,440
My face is starting to cramp.

562
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:30,408
Oh, nice. Cute.

563
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,577
We all look cute,
and everyone's wearing plaid.

564
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:33,845
We look like close friends.

565
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:36,014
- <i>Tomoaki looks lonely.</i>
- <i>Is he okay?</i>

566
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:39,017
- <i>Maybe he has trouble joining in.</i>
- <i>I wonder what's wrong.</i>

567
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,355
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

568
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:48,960
Is it awkward?

569
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,362
Yeah, sorry.
I'll go to my room. Thanks for the food.

570
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:53,531
Wait, wanna wear this?
You can wear my plaid.

571
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:54,466
It's a bit awkward.

572
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:56,968
- Sorry, thanks for the food.
- Why?

573
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,604
- No, it's not awkward.
- Wait a minute.

574
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,706
- That's not what I meant.
- Huh?

575
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,009
<i>Now what's wrong with him?</i>

576
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,978
<i>Maybe he doesn't feel like he fits in.</i>

577
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,180
<i>Maybe so. He seems lonely.</i>

578
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:19,023
We've only been living here a week,
but maybe he's already sick of it?

579
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,825
Yeah, I'm a bit worried.

580
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,302
- Okay.
- All right.

581
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,705
- We worked well.
- Yes, we did.

582
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:38,009
Today was,
you know, it was a volunteer thing.

583
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:41,880
I thought it would be nice
if I could talk to someone.

584
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,718
And since you're the one
I feel most comfortable talking to,

585
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,286
I decided to choose you.

586
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:52,323
- Well, you can talk to me about anything.
- Right. Yeah.

587
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:53,858
How are things with you?

588
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,494
Hmm. Well, I don't know.

589
00:29:56,561 --> 00:30:01,599
I've been doing some reflecting
on the 15 years with my ex.

590
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:05,170
I think back on all the things
that happened over those years.

591
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,171
Mm.

592
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:07,405
We kind of broke up

593
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:11,843
because there was no excitement
or stimulation anymore.

594
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,579
After listening to people here,

595
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,282
I'm starting to think that

596
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:20,885
maybe that's how it was
always supposed to be in the end.

597
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,087
Mm, ah. You two broke up,

598
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:26,357
but maybe that uneventful life
you had with him

599
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:29,594
was in fact the happiest kind
of relationship you really wanted?

600
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,495
Mm.

601
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:33,231
We made it through everything,
like the saying goes.

602
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:36,801
- Fifteen years is a long time.
- We made it through everything.

603
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:39,904
After listening to everyone,
you remembered the things that happened?

604
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:42,640
So, during the rest of my time here,

605
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:46,845
yeah, I might be able to make up my mind.

606
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:48,813
Mm, okay.

607
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:52,483
So this past month
was totally meaningful for you.

608
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,753
- Yeah, in that sense, it was.
- That's really huge, isn't it?

609
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,623
It's a much bigger decision
than starting a new relationship.

610
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,757
Mm.

611
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,471
- Something happened, right?
- Huh?

612
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:15,373
Are you tired?

613
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,876
Yeah, I guess I'm tired.
I'm… I'm tired. Yeah.

614
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:19,244
- You're tired?
- Yeah.

615
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:22,413
Up until now,
whenever I really felt like this,

616
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,983
all I would have done was just walk away.

617
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,253
I would often choose
not to engage with people,

618
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,221
because I didn't wanna deal with them.

619
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,157
Hmm.

620
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,727
But here, it's not like
you can just walk away,

621
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,295
you know what I mean?

622
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:42,166
When did it happen?
You were fine this morning.

623
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:47,705
There was that thing with the shirts
this morning, right?

624
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:51,442
When everyone was having fun together
in the kitchen,

625
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,913
I really felt like
I was completely invisible,

626
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:56,614
like I wasn't even there.

627
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:02,287
I've lived my whole life
with this type of personality,

628
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:06,591
and I realized that even when
I'm thrown into a new environment,

629
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:08,593
it's still not easy for me to change.

630
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:13,064
I absolutely hate being the one
to bring down the mood like this.

631
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:16,034
So that's why I really felt bad, honestly.

632
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,736
You shouldn't feel bad.
Don't push yourself.

633
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:19,904
Mm.

634
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:25,910
When I first got here, the group… dynamics
were already in place as well.

635
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:31,115
There were times when I assumed
no one was paying any attention to me.

636
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,486
It's normal to feel that way, right?

637
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:38,156
So, whatever you do,

638
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,658
don't think you're alone.

639
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:41,592
Thanks.

640
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:44,128
<i>That was so well said, Ryuki.</i>

641
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:47,532
You wouldn't have shared this
with anyone before, Tomoaki.

642
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:48,733
So, to some extent,

643
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,936
this is also a sign of growth,
wouldn't you agree?

644
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,771
This is definitely progress.

645
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,375
I think being alone
makes it worth coming here for you.

646
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:03,114
I can't believe how bad a person I am
for being such a self-centered individual.

647
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,016
I don't think it's a question

648
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,552
about whether this makes you
a bad person or not.

649
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:09,821
Everyone has their own style in life,

650
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:12,523
so I don't think it's a bad thing at all.

651
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:17,195
You can learn a lot
from clashing with others too.

652
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,932
But if you feel better
after letting it out like this,

653
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:22,967
just know that I'm always here

654
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:26,170
to listen to you
when you need to talk to someone.

655
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:27,138
Thank you.

656
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,941
- <i>That's so sweet.</i>
- <i>That's Taeheon-sensei for you.</i>

657
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,720
- Hey.
- Hey.

658
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,160
I need to talk to you.

659
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,496
About what? I'm scared. What is it?

660
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:54,999
The thing is,

661
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,235
tomorrow morning…

662
00:33:58,336 --> 00:33:59,370
You'll be leaving?

663
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:02,774
I guessed as much.

664
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,143
- Yeah.
- Mm.

665
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,578
For your entrance ceremony?

666
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,248
Good guess.

667
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,051
Yeah, I figured
it was going to be this week.

668
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,486
- Oh, really? You guessed?
- Yeah.

669
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,156
- I looked it up.
- Wow, you did?

670
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,025
I looked up the date of the ceremony.

671
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,394
I was like, "Okay, it's that day."

672
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:24,462
You looked it up?

673
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,298
- You have to leave for that.
- Yeah.

674
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,737
How have you been lately?

675
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,172
- Lately?
- Mm.

676
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:37,875
Any changes in your feelings?

677
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:38,843
A few.

678
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:40,778
How so?

679
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:42,513
Hmm.

680
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:47,285
Well, to be honest, um,

681
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,421
when we went to the foot bath,

682
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,957
I said I wasn't sure
about my feelings yet, right?

683
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:53,858
You did.

684
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:58,062
But I found myself
regretting having said that.

685
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:59,597
- Oh.
- Huh?

686
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:02,800
- Huh?
- Uh-huh.

687
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:06,471
Yeah, I was like,

688
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:10,341
"What? If I'm regretting it,
then what does that mean?"

689
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,977
And since then,
all I've been thinking of is,

690
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:15,780
"Hmm, what does this mean?
What is this feeling?"

691
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,982
Okay. And did you find the answer?

692
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,085
Mm. Well,

693
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:24,589
I realized there might be
a little part of me

694
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:26,057
that can say I like you.

695
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,063
So you like me now?

696
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,298
Okay, that's good.

697
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,801
Thanks for letting me know.

698
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:38,536
Sure.

699
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,138
That's good.

700
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,646
Are you bad at showing your feelings

701
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,882
to someone you like?

702
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:52,984
Maybe I am?

703
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,387
I mean, I can tell
you're focusing on me and everything.

704
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:59,390
But I think I want you to

705
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:03,961
express yourself much more.

706
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:07,465
Then I think I'd be more assertive too.

707
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:11,302
- So a physical expression?
- Physical expression…

708
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,504
- Well…
- Verbal expression too.

709
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,339
Okay, I guess.

710
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:16,707
Verbal expression.

711
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,378
Verbal expression? For example?

712
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:22,413
You don't have to touch me physically.

713
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,016
- What kind of verbal expression?
- I don't know. Surprise me.

714
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:30,321
But thank you. I'm glad you told me
how you feel before you left.

715
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:35,960
Isn't that amazing?

716
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,896
What Bomi-sensei said was just wonderful.

717
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:40,731
- Good for him.
- Yeah.

718
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:42,533
Verbal or physical expression?

719
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,269
Normally, you wouldn't be able to say,
"I looked it up."

720
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,505
He played it really well.
He was very casual about it.

721
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,574
If you say, "I looked it up,"

722
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,043
you're labeled a stalker,
and it's over for you.

723
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:53,578
It's a little too psycho.

724
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:56,347
The way he delivered it was spot-on.
It was really good.

725
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:59,617
He's really very good at telling people
what he wants them to do,

726
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:02,153
always in a very natural, nurturing way.

727
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,956
And always by helping them grow
at the same time.

728
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:07,391
If you say, "I want you
to express your feelings more,"

729
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,327
it comes across as really demanding.

730
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,663
But ask for "a verbal expression"
and the other person will think about it,

731
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,298
wonder what to do, and grow from it.

732
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,734
- Oh, you're right.
- It's kind of for themselves.

733
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,769
- That's smart.
- You're right.

734
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:23,407
It's a really clever way
for both of them to adjust to each other.

735
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:24,742
He wasn't being pushy.

736
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:25,943
- He wasn't.
- Exactly.

737
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,846
But he's definitely making
Huwei fundamentally change.

738
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,881
Isn't that the best way to do it?

739
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:32,917
I think he's a good match for Huwei.

740
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:35,686
He makes Huwei think,
and we know he likes that.

741
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,522
It's good that Huwei is
going to leave for a while.

742
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,292
It's like they say,
"Absence makes the heart grow fonder."

743
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,696
Absolutely. But in the meantime,
Tomoaki is, uh…

744
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:49,066
When they started getting excited
about wearing plaid,

745
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:51,836
someone who's good at reading the room
could slip in and join the fun.

746
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:55,506
But there are people who find it hard
to do even if they want to.

747
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:59,176
I think Ryuki's way of making him talk
was really great too.

748
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,279
He got him to confide in him naturally.

749
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:03,347
Great choice of words and lots of empathy.

750
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:07,485
And then Taeheon as well.
He was really being there for him.

751
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:10,154
But what I can't forget
is how Taeheon was with Jobu.

752
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,957
This is the Taeheon
we're all familiar with, right?

753
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:16,060
The Taeheon we've been
seeing until now. Yeah.

754
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,863
- So I'm really confused right now.
- His modes are really distinct.

755
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,299
Romance mode and friend mode.

756
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:23,934
Maybe he has
a strong on-off switch for it.

757
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:28,572
So what should we have to eat?

758
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,042
Hmm, what should we have?
It's a special day, after all.

759
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:35,179
Oh, hang on a second.
I eat strawberries quite often.

760
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,214
Should we get some?
Wait, these are huge.

761
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:39,884
- No, bigger isn't necessarily better.
- All right.

762
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,719
- I think that's good.
- Why don't we get two?

763
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,854
- We might as well.
- We don't need that many.

764
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,022
Okay.

765
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:47,058
- We'll get one, then?
- Yeah.

766
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:50,828
Oh, that looks good. Meat.

767
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,997
- How about steak?
- Yeah, steak.

768
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:55,032
How about this? Wagyu round block.

769
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:57,768
- That looks good.
- It does look good.

770
00:38:58,269 --> 00:38:59,937
- It's expensive.
- Yeah.

771
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:04,075
- Let's get this.
- Okay, let's do that.

772
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:06,977
Wow, look at this. They have yellowtail.

773
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:08,746
Let's get this too.

774
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:09,847
No.

775
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:12,216
- We're having steak, right? Wait.
- You're right.

776
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:16,320
Okay. It's our first time
shopping together like this.

777
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,758
- Wow!
- Look at the view.

778
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:22,660
- The weather's amazing.
- Awesome.

779
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:25,930
- Is this the place?
- Either this one or that one.

780
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,665
Oh, you're right.

781
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,102
- Whoa, wait.
- Whoa, this is crazy. Look!

782
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:32,870
It's so beautiful.

783
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:35,339
This is the kind of place
I've been wanting to visit.

784
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,546
Whoa, amazing. Wow.

785
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,015
Whoa, awesome.

786
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,050
- Whoa.
- Huh?

787
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,053
- Oh, there's a wood stove.
- Whoa, that's nice.

788
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,789
- Let's warm up with this.
- this is crazy.

789
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:52,690
Right?

790
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:54,992
Whoa, amazing!

791
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:56,427
Wow!

792
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:59,096
- This is awesome.
- It really is.

793
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:02,066
Wow, the sunlight is streaming in.
This is crazy.

794
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:07,605
The quiet sounds are nice too.

795
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:09,140
- You can hear the birds.
- I know.

796
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:11,642
We have to really cherish
this time together.

797
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,210
Yeah.

798
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:21,385
- This is awesome.
- It's great.

799
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,988
- With coffee.
- Let's enjoy this view.

800
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:26,891
- Okay.
- It's awesome.

801
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,894
This laid-back vibe is so nice.

802
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,365
Yeah. You can't hear
any of the outside noise. It's nice.

803
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,642
- There's not enough.
- I told you we should've gotten two packs.

804
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:47,211
I didn't have that many.
One, two, three, four, five.

805
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,681
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
Seven. You had seven.

806
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:54,819
I was wondering if you were gonna eat
the last one. But I had more.

807
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:56,821
You had a lot.

808
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:59,190
<i>This is the kind of chitchat</i>
<i>I wanted them to have.</i>

809
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:00,224
<i>This is great.</i>

810
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,060
- The sun's starting to set.
- Yeah.

811
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,867
- Wanna watch the sunset here?
- No, let's watch it out there.

812
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:13,270
Out there? Let's wait here
until the sun gets lower,

813
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:14,905
then head out when it starts setting.

814
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:15,840
Sure.

815
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:20,845
- Did it get better?
- Yeah, a lot better.

816
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,646
I don't usually cut myself.

817
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,250
Maybe you're not very good at cooking.

818
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:28,586
I'm good at it,

819
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:30,855
but I'm careless.

820
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:33,691
- Yeah, you can be sometimes.
- You're pretty meticulous, aren't you?

821
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:35,125
I'm super meticulous.

822
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:37,862
You're super meticulous,
so we're different in that way.

823
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,832
It's fine if you're not.
Stay the way you are.

824
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:51,575
- That's really pretty.
- Is it?

825
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:53,677
Should we go see? Let's go see.

826
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:54,945
It's beautiful.

827
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,316
Wow, amazing.

828
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:04,355
Wow, gorgeous. It's peeking out.

829
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:07,124
It's been a while
since I've seen such a round sun.

830
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,260
You don't see
such a beautiful sunset very often.

831
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:10,461
Yeah.

832
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,229
It's a great view.

833
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:13,931
This is so beautiful.

834
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:19,970
You know, if the two of us
hadn't reconnected here,

835
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,039
our lives would be completely different.

836
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,142
When I think about that,

837
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,445
it feels strange how people meet.

838
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,382
But meeting here was…

839
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,817
- Fate?
- I think it was meant to be.

840
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:34,985
- You're right.
- Mm.

841
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,322
Even with all the detours,
it was meant to be.

842
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:42,526
Oh, the moon's coming out.

843
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,929
It's a crescent moon tonight.

844
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:46,931
- A crescent moon.
- Mm.

845
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:51,902
We did pretty well.

846
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:54,271
- I wanna light the wood stove.
- Good idea.

847
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:00,878
I think it's gonna take.

848
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:04,181
- To our first overnight date.
- To our special day.

849
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,282
Cheers.

850
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:07,751
- Thank you.
- Thank you too.

851
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:11,922
It's good.

852
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,427
- Mmm. It's good.
- It's good.

853
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:22,399
If I go to Spain,
I wanna be able to learn the language,

854
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:24,268
so it'd be good to take lessons there.

855
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:25,502
Mm.

856
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:29,506
I wanna be able to talk to your friends
in Spanish and understand them too.

857
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:31,308
- I like that.
- Yeah.

858
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,645
But I'm worried about the time difference.

859
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:38,048
I mean, I'll probably be working
in the Asian time zone, right?

860
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:42,386
Which means I'll have to wake up early
to be online.

861
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:46,423
I think what's most important
is that we wake up together.

862
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,158
That means I'll wake up with you.

863
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:52,796
If you wake up in the middle of the night,
and I wake up in the morning,

864
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:55,032
you'll be going to bed when I wake up.

865
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:57,201
If that happens…

866
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:58,402
I see what you mean.

867
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,572
Some people wake up early.
They have good lifestyle rhythms.

868
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,140
And some people wake up at four

869
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:05,376
and use that time
to do a bunch of stuff, so…

870
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:07,277
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

871
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:08,879
That would make me happy.

872
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,317
Also, there's another thing I want to do.
I'd like to open a joint bank account.

873
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:14,652
Mm.

874
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:18,355
Just for things like a fancy dinner
or a vacation we want to take.

875
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:21,025
I think we'd both feel good

876
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:24,361
using the money we saved
on this account together

877
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:25,996
to treat ourselves once in a while.

878
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:28,599
That's a good idea.
Why not? I mean, I'd like that.

879
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,633
I'd like that too.

880
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,468
<i>Is that fireplace burning too hot?</i>

881
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:34,038
- You're right.
- It does look like it's too strong.

882
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:36,774
Maybe it's syncing with their feelings.

883
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,809
I think the main source of conflict

884
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:41,612
is when one person pays on the spot
or pays later.

885
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,781
- Mm.
- It was the same with my ex.

886
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,749
One person always ends up thinking,

887
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:48,452
"I already paid more,
and now I have to pay again?"

888
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,255
That happens
when you don't have an agreement, right?

889
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:52,923
I don't want that happening again.

890
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:56,226
That's why those frustrations
end up building over time.

891
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:58,896
We don't want to create
more sources of conflict.

892
00:44:58,962 --> 00:44:59,963
Mm.

893
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,166
It's nice to talk about this.

894
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:04,435
I feel like I caught a glimpse

895
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:08,605
of what you're like in your everyday life,
and I'm glad.

896
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:22,419
If we were to have a wedding,
at what age would you wanna have it?

897
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,189
What?! That's a tough one.

898
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:29,526
I used to think I wanted to get married
by the time I was 40.

899
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:30,928
What about you?

900
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,464
Late thirties or around forty?

901
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:36,166
- So same as me.
- Yeah.

902
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,901
That's ideal, isn't it?

903
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:40,838
Yeah. I think it's a stage in life

904
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:44,508
where you reflect on the meaning
of your journey

905
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:48,946
and how you want… to spend
the rest of your life.

906
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:53,584
I feel like that milestone
usually comes around 40.

907
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:57,087
Do you want to have a wedding?

908
00:45:57,154 --> 00:46:00,457
Mm. Yes, I think we should cherish

909
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:02,893
and make the most of the friends

910
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:08,232
and the… the connections we make
in our future life we build together.

911
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:12,169
And it's these friends who we invite
to celebrate these kinds of events.

912
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:14,505
- I agree.
- We already have some now.

913
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:15,939
- The boys?
- Yeah.

914
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:19,276
- We have our Green Room friends.
- Yeah. You're right.

915
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:22,579
- I wanna make all our dreams come true.
- Yeah.

916
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,454
I figured we had similar values,

917
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:36,460
but going over them again
really reassured me… that we're alike.

918
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:38,662
Me too.

919
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:47,738
<i>I trace your name in…</i>

920
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:48,906
Are you hot?

921
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,607
Aren't you?

922
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,042
I'm hot.

923
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:55,145
<i>I know you were there</i>

924
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:57,614
<i>I'll be waiting for</i>

925
00:46:57,681 --> 00:46:59,950
<i>I'll be waiting for you</i>

926
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:01,485
<i>Now hold my hand</i>

927
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:04,721
<i>I promise that, that, that</i>

928
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:10,093
<i>I hear your voice</i>
<i>In the wind's quiet song</i>

929
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:15,065
<i>Fading like echoes, but never for long</i>

930
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:17,801
<i>I'll be reaching for</i>

931
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:19,870
<i>I'll be reaching for you</i>

932
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:21,471
<i>Now hold my hand</i>

933
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:23,640
<i>I promise that</i>

934
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:28,278
<i>With love</i>

935
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:33,016
<i>I can change the sky above</i>

936
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:38,021
<i>And rise a little higher</i>

937
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:44,294
<i>Until the sun feels closer</i>

938
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:48,232
<i>With love </i>

939
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:52,970
<i>I can change the sky above</i>

940
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:57,975
<i>And rise a little higher</i>

941
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:04,982
<i>Until the sun feels closer again</i>

942
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,920
- Finally! Good for them!
- Bravo!

943
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:11,889
- Yeah!
- I'm glad for them.

944
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:13,957
It was as intense as the fire flames.

945
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:15,692
Congratulations!

946
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,895
How intense was that?
