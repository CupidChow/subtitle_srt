1
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,880
These flowers have all bloomed in just one day.

2
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,690
This is called the Migu flower.

3
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,440
it only blooms once every two years.

4
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,880
and their entire flowering period

5
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,120
lasts only this one day.

6
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,120
For this one day,

7
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,600
they endure countless harsh winters and scorching summers.

8
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,360
Many flowers don't even make it to this day.

9
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,400
What do you think? Beautiful, isn't it?

10
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,130
What happens after they bloom?

11
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,560
After they bloom,

12
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,340
after they bloom, they reset to zero.

13
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,039
And then?

14
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,800
New Migu flowers will bloom.

15
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,380
Then they'll endure the long wait again.

16
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,130
If they can only bloom once in their lifetime,

17
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,759
isn't that too brief?

18
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,960
Not at all.

19
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,039
We can't deny their existence

20
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,440
just because it's brief.

21
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,120
People love beautiful things,

22
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,780
don't they?

23
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,440
People,

24
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,880
if they're destined to part,

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,729
should they never meet in the first place?

26
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,600
Miss Nian,

27
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,500
if it weren't for your care during this time,

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I probably wouldn't have survived.

29
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,760
It's nothing.

30
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,400
Perhaps

31
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,040
I... I should leave.

32
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,290
Do you want to leave?

33
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,400
I suppose so.

34
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,320
Outside,

35
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,380
you have your own family and friends.

36
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,900
You'll leave someday anyway.

37
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,280
Miss Nian,

38
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,380
you'll meet a good person,

39
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,410
not just a brief encounter.

40
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,600
Of course.

41
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,320
Don't worry.

42
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,450
I'll take you out of the mountains in a couple of days.

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
I'll be going now.

44
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,079
A Nian, I'm sorry.

45
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,560
I can never marry or have children in this life.

46
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,900
I can't ruin your entire life.

47
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,840
Sister.

48
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,600
A Nian.

49
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,000
The person you want to heal is leaving.

50
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,360
You already know.

51
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,800
Silly child.

52
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,500
I've advised you long ago.

53
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,840
As long as you stay in this Misty Valley,

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,260
never in contact with the outside world,

55
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,680
you would be free from troubles forever.

56
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,540
And you wouldn't be as heartbroken as you are today.

57
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,400
But if it weren't for him,

58
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,770
I wouldn't have been as happy as I've been these days.

59
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,240
You can't be with this outsider.

60
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,079
He has wounds that can never be healed.

61
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,020
He doesn't want to burden you.

62
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,040
Your only option is to make a wish to the Divine Tree,

63
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,120
using its divine power.

64
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,040
Only then is it possible to heal him.

65
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,320
Do you know what this means?

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,600
Xue Yiyang is still injured.

67
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,320
Then, will he die?

68
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,000
No.

69
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,340
But he will live the rest of his life in humiliation.

70
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,880
I understand.

71
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,600
The price of making a wish to the Divine Tree

72
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,380
is to replace you as the Goddess of the Misty Valley,

73
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,600
guarding the Divine Tree and our people,

74
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,530
unable to marry,

75
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,880
until the next person who makes a wish appears.

76
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,640
A Nian.

77
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,080
Becoming the Goddess

78
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,840
means abandoning everything in the mortal world.

79
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,040
You'll stay in this void realm forever.

80
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,720
And this outsider

81
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,640
can only leave the Misty Valley.

82
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,200
He will forget you and everything here.

83
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,520
Do you really want to sacrifice

84
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,720
the rest of your life for this outsider?

85
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,200
If that's the case,

86
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,640
after you become the Goddess,

87
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,400
his wounds will be healed.

88
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,640
But the Divine Tree can also sense

89
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,370
the existence of this outsider

90
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,360
and will punish him.

91
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,730
For the rest of his life,

92
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,920
every rainy night,

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,800
he will endure inhuman torment.

94
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,480
Unless he can remember everything.

95
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,080
A Nian, you have seven days left.

96
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,440
After seven days,

97
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,620
you will never see each other again in this life.

98
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,480
Yiyang.

99
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,320
A Nian, I've fixed the roof.

100
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,060
It won't leak anymore.

101
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,159
I've also added tables and chairs inside.

102
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,290
You can eat and write there from now on.

103
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,040
Yi Yang,

104
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,920
if...

105
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,090
you had met me before you were injured,

106
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,880
what would you have done?

107
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,120
It's okay. Let's go inside then.

108
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
I would marry you.

109
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,370
That's enough, just hearing you say that.

110
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,159
A Nian.

111
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,640
Yi Yang.

112
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,800
Great!

113
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,050
I'm not leaving.

114
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,090
I've recovered.

115
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,920
From now on, I'll stay here with you.

116
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,640
A Nian,

117
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,680
will you marry me?

118
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,320
I do.

119
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,900
Wonderful!

120
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,640
A Nian, shall we get married soon?

121
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,400
Sure.

122
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,720
May the sacred tree bless you.

123
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,780
Congratulations.

124
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,760
Have a healthy baby boy.

125
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,650
The bride is so beautiful. Indeed.

126
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,740
Indeed.

127
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,820
Congratulations.

128
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:34,880
Congratulations.

129
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,080
Have children soon.

130
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,120
That's right.

131
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,180
Congratulations.

132
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,320
You're such a perfect match.

133
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,000
That's wonderful.

134
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,840
We people of Zhaoyao Mountain,

135
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,160
when we get married,

136
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,280
all come to the sacred lake.

137
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,640
Our people bring blessings

138
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,370
and prepare for the newlyweds.

139
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,120
At night, we sleep by the sacred lake,

140
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,640
under the open sky,

141
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,900
receiving blessings from the sacred mountain.

142
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,160
The elders also say

143
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,760
if it's windy or rainy tonight,

144
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,680
it means the couple

145
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,520
will surely argue in the future.

146
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,840
May the sacred tree bless us.

147
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,960
It must be a clear night tonight.

148
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,120
May the sacred tree bless us.

149
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,850
Don't be afraid of wind or rain.

150
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,520
You can just hide in my arms.

151
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,250
I will never argue with you,

152
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,920
or get angry with you.

153
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,120
I'll do whatever you say.

154
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,880
And tonight,

155
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,980
it looks like a clear night full of stars.

156
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,920
We people of Zhaoyao Mountain,

157
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,320
when we find our beloved,

158
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,120
we take a branch from the Migu tree as a hairpin.

159
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,600
Now I want to give it to you.
