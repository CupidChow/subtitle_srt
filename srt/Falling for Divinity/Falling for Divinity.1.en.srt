1
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,920
Xue Yiyang.

2
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,240
The entire Bu clan died because of you.

3
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,100
How dare you come to see her again?

4
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,760
If she listens to my explanation

5
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,160
and still wants to take my life,

6
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,240
I, Xue Yiyang, will take my own life here

7
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,700
as a sacrifice to her clan.

8
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,700
Keep a close eye on him.

9
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,360
If he takes one step forward,

10
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,690
kill him without mercy.

11
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,320
A'nian.

12
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:47,200
A'nian, let me take you home.

13
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,000
Please, let me explain to you.

14
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,650
Goddess.

15
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,050
With this strike, our bond is severed.

16
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,680
You caused the death of my entire clan.

17
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,880
And you still want me to go back with you?

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,040
I want you to atone for my clan's deaths.

19
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,760
How could it be you, Pei Ji?

20
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,960
I never thought

21
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,960
that the one trying to kill me would be you.

22
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,079
A'nian, don't make any more mistakes.

23
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,680
Everything should end now.

24
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,520
The ending...

25
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,740
Could it have been different?

26
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,480
Unfortunately,

27
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,480
there are no 'what ifs' in this world.

28
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,280
Is he dead?

29
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,880
Oh my God.

30
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,400
How did he survive with so many injuries?

31
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,360
Sister Shennu finally agreed that on my birthday,

32
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,160
I could leave the mountain once.

33
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,380
You should come with me today.

34
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,040
Strange.

35
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,920
why is he getting weaker and weaker?

36
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,040
if a person eats,

37
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,330
they should get better, right?

38
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,160
This porridge...

39
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,280
Is this color right?

40
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:05,960
I don't know either.

41
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,820
What do things look like outside?

42
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,700
Never mind, let's just try it.

43
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,380
You're finally awake.

44
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,920
This room hasn't been repaired for years.

45
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,800
The rain inside is heavier than outside.

46
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,840
You have no idea.

47
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,560
A few days ago, I left Zhaoyao Mountain for the first time.

48
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,159
I used all the precious herbs I had gathered with great effort

49
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,560
to make porridge for you.

50
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,820
You better stay alive.

51
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,680
As compensation,

52
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,740
tell me stories about the outside world.

53
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,040
However,

54
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,520
you need to give me the knife you're hiding behind your back first.

55
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,080
Okay?

56
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,410
You're all grown up now, why are you still afraid of bitterness?

57
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,560
Give me something sweet.

58
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,850
It's not poisonous.

59
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,760
What are you doing?

60
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,530
I'm applying medicine.

61
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,450
A few days ago...

62
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,140
Have you been applying medicine for me like this all along?

63
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,000
Not really.

64
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,580
You weren't wearing pants a few days ago.

65
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,200
So...

66
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,580
You know I have a physical defect.

67
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,680
Defect?

68
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,560
Are you missing an arm or a leg?

69
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,680
Aren't you quite whole?

70
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,740
What's different?

71
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,840
I was born with gray eyes.

72
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,120
However, I heard from my grandmother...

73
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,159
In the outside world...

74
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,159
there are also women with gray eyes.

75
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,440
But none of us have ever been outside.

76
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,900
We don't know if it's true.

77
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,299
Have you ever seen any?

78
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,050
Why do you never go outside?

79
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,560
According to what our ancestors said...

80
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,600
a long time ago, during a war...

81
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,560
one of our people, for self-preservation...

82
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,840
sought help from a goddess.

83
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,720
She hid Mount Zhaoyao from the world.

84
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,120
Outsiders can't come in.

85
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,930
And those inside can't get out.

86
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,640
Unless they find the Migu Branch.

87
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,400
Migu Branch?

88
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,800
With the Migu Branch...

89
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,000
one can find the entrance to Mount Zhaoyao.

90
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But you're quite lucky.

91
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,560
I smuggled you in.

92
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,200
Is your wound better?

93
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
Why are you barefoot?

94
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,320
Walking on the ground without shoes?

95
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,880
Shoes?

96
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,360
What are shoes?

97
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,480
Our people have been like this since childhood.

98
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,280
Outside, everyone wears shoes.

99
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,680
Besides these...

100
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,740
there are many complicated customs.

101
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,020
There's a ceremony for birth.

102
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,200
A coming-of-age ceremony.

103
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,680
A ceremony for starting apprenticeship.

104
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,920
Even during festivals...

105
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,180
there are ancestral temple sacrifices.

106
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,220
You have too many rules there, don't you?

107
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,280
As for us people of Mount Zhaoyao...

108
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,480
we yearn for freedom.

109
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,640
When we're tired...

110
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,880
we rest by the roadside.

111
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,540
When thirsty, we drink water.

112
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,410
We can sleep until we naturally wake up every day.

113
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,840
It's incredibly joyful.

114
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
What's life like where you're from?

115
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,880
Where I'm from...

116
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,280
there are rules everywhere.

117
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,400
Since childhood, it was decided for me...

118
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
what kind of person I should become.

119
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
My mother said...

120
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,240
as a subject...

121
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,880
one must understand forbearance.

122
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,940
Not an inch more...

123
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,120
nor an inch less.

124
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,200
What about yourself?

125
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What kind of person do you want to be?

126
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:33,800
I...

127
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,160
I used to always give in.

128
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,640
thinking that taking a step back would keep the peace.

129
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,420
But I never thought...

130
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,240
taking a step back...

131
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,420
behind me was a bottomless abyss.

132
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,140
Countless people who followed me...

133
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,000
all ended up shattered.

134
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,840
The person I want to be now...

135
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,240
is someone who isn't controlled by others.

136
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,120
You have too many rules here.

137
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,580
How about this?

138
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,370
Tomorrow, you'll come with me.

139
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,680
I'll take you to see

140
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,120
how our people live.

141
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,640
Okay.

142
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,320
Yi Yang, look.

143
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,560
This is the sacred lake of our Zhaoyao Mountain.

144
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,360
The water stays warm all year round.

145
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,680
It can cure diseases and heal wounds.

146
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,920
it's effective for wounds.

147
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,240
You should go soak in it quickly.

148
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,840
Your wound will heal faster.

149
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,860
What are you doing?

150
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,680
What can I do?

151
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,680
Of course I'm going to soak with you.

152
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,160
I was out in the rain all night yesterday.

153
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,880
It would be bad if I caught a cold.

154
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,340
Well...

155
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,210
This... this... this isn't appropriate.

156
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,040
What's wrong with it?

157
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,040
Don't be shy, let's go together.

158
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,040
Let's go, let's go.

159
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,360
Well...

160
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,320
It's really okay, I'll help you.

161
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,840
Ah Nian.

162
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,900
Ah Zhao.

163
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,200
Not bad, Ah Nian.

164
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,600
Bringing back a handsome lover from outside the mountains.

165
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,720
And you didn't even tell me.

166
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,960
Ah Zhao,

167
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,960
don't talk so loudly in front of him.

168
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,320
He can hear you.

169
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,280
In our tribe,

170
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,080
we haven't had outsiders for hundreds of years.

171
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,360
And such a good-looking outsider at that.

172
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,360
What's your name?

173
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,180
Xue Yiyang.

174
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
Have you seen outside the mountains

175
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,000
my stinky brother Pei Ji?

176
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,520
He looks, looks about the same as me.

177
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,680
Ah Zhao,

178
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,280
I just remembered

179
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,280
I need to take Xue Yiyang to get medicine.

180
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,340
We'll be going now.

181
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,210
Let's go.

182
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,320
Just give me the medicine.

183
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,160
Whatever you do, don't make a wish to the divine tree.

184
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
Don't worry, I'm not an idiot.

185
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,200
Divine Sister,

186
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,680
the other day when I went up the mountain to pick mushrooms,

187
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,080
I accidentally got hurt.

188
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,720
Could you give me some spiritual medicine?

189
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,400
preferably the kind that works for knife wounds and arrow wounds,

190
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,680
and burns too.

191
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,840
Also, I-

192
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,560
No.

193
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,600
No?

194
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,160
How can there be none?

195
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,720
The medicine you gave me last time I was injured,

196
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,320
my wounds were completely healed the next day.

197
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,980
There wasn't even a scar left.

198
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,240
If it's to save you, I have it.

199
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,880
To save outsiders, I don't.

200
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,920
Divine Sister, please, I beg you.

201
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,680
I'm in so much pain.

202
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,520
Just give me some medicine, please.

203
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,080
Ah Nian,

204
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,720
since you were little, you've cleansed my body daily with the holy lake water,

205
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,680
preserving my physical form from decay.

206
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,120
I've watched you grow up.

207
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,960
I know your character best.

208
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,800
You are pure-hearted by nature,

209
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,560
but you care too deeply for others.

210
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,880
Deep emotions lead to a short life.

211
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,560
Ah Nian, don't let yourself be hurt by emotions.

212
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,320
Divine Sister,

213
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,960
why are you suddenly saying such serious things?

214
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,080
I'm clever, you know.

215
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,280
Who could possibly hurt me?

216
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,160
Silly child, you're already deeply involved.

217
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,360
Those in the midst of it are blind to it.

218
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,520
Don't continue to be so obstinate.

219
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,460
Thank you, Divine Sister.

220
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,680
Good morning, Uncle Li.

221
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,280
Going to pick wild fruits?

222
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:48,840
Wait for me!

223
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,000
This is the pottery we fired for mother.

224
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,530
What is it? It's beautiful.

225
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,200
Look, this is the treehouse.

226
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,680
We can pick wild fruits over there too.

227
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,160
I'll take you there.

228
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,020
It's so lively.

229
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,260
Yi Yang, come here.

230
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,640

232
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,280
