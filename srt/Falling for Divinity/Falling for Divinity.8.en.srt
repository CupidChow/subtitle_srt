1
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,340
Open it and take a look.

2
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,520
It's so beautiful!

3
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,490
It's for you.

4
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,039
Aren't the ones on your feet uncomfortable?

5
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:17,770
Try these on.

6
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,840
They're so beautiful!

7
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,640
I love them!

8
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,820
Thank you, Yiyang.

9
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,090
You helped me resolve a crisis.

10
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,420
Consider this my token of gratitude.

11
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,800
I believe you have the ability to foresee the future.

12
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,400
However,

13
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,280
why do you want to protect me?

14
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,160
A Nian,

15
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,800
I told you about Xue Yiyang's death date

16
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,080
to make you give up,

17
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,080
not for you to save him.

18
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,400
Moreover, the prophetic power of Migu

19
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,130
is meant to protect our people,

20
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,840
not to be used for outsiders.

21
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,800
You haven't succeeded as the divine maiden yet,

22
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,760
so you can't master the prophetic power.

23
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,360
Using it recklessly will only backfire on you.

24
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,360
I know.

25
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,480
Just this once.

26
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,180
Once I've resolved his death crisis,

27
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,880
I'll fulfill my promise

28
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,560
to become the divine maiden of Migu

29
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,020
and protect Zhaoyao Mountain for eternity.

30
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,680
If that's the case,

31
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,160
when the first snow falls this year,

32
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,960
you must return to Zhaoyao Mountain

33
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,890
to take on your responsibilities.

34
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,440
Remember,

35
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,160
everything about Zhaoyao Mountain

36
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,560
must not be mentioned to outsiders, not a single word.

37
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,620
Otherwise, the people of Zhaoyao Mountain will face eternal damnation.

38
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,440
Can I not say this?

39
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,360
I promise.

40
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,090
Next time, I'll tell you everything for sure.

41
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,720
Can I trust you?

42
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,370
Yes, you can.

43
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,360
Young Lord, the letter has been delivered.

44
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,240
You may go.

45
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:44,920
Yes.

46
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,780
Someone wrote a letter to Bu Nian.

47
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,290
Could it be that they

48
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,740
also found out about her ability to foresee the future?

49
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,440
It's up to her to decide then.

50
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,760
Oh, right.

51
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,160
Is that treehouse going to be demolished?

52
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,420
The house steward said

53
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,480
since it's in the general's private quarters,

54
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,640
they're worried it might be in the way.

55
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,320
Let it stay.

56
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,450
I guess she went to find the Young Lord.

57
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,440
Young Master,

58
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,440
they're selling freshly made

59
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,440
pastries.

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,440
Take a look at the sachet.

61
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,840
Could this vendor be

62
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,880
the person sent by the young city lord to meet with her?

63
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,420
Let's wait and see.

64
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,720
Boss,

65
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,400
can you sell me some thin bamboo sticks?

66
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,560
Sure, miss.

67
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,480
Feel free to choose whichever you like.

68
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:04,960
Just pay with silver.

69
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,920
Could this be some kind of code?

70
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,930
I'd rather do it myself.

71
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,640
Take your time, miss.

72
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,920
Why does this scene feel so familiar again?

73
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,520
Miss,

74
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,860
you're very skillful.

75
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,760
Is this for your sweetheart?

76
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
Sweetheart?

77
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,560
Sweetheart...

78
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,480
Here, take this red string.

79
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,120
Once you tie this,

80
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,160
it's like the matchmaker god has tied you together.

81
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,400
For a lifetime.

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,800
Looks nice, doesn't it?

83
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,730
Thank you, boss.

84
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,560
But I don't need it.

85
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,040
Yi Yang and I no longer have a lifetime together.

86
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,720
Sister Nian,

87
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,760
Pei Ji, it's you.

88
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,690
I've finally found you.

89
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,720
Find me?

90
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,960
Weren't you traveling?

91
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,360
We'll talk about family matters later.

92
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,000
Your hands are still as skillful as before, sister.

93
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,720
This...

94
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,380
Can you give this to me?

95
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,120
This?

96
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,320
This...

97
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,400
It seems you already have someone in mind to give it to.

98
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,320
That's right.

99
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,960
It's been a long time.

100
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,040
I'm afraid you might already have someone special in your heart.

101
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,900
It's just a bamboo wind chime.

102
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,250
I'll give it to you then.

103
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,560
Take it.

104
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,920
Thank you, sister.

105
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,040
Where are you staying now, sister?

106
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,920
I just bought a house.

107
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,370
How about...

108
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,010
coming over to my place for a visit?

109
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,840
I... I'm actually staying at someone else's place recently.

110
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,960
And it's getting late today.

111
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,440
I'll definitely visit you another day.

112
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,040
Staying at someone else's place must be inconvenient.

113
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,480
If you don't mind, sister,

114
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,940
you can come to me anytime.

115
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,600
After all, we are family.

116
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,040
It's been a long time since we last met.

117
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,770
Do you have someone you like now, little brother?

118
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,940
How come I didn't know about this?

119
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,160
Didn't you say you couldn't find any information about her background?

120
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,090
What's going on?

121
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,160
As soon as she goes out, a brother appears?

122
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,200
This might be a newly recognized relationship.

123
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,720
Investigate. Go and investigate for me.

124
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,760
including the brother's name.

125
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,290
Find out everything for me.

126
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,720
Is that all?

127
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,330
Everything's been hung up.

128
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,440
Yi Yang.

129
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,300
Why are there so many portraits of women?

130
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,560
The Empress Dowager, to thank the general for saving her life,

131
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,040
specially sent people from the city

132
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,920
to select eligible young ladies from noble families

133
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,650
for the general to choose from.

134
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,640
Choose what?

135
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,960
To choose a princess consort, of course.

136
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,840
Miss Bu Nian, it's good that you're here.

137
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,600
Why don't you help us take a look?

138
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,920
Would a daughter of a military family be better,

139
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,480
or a sheltered young lady?

140
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,240
Can't he not marry?

141
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,450
What are you saying?

142
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,600
For a man,

143
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,240
having three wives and four concubines is normal.

144
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,160
Moreover, our general is in his prime,

145
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,240
yet he doesn't have even one wife or concubine.

146
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,240
No wonder there are rumors spreading in the city,

147
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,080
saying he's impotent.

148
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,600
What kind of talk is that?

149
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,250
What happened to your hand?

150
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,880
It's nothing.

151
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,000
They're gone.

152
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,440
Burn all these paintings.

153
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,900
Tell the Empress Dowager,

154
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,250
I already have someone I'm interested in.

155
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:26,930
Who is it?

156
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,210
It's none of your business.

157
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,220
How boring.

158
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,880
Sister Nian, persimmons.

159
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,570
Here, have a big one.

160
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,360
Thank you.

161
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,360
Sister, why aren't you eating?

162
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,080
Aren't persimmons your favorite?

163
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,760
I searched the entire Fuzi City

164
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,080
to find this one persimmon tree.

165
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,140
I had it moved here.

166
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,320
But,

167
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,480
the persimmons here are small and astringent.

168
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,120
The taste

169
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,860
is probably mediocre.

170
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,400
But it doesn't matter.

171
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,800
Once we return to Zhaoyang Mountain,

172
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,860
I'll pick fresh ones for you, Sister.

173
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,800
You still remember that I like to eat persimmons?

174
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,880
Of course.

175
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,520
How could I forget anything about you, Sister?

176
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,820
Sister, what's wrong?

177
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,490
Are you feeling unwell?

178
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,040
It's nothing.

179
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,840
Oh, Pei Ji,

180
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,760
do you know?

181
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,440
I heard that

182
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,920
the men in Fuzi City

183
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,250
can have three wives and four concubines.

184
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,760
The men here

185
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,760
are naturally not like those from our Zhaoyang Mountain.

186
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,490
In our Zhaoyang Mountain, it's

187
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,320
one life, one world, one partner.

188
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:46,920
Right.

189
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,880
By the way,

190
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,440
a few years ago,

191
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,880
Sister Goddess predicted

192
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,240
that our people would face a great calamity.

193
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,560
Since you were sent out to travel

194
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,160
to seek ways to protect our people,

195
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,240
have you gained anything in these three years?

196
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,400
Gains?

197
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,810
I've learned some useless etiquette.

198
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,600
Sister, why did you leave the mountain?

199
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,460
Could it be that

200
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,100
you made a wish to Sister Goddess?

201
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,160
I...

202
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,450
So it's true.

203
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,220
You've still taken this step.

204
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,330
What do you mean?

205
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,970
Sister Nian,

206
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,260
do you know that

207
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,840
once you become the Goddess of Migu,

208
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,120
you'll have to protect Zhaoyang Mountain forever?

209
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,920
You can never marry in this life.

210
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,880
I know.

211
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,240
So, before long,

212
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,970
I'll have to go back to fulfill my promise.

213
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,930
Look on the bright side.

214
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,760
You see,

215
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,840
if I become the Goddess of Migu,

216
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,400
I'll be able to foresee the future.

217
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,120
I'll know

218
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,480
when you'll get married and have children,

219
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,400
and even how many babies you'll have.

220
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,800
If it were me,

221
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,850
I would never let you sacrifice

222
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,920
your lifelong happiness for me.

223
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,680
Don't think about these things anymore.

224
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,320
Oh, Pei Ji,

225
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,360
since you came out before me,

226
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,000
why don't you teach me

227
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,400
what other rules are there in Fuzi City?

228
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,410
Well, there are so many rules in Fuzi City.

229
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,640
But it doesn't matter.

230
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,960
You don't have to learn everything.

231
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,840
When you're with me,

232
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,770
you never need to follow any rules.

233
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,120
My Pei Ji has really grown up.

234
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,340
How could this happen?

235
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,840
Why?

236
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,330
The people I care about,

237
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,610
why do they all end up like this?

238
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,360
What should I do?

239
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,400
Have you heard?

240
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,120
The Empress Dowager is arranging a marriage for General Xue.

241
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,920
I wonder which family's daughter it will be.

242
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,000
To have such good fortune.

243
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,560
Indeed.

244
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,760
Someone like General Xue,

245
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,840
of course, must marry someone of equal status.

246
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,640
He'll marry a well-educated and well-mannered lady from a noble family.

247
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,560
That's true.

248
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,290
How could an ordinary person be worthy of him?

249
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,690
A match of equal status.

250
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,160
Sister Nian.

251
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,560
I will never let anything happen to you.

252
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,360
Unfilial son.

253
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,280
You haven't eliminated the bandits outside the city.

254
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,800
Why are you sending me clothes?

255
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,920
Do I need these few pieces of clothing from you?

256
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,440
Uncle,

257
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,840
the young city lord also has filial intentions.

258
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,240
regarding the recent matter of the roving bandits,

259
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,600
I suppose he doesn't know about it.

260
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,120
Please don't let anger harm your health.

261
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,480
Have I gone blind,

262
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,960
or have I gone deaf?

263
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,620
As the young city lord,

264
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,880
you don't care about the citizens in the city.

265
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,360
What are you doing?

266
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,760
If you can't do it, then don't do it anymore.

267
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,640
Father, I know I was wrong.

268
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,820
Remember this,

269
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,320
between us, the relationship of ruler and subject comes first,

270
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,050
and then that of father and son.

271
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,540
Nephew,

272
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,120
take my military tally,

273
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,880
and make sure to capture all the bandits outside the city in one sweep.

274
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,140
I accept your command.

275
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,720
Is everything arranged?

276
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,660
Yes, it's done.

277
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,760
Xue Yiyang

278
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,160
I thought you were very patient.

279
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:18,840
What?

280
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,130
You've finally shown your true colors this time.
