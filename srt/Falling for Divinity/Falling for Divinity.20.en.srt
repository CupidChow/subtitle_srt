1
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,440
Move.

2
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,320
Come here.

3
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,080
Behave yourself.

4
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,840
Come here.

5
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:09,720
Squat down.

6
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,010
Everyone, behave yourselves.

7
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,960
Move, come here.

8
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:19,770
Hurry up.

9
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,220
How could this happen?

10
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,480
Where do you think you're going?

11
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,760
Don't kill me, don't kill me!

12
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,200
Stop!

13
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,840
Don't kill my father!

14
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,160
Father!

15
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,410
The Goddess has come to save us!

16
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,320
You'll be punished by heaven!

17
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,560
Watch out!

18
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,560
Catch them!

19
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,259
Hurry up, hurry up!

20
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,100
Squat down.

21
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,100
Everyone, squat down!

22
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,200
Quick!

23
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,320
A Zhao!

24
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,560
A Zhao!

25
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,720
A Zhao!

26
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,020
Stand here and don't move.

27
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,740
Xue Yiyang!

28
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,170
You've really done a great service this time.

29
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,880
If you hadn't broken the barrier of Zhaoyao Mountain,

30
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,940
I wouldn't have been able to break in.

31
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,200
You'll be greatly rewarded when we return.

32
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,520
Xue Yiyang, you deceived me.

33
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,880
What exactly did you do to me?

34
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,600
I didn't.

35
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,680
Give me your hand.

36
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,120
From now on,

37
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,980
you are the Goddess of Zhaoyao Mountain.

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,160
But remember this,

39
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,850
you promised me.

40
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,880
No matter what,

41
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,210
you must not harm the people of Zhaoyao Mountain.

42
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,520
Rest assured,

43
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,440
from now on,

44
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,370
there will be no more people of Zhaoyao Mountain.

45
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,810
What do you mean?

46
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,680
You.

47
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,210
Not good.

48
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,400
A Zhao.

49
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,120
Come on, everyone keep up! Hurry!

50
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,409
Grandma, slow down.

51
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,180
Come on.

52
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,640
Sister A Nian.

53
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,040
Sister A Nian.

54
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,560
Pei Ji.

55
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,180
I'll take you away.

56
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,040
Tell me.

57
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,360
Is there in your tribe

58
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,220
a way to bring people back to life?

59
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,540
There's no way.

60
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,880
People, people can't come back to life once they're dead.

61
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,480
I don't want to hear 'can't'.

62
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
I just want to know

63
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,100
how to bring the dead back to life.

64
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,600
Goddess.

65
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,280
Come.

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,920
You tell me.

67
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,600
Otherwise,

68
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,420
your father will never be able to hold you again.

69
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,720
Speak.

70
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,920
Go, go ask the Goddess.

71
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,280
She can do anything.

72
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,650
She's really powerful.

73
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,360
Goddess.

74
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,810
Where is she?

75
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,040
It's Bu Nian.

76
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,600
She is the goddess.

77
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,320
Ruo Feng can be saved.

78
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,760
Ruo Feng can be saved.

79
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,970
Bring her back to the prince's mansion for me.

80
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,920
Pei Ji.

81
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,640
Sister Nian, you're awake.

82
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,600
Where are our people?

83
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,000
How are our people doing?

84
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,880
Sister,

85
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,160
actually, this isn't entirely your fault.

86
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,680
It's all because of that Xue Yiyang.

87
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,440
He forced you to leave the divine tree

88
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,240
at the crucial moment when you were receiving divine power.

89
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,200
As soon as you left the divine tree, the barrier disappeared.

90
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,040
Xue Fu then led his troops to invade Zhaoyao Mountain.

91
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,900
Don't you think

92
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,570
this was a conspiracy between the two of them?

93
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Actually, we can't blame Xue Yiyang entirely either.

94
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,360
After all, Xue Fu is the young lord of Fuzi City.

95
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,360
He had to obey the young lord's orders.

96
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:27,820
Enough.

97
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,040
Stop talking.

98
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,330
Sister Nian,

99
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,760
shall we leave this place of trouble together?

100
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,020
We can find a new place,

101
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,520
just like Zhaoyao Mountain,

102
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,640
and start a new life.

103
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
What about A Zhao?

104
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,850
What about Lu Li?

105
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,140
What about Granny Li and Granny Wang?

106
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,460
I should never have known Xue Yiyang.

107
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,800
Miss Bu Nian, you can't go in.

108
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,420
Move aside.

109
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,160
You, go out first.

110
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,560
Yes.

111
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,600
Young City Lord, it's been a while.

112
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,600
Bu Nian.

113
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,560
So you're the so-called Goddess of Mount Zhaoyao?

114
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,240
I know you have the power to bring the dead back to life.

115
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,970
I command you

116
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,720
to quickly revive my Young City Lord's wife.

117
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,380
Command me?

118
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,530
Your people are all in my hands.

119
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,299
If you don't agree,

120
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,200
I'll kill them all.

121
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,370
Then go ahead and kill them.

122
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,120
What?

123
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,170
You seem like a completely different person.

124
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,480
I am a goddess now.

125
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,960
I can take your life at any time.

126
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,490
In that case,

127
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,760
if you just help me revive my Young City Lord's wife,

128
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,560
I'll agree to anything you want.

129
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
It's just saving someone, isn't it?

130
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,530
What's the big deal?

131
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,000
Look how anxious our Young City Lord is.

132
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,160
I need

133
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,810
you to cut forty-nine pieces of flesh from your body.

134
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,100
One piece each day.

135
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,130
After forty-nine days,

136
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,170
combined with my divine power,

137
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,530
I can resurrect the Young Lord's wife.

138
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,800
What do you think?

139
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,160
It seems the Young Lord's deep love for his wife

140
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,170
is not as great as I thought.

141
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,040
Perhaps you should find another wife instead.

142
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,650
I'm willing to do it.

143
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,620
The poison of three insects and three herbs.

144
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,480
This must be your most prized medicine.

145
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,760
What a pity.

146
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,560
It's of no use to me now.

147
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,210
I asked you to take Bu Nian's place.

148
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,200
But I didn't tell you to harm my sister.

149
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,960
And our people.

150
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,220
Was it really my fault?

151
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,840
Didn't you tell Xue Yiyang

152
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,970
to take Bu Nian away?

153
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,440
Only then would the barrier disappear.

154
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,480
If we're talking about harming them,

155
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,940
you're also responsible.

156
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,760
You're right.

157
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,820
I can't believe you dared to drink it.

158
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,920
You finally managed to take Bu Nian away.

159
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,320
Don't you want to spend your life with her?

160
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,920
I'll kill Xue Fu and Xue Yiyang for you.

161
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,800
Consider it

162
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,980
my repayment for giving me this body.

163
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,280
And the divine power.

164
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,900
You said Bu Nian and I share the same fate.

165
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,040
So please, take good care of her life for me.

166
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,560
A Ran.

167
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,960
Do you know Xue Fu and Xue Yiyang?

168
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,580
You should change how you address me.

169
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
My name is Qiao An.

170
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,380
Young Lord,

171
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,920
this death warrior, Qiao An,

172
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,680
was bought at the age of five and has been trained since then.

173
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,280
it's been fifteen years already.

174
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,410
She wins every time.

175
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
What's the point of competing with people?

176
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,880
Go bring the tiger that was captured from Xishan before.

177
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,680
Bring it here.

178
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,320
Yes.

179
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,600
Have you memorized General Xue's appearance?

180
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,880
Yes, I have.

181
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,200
From now on,

182
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,440
you are Qi Wanwan, the daughter of the Chief Protector.

183
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,970
Where is the real Qi Wanwan?

184
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,560
I've arranged for her to be well taken care of, of course.

185
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,120
That General Xue by your side

186
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,040
is far more dangerous than a fierce tiger.

187
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,240
If he discovers any flaw in your act,

188
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,000
you'll have only one path left - death.

189
