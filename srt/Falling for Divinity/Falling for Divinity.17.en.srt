1
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,440
Sister has worn the sachet for a long time.

2
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,970
You have already obtained her divine thread.

3
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,600
From now on, your fates are intertwined.

4
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,560
Before long,

5
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,440
you will become like a human,

6
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,920
with a heart

7
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,280
and emotions.

8
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,240
Perhaps when you return,

9
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,320
you can take Sister Anian's place

10
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,980
and become the divine maiden.

11
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,120
Then,

12
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,800
I can take Sister Anian

13
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,480
and run away.

14
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,960
Come back soon, will you,

15
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,120
Aran?

16
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,560
The woman who gave me the divine thread,

17
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,400
her beloved is actually Xue Yiyang.

18
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,780
Since heaven has given me this opportunity,

19
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,880
how could I not cherish it?

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,760
What's wrong?

21
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,160
Is he running a fever again?

22
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,960
I'm afraid his injuries have worsened.

23
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,760
We should quickly find a doctor.

24
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,280
Xue Fu is so shameless,

25
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
relying on the Empress Dowager's influence

26
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,320
to treat the General like this.

27
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,780
It's because our General commands a hundred thousand troops,

28
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,440
wielding significant military power.

29
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,560
The young lord has always felt

30
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,220
that the General is superior to him in every way.

31
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
If things are already like this now,

32
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,680
if in the future

33
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,720
he really becomes the city lord,

34
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,040
what will happen to the General?

35
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,970
What are you-

36
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,240
It's nothing.

37
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,920
Am I wrong?

38
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,090
He's already like this.

39
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,079
Don't you want to do something about it?

40
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,010
Of course I will,

41
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,240
but we shouldn't talk like this.

42
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
It's all my fault.

43
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,210
I was too anxious about Yiyang.

44
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,940
I'll go fetch a doctor.

45
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,290
You take care of him.

46
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,520
Are you tired?

47
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,079
Madam.

48
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,280
I... I really can't carry it anymore.

49
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,480
Using such hot water,

50
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,770
who are you trying to scald?

51
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,560
Madam, the water has already cooled down.

52
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,800
Alright, pour it in.

53
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,240
Then get out.

54
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,080
Yes.

55
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,159
Look, our child.

56
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,120
Take him to the divine maiden.

57
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,680
Go and pray for blessings for him.

58
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,040
Father, drink your medicine.

59
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,840
Slowly, take it easy.

60
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,200
There's not a single grain of rice left at home.

61
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,960
You still want money?

62
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,800
If you don't give me money,

63
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,000
you just wait and see.

64
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:49,840
Father!

65
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,200
I'm burning paper money for you.

66
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,130
Please accept it on the other side.

67
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,880
So this is what she meant.

68
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,240
All things change, causes arise and cease.

69
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,400
Miss, this is not good for the child.

70
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,200
You're taking too much risk.

71
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,680
A Fu is coming back today.

72
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,840
He can't find out.

73
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,000
Miss, why are you doing this to yourself?

74
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,000
The young master might

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
be looking forward to this child's birth too.

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,600
Besides,

77
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,200
if you keep going like this,

78
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,960
how long can you keep it a secret?

79
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,690
I'll hide it for as long as I can.

80
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,840
After some time,

81
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,400
I'll tell him I'm going to the temple to pray for a year.

82
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,660
Once the child is born, I'll send it away.

83
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,290
He absolutely cannot know.

84
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,800
I don't want

85
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,000
my child to be seen as a bastard by him in the future.

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,400
But if something happens to your health...

87
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,480
Madam, the young master has returned.

88
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,610
So what if he's back?

89
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,560
Don't you know to knock before entering the master's room?

90
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,880
The young lord is injured.

91
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,720
It was the lord who punished the young lord.

92
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,960
He subjected General Xue to excessive punishment.

93
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,480
I see.

94
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,880
I'll go see him later.

95
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,560
That won't be necessary.

96
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
The young lord's injury

97
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,220
is also related to you, madam.

98
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,040
It's better if you don't go, madam.

99
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,320
Do you still know who's in charge here?

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,660
Young Lord,

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,680
the extermination of the Liu family.

102
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,480
Should we inform the Young Lord's wife?

103
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,610
What's there to say?

104
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,400
Tutor Liu betrayed the country and sided with the enemy.

105
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,880
He planted spies in the army and embezzled supplies.

106
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,810
He even tried to pin the blame on me.

107
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,410
He got what he deserved.

108
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,200
The Young Lord's wife is now just the Young Lord's wife,

109
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,600
not Liu Ruofeng anymore.

110
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,860
But there were over thirty lives lost in the Liu household.

111
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,680
This matter can't be kept secret.

112
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,880
Moreover, Tutor Liu did it for you.

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,600
Gentler.

114
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,840
You're hurting me.

115
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,300
Guards!

116
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,280
Take him away.

117
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,720
Young Lord, please calm your anger.

118
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,380
My disciple has offended you.

119
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,080
I beg you,

120
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,120
for the sake of your newborn son with your wife.

121
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,159
Do a good deed.

122
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,880
Please spare my disciple.

123
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,210
What did you say?

124
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,720
Please, I beg you to spare my disciple.

125
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,480
Not that one.

126
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
The previous one.

127
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,050
What's this about the lady having a new child?

128
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,000
Yes.

129
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,520
Just now, a maid named Lian'er

130
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,800
went to the pharmacy to check on the lady's pregnancy medicine with a subordinate.

131
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,440
I'm having a child.

132
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,160
That's right.

133
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,820
Young Master, don't you know?

134
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,440
Didn't I tell you

135
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,159
I haven't had much appetite lately?

136
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,000
Why did you prepare so many dishes?

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,360
The young master instructed the kitchen early this morning.

138
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,090
He asked them to prepare some appetizers for you.

139
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,320
Did he really come last night?

140
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,700
Could it be that he already knows?

141
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,290
It's not good, miss.

142
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,040
I just went to the street to buy something,

143
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,800
They said

144
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,600
They say the Liu family has been massacred.

145
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,200
Over thirty people, and not a single survivor.

146
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,200
Why?

147
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,200
They're accused of treason, collaborating with the enemy, and planting spies.

148
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,400
And selling our army's supplies.

149
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,660
Nonsense! My father would never do that.

150
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,440
Young Lord,

151
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,880
the Young Lady already knows the truth.

152
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,960
What should we do?

153
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,000
So she knows. So what?

154
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,160
Take good care of the Young Lady.

155
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,360
Don't let anything happen to her.

156
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:25,890
Yes, sir.

157
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,960
What about the bird in this cage?

158
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,970
It flew away.

159
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,300
Then why are you still feeding it?

160
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,220
Aren't its chicks still here?

161
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,520
It will come back to feed its young.

162
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,840
Young Lord,

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,400
why don't you ask your wife

164
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,640
about that child?

165
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,970
What's there to ask?

166
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,440
Haven't you always suspected

167
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,280
that the Young Lady and General Xue were having an affair?

168
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,210
Shut your mouth!

169
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,520
Once Xue Yiyang is dead,

170
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,580
no one will ever question this matter again.

171
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,080
The child she bears

172
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,480
will be my, Xue Fu's, legitimate firstborn son.

173
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,080
As long as she has this child,

174
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,460
she won't think about other men anymore.

175
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,560
Pei Ji said,

176
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,060
before inheriting divine power,

177
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,090
if I stay away from Bu Nian for too long,

178
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,240
my body will start to decay.

179
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
If that's true,

180
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,280
I need to wrap things up here quickly

181
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,460
and return to Zhaoyang Mountain.

182
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,440
A maid from the mansion has mysteriously disappeared.

183
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,840
It must have been done by someone in the mansion.

184
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,300
How should we handle this?

185
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,970
Search the mansion.

186
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,960
The security in the mansion is tight.

187
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,640
It's impossible to leave casually.

188
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,570
Whether she's dead or alive, we need an explanation.

189
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,530
Miss Bu Nian,

190
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,400
Yiyang, I've brought your medicine.

191
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,520
What's wrong?

192
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,160
Where are the preserved fruits?

193
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,760
I forgot.

194
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,730
I'll definitely bring you some next time.

195
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,080
Ah Nian,

196
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,040
why did it take you so long to return to Zhaoyang Mountain this time?

197
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,770
Was it because Pei Ji couldn't find the medicine?

198
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,520
It took some time,

199
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,840
but we've found it now.

200
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,820
So, does this mean you won't be leaving anymore?

201
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,400
I've already prepared the wedding dress.

202
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,600
Shall we get married?

203
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,800
Your leg injury hasn't fully healed yet.

204
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,800
It will also take some time to send out invitations to the guests.

205
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,260
Why don't we wait a few days and then choose an auspicious date?

206
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,320
Ah Nian, what do you think?

207
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,080
Alright.

208
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,880
Madam, what do you need me for?

209
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,840
Why don't you come in?

210
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,420
It's late at night.

211
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,240
It's not appropriate for me, an outsider, to enter.

212
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,080
I have important matters to discuss with you, General.

213
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,080
It's not convenient for others to hear.

214
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,880
Come in, then.

215
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,880
General,

216
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,040
do you think this dress fits me well?

217
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,260
Is this the important matter you mentioned?

218
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,450
Isn't this an important matter between us, General?

219
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,040
Then I should call a maid to help you with that.

220
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,920
I'm a rough man.

221
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,440
I don't understand these things.

222
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:34,970
Don't go.

223
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,610
You're not Bu Nian. Who are you?

224
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,320
We've met before.

225
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:46,880
We have.

226
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,340
Ah Nian.

227
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,820
Don't come any closer.

228
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,860
Quick, leave! Don't come closer!

229
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,040
Lu Li.

230
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,120
No.

231
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,360
