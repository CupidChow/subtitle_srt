1
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,360
Who is this?

2
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,360
It seems A Ran was not wrong.

3
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,380
You've been pestering our sister A Nian,

4
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,760
and now you've followed her all the way to our Zhaoyao Mountain.

5
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,600
You brought A Nian back to get medicine,

6
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,200
why didn't you take her back?

7
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,920
What a joke.

8
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,200
You must have forgotten,

9
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,640
this is A Nian's original home.

10
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,539
We've already married on Zhaoyao Mountain.

11
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,400
Did you follow Fuzi City's customs

12
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,490
with the three matchmakers and six betrothal gifts?

13
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,080
If not,

14
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,900
then it doesn't count.

15
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,400
But we've already consummated our marriage.

16
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,759
Consummation?

17
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,080
We don't have so many rules on Zhaoyao Mountain.

18
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,640
Besides, A Nian now

19
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,520
is no longer someone

20
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,440
that you or I can just take away as we please.

21
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,700
I will take A Nian away.

22
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,680
That woman you found,

23
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,010
she killed Lu Li.

24
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,210
I will take her life.

25
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,520
What if I tell you now

26
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,120
that only if she lives

27
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,120
can A Nian be free?

28
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,130
What do you mean?

29
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,210
What happened to A Nian?

30
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,920
When you first arrived at Zhaoyao Mountain severely injured,

31
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,760
you were already on the brink of death.

32
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,160
But why did you manage to survive in the end?

33
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,240
Moreover,

34
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,600
you were clearly physically disabled at first,

35
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,040
unable to perform marital duties.

36
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,880
Yet why did you eventually recover completely?

37
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,640
Have you ever thought about these things?

38
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,620
The women of our Zhaoyao Mountain

39
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,400
have one chance in their lifetime to make a wish to the divine tree.

40
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,600
If the divine tree grants her wish,

41
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,920
she must become a divine maiden for the rest of her life,

42
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,120
eternally guarding Zhaoyao Mountain.

43
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,320
She can never marry,

44
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,060
nor can she leave the divine tree's side.

45
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,000
So, guess what

46
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,280
my sister Anian

47
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,240
has done for you, an outsider.

48
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,600
What has she done?

49
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,440
During these days when you've forgotten about sister Anian,

50
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,920
I've been running around everywhere

51
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,800
looking for a way to exchange for her freedom.

52
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,079
It was me, it was me.

53
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,760
I traveled for a long time but couldn't find anything.

54
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,120
Later, I finally managed

55
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,570
according to what the secret technique said,

56
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,320
to find the corpses of seven women

57
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,840
and sew them together.

58
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,040
Their corpses and souls became one.

59
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,400
I discovered a method to connect them,

60
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,920
using a sachet to connect their divine threads.

61
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,400
I nurtured this puppet

62
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,240
until it resembled sister Anian by seventy to eighty percent.

63
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,520
That's right.

64
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,640
That woman called A Ran

65
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,959
perhaps

66
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,209
could replace Sister A Nian as the Divine Maiden.

67
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,170
Then my Sister A Nian would be free.

68
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,440
So, General Xue,

69
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,159
I've done so much for my Sister A Nian,

70
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,280
what right do you have now

71
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,400
to discuss your marriage with me?

72
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,000
What can I do for A Nian?

73
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,720
In three days,

74
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,760
my Sister A Nian

75
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,370
will fully merge with the Divine Tree.

76
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,920
I need you to bring her out before that,

77
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,240
half a day will do.

78
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
Is it that simple?

79
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,680
Simple?

80
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,520
Yes, it's that simple.

81
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,720
As for how to make A Ran replace A Nian

82
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,760
to become the Divine Maiden,

83
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,840
I have my own ways.

84
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,880
Oh, right,

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,240
I should remind you,

86
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,040
once she becomes the Divine Maiden,

87
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,960
it means

88
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,440
she will lose human emotions.

89
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,800
However,

90
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,840
since you are

91
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,520
our Sister A Nian's beloved,

92
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,840
if you can't do it,

93
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,960
then

94
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,840
probably no one can.

95
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,320
Right, General Xue?

96
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,600
A Nian,

97
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,050
I brought you your favorite fruit.

98
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,530
Do you remember?

99
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,000
When you first met me,

100
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,780
this is what you gave me to eat.

101
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,120
You should go. You shouldn't have come.

102
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,010
What about this?

103
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,180
This should be useful, right?

104
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,260
As the Great General of the State,

105
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,659
instead of staying by the people's side,

106
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,500
why are you wasting time here?

107
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,840
In this world,

108
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,440
the most unsettled place is my own household.

109
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,600
My wife has run away.

110
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,810
What am I supposed to guard now?

111
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,120
Wherever you go, I'll follow.

112
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,840
I miss so much

113
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,170
the feeling of holding our little A'nian.

114
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,640
So fragrant and soft,

115
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,880
warm and adorable.

116
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,640
Xue Yiyang,

117
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,520
are you angry?

118
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,040
Are you angry?

119
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,960
Pei Ji told me

120
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,160
that you've lost your mortal emotions.

121
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,640
How could that be?

122
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,640
You still have feelings for me, don't you?

123
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,300
I can use the power of the divine tree to save you.

124
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,760
I can also hurt you again.

125
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,520
It's just a small injury.

126
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,760
My lady, you needn't worry about it.

127
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,690
I, your husband,

128
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,520
I, your husband, am in good health. I can take it.

129
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,960
In this world,

130
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,770
what couple doesn't have their quarrels?

131
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,160
I've made you angry.

132
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,960
I deserve to be punished, I deserve to be punished.

133
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,290
If you say one more word,

134
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,840
I'll immediately turn you back

135
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,720
to how you were before coming to Zhaoyao Mountain.

136
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,280
You must be so bored.

137
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,200
You've just married me.

138
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,920
I haven't even given you a good life yet.

139
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,040
Ah Nian,

140
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Since the day I became a goddess,

141
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,080
I am no longer Bu Nian.

142
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
my duty

143
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,360
is only to protect the people of Zhaoyao Mountain.

144
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,000
Time and emotions in this world

145
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,280
no longer have anything to do with me.

146
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,800
The person you're waiting for is not me.

147
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,600
Then you'll see

148
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,440
whether I can wait or not.

149
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,720
Thank you, Yi Yang.

150
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,080
Granny,

151
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,740
you went to pick fruits again.

152
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,640
Thank you.

153
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,360
Ah Bao,

154
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,520
Ah Niu,

155
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,880
you're slacking off and not fishing again, huh?

156
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,740
I'll go in a bit.

157
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,560
You try.

158
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,130
You lost, drink.

159
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,280
Lost again.

160
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:31,880
Your turn.

161
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,800
I'll drink it all.

162
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,130
You drink it all.

163
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,680
My lady, did you just smile?

164
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,960
Is there really no escape after all?

165
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,250
Have you found them?

166
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,360
No.

167
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,120
Have you found them?

168
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,800
No.

169
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,860
Young Lord,

170
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,040
we've been searching here for two days,

171
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,720
and we've scoured a ten-mile radius without finding anyone.

172
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,520
The weather is getting cold now.

173
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
Should we withdraw our troops?

174
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,170
Keep searching.

175
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,880
No one's going back today until we find them.

176
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,410
Yes, sir.

177
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,400
Continue the search.

178
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
Lu Li is gone.

179
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,880
You're leaving me too.

180
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,600
Do you really plan to leave me all alone?

181
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,760
You said you liked freedom,

182
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,770
yet now you're guarding this broken tree.

183
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,160
A'nian,

184
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,040
is this really what you want?

185
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,200
A'nian, I miss you so much.

186
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,650
What do you want?

187
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,080
As Bu Nian,

188
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,540
accompany me to Zhaoyao Mountain one more time.

189
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,740
And then you'll leave?

190
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,730
This character is pronounced 'jian'.

191
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,410
Are you tired from walking so long?

192
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,130
You know very well that pebbles can't hurt me.

193
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,500
Don't forget, you're Bu Nian now.

194
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,690
I can't let our A'nian get hurt.

195
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,060
What are we doing here?

196
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,040
I'm waiting.

197
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,840
to see if that Xue Yiyang

198
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,100
is really that important to Sister Nian,

199
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,280
important enough for her to give up her identity as a goddess.

200
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,240
Tell me,

201
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,880
if Bu Nian finds out we've all been deceiving her,

202
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
will she be angry?

203
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,010
I haven't deceived her.

204
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,100
It's Xue Yiyang who's deceiving her.

205
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,680
So you've had this all planned out from the beginning.

206
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,720
What about you?

207
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,440
After obtaining divine power,

208
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,770
what do you intend to do?

209
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,040
You'll find out soon enough.

210
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,170
When the time comes,

211
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,700
just take your Sister Nian and go.

212
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,280
Brother, look at that village.

213
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
How come we've never seen it before?

214
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,080
Don't talk nonsense.

215
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,880
Brother has been gathering herbs in these mountains for many years.

216
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,210
There are no villages in these mountains.

217
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,730
But there's clearly a village over there!

218
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,960
I can't dig it out.

219
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,920
Once the barrier of Zhaoyao Mountain disappears,

220
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,520
our people will be in danger.

221
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,120
You only have half an hour

222
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,880
to take over the divine tree in Bu Nian's place.

223
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,560
I've accompanied you on all the paths we were meant to walk together.

224
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
You should go now.

225
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,900
Can't you really come with me?

226
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,040
Yi Yang,

227
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,420
would you abandon your soldiers and live alone?

228
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,240
would that make you happy?

229
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,680
I understand. Well...

230
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,089
