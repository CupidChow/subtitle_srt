1
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,400
I'm sorry, Yi Yang.

2
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,520
I can't come to marry you.

3
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,940
Hurry up, hurry up.

4
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,560
Coming!

5
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,410
Put it there.

6
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,560
Thank you, Goddess, for your blessing.

7
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,730
My little brother's illness is cured.

8
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,640
General Xue, I want some wedding candy.

9
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,880
I want to save one for Sister A'nian.

10
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,079
Alright, good girl.

11
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,520
I can finally lay down the burden of being the Goddess.

12
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,640
But in the end, I still couldn't make it in time.

13
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,200
To see you for the last time in this life.

14
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,480
A century has passed, and the world has changed.

15
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,760
I only wish to continue our fate in the next life.

16
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,560
All things in the world are part of the cycle of destiny.

17
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,120
every moment

18
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,960
is an eternity of settled dust.

19
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,160
So this was the scene she had once seen.

20
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,120
I killed Xue Yiyang with my own hands.

21
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,800
You haven't slept for three days.

22
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,600
Get some rest.

23
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,120
When she returns,

24
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,840
I'll let you know immediately.

25
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,570
Any news from outside the city?

26
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,020
Don't worry about anything else for now.

27
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,839
Take care of yourself first.

28
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,370
The candle in the lantern has gone out.

29
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,560
Have someone replace it.

30
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,640
Otherwise, A Nian won't find her way home.

31
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,880
This branch seems to be withering a bit.

32
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,840
Migu.

33
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,560
Its brilliance shines in all directions, wear it and you won't get lost.

34
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,580
She had already told me where to find her.

35
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,480
Where?

36
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,600
Prepare the horses. We're going to Yaoyao Mountain.

37
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,480
General Xue,

38
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,600
the Empress Dowager's verbal decree:

39
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,130
General Xue is requested to have an audience tomorrow morning.

40
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,720
Is the Empress Dowager well?

41
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,760
Yiyang,

42
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,960
how do you think my flowers are growing?

43
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,960
With Your Majesty's daily attentive care,

44
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,280
they are naturally lush and in full bloom.

45
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,080
Appreciating flowers, appreciating flowers.

46
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,840
Everyone looks at the flowers.

47
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,680
It's a pity,

48
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,800
there are always some tactless branches that sprout out.

49
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,640
Since they are branches,

50
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,040
they should complement the flowers, shouldn't they?

51
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,720
Don't you agree?

52
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,860
Your Majesty is right.

53
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,400
You are a clever child.

54
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,240
When your parents were alive,

55
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,760
they always said you were foolish.

56
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,040
But in my opinion,

57
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,160
you are much smarter than that child Fu'er.

58
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,100
I wouldn't dare say so.

59
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,600
The young city lord is exceptionally talented.

60
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,530
He has inherited the city lord's wisdom and bravery.

61
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,960
I naturally cannot compare.

62
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,100
I would believe these words if they came from your mother's mouth.

63
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,080
But coming from you,

64
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,160
Xue Yiyang, with your sky-high ambitions,

65
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,880
do you even believe it yourself?

66
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,400
This child has grown up by my side since he was little.

67
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,200
Whether he has inherited his father's abilities,

68
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,960
I know better than you.

69
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,800
Your father and mother won so many battles.

70
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,360
To avoid overshadowing their superiors,

71
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,220
they voluntarily requested to guard the far north.

72
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,880
They are the heroes of our Fuzi City.

73
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,120
In the future, when Fu'er succeeds as the city lord,

74
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,250
you will assist him in the same way, won't you?

75
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,720
I will certainly do so, Your Majesty.

76
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,520
Good child, I believe you.

77
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,560
Then in the army, you will fight on behalf of Fu'er.

78
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,640
I'll consider this as you helping him.

79
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,400
However, others might misunderstand.

80
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,570
They might think you're trying to compete for the position of young city lord.

81
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,000
Yiyang,

82
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,530
this is a misunderstanding, isn't it?

83
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,180
It is a misunderstanding.

84
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,240
If it's a misunderstanding, then it needs to be clarified.

85
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,840
The young city lord is here in the palace,

86
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,080
punished by his father to copy the city chronicles a thousand times.

87
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,810
Since you will be his future assisting official,

88
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,320
shouldn't you be with your lord,

89
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,159
sharing his honor and disgrace?

90
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,940
Your Majesty is right.

91
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,160
Then I will express your stance for you.

92
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,280
Guards!

93
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

94
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,480
General Xue voluntarily requests twenty lashes

95
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,880
and to join the young city lord in the dungeon for punishment.

96
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,130
When will the young city lord come out?

97
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,650
General Xue will come out at the same time.

98
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,640
Yes.

99
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,720
Yes.

100
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,380
Young Lord.

101
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,440
Young Lord.

102
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,280
Get out.

103
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,160
I've always been bothered by something.

104
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,960
A year ago,

105
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,080
when you were beaten up by those serious offenders,

106
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,680
I didn't get to see you in such a splendid state.

107
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,080
Now that I have,

108
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,610
how does it feel?

109
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,400
The great General Xue,

110
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,120
how does it feel to be whipped?

111
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,480
Xue Fu.

112
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,920
Why do you always target me?

113
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,200
Who told you to always

114
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,100
outshine me in front of my father?

115
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,080
Don't you know?

116
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,800
This entire city is mine.

117
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,000
Mine.

118
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,760
Liu Ruofeng is also mine.

119
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,690
What right do you have to touch her?

120
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,280
I have never touched Liu Ruofeng.

121
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,800
I clearly saw it.

122
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,640
General Xue,

123
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,200
you recovered from such severe injuries back then.

124
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,560
Now, mere whip wounds

125
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,300
must be nothing to you, right?

126
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,840
Just tell me,

127
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,440
who exactly is Bu Nian?

128
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,160
Bu Nian is my wife.

129
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,280
Wife?

130
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,660
I don't care if you're married or not.

131
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,490
I just want you to tell me

132
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,040
what her background is.

133
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,440
Where is she?

134
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,040
I don't know.

135
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,570
As expected of General Xue.

136
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,800
Very well.

137
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,650
Our General Xue is thirsty.

138
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,120
Bring up some freshly boiled water.

139
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,720
Yes, sir.

140
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,840
I'll personally serve General Xue.

141
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,520
Xue Fu,

142
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,460
is this the extent of your abilities?

143
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,320
Very well.

144
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,880
There's a rumor among the people

145
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,040
that after butchers scald the skin with hot water,

146
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,840
they use this kind of iron brush.

147
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,440
It scrapes right to the bone.

148
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,700
General Xue, with your strong physique,

149
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,200
I wonder how long you can endure?

150
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,520
Miss, are you alright?

151
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,040
It's nothing.

152
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,300
I'm just feeling a bit uneasy.

153
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,080
Miss,

154
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,940
since you've been with child,

155
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,680
your mood seems to have improved quite a bit.

156
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,600
You haven't done embroidery for a long time.

157
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,400
In the past,

158
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,760
you would sigh while looking at your books one moment,

159
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,560
and then sigh while gazing out the window the next.

160
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,800
Is that so?

161
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,220
I've almost forgotten about those days.

162
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,690
Sister Nian,

163
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,800
I just approached the divine tree,

164
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,130
why didn't you sense it?

165
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,850
I don't know why either.

166
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,770
After the goddess left,

167
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,400
I feel that not all the power of the divine tree

168
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,880
has been transferred to me.

169
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,680
I can only sense some fragments.

170
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,280
Perhaps the divine tree hasn't fully accepted me yet.

171
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,080
No, that won't do.

172
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,130
You must inherit all the divine power of the tree.

173
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:16,940
Otherwise,

174
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,010
our people won't be able to live peacefully under your protection.

175
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,480
Alright, I understand.

176
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,600
This sachet is of no use to me anymore.

177
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,250
You can take it back.

178
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,480
Keep it.

179
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,610
As a memento.

180
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,200
My dear Sister Nian,

181
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,660
you've finally inherited the position of the goddess.

182
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,090
You can finally come out of the box.

183
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,680
Are you happy?

184
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,040
Once sister

185
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,760
has inherited all the divine power of the tree,

186
