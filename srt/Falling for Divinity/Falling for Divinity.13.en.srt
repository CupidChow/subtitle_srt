1
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,450
It's all set.

2
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,880
Xue Yiyang, oh Xue Yiyang.

3
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,960
Still trying to tip them off?

4
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,240
I'd say you're the one who can't escape now.

5
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,180
Young Lord,

6
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,100
it was my incompetence

7
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,200
that allowed Xue Yiyang to infiltrate our army.

8
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,330
I'll send men to arrest him right away.

9
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,100
No rush.

10
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,320
He's a grand general of the city,

11
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,840
who should be on standby within the city walls.

12
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,280
Leaving without orders,

13
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,600
he surely didn't bring any troops with him.

14
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,180
Since he wants to play,

15
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,020
let's play along with him.

16
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,650
That was exhilarating.

17
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,400
Feng'er, come here.

18
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,170
Congratulations on your great victory, A Fu.

19
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,320
Brothers,

20
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,320
Today was the young lord's first battle,

21
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,360
and he was so valiant.

22
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,240
It's truly a blessing for our Fuzi City.

23
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,700
I believe within ten days,

24
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,560
we will surely reclaim the territories occupied by Anqing City.

25
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,200
Then, we'll annihilate them all.

26
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,660
When we return to the city,

27
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,250
everyone will be rewarded.

28
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,600
Thank you, young lord.

29
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,580
Bu Nian, you deserve the most credit.

30
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,090
Young Lord, today is truly joyous.

31
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,840
I've heard that the Young Lord's wife is exceptionally talented.

32
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,560
I wonder if we could ask the Young Lord's wife to lead a drinking game.

33
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,290
That's fine.

34
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,200
Right.

35
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,260
Let the Young Lord's wife give us one.

36
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,960
Alright.

37
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,570
Since Captain Zhang wants to liven things up,

38
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,160
let's play a game.

39
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,329
But if I guess correctly twice,

40
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,320
Captain Zhang will have to leave behind a finger.

41
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:31,840
Three.

42
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,620
Three dots.

43
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,680
Just a coincidence.

44
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,280
Try again.

45
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,160
Best two out of three.

46
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,920
You've lost, Captain Zhang.

47
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,600
Guards!

48
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,840
Take him away.

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,040
Young Lord, please spare me!

50
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,440
Young Lord, Young Lord, please have mercy!

51
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:15,800
A Nian.

52
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,600
Yi Yang.

53
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,440
Bu Bu Guang Chen.

54
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,520
Only One in Mind.

55
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,690
Together Until Old Age.

56
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:54,040
So, I was the one who gave you the name Bu Nian.

57
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,980
You remember everything now.

58
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,720
How could I...

59
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,010
how could I ever forget you?

60
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,620
Didn't you want to know...

61
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,360
why I came back to you?

62
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,880
I'll tell you now.

63
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,980
Because Sister Goddess prophesied that you would die.

64
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,850
I wanted to save you.

65
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,320
But I didn't know...

66
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,450
which danger would actually kill you.

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,960
I was afraid.

68
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,680
I was afraid I couldn't save you.

69
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,480
Silly girl.

70
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,480
From the moment I stepped onto the battlefield,

71
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,280
I was prepared to die.

72
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
Not just me,

73
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,000
but all the soldiers too.

74
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,880
We live on the edge of death every day.

75
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,440
Whether the prophecy is true or not,

76
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,640
as long as you're by my side, that's all that matters.

77
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,560
But I don't want you to die.

78
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,040
I want you to live well.

79
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,680
Don't worry.

80
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,440
take good care of yourself and recover.

81
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,160
I won't die.

82
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,580
I will take you away from here safely.

83
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,840
It's just a prophecy.

84
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,810
if we truly believe in fate,

85
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,200
what's the point of living?

86
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,040
Alright, I'll wait for you.

87
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,540
We'll leave together.

88
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,480
Slow down.

89
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,740
Why are there so many wounded lately?

90
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,500
Is it because we're running low on supplies?

91
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,400
I think so too.

92
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,159
You work for the young lord.

93
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,740
Could you perhaps put in a word for us?

94
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Our Nian is already in a precarious position herself.

95
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,500
What more do you want her to do?

96
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,220
Naturally, to help purchase some supplies.

97
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,400
We can't even eat our fill.

98
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,520
How are we supposed to fight?

99
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,920
Purchase supplies?

100
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,159
When the soldiers take me out,

101
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,400
to purchase supplies,

102
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,400
I'll just buy extra and bring it back.

103
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,880
Why trouble my Nian?

104
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,720
Doctor! Doctor!

105
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,410
He's severely wounded.

106
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,120
Over here.

107
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,440
I heard these wounded have deep injuries.

108
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,560
They'll all die without supplies.

109
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,760
Dr. Pei, you'd better hurry.

110
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,520
The young lord has issued an order.

111
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,360
There's a rebellious rumor-monger among the new recruits.

112
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,290
I hear he's hiding among you three.

113
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,920
Guards, seize them!

114
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,690
Yes, sir.

115
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,360
I didn't spread any rumors!

116
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,720
The young lord must be mistaken.

117
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,600
It wasn't me!

118
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,200
Speak up!

119
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,760
Beat them!

120
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,680
Beat them until they confess!

121
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,740
Go ahead, beat me to death if you dare!

122
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,040
You guys...

123
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,480
If you want to blame someone, blame this man.

124
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,360
Xue Yiyang.

125
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,340
Our great General Xue.

126
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,560
So you've recognized me all along.

127
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,040
So you're not a spy after all.

128
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,200
You're the illustrious General Xue.

129
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,840
In this life, I've had the honor of grooming horses with General Xue.

130
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,170
and called him brother.

131
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,360
It was worth it.

132
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,100
You still show no remorse.

133
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,380
Beat them to death!

134
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,280
Release them!

135
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,880
They've done nothing wrong!

136
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,160
Fellow soldiers,

137
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,610
watch carefully

138
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,730
what happens to those who spread rumors and slander in the army.

139
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,760
Yiyang!

140
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,440
Ah Nian!

141
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,400
Take this.

142
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,840
Otherwise, I'll burn him alive.

143
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,640
No, I don't want to!

144
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,320
Let go!

145
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,880
Yiyang!

146
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,240
I'm sorry, Yiyang.

147
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,360
I'm alright, Ah Nian.

148
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,520
Let me go!

149
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,560
Release me!

150
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,360
Don't forget,

151
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,480
in his eyes,

152
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,090
you're nothing but a substitute for Liu Ruofeng.

153
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,320
Guards!

154
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,010
Yes, sir!

155
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,500
The dagger.

156
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,240
No!

157
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,160
Xue Fu, don't hurt him!

158
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,220
Please, don't!

159
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,560
Yiyang!

160
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,160
I'm so sorry,

161
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,740
it seems I've aggravated your old wound.

162
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,200
Why don't we try something more exciting?

163
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,320
Guards!

164
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,080
Bring the bow and arrow.

165
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,610
Yes, sir.

166
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,200
Let me go!

167
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,130
Are you alright?

168
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,610
I thought you didn't want to see me.

169
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,640
Yi Yang,

170
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,610
I don't care if I'm a substitute for someone else.

171
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,600
I just want to be with you.

172
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,440
Silly.

173
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,010
How could you be a substitute for anyone else?

174
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,210
The person I, Xue Yi Yang, have chosen,

175
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,600
will never change in this lifetime.

176
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,010
Since the prophecy cannot be changed,

177
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,160
at least

178
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,080
I can stay by your side.

179
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,360
A'nian.

180
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,370
Where is the Young Lord?

181
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,480
Delivering the Lord's verbal order.

182
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,400
General Xue is acting on the Lord's orders

183
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,680
to secretly investigate the withholding of military rations and pay.

184
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,880
The Lord now has evidence

185
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,280
revealing that the mastermind is a confidant of the Young Lord.

186
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,920
The Young Lord has failed in his supervision

187
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,240
and is guilty of dereliction of duty.

188
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,960
The Young Lord is now ordered to hand over his command token to General Xue

189

191

General Xue.

194
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,440
Attention, all officers and soldiers!

195
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,840
I swear not to return to the city until Qing'an's rebellion is quelled.

196
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,760
Understood, understood.

197
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,080

198
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,480

you'll always stand in my way, right?

Fine.

203
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,490
Since you're forcing me like this,

204
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,620
we might as well go down together.

205
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,360

206
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,680

Are you sure you've investigated thoroughly?

208
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,200
Yes, I have confirmed that

209
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,040
Xue Yiyang has been

210
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,960

Many can testify to this.

212
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,690
He is in good health.

213
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,060
Where has Xue Yiyang been this past year?

214
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,480
The place where this woman comes from,

215
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,540
how can it possess such divine power?

216
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,490
If I could harness all the divine power of this place,

217
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,320
she, mere Bu Nian,

218
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,960
