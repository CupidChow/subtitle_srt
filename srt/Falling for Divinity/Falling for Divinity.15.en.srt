1
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,250
Alright.

2
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,080
Yiyang, it's fortunate that you're skilled in this rubbing technique.

3
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,800
otherwise, if the teacher finds out

4
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,000
that my cat ruined his precious book collection,

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,360
he'll surely punish me by making me copy books.

6
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,090
You've got ink on your clothes.

7
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,080
Where?

8
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,280
Oh no.

9
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,160
Mother will definitely interrogate me when I get back.

10
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,020
Let me help you.

11
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,760
On my wedding night with A Fu,

12
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,840
A Fu saw

13
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,680
half a line of poetry in my dowry:

14
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,979
'Love threads sway on branches.'

15
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,530
He mistakenly thought the person I liked was Xue Yiyang.

16
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,080
You've tucked this line of poetry into all the books in your dowry.

17
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,210
You've never truly loved me, have you?

18
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,840
I haven't.

19
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,479
You're still lying to me.

20
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,039
Then how do you explain

21
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,440
that you were not a virgin on our wedding night?

22
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,160
I clearly saw

23
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,890
you and Xue Yiyang engaging in illicit behavior.

24
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,690
Liu Ruofeng.

25
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,540
Enjoy your newlywed bliss while you can.

26
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,000
I will make sure you never know peace for the rest of your life.

27
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,160
There was no blood on our wedding night.

28
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,280
Since then,

29
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,280
he has suspected me of having an affair with Xue Yiyang at every turn.

30
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,360
He allows those women to come and go from his room

31
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,480
all to punish me.

32
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,280
This Xue Fu,

33
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,360
not all women

34
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,020
bleed on their wedding night.

35
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,000
Let's not even mention how shallow he is.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,600
If he truly

37
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,130
loved you as much as you say,

38
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,600
how could he make such a big deal out of this?

39
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,520
Doctor Pei, is everything you're saying true?

40
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,200
Could you please tell the young master

41
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,120
to stop giving my lady a hard time?

42
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,720
But

43
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,720
he might not believe what we say.

44
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,280
Fu only believes what he wants to believe.

45
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,010
Alright,

46
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,960
I'll prescribe you some medicine to regulate your body.

47
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,960
After you go back,

48
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,160
remind your lady to remember

49
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,370
not to move around too much these days.

50
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,040
Also,

51
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,280
if you really want to keep the child in your womb,

52
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,079
I'm afraid you'll have to endure a lot of hardship.

53
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,520
Moreover, in the end,

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,250
you might not be able to keep it.

55
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,250
No matter how much I suffer,

56
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,540
I must keep this child.

57
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,600
Bu Nian.

58
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,800
You and Yi Yang are the ones who truly understand each other.

59
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,060
You two must take good care of each other.

60
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,960
Actually,

61
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,160
Yi Yang and I were once married.

62
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,640
Yi Yang said

63
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,640
he wants to be with me in Fu Zi City

64
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,160
and follow the customs of Fu Zi City

65
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,160
to marry again.

66
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,960
That's not possible.

67
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,640
Sister Nian, I forgot to tell you

68
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,960
The herbs for this sachet are running out.

69
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,680
if we don't replenish them in time,

70
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,480
you'll die.

71
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,280
Sister Nian,

72
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,810
It hurts so much.

73
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,200
We need to hurry.

74
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,280
Sister Nian,

75
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,560
Nian!

76
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,400
You... why are you here?

77
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,280
Nian came to you to change her sachet.

78
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,320
Why did she suddenly collapse?

79
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,980
Let go of me.

80
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,640
The sachet I gave to sister

81
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,159
is just a temporary solution.

82
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,420
To cure it completely,

83
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,680
we still need one more ingredient.

84
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,680
What ingredient?

85
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,159
Flesh.

86
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,480
No!

87
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,960
Yiyang, don't!

88
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,440
Cut mine.

89
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,080
No!

90
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,320
Yiyang, don't!

91
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,480
What a touching display of marital devotion.

92
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,520
I was just joking.

93
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,160
At a time like this,

94
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,690
how can you make such jokes?

95
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,920
The herbs for that sachet have run out.

96
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,520
Only Mount Zhaoyao has them.

97
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,900
Sister needs to come back with me.

98
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,420
Can't you go back first

99
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,960
and bring them back after you've replaced them?

100
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,220
That would be too late.

101
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,440
Unless General Xue wants a ghost marriage.

102
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,440
You're willing to cut your own flesh,

103
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,970
but you won't let her return to Mount Zhaoyao?

104
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,840
Nian once said

105
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,240
that the entrance to Mount Zhaoyao

106
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,840
can only be found by people from Mount Zhaoyao.

107
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,050
If you take her back,

108
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,210
unless she comes out on her own,

109
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,480
I'll never be able to find her again.

110
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,960
Yiyang, don't worry.

111
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,280
I will definitely come back.

112
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,680
I've finally found you after so much effort.

113
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,240
I will surely come back to marry you properly.

114
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,240
Silly.

115
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,320
I'm the one who will marry you properly.

116
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,659
You are to marry me.

117
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,520
Let's leave right away.

118
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,650
I'll have someone prepare the horses.

119
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,000
Pei Ji, what's in the box?

120
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,520
It's just some

121
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,650
things I'm bringing for Sister A Zhao.

122
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,159
For A Zhao?

123
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,800
It must be something fun, right?

124
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,680
I want to see too.

125
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,159
No.

126
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,360
I mean,

127
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,850
the things in the box

128
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,960
can only be opened when we reach Zhaoyao Mountain.

129
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,280
Alright then.

130
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,280
The direction doesn't seem right, does it?

131
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,000
Is that so?

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,640
But isn't the Migu branch pointing this way?

133
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,600
But

134
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,800
when we left the mountain,

135
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,460
A Zhao gave me her Migu branch.

136
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,960
It should be correct.

137
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,840
It's clearly pointing that way.

138
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
How could your Migu branch be wrong?

139
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,320
It's enough for two days.

140
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,850
I'm back.

141
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,360
Let's go back for dinner. Hurry up.

142
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,800
Okay.

143
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,360
A Zhao, is that you?

144
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,640
How boring.

145
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,480
Why don't you guess someone else?

146
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,540
Who told you to always play this trick since childhood?

147
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,560
You little rascal.

148
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,580
So you still know how to come back.

149
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,840
Sister, I'm so hungry.

150
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,480
Is there any food left at home?

151
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,120
Bring it out quickly.

152
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,680
Let me eat with Sister A Nian.

153
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,520
Eat, eat, eat. All you know is eating.

154
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,200
As soon as you're back, you start bossing your sister around.

155
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,120
I'm hungry.

156
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,800
Oh, right.

157
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,240
A Nian, have you gone mad?

158
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,840
You actually made a wish to the sacred tree for Xue Yiyang?

159
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,600
Do you know?

160
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,840
You'll have to be like a Bodhisattva,

161
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,799
protecting us for your entire life.

162
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,679
I know.

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,960
You need to leave now.

164
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,620
Pei Ji, take her away quickly.

165
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,400
It's useless, A Zhao.

166
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,080
If I don't keep my vow,

167
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,400
to protect the sacred tree,

168
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,720
our people will face a catastrophe.

169
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,360
Have you forgotten?

170
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,800
What catastrophe?

171
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,840
All of us

172
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,400
have long been tired of staying in this boring place.

173
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,640
Worst case, we'll all move away together.

174
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
There are so many of us.

175
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,960
We could even burn down the tree if we have to.

176
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,240
Our ancestors, in order to let our people

177
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,880
seek refuge during times of war,

178
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,360
finally found this

179
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,560
peaceful sanctuary.

180
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,000
How could I, for my own sake,

181
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,930
disregard the lives of our people?

182
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,720
A Nian, I'm not as noble as you.

183
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,040
Do you know?

184
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,280
If you inherit the role of the divine maiden,

185
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,810
you'll never be free again.

186
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,240
Sister A Nian, don't worry.

187
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,920
After you inherit the divine power,

188
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,780
I have my own way

189
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,000
to free you from the fate of being bound to the sacred tree for life.

190
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,730
A new sachet.

191
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,440
Thank you.

192
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,240
Divine Sister.

193
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,930
Goddess Sister,

194
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,600
Nian, it's about to snow.

195
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,680
No.

196
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,680
I haven't helped Yi Yang overcome his great calamity yet.

197
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,640
Sister, tell me,

198
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,570
Yi Yang's death crisis,

199
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,240
is it beneath the city wall?

200
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,360
So what if it is?

201
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,840
Nian, are you planning to break your promise

202
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,000
and disregard the lives of your people?

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,040
You should know

204
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,330
what happens when you break the sacred tree oath.

205
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,960
But I haven't said goodbye to him yet.

206
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:19,880
Nian,

207
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,600
every parting between people could be the final farewell.

208
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,240
You'll understand when you become the Goddess.

209
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,420
Even the Goddess has moments of powerlessness.

210
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,440
Then what about the

211
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,640
great calamity you foresaw for our people?

212
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,570
Is there no hope for Yi Yang either?

213
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,660
But if that's really the case,

214
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,480
why did you ask Pei Ji

215
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,410
to find a way to break the calamity?

216
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,160
And why did you ask me to go back and save Yi Yang?

217
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,760
Pei Ji left the mountain on his own accord.

218
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,480
As for that outsider,

219
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,140
it's you who won't give up.

220
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,760
Leaving the mountain without permission

221
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,160
will result in memories being erased by the divine tree.

222
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,490
Even the Migu branch can't bring him back.

223
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,800
How is that possible?

224
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,080
He clearly remembers us.

225
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,320
A'nian, A'zhao.

226
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,060
And Zhaoyao Mountain.

227
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,120
I won't forget you.

228
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,200
So,

229
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,280
Pei Ji has been reminiscing every day,

230
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,940
about everything related to Zhaoyao Mountain.

231
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,880
Divine Sister,

232
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,840
what will happen to you after I succeed?

233
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,820
I'll go where I should have gone long ago.

234
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,880
Back then,

235
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,650
what exactly was the reason

236
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,660
you made a wish to the divine tree?

237
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,000
Pei Ji.

238
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,800
Sister A'nian,

239
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,330
you're drying herbs again.

240
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,000
I still remember when we were little,

241
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,280
we would go to each clan member's house every day

242
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,640
to bring them fruits to eat.

243
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,320
Yes.

244
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,320
When we were young, we had no parents.

245
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,200
We grew up on the kindness of others.

246
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,040
if it wasn't an old lady mending our pants,

247
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,840
it was an uncle fixing our house.

248
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,840
Back then, Sister Azhao always used to say something.

249
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,040
We should remember people's kindness.

250
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,520
At that time, I always thought

251
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,680
that the three of us could stay together forever.

252
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,720
My silly little brother,

253
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,640
your sister and I have to grow up.

254
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,680
We both have to get married.

255
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,160
You'll marry someone else too.

256
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,690
How could we possibly stay together forever?

257
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,410
Then why don't I just marry you?

258
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,200
So that's why you've been wearing the Migu branch all this time.

259
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,400
That's what it meant.

260
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,360
Pei Ji, you should leave.

261
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,560
Leave Zhaoyao Mountain.

262
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,820
Forget about all of us.

263
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,760
If you leave,

264
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,960
that prophecy about you,

265
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,960
maybe it won't come true.

266
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,480
If Xue Yiyang were standing here,

267
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,560
would you say the same thing to him?

268
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,440
I.

269
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
I think A Zhao is right.

270
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,160
You really don't need to sacrifice yourself for these people,

271
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,560
and sacrifice yourself.

272
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,210
But all of this happened because of me.

273
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,680
It should also be ended by me.
