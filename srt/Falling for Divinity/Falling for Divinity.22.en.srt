1
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,280
What are you going to do?

2
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,720
Didn't Pei Ji tell you?

3
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,760
Our hearts and fates are bound together.

4
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,720
If I die,

5
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,160
you won't survive alone either.

6
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,090
Put down your sword.

7
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,500
I won't kill him, alright?

8
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,260
You always say everyone is using you,

9
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,570
but aren't you using everyone as well?

10
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,440
Back then,

11
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,160
wasn't it to make Yi Yang take you into his household

12
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,220
so you could escape Xue Fu's control?

13
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,240
You knew very well

14
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,200
that the Goddess couldn't leave Zhaoyao Mountain,

15
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,760
yet you pretended to agree with Pei Ji

16
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,680
to succeed as the Goddess in exchange for my freedom.

17
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,720
In reality, you were taking away the power of the Divine Tree,

18
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,280
putting your people and Zhaoyao Mountain in danger.

19
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,080
How do you know

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,120
the power of the Divine Tree

21
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,180
depends on how its possessor uses it?

22
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,960
If you love everyone,

23
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,890
their faces will appear before your eyes.

24
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,700
If you love one person,

25
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,490
you can sense their danger.

26
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,300
If you hate people,

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,460
it will only become a sharp sword.

28
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,120
That's enough.

29
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,320
Stop it, Qiao An.

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,440
My fate has been like that of an ant,

31
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,060
trampled under everyone's feet.

32
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,120
Now that I finally

33
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,380
have the power to control others' fates,

34
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,919
what makes you think I would stop?

35
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,340
If that's the case,

36
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,520
I won't allow you to harm innocent people anymore.

37
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:27,880
Bu Nian.

38
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,480
Your people have already died in

39
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,960
the power struggle between Xue Yi Yang and Xue Fu.

40
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,960
You're just a pawn in their game.

41
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,140
All living beings.

42
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,160
Our people.

43
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,240
I'll show you

44
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,640
how ridiculous the so-called love of the Goddess is.

45
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,000
No, no!

46
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,560
Don't!

47
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,160
Yi Yang!

48
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,440
Yi Yang!

49
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,800
Yi Yang!

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,800
Don't!

51
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,960
A Nian.

52
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,440
Don't cry.

53
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,360
I thought

54
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:20,200
you had at least some affection for me.

55
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,400
From beginning to end,

56
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,040
everything I've done

57
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,800
has been for Bu Nian.

58
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,640
Yi Yang.

59
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,120
The young lord's consort is missing.

60
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,180
the young lord's consort is missing.

61
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,200
Useless!

62
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,440
How could Feng'er's body just disappear?

63
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,040
This servant doesn't know either.

64
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,500
when I... when I came back,

65
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,080
the young lord's consort's body...

66
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,040
no, her body was already gone.

67
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,920
Send people to search for her.

68
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,040
And the people from Zhaoyao Mountain,

69
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,600
where are those lowly peasants?

70
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't believe they only have one goddess.

71
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,040
There must be someone else who can resurrect my Feng'er.

72
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,880
Young Master,

73
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,260
they were sold to the mines by slave traders.

74
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,800
Yi Yang.

75
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,800
We're home.

76
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,400
Spring Festival is coming in a few days.

77
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,600
You always said those days would be very lively.

78
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,120
If only you could take me to see it.

79
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,800
I still remember you promised me

80
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,330
that we would get married in Fuzi City.

81
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,500
How could you break your promise?

82
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,000
If we had gotten married in Fuzi City,

83
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,040
if we had a baby,

84
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,320
we could build so many treehouses.

85
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,000
Everything in this world

86
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,240
would have nothing to do with us.

87
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,120
Yi Yang, I miss you so much.

88
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,280
I really miss you.

89
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,600
A'nian.

90
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,840
A'nian.

91
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,280
A'nian.

92
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,940
I am the Migu Tree, guardian of Zhaoyao Mountain for generations.

93
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,740
Now our people are in trouble.

94
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,200
They need you.

95
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,280
But what can I do?

96
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,760
I brought all this to Zhaoyao Mountain.

97
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,330
If it weren't for me,

98
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,050
our people wouldn't have suffered these disasters.

99
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,760
All the goddesses throughout history

100
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,720
eventually fall in love with someone

101
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,680
and end up loving all people.

102
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,440
The goddess doesn't bring disaster to her people,

103
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,360
but after experiencing all this,

104
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,400
she can understand what true freedom is.

105
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,080
I will give you my last divine power.

106
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,280
But you will pay a price for it.

107
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,720
As for whether to save your people

108
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,320
or the one you love,

109
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,200
it's up to you to choose.

110
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,240
What's the price?

111
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,200
Yi Yang.

112
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,960
A'nian.

113
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,040
How are you doing?

114
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,560
I'm fine now.

115
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,700
Xue Fu has captured my people.

116
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,960
Let's go rescue them.

117
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,140
Where are they?

118
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,560
I'll go with you.

119
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,200
It turns out Pei Ji and A Ran deceived me.

120
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,240
My people are suffering.

121
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,040
It wasn't Yi Yang who ordered it.

122
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,840
At the mine.

123
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,930
But before that, I need to go somewhere first.

124
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,120
Sister Nian,

125
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,480
you've finally agreed to see me.

126
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,700
You owe me an explanation.

127
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,100
Things are exactly as you know them to be.

128
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,650
Do I really need to say it again myself?

129
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,810
You never asked for my opinion.

130
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,280
you used secret techniques to create A Ran.

131
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,240
You put our people in danger.

132
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,170
You made me misunderstand Yi Yang.

133
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,960
Your sister A Zhao,

134
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,280
Lu Li,

135
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,440
and even A Ran,

136
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,500
all died in this disaster.

137
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,440
Pei Ji, is this what you wanted?

138
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,800
What I wanted,

139
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,360
has always been only you.

140
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,480
You're no longer the Pei Ji I knew.

141
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,080
But, but now you're...

142
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
You're free now, aren't you?

143
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,440
What about A Zhao?

144
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,340
What about our people?

145
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,480
If you still feel any guilt towards our people,

146
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,060
then promise me one thing.

147
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,800
Alright, whatever you say,

148
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,360
I'll promise you.

149
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,000
Come here.

150
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,320
Sister Nian,

151
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,360
after I help you with this,

152
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,930
will you never see me again?
