1
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,280
Yiyang, you said you wanted chicken soup.

2
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,120
so I brought you some.

3
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,480
The dead cannot be brought back to life.

4
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,480
Don't be sad anymore.

5
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,600
How is it?

6
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,480
Is the chicken soup good?

7
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,240
It's good, very good.

8
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,760
Yiyang.

9
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,280
Why are there two coffins in this room?

10
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,080
Who is this one prepared for?

11
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,680
You, and...

12
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,140
For you.

13
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:21,160
Yiyang, why don't you believe me?

14
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,440
I've already told you.

15
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,770
He took advantage of me.

16
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,480
You're not Anian.

17
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,610
Lu Li wouldn't do such a thing to me either.

18
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,920
Look at me.

19
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
How am I not Anian?

20
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,480
Lu Li, Lu Li is a man.

21
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,960
He can also have moments of confusion.

22
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,480
Shut up.

23
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,930
Don't say such things to me with Anian's face.

24
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,320
Where is Anian?

25
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,640
Who sent you?

26
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,290
My patience is limited.

27
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,020
Don't make me say it twice.

28
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,680
Yiyang.

29
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,440
I really am Bu Nian.

30
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,440
You're lying.

31
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,640
Yi Yang.

32
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,240
Yi Yang, I really am A Nian.

33
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,500
Believe me.

34
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,760
Let me out.

35
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,600
let me out.

36
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,920
Yi Yang.

37
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,960
Why?

38
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,200
The chicken soup you made was too delicious.

39
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,159
unfortunately,

40
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,960
A Nian doesn't know how to make chicken soup.

41
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,690
A Nian also wouldn't kill Lu Li.

42
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,800
Please, General, don't kill me.

43
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,530
Pei Ji sent me to deliver a message.

44
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,440
Bu Nian is now on Zhaoyao Mountain.

45
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,440
She's in danger.

46
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,860
If you let me go,

47
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,760
I'll take you to find her.

48
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,840
Without me,

49
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,000
you won't be able to find Zhaoyao Mountain.

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,200
What danger is she in?

51
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,560
Those tribespeople

52
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,980
forcibly kept her at the Divine Tree in Migu Valley.

53
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,760
They're forcing her to become the Divine Maiden.

54
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,400
So Bu Nian will never be able to leave in this lifetime.

55
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,080
Why?

56
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,280
Didn't Pei Ji accompany her back to gather herbs?

57
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,409
Because Bu Nian has made a contract with the Divine Tree.

58
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,400
Pei Ji wants me to become the Divine Maiden in place of Bu Nian.

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,480
If I don't go back,

60
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,020
Bu Nian won't be able to leave.

61
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,410
You'd better not be lying to me.

62
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,440
Otherwise, I'll have you torn to pieces.

63
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,800
I'm not.

64
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,000
Grandfather, hurry!

65
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,420
The future.

66
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,940
Our people will truly die at the hands of Yi Yang.

67
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,080
No, it can't be.

68
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,200
Young Lord, the Young Lady has just become pregnant.

69
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,360
Isn't it a bit early to prepare these things now?

70
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,000
Early? It's not early at all.

71
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,770
My child, Xue Fu's child, will have only the best from birth.

72
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,530
This one will do.

73
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,040
Please deliver this to her for me.

74
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,570
Yes, sir.

75
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:16,680
Wait.

76
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Wait until she's willing to talk to me.

77
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,720
Then I'll deliver it to her personally.

78
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,880
Have someone buy more apricot blossom pastries.

79
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,840
She loves the ones from Zhu's shop the most.

80
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,570
The Young Lord cares so deeply for the Young Lady.

81
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,560
Surely, the future young master...

82
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,620
will also be a heaven-sent treasure.

83
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,640
Whether it's a son or a daughter,

84
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,000
as long as it's mine and Feng'er's child, it's all good.

85
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,659
Young Lord,

86
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,280
the Lady says she wants to go to the temple to pray for blessings.

87
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:42,880
Let her go.

88
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,250
It's probably to pray for the child's safety.

89
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,920
Order more men to be sent.

90
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,780
Protect the Young Lady secretly.

91
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,300
If she gets hurt in any way,

92
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,480
none of you should even think about coming back.

93
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,409
Yes, sir. I'll see to it right away.

94
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,560
Young Lord,

95
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,520
Young Lord.

96
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,320
Today, the Lady went to pray for blessings.

97
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,960
everything was fine at first.

98
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,960
but then Lin'er said that the Lady...

99
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,360
The Lady has been poisoned.

100
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,400
By the time I arrived,

101
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,659
the Lady had already stopped breathing.

102
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,480
Young Lord.

103
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,360
So you don't like these.

104
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,770
If they're burned, so be it.

105
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,580
We can always buy more.

106
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,000
Look,

107
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,930
this is the longevity lock I bought for our child.

108
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,400
I know I was wrong.

109
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,260
Please, open your eyes and look at me.

110
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,490
I know you're still angry with me, aren't you?

111
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,440
Look at me, look at me.

112
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,600
So even in death,

113
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,900
you're still thinking of him.

114
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,360
A Fu, I already know.

115
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,920
You've learned about the existence of this child.

116
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,640
But I don't want,

117
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,570
nor do I wish for him to suffer everything I've been through.

118
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,040
When I was young,

119
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,500
I once rejoiced that the person I married was the one I desired.

120
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,720
I also once vowed a deep love like that of mandarin ducks,

121
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,720
to be of one heart, fulfilling the wishes of this life.

122
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,360
But I never thought that after five years of marriage,

123
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,690
our hearts and natures would be worn down to nothing.

124
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,530
I also cannot untie the knot in your heart.

125
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,240
Our fate has come to an end.

126
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,720
The flowing river parts us forever.

127
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,680
May we never meet again in the next life.

128
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,120
Feng'er, don't leave me alone.

129
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,400
I know I was wrong.

130
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,040
I'm begging you.

131
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,280
Don't leave me, please don't.

132
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,480
I know, I know I was wrong.

133
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,400
Feng'er.

134
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,200
Guards!

135
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,730
Prepare the horses.

136
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,800
Young Lord.

137
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,730
When will the lady's body be placed in the coffin?

138
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,280
Young Lord, this servant has spoken out of turn.

139
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,540
My Feng'er is not dead.

140
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,920
Even Xue Yiyang could be resurrected.

141
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,980
Why can't my Feng'er be brought back?

142
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,120
Tell me, where is Xue Yiyang?

143
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,360
Reporting to the Young Lord,

144
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,090
General Xue early this morning

145
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,620
left the city with Bu Nian.

146
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,000
Go after them!

147
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,730
Yes, sir.

148
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,560
Go after them!

149
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,440
Young Lord.

150
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,460
Kneel down.

151
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,080
Stop.

152
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,280
Go.

153
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,800
Only people from Zhaoyao Mountain can find the entrance.

154
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,660
What use is the Migu branch to you?

155
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,400
Let me go.

156
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,520
I have Bu Nian's divine thread on me.

157
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,920
I can enter the mountain.

158
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,080
Found it.

159
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,760
This is the place.

160
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,010
What's that?

161
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,080
How did it disappear?

162
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,280
Where did it go?

163
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,680
Where is she? Where is she?

164
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,380
She was just ahead.

165
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,680
You're back.

166
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,520
Aran.

167
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,290
I want the antidote.

168
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,120
You've regained consciousness so quickly.

169
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,000
It seems you'll soon be able to replace Sister Nian.

170
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,520
Becoming the divine maiden.

171
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,560
I am not Bu Nian.

172
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,960
Nor am I Aran.

173
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,690
Not only have I regained my senses,

174
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,220
I also remember my enemies from my past life.

175
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,060
I will make sure they all meet a terrible end.

176
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,920
I carefully created you.

177
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,920
It wasn't for you to seek personal revenge.

178
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,960
Don't worry.

179
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,600
I will fulfill your task of replacing Bu Nian.

180
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,400
After all, what I want to accomplish

181
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,760
also requires the power of the divine tree.

182
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,440
We each take what we need.

183
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,960
If that's the case, then it's for the best.

184
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,120
Nian.

185
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,200
