1
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,880
Is anyone there?

2
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,080
Where did this woman come from?

3
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,360
Excuse me, is anyone here?

4
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,280
Boss.

5
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,730
This woman actually has gray eyes.

6
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,010
And she's blind.

7
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,740
When I used to come up the mountain to chop firewood,

8
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,770
I often came to this hut to rest.

9
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,520
I didn't expect anyone to be here today.

10
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,840
I'm sorry to have disturbed you all.

11
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,440
Don't be afraid, young lady.

12
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,800
We are prison guards.

13
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,400
We're passing through with some serious criminals.

14
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,460
The boys are just taking a break here.

15
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,560
Boss.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,240
Why are we hiding our identities?

17
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,500
Can't we just kill her?

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,039
But she's quite pretty.

19
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,300
Why don't we let the boys have some fun first?

20
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,240
Watch your mouth.

21
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:56,360
The boss's late sister was also blind.

22
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,800
It's getting late today.

23
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,400
Gentlemen,

24
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,520
why don't you have dinner and rest early?

25
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,160
You can continue your journey tomorrow.

26
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,960
I've just chopped some firewood.

27
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,320
I can use this firewood

28
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,460
to roast some meat for you gentlemen.

29
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,480
How did you know it's already dark?

30
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,540
Yiyang, watch out!

31
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,010
You knew you'd get hurt.

32
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,920
Why did you still use your foresight to save me?

33
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,850
I couldn't just watch you get hurt.

34
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,520
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

35
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,360
Yiyang, run!

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,260
Come on!

37
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
Strange.

38
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,760
Why did those people shoot them?

39
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,600
Could it be that they have too many enemies?

40
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,300
The young city lord sent them.

41
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,160
Including these people pretending to be bandits.

42
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,680
It was also to lure me here.

43
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,280
He used me to kill people.

44
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,240
To amplify their hatred.

45
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,240
I know.

46
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,960
Why don't you suspect me?

47
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,720
I believe in you.

48
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,880
Someone once said,

49
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,640
a person will never change.

50
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,480
Even if they forget everything,

51
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,760
when faced with the same choice,

52
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,260
they will still have only one answer.

53
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,060
What about you?

54
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,200
You clearly knew it was a trap.

55
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,460
Why did you still come?

56
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,360
I went to the military camp earlier to find Guard Lu.

57
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,600
to ask him to save you.

58
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,680
But he...

59
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,200
Hide in the shadows, fearing the enemy,

60
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,080
or strike a fatal blow to eliminate future troubles?

61
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,140
I would certainly choose the latter.

62
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,100
Lu Li was right not to come.

63
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,240
Because I told him to do so.

64
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,200
Everything has been taken care of.

65
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,080
the people we sent out

66
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,400
have all been silenced.

67
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,640
General Xue and that girl called Bu Nian

68
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,740
have also escaped.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,730
That's good.

70
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,880
This time, Yi Yang

71
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,920
won't fall for the young city lord's scheme again.

72
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,380
He must have a backup plan.

73
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,400
If Yi Yang finds out about the young city lord's weakness,

74
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,460
The city lord will surely be furious.

75
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,760
Have you investigated thoroughly?

76
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,840
Does that woman really have the ability to foresee the future?

77
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,240
I witnessed it with my own eyes.

78
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,970
She can predict life and death.

79
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,360
She even knows when the arrow will be shot,

80
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,520
and where it will hit.

81
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,360
She calculates everything with precision.

82
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,240
No wonder Xue Yiyang

83
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,880
is so attentive to this woman of unknown origin.

84
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,080
He's so concerned about her.

85
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,360
So she's a witch who practices sorcery.

86
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,960
The people sent by the lady

87
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,160
were actually there to save Xue Yiyang.

88
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,290
Pass down the order.

89
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,560
The young city lord's consort is sweating from the heat.

90
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,480
Prepare a bucket of ice water for her bath.

91
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,810
The colder, the better.

92
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,300
She's not allowed to come out until dawn.

93
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,720
Since she's so eager to save Xue Yiyang,

94
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
I want to see

95
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,020
if Xue Yiyang can actually come to save Feng'er.

96
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,560
Young Lord.

97
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,400
The Young Lord's wife has been in the ice bucket

98
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,840
soaking for an entire night.

99
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,280
Her health is already poor.

100
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,940
Please, I beg you to spare her.

101
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,600
Take her away.

102
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,600
Go, get out.

103
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,760
Please, Young Lord, I beg you.

104
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,480
How is it?

105
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,290
Has the Young Lord's wife calmed down?

106
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,320
Why?

107
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,240
Why?

108
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,040
About last night,

109
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,840
don't you owe me an explanation?

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,960
Since we got married,

111
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,000
I've been protecting

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,930
the reputation of your Liu family.

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,720
The fact that there was no blood on our wedding night,

114
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,050
if others knew about it,

115
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
the reputation of your Liu family

116
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,159
would be a joke.

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,920
And you?

118
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,720
You keep testing my patience.

119
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,600
Liu Ruofeng,

120
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,020
before we got married,

121
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,360
you kept telling me

122
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,970
that you had nothing to do with Xue Yiyang.

123
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,120
But you can't explain

124
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,440
why on our wedding night

125
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,240
there was no blood.

126
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,680
I, Xue Fu,

127
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,800
never wear someone else's old clothes.

128
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,040
Liu Ruofeng,

129
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,520
don't tell me

130
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,880
you saved Xue Yiyang for my sake.

131
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,360
What if I say yes?

132
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,680
Go on,

133
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,370
I'm listening to your excuses.

134
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,380
You won't believe anything I say anyway.

135
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,360
Even if I explain to you

136
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,120
that there's nothing romantic between us,

137
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,120
you've never believed me, have you?

138
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,040
I believe you.

139
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,440
I believe you.

140
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,280
I believe you bring all men back

141
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,400
for my own good.

142
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,080
So,

143
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,320
I'll also let you know

144
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,120
whose woman you really are.

145
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,920
You're awake.

146
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,280
Yiyang, eat.

147
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,700
I just washed them.

148
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,890
What are you smiling at?

149
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,170
How long was I unconscious?

150
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,040
Three days, or maybe five.

151
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,970
How are you feeling now?

152
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,800
I couldn't find the exit.

153
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,050
I couldn't find the way either.

154
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
The fruits I picked are a bit rotten.

155
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,320
Am I useless?

156
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,600
Ah Nian, why didn't you leave?

157
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,640
How could I?

158
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,040
leave you here alone?

159
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,280
I told you,

160
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,460
I will protect you.

161
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,300
Have you really been engaged to someone?

162
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,760
Is it Pei Ji?

163
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,440
Pei Ji?

164
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,380
I only see him as a brother.

165
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,280
It's raining.

166
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,840
Yiyang, are you alright?

167
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,380
Yiyang.

168
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,200
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,900
It's all because of me that you're like this.

170
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,200
Come.

171
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Do you know?

172
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,320
a year ago,

173
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,040
although I was tortured nearly to death by that deserter,

174
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,120
I was saved by someone.

175
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,440
My body has fully recovered,

176
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,640
and I can still marry and have children.

177
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,800
Do you know?

178
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,160
Even if you're already married,

179
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,880
I'll still take you away from someone else.

180
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,400
Do you know?

181
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,880
After tonight,

182
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,360
even if you want to leave,

183
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,160
I won't let you go.

184
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,770
Every step is illuminated,

185
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,120
thinking only of one person.

186
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,700
Growing old together.

187
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,210
The ten-day deadline is approaching.

188
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,090
Why hasn't my sister Nian arrived yet?

189
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,890
