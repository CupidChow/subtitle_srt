1
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,680
If you forget me in the future,

2
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,400
seeing this

3
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,959
will remind you of our past.

4
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,720
Silly,

5
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,090
how could I ever forget you?

6
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,730
We'll be together forever.

7
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,160
Yes.

8
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,240
A'nian, try this.

9
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,250
It's delicious.

10
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,320
Yi Yang,

11
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,160
usually in your place,

12
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,400
on the second day after marriage,

13
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,730
what am I supposed to do?

14
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,120
Both my parents have passed away,

15
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,440
so naturally, you don't need to pay respects to in-laws.

16
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,840
If you were just married,

17
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,520
the subordinates would come to greet you.

18
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,040
They would address you as Princess Xue.

19
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,840
Princess Xue?

20
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,800
Why would I have the surname Xue?

21
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,760
Because in our place,

22
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,010
women take their husband's surname after marriage.

23
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,880
But in our Zhaoyao Mountain, our names

24
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,160
all have one character.

25
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,360
My name is Nian,

26
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,320
so everyone calls me A'nian.

27
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,300
How about this,

28
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,130
why don't you give me a surname?

29
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,320
Step by step in the shining dust,

30
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,120
thinking of only one person,

31
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,540
growing old together,

32
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
how about Bu Nian?

33
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,520
This way, you'll have your own surname.

34
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,880
You're not Princess Xue,

35
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,140
you're just yourself.

36
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,280
Bu Nian.

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,200
How do you write 'Bu'?

38
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,240
Bu.

39
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,610
It looks beautiful over there.

40
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,360
Look, isn't it beautiful?

41
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,450
It's beautiful.

42
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,890
Not nearly as beautiful as you.

43
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,080
I know.

44
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,040
Yiyang, are you still in pain?

45
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,490
I'm fine now.

46
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,280
If it weren't for you,

47
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,159
I would have given up on life long ago.

48
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,820
Do you hate those who hurt you?

49
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,880
I mean,

50
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,480
if you leave this place,

51
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,570
would you seek revenge?

52
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,480
The old Xue Yiyang is already dead.

53
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,080
Now, I only want to stay here

54
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:09,960
with you.

55
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,160
Then promise me,

56
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,160
if you can get out,

57
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,600
don't take any risks.

58
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,840
Live well.

59
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,560
What's wrong with you today?

60
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,680
Yiyang,

61
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,960
we don't have a baby yet.

62
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,120
We're already married.

63
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,130
These things...

64
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,200
Yi Yang.

65
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,960
Let's play a game.

66
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,180
Aren't we too old for this?

67
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,160
How childish.

68
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,440
Play with me, please.

69
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:52,880
Okay.

70
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,600
Yi Yang.

71
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,370
See you in the next life.

72
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,440
You must not open your eyes, okay?

73
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,810
Don't worry.

74
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,250
Only puppies cheat.

75
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,080
You'll definitely find me, right?

76
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,000
Of course.

77
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,560
No matter where you go,

78
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,400
I'll find you.

79
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,360
Promise?

80
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,360
