1
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,280
This willow leaf tea is specially paired with lotus cake.

2
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,000
Try it.

3
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,860
You're so thoughtful.

4
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,560
These days are truly leisurely.

5
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,840
If only it could always be like this.

6
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,520
As for some people,

7
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,800
they need to learn a bit more about proper conduct.

8
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,130
Who can argue with that?

9
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,800
I understand, sister.

10
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,260
I'll go wash up right away.

11
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,280
Why don't you take a short rest?

12
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,810
Alright.

13
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,160
What's wrong?

14
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,800
Who is it?

15
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,620
Yiyang, you...

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,600
speak.

17
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:40,039
How did you know there was a hidden weapon in the Buddha statue?

18
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:42,600
I can sense danger.

19
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,450
You think I'd believe that?

20
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,640
Were you trying to assassinate the Empress Dowager?

21
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,440
Do you realize

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,320
if I had been a moment later,

23
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,800
the Empress Dowager would have died by that statue.

24
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,920
I would have been held responsible as well.

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,000
Yiyang, believe me.

26
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,160
Write down your name.

27
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,240
Where do you live?

28
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,810
How many parents and siblings do you have?

29
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,200
Your handwriting is so ugly.

30
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,720
You're trying to play dumb right under my nose.

31
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,450
Do you want Lu Li to torture you?

32
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,060
Only then will you show your true colors?

33
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,600
Yiyang, you've become so fierce now.

34
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,380
You know me?

35
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,420
No, I don't.

36
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,610
It's only been a day.

37
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,250
how did you end up like this?

38
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,360
They said I would be sent away if I didn't work.

39
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,700
But I can't leave the mansion.

40
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,280
Why?

41
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,120
those who can stay in my mansion

42
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,980
are only my wives and concubines.

43
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,090
Are you willing?

44
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,200
Today,

45
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,480
the Empress Dowager asked me to dispel this rumor.

46
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,540
It's nothing more than spending the night with a woman.

47
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,200
There are many eyes and ears in the mansion anyway.

48
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:40,960
Why don't

49
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,800
you help me dispel this rumor?

50
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,079
What rumor?

51
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,720
Since you already know about my weakness on rainy nights,

52
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,380
I can't let you out of my sight.

53
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,220
You said you have the ability to foresee,

54
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,360
so stay here

55
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,500
and let me see your skills.

56
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,140
Alright, alright.

57
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,089
You'll sleep here tonight.

58
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,500
A woman is staying overnight in Xue Yiyang's bedchamber tonight.

59
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,120
Someone actually gets to stay in Xue Yiyang's bed.

60
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,450
Is she one of our people?

61
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,240
The woman's background is unknown.

62
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
I have never seen her before either.

63
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,620
Then let's make her one of our people.

64
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,120
A year ago,

65
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,680
that convicted criminal clearly told me

66
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,440
he had subjected Xue Yiyang to castration.

67
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,400
He shouldn't be able to touch women anymore.

68
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,240
Perhaps he's just putting on a show for outsiders.

69
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,440
As far as I know,

70
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,440
he went to see the Empress Dowager today.

71
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,200
I'm afraid the Empress Dowager may already be aware of these rumors.

72
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,600
Good.

73
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,940
Let him confirm these rumors for me then.

74
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,520
Go and bring that woman to me.

75
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,370
Yes, sir.

76
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,380
Young Lord,

77
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,400
the clothes for the Young Lord's consort are ready.

78
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,600
Shall I deliver them?

79
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,450
Bring them to me.

80
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
Last night, you

81
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,520
didn't use this body

82
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,080
to serve the General, did you?

83
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,240
You can't read or follow rules.

84
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,640
How could the General be interested in

85
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,770
a wild girl of unknown origin like you?

86
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,000
You all

87
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,040
Who told you not to wear shoes?

88
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,720
Who are you showing your bare feet to?

89
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,800
Shameless.

90
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,880
I'm not here to be bullied by you.

91
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,330
My patience only works for Yi Yang.

92
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,320
If you dare to bully me again,

93
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I can't guarantee what I might do.

94
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,320
We're just about to go out shopping.

95
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,720
Your foot is injured, it's not convenient.

96
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,560
Some books in the library haven't been aired out.

97
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,040
Since you're so protective of the General,

98
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,040
why don't you help air out his books?

99
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,700
Let's go, let's go.

100
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,560
Yi Yang, Yi Yang.

101
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,360
The General is reading in the inner chamber.

102
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,420
Don't disturb him.

103
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,850
Not even breathing is allowed.

104
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,280
It's very noisy.

105
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,000
Is Yi Yang here?

106
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,480
Call him General.

107
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,650
You're not allowed to call him Yi Yang either.

108
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,600
General.

109
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,680
General Xue.

110
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,890
Why are you still walking barefoot on the ground?

111
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,120
Alright, everything's been dried.

112
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,660
Oh no, Yiyang is still inside.

113
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,800
Yiyang! Yiyang!

114
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,840
Yiyang, are you okay?

115
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,360
Come.

116
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,080
Yiyang, it's me.

117
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,760
it's me.

118
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,180
Yiyang.

119
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,290
It hurts.

120
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,040
It hurts.

121
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,120
Ah Nian.

122
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,760
You remember me.
