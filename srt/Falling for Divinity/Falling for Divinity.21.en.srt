1
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,760
Sir,

2
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,160
look at these people.

3
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,640
They're all old,

4
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,360
and their bodies are just fat.

5
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,290
Who would want them for hard labor?

6
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,680
General Xue ordered

7
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,570
to sell all these people for just one copper coin.

8
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,440
However,

9
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,880
you need to sell them to

10
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,640
places that treat people like animals.

11
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,370
Understand?

12
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,100
Understood, understood.

13
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,700
Take this front row

14
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,320
to the mines for me.

15
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,250
Yes, sir.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,039
No, they...

17
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,000
You don't have divine power now.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,130
You can't save them.

19
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,500
Am I supposed to just watch them being sent to their deaths?

20
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,320
Our tribe has been wiped out,

21
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,160
and the power of the divine tree has disappeared.

22
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,160
What can you do now?

23
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,420
Going there would be suicide for you too.

24
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,440
Xue Yiyang,

25
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,370
you have truly betrayed me.

26
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,970
Can you really not come with me?

27
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,700
Would you abandon your own soldiers and live alone?

28
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,260
if you did that,

29
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,579
would you be happy?

30
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,440
What is he asking for?

31
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,680
It's said that the young lord of the city has captured

32
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,240
a group of bandits from Zhaoyao Mountain.

33
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,960
General Xue wants to plead for them

34
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,360
to release these people.

35
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,650
If they are bandits,

36
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,500
what's there to plead for?

37
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:52,800
Let him go.

38
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,490
A dignified general of the city

39
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,410
kneeling for a group of unrelated outsiders,

40
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,490
what a disgrace.

41
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,600
Why did you lie to me?

42
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,440
Make A'nian come out of the divine tree.

43
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,480
Did you plan everything from the beginning?

44
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,160
to put all the blame on me,

45
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,420
to make A'nian hate me.

46
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,560
General Xue,

47
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,920
Didn't Xue Fu come with you?

48
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,280
I just didn't tell you.

49
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,530
As long as Sister A'nian walks out of the divine tree,

50
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,520
the barrier of Zhaoyang Mountain will disappear.

51
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,880
Those villagers of Zhaoyang Mountain,

52
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,440
in your eyes, General Xue,

53
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,170
what do they matter?

54
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,720
Is she alright?

55
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,800
You should worry about yourself first.

56
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
Look at yourself.

57
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,800
Since you want to see her,

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,060
why don't you go in?

59
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,200
Most of the people of Zhaoyang Mountain are dead or injured.

60
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,860
After all, it was done by the people of Fuzi City.

61
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,600
Today I went to beg the city lord for mercy,

62
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,930
to release your people.

63
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,650
But he didn't agree.

64
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,240
If she sees me,

65
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,940
I'm afraid there will only be hatred.

66
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,640
You seem to know that.

67
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,920
Bu Nian still doesn't know

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,800
that you deceived Xue Yiyang

69
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,050
and took her out of the God Tree.

70
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,200
And Xue Fu still doesn't know

71
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,440
that you deceive him into cutting his flesh every day.

72
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,420
Then there's no need to let them know.

73
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,020
What about you?

74
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,720
What do you plan to do next?

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,120
My two biggest enemies now

76
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,159
are Xue Fu and Xue Yiyang.

77
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,440
The greatest pleasure

78
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,760
is of course to watch these two crickets

79
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,000
fight to the death.

80
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,520
You have divine power now,

81
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,080
why don't you just

82
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,700
kill them both?

83
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,400
That's no fun.

84
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,360
Sometimes when I look at your face,

85
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,720
I really can't tell

86
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,520
if you're the puppet I carefully stitched together

87
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,960
or not.

88
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,880
I'm a goddess now,

89
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,240
a living, breathing person.

90
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,060
It's quite laughable.

91
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,960
My sister A Nian was so beautiful

92
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,880
and kind.

93
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,680
Who's like you, with such a vicious heart?

94
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,850
Can't bear to part with it, can you?

95
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,920
Take it, take it. Who cares?

96
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,440
Vicious heart.

97
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,280
I'm the one you dragged out of a pile of corpses.

98
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,240
You say I have a vicious heart,

99
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,580
aren't we cut from the same cloth?

100
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,400
You can't have her,

101
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,840
but you can have me.

102
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,080
A Nian.

103
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,860
It's the tenth day now.

104
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,140
The young city lord truly has perseverance.

105
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,840
This deep affection is truly moving.

106
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,960
If the time comes,

107
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
and my Feng'er hasn't been revived,

108
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,490
I'll make you join her in death.

109
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,960
Before that happens,

110
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,180
why don't I help you fulfill a wish first?

111
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,920
Tell me, what is it?

112
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,600
Charge!

113
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,200
You've had a long-standing grudge against Xue Yiyang, haven't you?

114
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,520
How about I help you eliminate him once and for all?

115
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,800
He broke the barrier of my Zhaoyao Mountain.

116
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,200
He is the real culprit.

117
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,450
Both emotionally and rationally,

118
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,240
I should take his life.

119
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,280
What do you want to do?

120
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,240
Xue Yiyang went to plead with the city lord yesterday,

121
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,080
to release my people.

122
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,610
The city lord didn't agree.

123
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,760
But if you go and say

124
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,090
that the bandits from Zhaoyao Mountain attacked the young city lord at night,

125
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,880
and that I, as the bandit,

126
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,880
am being taken by you to the city tower for public beheading,

127
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,560
he obstructs your law enforcement.

128
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,090
You can just shoot an arrow,

129
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,200
and it will be perfectly justified.

130
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,160
I wonder how Xue Yiyang

131
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,330
could have fallen for a woman like you.

132
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,200
Guards!

133
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,700
Take Bu Nian to the city tower.

134
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,440
A Nian.

135
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,800
A Nian, I'll take you home.

136
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,120
okay?

137
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,760
His life.

138
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,600
I'll take it.

139
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,320
How can there be two Bu Nians?

140
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:26,920
A Ran.

141
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,480
Or should I call you Qiao An?

142
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,250
Pei Ji has told you everything.

143
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,730
It's really laughable.

144
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,160
When he gave me the dagger,

145
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,080
he was calling out your name.

146
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,570
But I never expected...

147
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,600
You were also the first one to cut me.

148
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,080
Who are you?

149
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,960
General Xue,

150
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,560
you certainly have a short memory for important matters.

151
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,080
That day, Xue Fu wanted to test you,

152
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,540
to see if the rumors about your impotence were true.

153
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,690
He had me impersonate Qi Wanwan

154
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,200
to go to your mansion and gather information.

155
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,930
Have you forgotten all of this?

156
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,440
General Xue,

157
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,240
I am Wanwan, the daughter of the Chief Protector.

158
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,700
I am willing to offer myself to you, General.

159
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,680
It's you.

160
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,240
Xue Fu wanted to test you.

161
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,560
He used me.

162
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,480
You wanted revenge on Xue Fu.

163
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,540
You used me.

164
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,600
Pei Ji wanted to exchange for Bu Nian's freedom.

165
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,200
He used me.

166
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,280
But now I have become the Divine Lady.

167
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,600
It's time for you all to pay

168
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
for your actions.

169
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,440
Divine Lady,

170
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,700
didn't you promise to resurrect Ruo Feng for me?

171
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,160
What compensation do you want?

172
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,600
Gold, houses, or servants?

173
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,860
I'll give you all of it.

174
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,320
Young Lord, you are so naive.

175
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,880
You don't really believe

176
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,140
there's such a thing as resurrection in this world, do you?

177
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,560
Didn't you tell me

178
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,280
that if I cut off forty-nine pieces of flesh

179
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,720
What if I now ask you

180
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,770
to exchange your life for hers?

181
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,500
What would you do then?

182
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,960
You lied to me.

183
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,640
I hate it the most

184
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,120
when you prodigal sons put on this act of repentance.

185
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,320
Not everyone gets the chance to repent.

186
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,600
Lu Li is dead.

187
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,680
You must pay for his life with yours.

199
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,340
forget about your people,

200
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,640
leave Mount Zhaoyao,

201
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,960

202
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,720
What are you going to do?

203
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,160
Hasn't Pei Ji told you?

204
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,200
Our hearts and fates are one.

205
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
