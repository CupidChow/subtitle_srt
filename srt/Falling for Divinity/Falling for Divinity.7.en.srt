1
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,800
Yi Yang.

2
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,920
How can I be like Guard Lu,

3
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,440
always by your side?

4
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,120
If I tell him about the foreseen danger,

5
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,970
will he believe me then?

6
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,090
Black horse.

7
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,080
I never thought that at such a young age,

8
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,660
instead of dying on the battlefield,

9
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,080
I'd be defeated by a bowl of chicken soup.

10
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,610
General,

11
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,330
I'm leaving.

12
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,520
Look at you.

13
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,200
Put it down, put it down, put it down.

14
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,729
Alright.

15
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,250
Are you alright?

16
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,520
There are still a few detoxification pills left from the doctor's last prescription.

17
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,850
I'll go get them for you.

18
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,530
Where is she?

19
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,720
Who?

20
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,360
You mean Miss Bu Nian, right?

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,760
She built a wooden cabin in the backyard.

22
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,440
I don't know how she managed to build it.

23
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,520
But it's fine.

24
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,440
At least she won't come here to bother you.

25
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,240
Wooden cabin?

26
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,220
Tree house.

27
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,840
Take this empty bowl back to her.

28
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,540
Just say you drank from it.

29
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,450
Shouldn't empty bowls go back to the kitchen?

30
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,520
Why give it to her?

31
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,880
Just do as I say and take it to her.

32
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,180
Let me nap a bit longer.

33
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,650
How about you become the general then?

34
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,440
it's not impossible.

35
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,200
Off to deliver the bowl then.

36
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,520
Actually,

37
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,640
I didn't want to come here today.

38
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,920
You're all grown horses now.

39
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,290
you should know better.

40
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,930
Please don't make me worry anymore, okay?

41
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,040
All the food, clothes, and things you use,

42
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,560
are all earned through the general's hard work.

43
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,440
Isn't that right?

44
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,880
So,

45
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,530
I hope you can be more emotionally stable.

46
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,140
Don't get angry so easily,

47
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,720
and kick people out with your hind legs.

48
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,250
It's very dangerous, okay?

49
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,490
You're not happy about it, are you?

50
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,680
you're the type who

51
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,760
goes crazy when your temper flares up,

52
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,290
throwing people off like a wild horse, right?

53
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,880
You really can't be like this anymore.

54
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,340
Grow up a little, will you?

55
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,019
And you,

56
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,720
you look pretty docile,

57
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,839
but when you go crazy, you're fiercer than anyone.

58
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,200
Why are you staring at me with those big eyes?

59
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,520
You're not happy either.

60
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,400
Can't you do it even if I beg you?

61
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,400
I know it's tough for you.

62
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,080
going to the battlefield is also difficult.

63
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,840
but this can't be

64
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,240
a reason for you to throw people off, right?

65
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,480
It's you, isn't it?

66
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,080
You throw people off and still think you're right, huh?

67
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,409
What's this fool doing?

68
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,140
Turn around and look at me.

69
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,720
Be a little more mature.

70
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,780
How old are you now?

71
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,760
A Li, why are you here?

72
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,690
I'm going to report to the general.

73
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,740
Wait for me.

74
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,850
I'll go with you.

75
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,640
I'm going to tell the general you've gone mad.

76
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,280
I believe

77
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,000
if we work together,

78
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:53,880
Crazy person,

79
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,010
the general definitely won't be thrown off by the horse.

80
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,140
Is it Young Master Pei?

81
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,760
It's me.

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,760
Hello, sir.

83
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,610
Here are the lease agreement and keys.

84
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,800
Thank you for your trouble.

85
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,920
May I ask if you're alone or...

86
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,040
I'm here to pick up my bride-to-be.

87
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,880
That's wonderful!

88
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,940
Congratulations!

89
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,680
Thank you.

90
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,120
Please, come in.

91
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,770
Have you finished looking?

92
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,040
You haven't agreed to my request yet.

93
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,240
Don't be ridiculous.

94
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,040
Am I supposed to never ride a horse again?

95
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,400
Should I take a carriage even when marching to battle?

96
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,720
Don't be angry.

97
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,409
Haven't I already told you?

98
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,560
I have the ability to foresee danger.

99
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,400
I really saw it.

100
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,480
You'll really have an accident if you ride a horse.

101
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,210
Then tell me.

102
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,490
when will it happen?

103
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,360
I can't say for sure when it will happen.

104
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,720
But if I'm there...

105
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,240
I won't let anything happen to you.

106
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,920
I've already arranged everything with Ma.

107
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,000
now it's just up to you.

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,660
Right, Ali?

109
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,970
How dare you!

110
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,010
Comparing me to livestock!

111
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,200
Let go!

112
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,480
No.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,480
Let go!

114
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,360
No.

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,880
I heard you built a treehouse yourself.

116
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,760
How did you hear about that?

117
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,720
Yeah, I built it myself.

118
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,120
Pretty impressive, huh?

119
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,650
You're quite handy.

120
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,520
Of course I am.

121
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,180
Let me show you around.

122
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:27,960
Sure.

123
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,320
Is that it?

124
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,440
Which one?

125
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,640
Yes, that's the one.

126
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,840
That orange one is the one I covered.

127
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,440
How is it? Looks good, right?

128
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:35,940
Yi Yang.

129
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:38,820
Xue Yi Yang.

130
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,040
A Li, something happened to Yi Yang.

131
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,480
Young City Lord's Consort,

132
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,960
why don't we take a break?

133
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,680
The doctor said moxibustion can dispel dampness,

134
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,800
which is beneficial for the Young City Lord's Consort to conceive.

135
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,130
You'd better not interfere arbitrarily.

136
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,530
It's alright, let's persist a bit longer.

137
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,159
You.

138
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,480
Do you have to follow me everywhere I go?

139
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,360
Well, I'm going to take a bath now.

140
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:54,840
Come on.

141
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,440
Wait.

142
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,320
Are you really going to bathe with me?

143
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,120
Sure, why not?

144
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:14,880
You.

145
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,000
You're a woman.

146
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,980
How can you have no sense of shame?

147
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,520
What is a sense of shame?

148
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,000
In the future, when you're out,

149
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,730
if a man is naked in front of you,

150
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,000
you must not look at him for even a second longer.

151
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,060
Do you understand?

152
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,610
I'm going to take a bath.

153
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,400
Wait here.

154
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,210
Stand still.

155
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,520
Those who know,

156
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,700
we're going to suppress bandits.

157
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,480
Those who don't might think we're adulterers.

158
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,240
I'm just worried she might be a spy for the young lord.

159
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,440
Then knock her out.

160
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,040
Torture her.

161
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,570
What's going on?

162
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,000
Bu Nian was just worried you might fall off the horse.

163
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,960
You've been riding horses since you were five.

164
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,040
If something was going to happen, it would have happened already.

165
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,440
It's too late. Let's go.

166
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,400
The last report from our scout

167
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,240
said they followed the mountain bandits into this Eastern Mountain.

168
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,240
After that, there was no news at all.

169
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,280
They've been gone for at least three or four days.

170
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,760
Find someone to inquire along the way.

171
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,880
Ask if there are any villagers nearby

172
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,880
who have seen traces of horses and carriages.

173
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,480
There are quite a few of them.

174
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,240
It rained just a few days ago.

175
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,400
They couldn't have gone far.

176
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,620
Be careful.

177
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,600
General, are you alright?

178
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,690
It's just a minor wound, nothing serious.

179
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,360
A dart.

180
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,010
It seems Miss Bu Nian truly has the gift of foresight.

181
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,560
Let's return to the mansion.

182
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,040
Young Lord,

183
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,840
if you miss the Young Lady,

184
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,210
why don't you go see her?

185
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,400
Between husband and wife,

186
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,730
there's no grudge that can't be resolved.

187
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,120
Why should I think about her?

188
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,490
Who knows which man she's thinking about?

189
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,340
Xue Yiyang arrived at the location and was stabbed.

190
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,920
It seems the fish has taken the bait.

191
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,720
Then let him investigate the clues.

192
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,160
The more thoroughly he investigates, the better.

193
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,840
The woman I asked you to investigate, the one who spent the night with him,

194
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
how's that going?

195
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,410
This woman is very mysterious.

196
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,240
It's as if she appeared out of thin air.

197
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,880
There's no trace of her to be found.

198
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,940
Then find an opportunity to meet her.

199
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,280
Young Lord,

200
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,880
the Young Lady today underwent

201
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,520
a full hour of moxibustion treatment.

202
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,880
The doctor has also prescribed a new medicine.

203
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,800
Young Lord,

204
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,560
trying to conceive is not

205
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,220
something the Young Lady can accomplish alone.

206
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,410
You don't see her day after day.

207
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,970
How can there be offspring?

208
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,290
There's no rush.

209
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,920
If she wants children,

210
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,170
let her come and beg me herself.

211
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,160
Bu Nian, come down.

212
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,320
come down.

213
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,760
Why don't you come up?

214
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,800
How childish.

215
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
If you don't come down, I'm leaving.

216
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,040
Alright, I'll stop teasing you.

217
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,080
What's the matter?

218
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,840
Don't you have the ability to foresee?

219
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,570
Then tell me,

220
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,840
what did I ask Lu Li to bring?

221
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,040
Do I need to foresee such a trivial thing?

222
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,080
He'll be here soon.

223
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,880
You'll find out then, won't you?

224
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,680
Fine.

225
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,480
He'll be carrying a wooden box.

226
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,400
A brown one, unlocked.
