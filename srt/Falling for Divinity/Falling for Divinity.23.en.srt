1
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,760
The sacred tree is destroyed.

2
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,090
The goddess is dead too.

3
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,800
We... we have no divine power.

4
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,640
How can we resurrect the young lord's wife?

5
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,040
What use are you anymore?

6
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,360
You'll all be buried with my Feng'er.

7
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,120
Kill them.

8
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,320
Stop!

9
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:08,960
Goddess!

10
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,280
The goddess is here!

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,760
We're saved!

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,200
Halt!

13
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,200
Xue Yiyang.

14
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,360
It really is you, Xue Yiyang.

15
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,890
You're indeed still alive.

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,380
Bu Nian, you truly have the power to bring the dead back to life.

17
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,039
You can help me resurrect Feng'er, can't you?

18
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,900
I can help you resurrect Ruofeng.

19
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,530
But you must release my people.

20
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,060
Ah Nian.

21
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,960
Your divine power is gone.

22
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,400
How can you promise him that?

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,130
Don't worry.

24
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,650
I'll stall for time.

25
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,060
You go and help me save the others.

26
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,120
Just come back to the mansion with me obediently,

27
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,380
and I'll naturally release your people.

28
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,250
Alright.

29
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,960
No, you can't go!

30
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,840
Wait.

31
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,440
This is your tribesman who just died.

32
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,440
Revive him first.

33
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,300
Let's see if you really have the ability.

34
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,610
You can't even revive your own tribesman,

35
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,760
What's wrong? Have you lost your divine power?

36
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,080
Then on what grounds are you negotiating with me?

37
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,080
Don't act rashly.

38
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
General Xue.

39
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,720
Bu Nian, you'd better stand firm.

40
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,280
if this boiling molten iron is poured on someone,

41
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,760
there won't be even skin left.

42
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,640
Your beloved,

43
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,020
and your clansmen.

44
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,280
I want to see

45
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,090
how you will choose.

46
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,960
Xue Fu,

47
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,480
have you ever thought about why Ruo Feng committed suicide

48
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,160
and didn't want to give birth to the child?

49
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,960
You're so determined to resurrect her.

50
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,820
Is it to make up for your mistakes,

51
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,490
or do you truly love her?

52
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,260
Of course I truly love her.

53
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,440
She didn't want her child to be born

54
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,880
only to be suspected by others.

55
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,079
She was also utterly disappointed in you.

56
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,810
Do you really think she wants to come back to life?

57
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,010
Impossible.

58
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,360
Everything you said is false.

59
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
It's impossible.

60
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,280
You oppose Yi Yang at every turn,

61
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,600
blaming your father for favoritism and your wife for infidelity.

62
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,060
But if your child were born

63
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,600
and learned that their father is such a brutal person,

64
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,660
wouldn't they treat you the same way?

65
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,000
Impossible.

66
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,760
Young Lord,

67
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,360
someone has delivered a letter

68
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,620
that requires your personal attention.

69
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,920
I knew it.

70
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,180
Feng'er is still alive. Feng'er is still alive.

71
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:38,930
Let's go.

72
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,800
Feng'er, Feng'er!

73
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,440
Feng'er.

74
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,320
You're here.

75
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,140
It's getting cold.

76
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,640
I just brewed this. It'll warm you up.

77
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,560
Feng'er, is it really you?

78
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,610
Do you remember this place?

79
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,600
Of course I do.

80
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,840
This is where we first studied together.

81
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,640
I had my happiest days here.

82
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,520
We can go back to those times.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,440
Really? Can we go back?

84
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,090
Of course we can.

85
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,520
Feng'er, I promise you.

86
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,170
I'll take good care of the baby in my belly from now on.

87
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,720
And yours too.

88
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,120
Alright.

89
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,400
From now on, just tell me whatever you want.

90
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,130
I'll give you anything.

91
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,320
Really?

92
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,080
Really.

93
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,760
You've come back.

94
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,560
I'm willing to give you everything.

95
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,160
Feng'er, I'll never leave you again.

96
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,340
Thank you, Doctor Pei, for the musk bone incense and the illusion tea.

97
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,400
He harmed my sister and my people.

98
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,090
He got what he deserved.

99
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Did you take Liu Ruofeng's body?

100
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,360
Yes.

101
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,300
The young lady told me.

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
she had no choice when she was alive.

103
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,159
After death, she didn't want to enter the young lord's mansion again.

104
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,520
I took her to a

105
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,320
place with beautiful mountains and clear waters.

106
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,280
Young lady, Lin'er has avenged you.

107
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,240
Sister Anian,

108
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,640
what I promised you

109
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,570
has been fulfilled.

110
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,560
Yiyang, I heard

111
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,040
that people here draw fortune sticks for good luck.

112
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,370
What fortune did you draw at the Matchmaker Temple just now?

113
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,410
I'm not telling you.

114
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,880
You won't tell me?

115
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,400
How can you not tell me?

116
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,680
I just won't tell you.

117
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,840
Tell me, Yiyang,

118
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,600
you're the best.

119
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,480
Just tell me.

120
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,400
Oh, right.

121
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,530
Have all your people been settled?

122
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,690
I've already sent them back to Zhaoyao Mountain.

123
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,659
Ah Nian,

124
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,520
I didn't get a chance to ask you before.

125
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,920
How did you get the Divine Tree to revive me?

126
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,600
Well, I just promised the Divine Tree

127
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,960
that I would take good care of my people,

128
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,520
ensure they have fruits to eat every day,

129
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,760
and then we would water the Divine Tree daily,

130
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,159
so it would bless us with health and safety.

131
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,300
Just like that?

132
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,450
Yes, just like that.

133
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,600
What else could it be?

134
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,060
So, are you going to tell me or not?

135
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,120
Sister, you're so beautiful.

136
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,560
Can you be my wife?

137
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,360
She's my wife.

138
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,400
You're looking for a mother,

139
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
who's behind you.

140
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,400
Sister, this uncle won't do.

141
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,960
Why don't you wait for me to grow up?

142
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,280
I'll give you the best.

143
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,010
This is the betrothal gift.

144
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,000
Candy fruits.

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,920
So sweet.

146
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,210
Then it's a promise.

147
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,160
I'll wait for you to come find me.

148
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,800
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

149
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,919
The child likes to run around.

150
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,179
Let's go home quickly.

151
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,130
Remember, okay?

152
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,799
It seems my wife is even stealing children.

153
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,169
I'll have to keep a close eye on you.

154
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,280
Well, someone used to forget about me before.

155
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,720
Ah Nian.

156
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:54,880
Come here.

157
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,570
This time, you can't take it off again.

158
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,740
Yiyang,

159
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
do you have any unfulfilled wishes?

160
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,320
Yes, many.

161
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,370
I want to fulfill them with you.

162
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,840
I won't eat it. You eat.

163
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,360
Is it good?

164
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,640
Let's go.

165
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:57,960
A'nian.

166
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:58,960
Grandpa.

167
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,720
A'nian.

168
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,970
This place has always been self-sufficient.

169
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,720
There's no disease, no exploitation.

170
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,960
And no scheming or deception.

171
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,000
Then a stranger intruded.

172
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,240
He revealed everything here to the outside world.

173
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,320
And sold the Migu branch given to him by our people

174
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,360
for a hefty sum to others.

175
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,760
It brought catastrophic disaster to our tribe.

176
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,160
Since then,

177
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,120
those who leave Zhaoyao Mountain

178
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,840
will forget everything that happened here.

179
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,320
If you truly care about our people,

180
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,480
I think you should leave with him.

181
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,480
Grandpa,

182
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,220
Yi Yang is not that kind of person.

183
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,200
The matter of the barrier

184
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,160
is my fault alone.

185
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,880
Stop arguing.

186
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,760
What's done is done.

187
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,960
The dead tribesmen won't come back to life.

188
