1
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,080
We.

2
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,960
And Yi Yang too.

3
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,440
You've been with him these past few days.

4
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,820
Yes, that's right.

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,840
Sister Nian,

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,680
you haven't forgotten

7
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,160
becoming the Goddess of Migu

8
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,880
means you must guard Zhaoyao Mountain for life

9
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,539
and can never marry, have you?

10
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,440
I will leave.

11
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,560
I'll go when the first snow falls.

12
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,090
Alright.

13
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,960
Then let's go back together now.

14
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,360
Okay.

15
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,539
Then I need to bring Yi Yang along too.

16
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,000
I still need to go back to the thatched cottage

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,130
to find that dagger.

18
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,960
If I have that dagger with me,

19
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
Yi Yang will be safe.

20
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,640
So I...

21
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,210
Sister Nian,

22
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
in a few more days,

23
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,420
the gift I'm preparing for you will be ready.

24
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,360
At that time,

25
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,140
we can return to Zhaoyao Mountain together.

26
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,600
Let's go home.

27
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,600
A'nian.

28
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,200
a'nian.

29
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,480
Why don't you let me wear the newly made one?

30
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,280
Young Master,

31
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,280
have you forgotten what the City Lord said last time?

32
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,480
Do you wear new clothes every time you see him?

33
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,760
The City Lord prefers simplicity.

34
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,720
Let's wear this used one this time.

35
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,760
You're so thoughtful, Lian'er.

36
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,000
Have you found that girl called Bu Nian?

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,530
Since she has such ability,

38
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,120
she must be used by me.

39
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,200
I must have her.

40
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,840
Nian, where are you?

41
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,400
I hope you're not dead.

42
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,600
Nian, is that you?

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,260
You're finally awake.

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,520
During the ten-plus days you were unconscious,

45
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,200
I hoped every day that you would wake up.

46
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,800
I took the precious herbs I had worked so hard to gather

47
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,200
and made them into porridge for you.

48
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,260
You must live well.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,840
For us people of Zhaoyao Mountain,

50
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,300
if we have someone we love,

51
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,730
we use a branch from the Migu tree as a hairpin.

52
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,360
I want to give this to you.

53
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
Nian.

54
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,320
Sister Nian,

55
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,720
you're awake.

56
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,050
Are there other people living in here?

57
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,040
Of course not.

58
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,810
It's just some miscellaneous items stored here.

59
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,720
Pei Ji, thank you.

60
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,330
However, Yi Yang is still injured.

61
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,660
I need to go back to him.

62
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,250
What about your own injuries? Are you just going to ignore them?

63
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,760
Yi Yang didn't know before

64
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,300
that I would suffer backlash from my precognitive abilities.

65
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,960
The Goddess Sister sent me out of the mountains

66
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,520
to find a way to resolve the great calamity facing our people.

67
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,320
I've found it.

68
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,320
Really?

69
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,360
Then you should go back and handle it first.

70
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
I'll be back soon.

71
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,800
What if I told you

72
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,320
that the way to resolve the great calamity facing our people

73
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,980
is for you to return to Zhaoyao Mountain with me?

74
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,720
I...

75
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,640
You two,

76
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,120
come with us.

77
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,080
Who are you?

78
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,760
What are you doing?

79
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,080
Let go!

80
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,640
Let go! Release me!

81
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,400
Miss,

82
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,760
why have you taken out this book again?

83
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,420
The book General Xue gave you.

84
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,240
If you ask me,

85
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,130
these should have been burned five years ago.

86
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
Liu Ruofeng,

87
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,880
do you really can't let him go?

88
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,570
Greetings, Young Lord.

89
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,640
Tell the Young Lord's wife to go to the front hall.

90
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,080
Yes.

91
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,120
There was never anything between Yiyang and me.

92
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,920
We were just childhood classmates for a few years.

93
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,120
I just want to know

94
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,680
what exactly the Young Lord saw in this book

95
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,080
to misunderstand that I had an affair with him.

96
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,280
If I can resolve his misunderstanding,

97
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,440
will he stop pestering me?

98
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,700
Young Lord's wife, the Young Lord requests your presence.

99
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,440
Young Lord.

100
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,080
It's clearly mine.

101
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,360
mine.

102
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,240
Yours.

103
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:07,800
Why is she here?

104
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,560
Don't fight. There's enough for everyone.

105
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,220
Take a look.

106
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,920
My young lord's consort has arrived.

107
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,760
From a prestigious family, with a graceful figure.

108
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,280
Unparalleled beauty, no one can compare.

109
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,680
You all

110
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,320
can't even compare to her toes.

111
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,520
Seeing is believing.

112
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
you'll know when you see.

113
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,360
Ruofeng, take off your clothes and show them.

114
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,520
how incomparable you are.

115
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,600
Take it off!

116
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,960
What's wrong? Not taking it off?

117
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:39,800
Lian'er,

118
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,600
help the young lord's consort undress.

119
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,650
Young lord, Bu Nian has been found.

120
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,280
You may go now.

121
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,159
Sister, stay close to me.

122
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,760
This man is with her.

123
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,860
They've been brought here together.

124
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:19,960
It's you.

125
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,690
Beautiful lady.

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,840
You know me?

127
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,360
You're the one who wants to kill Yi Yang.

128
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,280
You shouldn't make such accusations lightly.

129
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,320
Did anyone see it?

130
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
Look at yourself.

131
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,039
Your eyes are truly beautiful.

132
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,880
Since you have the ability of precognition,

133
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,080
why don't you guess

134
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,799
what I'm going to do next?

135
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,320
No, you can't!

136
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,560
If Ah Nian uses her precognition ability, she'll suffer a backlash.

137
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,960
She can't use it anymore.

138
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,800
She can use it for Xue Yi Yang,

139
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,240
but not for me?

140
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,560
What I hate most in my life

141
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,440
is when he has something that I don't.

142
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,500
If she can't use it,

143
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,880
then I'll kill him.

144
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,740
Don't hurt him.

145
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,840
You... you want to marry me?

146
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,520
Sister,

147
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,120
you've guessed the outcome.

148
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,240
However, you can't become the young lord's wife.

149
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,800
Because I already have someone to be the young lord's wife.

150
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,460
You're not qualified enough.

151
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,240
You can stay by my side as a concubine.

152
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,200
It's enough for you to enjoy a lifetime of wealth and prosperity.

153
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,760
I know there's someone by Xue Yiyang's side,

154
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,560
a remarkable woman with the ability to predict.

155
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,490
but I didn't know

156
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,160
that it would be such a

157
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,800
pitiful beauty.

158
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,260
What are you doing?

159
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,560
Did Xue Yiyang promise to marry you?

160
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,120
Is that why you disregarded the backlash

161
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,120
and helped him without hesitation?

162
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,960
Whatever he promised you,

163
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,420
I can promise you the same.

164
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,960
I can even give you more.

165
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,280
Give the order.

166
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,170
Prepare the wedding feast.

167
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,080
Tomorrow, I will marry this

168
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,980
What's her name again?

169
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,920
Miss Bu Nian.

170
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,080
Tomorrow, I will marry this Miss Bu Nian.

171
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:19,800
Yes.

172
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,680
Tomorrow, I will hold a grand banquet.

173
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,320
What should we do?

174
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,040
Miss Bu Nian.

175
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,860
You are the Young Lord's consort.

176
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,530
What about Pei Ji? How is he?

177
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,720
You're in such a dire situation yourself,

178
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,780
yet you're still thinking of others.

179
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,040
He won't die,

180
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,960
at least not now.

181
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,080
The Goddess Sister is right.

182
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,080
You people from outside the mountain,

183
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,200
you'll stop at nothing to achieve your goals.

184
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,960
Miss Bu Nian,

185
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,480
Xue Fu, as the Young Lord,

186
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,120
is the second most noble person in this world.

187
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,440
Countless women want to marry him.

188
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,380
Are you truly not tempted?

189
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,460
Only someone like you would want to marry a man like him.

190
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,880
Although A Fu is surrounded by many women,

191
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,120
he has never thought of taking a concubine.

192
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
You are the first.

193
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,520
It's clear that you are very important to him.

194
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,240
However, from what I gather,

195
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,500
since you have no interest in him,

196
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,860
why don't you do me a favor?

197
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,800
Eat this poisoned pastry.

198
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,640
It would be a way to fulfill both our wishes.

199
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,680
What do you think?

200
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,410
You really don't know what's good for you.

201
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,640
Open the door.

202
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,940
Any news about Bu Nian?

203
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,080
Not yet.

204
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,850
Why don't you investigate?

205
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,400
However, someone sent a confidential report.

206
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,720
It says Xue Fu brought back a woman.

207
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,170
and he plans to marry her tomorrow.

208
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,840
Xue Fu is such a reckless person.

209
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,400
It's none of our business how many women he marries.

210
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,080
The urgent matter is to find information about Bu Nian.

211
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,210
I'll dispatch more people right away.

212
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,440
Why are you so ill?

213
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,210
Where's the doctor?

214
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,280
He has already come to see me.

215
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,800
He said I've caught a cold

216
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,680
and my old illness has flared up,

217
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,560
causing a persistent high fever.

218
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,650
If I can make it through tonight, I'll be fine.

219
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,330
Why hasn't the doctor come yet?

220
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,280
Quickly, call Lian'er in here too.

221
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,000
If anything happens to the young lord's wife,

222
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,720
none of you will live to see another day.

223
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,320
Yes.

224
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,840
Today,

225
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,280
I am to marry Bu Nian.

226
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,880
What's so good about Bu Nian?

227
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,890
Do you really have to marry her?

228
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,090
I thought you went to see her in prison.

229
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,240
I thought you were going to help her.

230
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,200
Help her?

231
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,000
Why would I help someone

232
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,660
who shares my husband with me?

233
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,080
This doesn't sound like you.

234
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,800
Usually, you don't have

235
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,440
a single word of complaint about these women.

236
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,500
Do you really care?

237
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,240
What if I really do care?

238
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,780
You're afraid I'll steal Xue Yiyang's people, aren't you?

239
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,920
After the ceremony,

240
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,700
I'll come to keep you company.

241
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,500
What about you?

242
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,960
Did you marry me because you love me,

243
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,560
or because

244
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,320
I'm something you wanted

245
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,640
to take away from Xue Yiyang?
