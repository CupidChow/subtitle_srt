1
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,080
What's wrong?

2
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,200
A'nian.

3
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:11,900
A'nian.

4
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,780
A'nian, what's wrong?

5
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,460
Those maids must have bullied her again.

6
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,760
That's not right.

7
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,330
They've all been sent away.

8
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,360
Recently,

9
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,840
she's been the only one serving in the inner court.

10
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,840
No one should be giving her trouble.

11
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,800
These injuries of hers are a combination of new and old wounds.

12
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,080
They couldn't have been caused in just one day.

13
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,320
This young lady's injuries

14
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,240
were not properly cared for to begin with.

15
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,120
Combined with her deep sorrow,

16
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,960
it led to a sudden stagnation of qi and blood,

17
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,220
resulting in persistent high fever and unconsciousness.

18
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,479
Deep sorrow?

19
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,120
This girl is usually so cheerful and silly.

20
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,800
She doesn't even know how to talk back when others bully her.

21
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
How could she be in such deep sorrow?

22
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,280
Could it be because of those portraits the Empress Dowager sent?

23
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,080
She's afraid of being sent away.

24
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,800
I've prescribed some medicines for external and internal use.

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,460
Apply the medicine to this young lady's wounds,

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
to prevent them from getting worse.

27
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,130
Alright, I'll go with you to get the medicine.

28
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,840
Lost valley.

29
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,600
Its splendor shines in all directions.

30
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,560
Wear it and never be lost.

31
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,200
A'nian.

32
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,820
Where are you really from?

33
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,720
Can you tell me everything when you wake up?

34
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,520
How many days has it been?

35
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,850
Why is the high fever still not subsiding?

36
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,320
You should get some rest too.

37
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,850
You haven't slept for days.

38
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,079
She can't even swallow a sip of medicine.

39
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,140
Find more doctors.

40
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,940
What kind of incompetent doctors are these?

41
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,360
Please.

42
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,240
General,

43
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,040
someone has come to say

44
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,240
that they're here to treat Miss Bu Nian.

45
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,440
You are Bu Nian's brother.

46
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,090
That's correct.

47
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,640
Half-brother.

48
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
How did you know Bu Nian was injured?

49
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,200
We grew up together,

50
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,720
so naturally, our hearts are connected.

51
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,440
Besides,

52
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,840
isn't the General already having me investigated?

53
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,570
I might as well come here myself

54
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,280
to answer the General's questions.

55
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,040
Can you cure A Nian?

56
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,840
I'm not here to treat her.

57
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,320
I'm here to take her away.

58
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,200
Who gave you permission?

59
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,480
General,

60
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,660
don't get excited.

61
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,080
Our Ah Nian

62
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,080
Has she signed a contract of indenture with your household?

63
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,480
Or does she owe you money?

64
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,800
Surely it can't be that

65
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,500
you've secretly agreed to marry, can it?

66
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,720
If not,

67
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,600
do you know, General,

68
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,400
that Ah Nian has the ability to foresee the future?

69
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,400
I know.

70
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,680
Good.

71
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,600
Then our Ah Nian

72
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,530
has no connection to you, General,

73
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,480
but after learning of her ability,

74
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,140
for your own selfish desires,

75
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,250
you want to detain an innocent girl

76
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,409
in your household without reason,

77
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,120
to use her as a tool for your political ambitions?

78
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,760
I didn't.

79
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,560
Do you know

80
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,660
that every time Ah Nian speaks of a future event,

81
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,320
her body suffers a backlash?

82
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,120
Her body now

83
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,120
must already be covered in wounds.

84
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:32,720
Wait.

85
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,860
Even if she wants to leave,

86
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,960
at least wait until she wakes up and tells me herself.

87
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,020
It's certainly not your place to say.

88
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,360
Have your people prepare hot bath water.

89
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,090
Put this medicine in the water.

90
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,340
Change the hot water every half hour.

91
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
Gently place A Nian in the water.

92
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,600
After soaking for two hours,

93
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,290
she will wake up.

94
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,080
But she's so deeply unconscious,

95
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,540
someone needs to hold her in the bath, right?

96
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,920
Then I should call a maid to come.

97
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,120
I'll do it. I'll do it.

98
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,560
Yiyang, you're back.

99
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,770
How do you recognize me?

100
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,400
Here.

101
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,860
Does it still hurt?

102
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,610
How did you know I was injured here?

103
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,320
A Nian.

104
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,730
During this year I was missing,

105
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,380
do you know what happened?

106
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,640
Slow down.

107
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,240
Pei Ji, you saved me.

108
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,960
Sister A Nian,

109
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,760
if I had come a step later,

110
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
your life would have been in danger.

111
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,880
It was clearly our general

112
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,080
who bathed with her for two hours, okay?

113
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,920
He didn't even have time to change his clothes.

114
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,480
Sister, shall I take you home?

115
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,800
I still have some unfinished business.

116
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,040
so

117
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,840
I need to stay by his side.

118
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,690
What else do you have left to do?

119
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,400
Can't I finish it for you?

120
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,450
What's so good about staying here?

121
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,170
They're clearly treating you like a servant.

122
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,200
What's wrong?

123
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,120
That's enough, isn't it?

124
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,130
She chose to stay here herself.

125
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,290
If not a servant,

126
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,680
you think she'll become a princess?

127
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,600
Lu Li, shut up.

128
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,120
It's all my fault.

129
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,280
I didn't take good care of my sister.

130
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,240
if it were me,

131
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,640
I definitely wouldn't have let my sister suffer so much.

132
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,440
If you really insist on staying,

133
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,680
you can keep this sachet.

134
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Your body is weak.

135
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,560
This sachet can boost your energy

136
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,120
and ward off evil spirits.

137
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,040
But every ten days,

138
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,770
you need to come to me to replace the herbs inside.

139
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,240
Also,

140
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,520
remember,

141
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,020
don't hurt yourself again

142
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,080
for the sake of others.

143
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,360
Pei Ji.

144
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,620
It's getting dark.

145
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,420
You must be tired after a long day's work.

146
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,490
I'll escort you out of the mansion myself.

147
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,960
After all, there are many courtyards in my mansion.

148
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,620
I'm afraid you might get lost.

149
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,200
General Xue,

150
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,800
if you have something to say,

151
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,860
just ask directly.

152
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,800
Where exactly are you and A'nian from?

153
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,820
At this time last year,

154
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,400
where was she?

155
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,040
Was I with her?

156
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,840
Interesting.

157
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,560
You've been with my A'nian for so long,

158
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,040
yet you haven't gotten

159
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,970
the information you want from her.

160
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,240
It seems that you two

161
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,440
aren't that close after all.

162
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,040
Answer what you're asked.

163
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,200
Don't ramble.

164
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:56,930
Alright.

165
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,180
Then I'll tell you.

166
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,160
At this time last year,

167
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,680
my sister and I got engaged.

168
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,520
She is my betrothed wife.

169
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,560
So, at that time,

170
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,280
she didn't know you at all.

171
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,760
We're suddenly going to suppress the bandits.

172
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,720
Should we send someone to inform her?

173
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,680
After all, she's still lying in bed.

174
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,840
The affairs of my household,

175
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,770
since when do we need to inform her?

176
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,680
I think she's almost recovered.

177
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,600
In a few days, I'll send someone to escort her out.

178
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,930
Moreover, she's someone else's fiancée.

179
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,360
To avoid gossip.

180
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,000
But you said she has the ability to foresee the future.

181
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Are we just letting her go like this?

182
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,840
I am a general.

183
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,160
I live on the edge every day.

184
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,780
I don't know if there's danger or not.

185
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,360
But I still feel...

186
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,090
Enough talk.

187
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,680
Set out immediately.

188
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,210
Let's go.

189
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:00,920
Yes.

190
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,720
These bandits are operating on these two hilltops.

191
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,200
Our plan must be foolproof.

192
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,730
General,

193
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,360
someone from the mansion has reported

194
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,960
that Miss Bu Nian is missing.

195
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,170
Perhaps her fiancé has taken her away.

196
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,400
Dr. Pei mentioned a few days ago

197
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,000
that Miss Bu Nian's injuries

198
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,000
make it difficult for her to move even after applying medicine.

199
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Even if it was him,

200
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
he wouldn't take her away so easily.

201
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,680
The servants just told me

202
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,000
that when she left the mansion,

203
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,860
she was heading in our direction.

204
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,200
A frail woman

205
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,080
who is still injured...

206
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,680
What if...

207
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,760
Lu Li,

208
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,640
hold our troops back tonight.

209
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,970
You'll relay my orders.

210
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,320
Commander Lu, this person has rashly entered the military camp.

211
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,080
Let me go! Let me go!

212
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,810
Release her.

213
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,660
Miss Bu Nian, why are you here?

214
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,160
Guard Lu, Yi Yang is in danger.

215
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,290
Quick, come with me to save him. Hurry!

216
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,200
The general assigned me to guard this place.

217
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,130
I have my orders.

218
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,290
I can only wait here for his return.

219
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,520
But...

220
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,160
Aren't you the person he trusts the most?

221
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,090
How can you stand by and do nothing?

222
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,640
I'm not standing by and doing nothing.

223
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,900
I'm powerless to help.

224
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,640
Powerless?

225
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,900
If you won't save him, I'll go myself.

226
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,480
Drink.

227
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,800
Come on, drink up.

228
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,480
Boss.

229
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,200
The young city lord's information was indeed correct.

230
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,440
This Xue guy.

231
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,240
Actually ran away from the military camp for a woman.

232
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,880
Escaped from the military camp.

233
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,410
He's got quite a lucky life.

234
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,240
Last time he was barely alive.

235
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,650
General Xue.

236
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,610
Long time no see, how have you been?

237
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,440
This scene looks familiar, doesn't it?

238
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,080
Boss.

239
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,160
The young city lord said.

240
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,240
A few days ago, there was a woman.

241
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,140
who stayed overnight in his room.

242
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,660
Could it be this guy deliberately trying to deceive us?

243
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,490
Whether it's true or false.

244
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,040
We'll find out if we test him.

245
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,570
Exactly.

246
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,130
Our boss was able to castrate him once.

247
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,680
he can do it a second time.

248
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,280
Make him unable to be a man for all his lives.

249
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,680
There's another good show to watch.

250
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,000
Is anyone there?
