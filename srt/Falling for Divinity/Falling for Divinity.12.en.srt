1
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,080
The auspicious time has arrived.

2
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,560
Young Lord, why rush?

3
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,880
Since I am already standing here,

4
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,120
I will naturally go through the wedding ceremony with you.

5
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,050
I didn't expect the beauty to come around so quickly.

6
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,720
However,

7
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,640
Young Lord,

8
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,200
why do you keep me tied up?

9
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,120
I trust you wouldn't dare to misbehave.

10
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,810
Let's consider it a celebration for tonight.

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Young Lord, is there anything

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,260
you'd like to foresee?

13
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,970
I can take a look for you.

14
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,620
The beauty is in such high spirits today.

15
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,000
But didn't that doctor say

16
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,079
you would suffer a backlash?

17
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,160
Seeing blood on the wedding night

18
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,700
might not be good for you, beauty.

19
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,600
Since I am to become the Young Lord's person,

20
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,900
I naturally should serve the Young Lord.

21
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,880
Good.

22
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,440
You're much more sensible than that Liu Ruofeng.

23
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,520
Show me what you can see.

24
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,210
When can I ascend to the throne?

25
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,450
Such a significant matter,

26
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,079
I may need to think about it for a moment.

27
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,920
Report!

28
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,680
The City Lord has issued an order.

29
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,120
Qing'an City is under attack.

30
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,600
The Young Lord is ordered to depart immediately

31
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,640
to quell the rebellion in Qing'an City.

32
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,360
What?

33
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,840
Now?

34
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,860
How dare those petty villains break their word?

35
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,320
Prepare the luggage.

36
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,000
Bring this woman and that doctor along.

37
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,490
We'll depart together.

38
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,060
For this mission to suppress the rebellion,

39
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,620
I'm afraid I'll have to trouble you, beauty.

40
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,800
Young Lord, Young Lord!

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,079
Please, I beg you to check on the Young Lord's consort.

42
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,880
She has fallen unconscious now.

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,860
Prepare the carriage for the young lord's consort.

44
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,060
She will depart with the army.

45
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,079
The young lord's consort is so gravely ill now.

46
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,800
how can she possibly accompany the army?

47
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,600
My people

48
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
must die by my side if they are to die.

49
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,810
We've found her.

50
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,800
Bu Nian was taken by Xue Fu to Qing'an City to quell the rebellion.

51
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:10,920
Prepare the horses.

52
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,450
Yes, sir.

53
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,640
Why is it still porridge?

54
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,959
I was hoping for some dishes to go with a drink.

55
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,720
Who's that?

56
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,640
Seems to be some doctor who committed a serious crime.

57
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,360
He's usually kept in a prison cart.

58
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,760
When there are patients needing treatment,

59
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,520
they let him go over.

60
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,360
He's on call at all times,

61
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,090
like a slave.

62
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,000
I see.

63
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,080
If you ask me,

64
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:37,320
the young city lord is really impressive.

65
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,200
Our ambush this time,

66
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,280
we achieved a great victory without a single casualty.

67
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,880
We beat those Qing'an people so badly,

68
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,280
they fled in panic.

69
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,040
You know what,

70
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,520
I used to think only General Xue was a military genius,

71
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,680
never expected the young city lord to be even better.

72
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,120
It's like he can predict the future.

73
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,420
So impressive.

74
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,080
Yeah, impressive indeed.

75
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,120
Why is he angry now?

76
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,840
Sister Nian, are you feeling better?

77
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,000
Pei Ji.

78
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,600
This Xue Fu

79
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,250
is just too despicable.

80
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,880
He's now using your abilities

81
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,520
to greatly boost his reputation in the military camp.

82
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,520
Those officers and soldiers even think

83
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,980
he's some kind of god descended from heaven.

84
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,480
At best, he's just

85
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,610
a contemptible person who only knows how to bully women.

86
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,720
While you're treating the wounded soldiers,

87
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,180
you should leave quickly.

88
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,240
How could I leave you behind?

89
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,160
Besides, if it weren't for me,

90
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,100
you wouldn't have to obey him.

91
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,960
Sister Nian,

92
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,040
I've dragged you down.

93
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,360
Actually,

94
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,160
it's not just because of you.

95
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,960
If Xue Fu fails to suppress the rebellion,

96
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,890
there will be corpses everywhere,

97
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,980
and civilians will be displaced.

98
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,360
These soldiers

99
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,320
have all risked their lives following Xue Yiyang.

100
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,050
Their lives were barely saved,

101
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,600
and they can't lose them in vain.

102
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,240
Yes, that's true, but

103
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:35,920
still,

104
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,600
I'm only worried about your health.

105
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,200
Moreover,

106
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,020
given your current injuries,

107
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,680
after no more than ten predictions,

108
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:42,960
you

109
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,600
will die from the backlash.

110
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,520
I'm afraid it won't even take ten times.

111
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:54,920
What?

112
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,210
No, that's not acceptable.

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,060
I need to find a way.

114
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,900
How about this,

115
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,680
I have another medicine.

116
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,280
If we just

117
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,410
secretly put it in the soldiers' food,

118
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,080
an epidemic will spread.

119
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,160
Then,

120
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,000
as long as the young lord gets infected,

121
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,340
the lord will surely order a retreat.

122
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,080
Pei Ji, you're a doctor.

123
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,120
As a healer, how can you poison people?

124
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,360
No, none of them are as important as you.

125
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,480
Maybe I'm being too hasty.

126
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,700
I'm too concerned about your health.

127
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
What's that then?

128
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:39,960
It's nothing.

129
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,920
Well then, Sister Nian,

130
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,290
get some rest early.

131
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
I'll come to see you again tomorrow.

132
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,560
Yesterday,

133
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,320
Brother Xiao Wan saved my life.

134
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,720
I can't thank him enough.

135
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,080
I'll give you my last steamed bun.

136
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,080
Brother Xiao Wan was so brave today.

137
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,900
He beat them until they begged for mercy.

138
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,680
Brother Xiao Wan, you're so impressive.

139
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,800
But how come we've never seen you before?

140
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,530
I'm new here.

141
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,960
In the future,

142
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,210
I'll need to rely on you brothers more.

143
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,140
No problem, no problem at all.

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,800
They only give us two bowls of porridge a day.

145
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,130
with just a few grains of rice in each bowl.

146
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,760
How can we have the strength to fight like this?

147
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,280
I heard from some veteran soldiers,

148
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,800
that it's always like this in the young lord's army.

149
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,920
We common soldiers are always short on food and clothes.

150
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,120
But once the battle is over,

151
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,600
the young lord's trusted followers

152
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,320
will all make a fortune.

153
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,840
General Xue is much better.

154
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,000
The soldiers under General Xue

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,679
have never had their rations cut.

156
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,559
The young lord doesn't treat us well,

157
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,240
but he's won many brilliant battles this time.

158
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,360
Every move of the enemy

159
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,720
he's aware of.

160
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,840
It's like he can predict the future.

161
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,800
In this army,

162
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,560
many people fled from their hometowns.

163
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,320
But even here, they still can't eat their fill.

164
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm here to protect Fuzi City,

165
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,360
risking my life.

166
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,040
It's really not worth it.

167
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,600
Don't talk nonsense.

168
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,410
Who's there?

169
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,400
It's me.

170
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,000
Yi Yang?

171
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,820
Why are you dressed like this?

172
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,690
Which tent is Bu Nian in?

173
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,360
In A Fu's tent.

174
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,480
A Fu has been marching and fighting these days,

175
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,880
all relying on Miss Bu Nian's predictions.

176
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,540
Then she...

177
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,920
Ruo Feng,

178
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,120
Ruo Feng.

179
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,640
How do you like my new battle robe?

180
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,400
It looks good.

181
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,520
That's right, it should look good.

182
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,800
When marching and fighting,

183
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,600
one should always have a good-looking battle robe, shouldn't they?

184
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,250
Are you feeling better?

185
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,220
Then come and have a drink with me.

186
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,800
A Fu,

187
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,360
do you remember when we were in school?

188
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,320
The teacher always praised you for being well-versed in military strategy.

189
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,580
You were a promising talent for warfare.

190
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,320
You could have won without relying on that woman.

191
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,040
Yes,

192
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,800
but I wanted to ensure absolute victory.

193
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,330
Xue Yiyang is the God of War,

194
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,520
but what about me?

195
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,400
I am his future sovereign.

196
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,240
Precisely because of this,

197
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,440
you already have much more than he does.

198
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,900
But that's not enough.

199
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,480
I want him to know

200
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,290
that my possessions

201
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,660
are beyond his reach for his entire life.

202
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:24,840
Ruo Feng,

203
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,400
Xue Yiyang is no longer a man.

204
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,130
He doesn't even know what a woman tastes like.

205
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,210
I'm not like him.

206
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,800
A Fu, don't.

207
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,840
Don't do this.

208
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,200
A Fu, A Fu.

209
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,760
Don't.

210
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,200
Tomorrow at the hour of Chou,

211
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,720
the Anqing army will attack our main camp.

212
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,280
They will burn our provisions.

213
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,140
Give the order.

214
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,490
Tomorrow night,

215
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,970
we'll ambush them here.

216
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,720
In these four places,

217
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,760
we'll catch them all in one fell swoop.

218
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,280
Yes.

219
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,560
You haven't asked me to make any predictions these past few days.

220
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,490
How did you know?

221
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,880
I'm not stupid.

222
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,770
I just wanted to make sure we could win.

223
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,780
And to test you as well.

224
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,760
To see if the rumors about you are true,

225
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
that you possess such divine power.

226
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,560
Didn't the doctor say

227
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,170
if you were to predict military intelligence again,

228
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,440
you would die in my tent?

229
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,680
I'm keeping you alive

230
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,320
because there are more important things to do.

231
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,560
The ones who should help each other the most in this world

232
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,600
should be us.

233
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,620
You don't know yet, do you?

234
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,600
My young lord's consort and your Xue Yiyang,

235
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,700
they're having an affair.

236
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,920
You're lying.

237
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,280
Only a wild girl from the backwoods like you

238
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,060
would still be kept in the dark by Xue Yiyang.

239
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,520
It can't be.

240
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,320
Yiyang has never told me anything about this.

241
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,800
There have long been rumors in the army

242
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,660
that Xue Yiyang is no longer a man.

243
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,960
How could he

244
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,360
bring up this heartbreaking past with you?

245
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,930
I'll tell you the truth.

246
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,080
Liu Ruofeng is the one I snatched away from him.

247
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,010
I just didn't expect

248
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,480
that they would still be secretly in love with each other.

249
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,480
Oh, beauty.

250
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,280
You might be

251
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,690
just a substitute for Liu Ruofeng.

252
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,160
It can't be.

253
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,880
I have seen with my own eyes

254
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,520
that the two of them were intimate.

255
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,720
How could it be false?

256
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,680
These shoes were given to you by Xue Yiyang, weren't they?

257
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,600
What's embroidered on them?

258
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,220
Don't you understand yet?

259
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,720
Maple leaves.

260
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,920
Feng.

261
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,610
Sister Nian,

262
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,580
what's wrong with you?

263
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,080
Why do you look so weak?

264
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,200
Didn't the young city lord say

265
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,800
he'd let you rest for a few days after the victory?

266
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,240
Hasn't he asked you to predict military intelligence again?

267
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,840
It's nothing to worry about.

268
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,360
Oh, sister,

269
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,320
are you wearing that sachet?

270
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,810
Yes, I am.

271
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,290
That's good.

272
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,440
No matter what,

273
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,370
you must keep the sachet on you.

274
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,760
What I mean is,

275
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,800
you've been overexerting your spiritual power these days.

276
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,200
The sachet can,

277
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,000
when necessary, replenish your vital energy.

278
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,180
You don't know yet, do you?

279
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,010
My young city lord's consort and your Xue Yiyang,

280
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,800
they're having an affair.

281
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,000
to tell you the truth,

282
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,440
I snatched Liu Ruofeng away from him.

283
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,880
I saw it with my own eyes.

284
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,540
The two of them were intimate.

285
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,840
How could it be false?

286
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,320
Yiyang.

287
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,450
Am I really just a substitute for Liu Ruofeng?

288
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,200
However,

289
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,420
as long as you're safe, that's all that matters.

290
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,850
In the prophecy,

291
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,720
your calamity is supposed to happen in the military camp.

292
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,210
As long as you don't show up,

293
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,520
will it not happen?

294
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,480
Ah Nian.

295
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,040
Ah Nian, it's me.

296
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,720
Go away.

297
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,820
I don't want to see you.
