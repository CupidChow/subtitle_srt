1
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,400
You're back.

2
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,360
Ah Nian.

3
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,600
I see you're showing off your strength.

4
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,720
Congratulations on your great victory, General.

5
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,400
I told you.

6
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,120
Even without relying on prophecies,

7
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,250
I could still defeat them thoroughly.

8
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,250
Come, let me see.

9
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:33,850
Alright.

10
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,160
Thanks to General Xue,

11
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,160
the wounds on my hands have completely healed now.

12
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,360
Look, see?

13
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,479
It seems you've been obedient,

14
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,210
not misusing your prophecies.

15
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,520
From now on, just trust me.

16
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,400
I'm more reliable than prophecies when it comes to warfare.

17
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,680
Yes, yes, yes. You're the best.

18
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,320
But I have a question for you.

19
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,320
How were you so sure

20
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,450
that Pei Ji would definitely help you?

21
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,300
He might not necessarily help me,

22
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,360
but he would definitely save you.

23
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,840
That's why I'm still alive.

24
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,960
So, what do you think?

25
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,420
The prophecy you saw has been broken, right?

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,600
Yes.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,460
You see,

28
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,000
not everything

29
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,000
is destined to follow heaven's will.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,600
We still have a long way to go.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,640
But Sister Goddess said

32
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,200
I haven't fully controlled my precognitive abilities yet.

33
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,720
Can prophecies really be broken so easily?

34
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,440
What if...

35
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,890
Never mind, I won't think about it.

36
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,280
As long as Yi Yang is safe, that's all that matters.

37
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,880
You seem to be in a good mood.

38
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,040
What?

39
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,120
I've become Xue Yiyang's defeated opponent.

40
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,180
You're happy about that, aren't you?

41
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,160
Stop right there.

42
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,680
You're hurting me.

43
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,440
What?

44
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,160
Can't stand to be near me for even a moment?

45
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,880
I know.

46
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,079
I've lost my power now.

47
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:31,010
Every one of you wants to step on me.

48
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,920
And you're the first one who wants to leave me.

49
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:36,880
You're drunk.

50
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,040
Let's talk when you're sober.

51
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,760
Why?

52
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,280
The things I, Xue Fu, want,

53
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,329
why do they all end up belonging to Xue Yiyang?

54
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,640
Only you,

55
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,560
I will never let go.

56
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,840
No!

57
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,959
Xue Fu, you are not worthy to be my husband.

58
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,579
You are even less worthy to be the father of the child in my womb.

59
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,960
Boss.

60
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,450
Ah, it's you again, young lady.

61
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,260
A wind chime for your sweetheart?

62
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,940
Did you give it away last time?

63
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,780
Come, come.

64
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,890
Please, have a seat.

65
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,840
Actually,

66
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,680
I made a bamboo wind chime here before.

67
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,720
I wanted to give it to you.

68
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,760
Because when you were living on our Zhaoyao Mountain,

69
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,290
I made something like this.

70
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,560
I thought,

71
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,940
if you forgot about me,

72
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,280
seeing it

73
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,210
might remind you of me a little.

74
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
I didn't expect Pei Ji would take it.

75
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,840
I know.

76
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,760
You know?

77
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,360
I even know how to make it.

78
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,410
Why don't I make one for you?

79
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,980
Winter is coming soon.

80
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,520
Isn't it?

81
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,720
A'nian,

82
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,360
why are your palms so sweaty?

83
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,810
They're not.

84
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,160
Could it be that the incident at the military camp wasn't Yi Yang's fatal calamity?

85
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,290
Is this the real one?

86
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,810
But why does it have to be on a snowy day?

87
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,300
I promised the goddess

88
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,250
that when the first snow falls,

89
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,160
I must return to Zhaoyao Mountain.

90
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,760
It's done.

91
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,530
It's really beautiful.

92
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,850
It's for my wife.

93
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
Since you're a match made in heaven,

94
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,720
this red string,

95
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,840
the young lady didn't take it last time,

96
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,440
but now that you're married,

97
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,480
you can't refuse it anymore.

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,680
Come on,

99
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,040
take it.

100
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:48,770
Here.

101
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,600
There.

102
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,880
Now we can be together for all eternity.

103
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,570
Speak your mind.

104
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,040
Marriage is a big deal.

105
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,320
It's one thing not to bring her here,

106
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,500
but to forget about her entirely?

107
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,090
If this were in a storybook,

108
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,200
it would be universally condemned.

109
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,680
Poor mistress,

110
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,210
still up in the middle of the night making fruit soup.

111
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,960
What kind of good wife makes fruit soup?

112
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
You talk too much.

113
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,530
But you're quick to call her 'mistress,' aren't you?

114
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,860
Come to think of it,

115
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,900
the young master suffered such a big setback this time.

116
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,570
If he goes to the Empress Dowager to complain,

117
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,530
what will you do?

118
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,120
We'll have to play it by ear with the Empress Dowager.

119
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,650
However,

120
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,320
the city lord can discern right from wrong and will make his own decision.

121
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,400
So you're saying

122
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,410
we're relying on the city lord now?

123
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,920
Have you considered

124
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,080
that no matter how incompetent Xue Fu is,

125
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,809
he's still the city lord's son?

126
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,600
Do you really believe a father would harm his own son?

127
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,659
Don't worry, Lu Li.

128
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,620
The old Xue Yiyang is dead.

129
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,970
Now, if anyone dares to harm those close to me,

130
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,920
I'll make sure they suffer a terrible fate.

131
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,090
Only if you want to live,

132
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,440
can your brothers survive.

133
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,200
What are you thinking about?

134
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,560
Yiyang, the fruit soup is almost ready.

135
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,640
It's getting late.

136
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,010
Let's have the soup tomorrow morning.

137
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,000
Alright, let's go back and rest together.

138
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,460
No rush.

139
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:18,740
A-Nian,

140
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,520
I have something to tell you.

141
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,060
I just saw you by the stove,

142
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,600
and it reminded me of these past years,

143
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,530
fighting battles everywhere, having no fixed home.

144
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,240
My mother told me since I was young,

145
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,640
to hide one's sharpness and cultivate eloquence in silence.

146
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,840
But it seems they didn't

147
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,000
end up well either.

148
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,520
Until I met you,

149
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,760
the sunrise,

150
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,880
and the meals and soups seemed to have flavor.

151
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,540
It made me feel that life should be like this.

152
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,440
I know,

153
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,900
we already got married on Zhaoyao Mountain.

154
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,360
It's my fault,

155
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,980
I forgot about you.

156
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,520
A-Nian,

157
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,640
would you give me a chance

158
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,600
to give you a proper wedding?

159
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,400
I, Xue Yiyang, am willing to give up all the chaos of this life,

160
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,120
just to be with you and explore the world together.

161
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,480
A proper wedding.

162
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,000
I will formally marry you with the customs of Fuzicheng.

163
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,840
Is Doctor Pei here?

164
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,080
Yes.

165
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,460
Please come in.

166
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,600
I've long heard of Doctor Pei's exceptional medical skills.

167
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,800
Could you please check my wife's pulse?

168
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,440
There are countless famous doctors at your residence,

169
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,370
why bother coming to find a wandering doctor like me?

170
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,720
I'm pregnant.

171
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,880
It's not the young city lord's.

172
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,010
How can you say that?

173
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,600
Then I can't think of

174
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,800
a reason why she would come to find me here.

175
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
You know very well that your husband

176
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,760
once hurt me and my sister A-Nian,

177
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,560
yet you still dare to come to me.

178
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,560
Aren't you afraid you might lose the baby in your belly?

179
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,080
I don't want A-Fu to know for now,

180
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,010
about the existence of this child.

181
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,240
Interesting.

182
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,400
Come, tell me your story.

183
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,440
I'll consider it after I hear it.

184
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,210
whether to agree or not.

185
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,880
Pei Ji,

186
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,860
Sister A-Nian,

187
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You, what are you doing?

188
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,320
Miss,

189
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,980
Where is the sachet I gave you?

190
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,600
Bu Nian.

191
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,040
My sister A'nian hasn't fully recovered from her old illness.

192
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,080
now your husband has

193
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,000
dragged her to the military camp as a pawn.

194
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,560
I need to treat my sister now.

195
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,800
Please, both of you, leave now.

196
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,440
Ruofeng.

197
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,220
What's wrong with you?

198
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,520
The lady is pregnant.

199
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,400
We came to see Dr. Pei for treatment,

200
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
but unexpectedly, Dr. Pei is being difficult at every turn.

201
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,080
It seems he doesn't have

202
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,760
a compassionate heart for a patient.

203
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,690
She's pregnant.

204
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,840
Pei Ji, please save her quickly.

205
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,040
She is my benefactor.

206
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,730
Benefactor?

207
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,600
Eating these poisoned pastries

208
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,620
will also fulfill our wishes.

209
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,480
What do you think?

210
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,000
The city lord will send A'fu to lead the troops tomorrow.

211
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,800
Try to delay the time before the wedding ceremony.

212
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,160
How ungrateful.

213
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,280
What's wrong? Say something.

214
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,080
What's all this noise about?

215
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,880
You're the loudest one here.

216
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,760
Liver qi stagnation and blood deficiency.

217
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,530
It's miserable, truly miserable.

218
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,440
The young lady is in the mansion,

219
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,320
enduring all kinds of abuse from the young lord.

220
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,120
If it weren't for this time

221
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,160
when the city lord confined the young lord in the city,

222
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,840
Lin'er,

223
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,280
this is the husband she chose for herself.

224
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,400
If she doesn't want to endure it,

225
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,760
then she should divorce him.

226
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,920
If she doesn't want to divorce,

227
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,160
then she can only endure it.

228
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,020
Others can't say much about this.

229
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,160
As for me,

230
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,440
I'm just a doctor.

231
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,120
I can only tell you

232
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,780
if you want to keep the child in your womb,

233
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,840
then your life

234
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,440
might not be saved.

235
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,960
I must keep him.

236
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,320
Madam, why can't you see reason?

237
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
All for a man like Xue Fu.

238
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,680
Ruofeng, doesn't he treat you well?

239
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,680
You two were clearly in love,

240
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,410
weren't you?

241
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,000
When I first met him,

242
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,840
he was a kind young man.

243
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,840
We had some wonderful times together.

244
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,520
But at some point,

245
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,370
Afu became a different person.

246
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,810
Yi Yang is young and promising.

247
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,240
I think Liu Taifu's daughter, Liu Ruofeng, is quite good.

248
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,480
The two of them

249
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,480
It's not possible.

250
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,280
City Lord,

251
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,280
the Young City Lord is truly an outstanding and unparalleled genius.

252
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,520
If we're talking about who's worthy,

253
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,960
of Liu Taifu's prestigious family,

254
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,240
it must be a heroic young man like the Young City Lord.

255
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,720
As his father,

256
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,010
how could I not know what he's like?

257
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,980
Yi Yang excels at everything he does.

258
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,250
To marry him to such a woman,

259
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,370
is he worthy?

260
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,000
Father,

261
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,520
I will certainly improve my knowledge and skills.

262
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,000
I won't let you down.

263
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,080
What? You really want this arranged marriage?

264
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,120
I beg for your blessing, Father.
