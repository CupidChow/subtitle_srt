1
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,400
General Xue.

2
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,960
General Xue.

3
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,480
Grandfather.

4
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,160
Grandfather, A'nian went up the mountain.

5
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,640
Well, I'm not here for A'nian.

6
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,160
I'm here for you.

7
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,240
What is it, Grandfather?

8
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,480
I can see.

9
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,160
You and A'nian are truly in love.

10
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,450
I'm letting A'nian go with you.

11
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,080
I don't want her

12
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,560
to sacrifice her happiness for us anymore.

13
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,880
What do you mean?

14
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,760
A'nian must have made a pact with the Divine Tree before.

15
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,690
That's how she saved us and you.

16
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,250
She agreed to reseal Zhaoyang Mountain for the Divine Tree.

17
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,960
But you don't know.

18
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,700
To revive the Divine Tree,

19
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,800
the Divine Maiden's body must become a barrier.

20
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,280
Injecting her divine consciousness into the Divine Tree,

21
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,120
she will endure torment like raging fire every day,

22
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,380
until the Divine Tree grows to maturity.

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,560
So,

24
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,479
A'nian has already made her decision.

25
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,680
Take her away.

26
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,760
It's not too late.

27
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,640
Grandfather, if I take A'nian away,

28
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,000
what will happen to Zhaoyang Mountain?

29
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,440
Zhaoyang Mountain and all of us

30
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,640
will cease to exist.

31
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,579
If that's the case,

32
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,060
I respect A'nian's decision.

33
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,680
Ruofeng and Ruofeng's baby.

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,480
Azhao and my tribespeople.

35
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,600
They'll all be watching us from heaven.

36
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,040
Yes.

37
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,520
Sister Goddess once said,

38
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,640
every parting could be the final farewell.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,600
Yiyang,

40
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,000
if one day we part,

41
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,360
please don't be too sad.

42
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,850
Alright.

43
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,640
and you must eat well,

44
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,360
sleep well,

45
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,960
and be a good general.

46
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,200
Okay.

47
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:45,760
Yiyang.

48
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm here.

49
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,620
Yiyang.

50
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,240
I'm here.

51
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,780
I just want to call your name a few more times.

52
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,400
I'll always be here.

53
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,280
Yi Yang.

54
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,360
Do you know how I felt when I first saw you?

55
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,120
how I felt?

56
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,760
I thought you were silly.

57
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,480
Calling me silly, huh? Don't run!

58
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,540
You can't catch me!

59
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
Stop right there!

60
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Don't run, A Nian!

61
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,810
Please, sacred tree, bless us with fruit.

62
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,570
Impressive.

63
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:40,820
How's that?

64
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,320
Yi Yang.

65
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,300
Don't touch me.

66
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,440
A Nian, I love you.

67
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,960
A Nian.

68
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,200
This is the place

69
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,260
where you took me away from, isn't it?

70
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,000
You know everything now.

71
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,840
I am your husband.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,440
You should tell me everything from now on.

73
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,240
I will respect and protect you.

74
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,520
Yi Yang.

75
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,159
You made me realize

76
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,960
that in this world,

77
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,120
besides love,

78
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,360
there's also the brotherhood among soldiers,

79
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,810
and the duty to protect.

80
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,640
As a goddess,

81
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,620
it's also my responsibility to protect the divine tree and my people.

82
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,920
I love you too.

83
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,240
But love

84
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,560
isn't about being together forever.

85
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,810
It's about cherishing,

86
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,170
it's about thinking of someone

87
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,180
and feeling that the world is beautiful.

88
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,040
My A Nian has grown up.

89
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,040
So after I leave this time,

90
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,680
I won't see you again.

91
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,480
Not just you,

92
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,680
everyone who has seen me

93
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,840
will forget me.

94
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,360
That's perfect.

95
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,160
This way, I can

96
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,090
marry eight or ten beautiful wives

97
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,400
to spend the rest of my life with.

98
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,360
You'd better.

99
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,120
You know,

100
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,420
I love lively scenes the most.

101
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,760
If one day

102
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,720
when I come out,

103
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,220
if you're still alive,

104
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,120
I want to see

105
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,560
eight or ten of your great-grandchildren.

106
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,640
Don't disappoint me.

107
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,200
Yi Yang,

108
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,920
you must...

109
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,920
Don't worry.

110
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,650
Once I leave this place,

111
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,180
I'll forget about you.

112
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,960
You must forget about me.

113
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,400
A Nian, I'm sorry.

114
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,040
I lied to you.

115
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,290
I will remember you.

116
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,360
Forever and ever.

117
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,680
Drink up, drink up.

118
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,920
A Nian.

119
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,170
Thank you, big brother.

120
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,560
Drink, drink, drink.

121
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,120
A Nian.

122
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,320
Won't you even leave me with this small memory?

123
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,810
Let me tell you guys,

124
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,160
which blind dog

125
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,400
bumped into our boss?

126
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,160
I can't forget you, A Nian.

127
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,160
Zhao, Zhaoyao Mountain.

128
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,800
What Nian?

129
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,400
A Nian, Zhaoyao Mountain.

130
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,640
Bu Nian.

131
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,460
Brothers, beat him up!

132
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,360
Hit him hard!

133
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,440
Beat you to death!

134
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,780
You stinking brat!

135
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,740
You pretty boy!

136
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,480
What the hell!

137
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,660
That's enough.

138
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,600
A Nian.

139
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,050
Let's go.

140
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,500
Alright, General.

141
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,570
Get some rest early.

142
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,880
Grandpa, let me help you sweep.

143
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,370
Grandpa, why are you in the courtyard?

144
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,640
I planted a persimmon tree.

145
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,080
Take this.

146
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,930
Thank you, Grandpa.

147
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,520
Take it and eat.

148
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,920
He even forgot his own name.

149
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,520
General Xue, please wait.

150
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,480
The city lord is considerate of your advanced age.

151
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,880
He has specially granted you a sedan chair to escort you home.

152
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,140
Thank you to the city lord.

153
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,000
That won't be necessary.

154
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,000
I'd like to walk by myself.

155
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,080
Paper umbrellas!

156
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,080
Don't run so fast!

157
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,300
Paper umbrellas here!

158
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,720
Daddy, I want to eat candied haws.

159
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,800
Candied haws!

160
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,480
Strange.

161
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,640
That girl.

162
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,420
She looks like someone I saw when I was young.

163
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,200
I want to go make sugar figurines.

164
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,160
I want to go too.
