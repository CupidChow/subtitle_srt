1
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,800
Who let you in?

2
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,420
I'm here to help you...

3
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,800
How impolite.

4
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,700
Is everyone outside dead?

5
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,210
As expected, you still don't remember anything.

6
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,000
Your cold hasn't gotten better yet.

7
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,930
you can't go out.

8
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,640
Yiyang,

9
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,800
they've sent for a doctor to prescribe medicine for you.

10
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,330
You should rest for a while.

11
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,160
The appearance of this woman...

12
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,440
...actually alleviates...

13
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,700
...the pain of my symptoms when it rains.

14
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:05,840
Yiyang.

15
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,440
General.

16
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,360
How did this door open by itself?

17
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,840
You're taking care of me so attentively.

18
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,760
Are you trying to explain...

19
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,760
...why you appeared in the library?

20
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,370
Don't tell me...

21
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,200
...you're going to claim you have precognitive abilities again.

22
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,860
That's not the case this time.

23
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,079
My foot was scalded.

24
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,120
I told the people in my room,

25
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,840
it's inconvenient for me to go shopping with them.

26
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,300
They asked me to air out books in the library.

27
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,160
Yiyang, you're right.

28
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,970
You have so many rules here.

29
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,690
Didn't I give you shoes?

30
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,920
Why aren't you wearing them?

31
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,010
Don't you like them?

32
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,040
I do like them.

33
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,079
It's because I like them so much that I can't bear to wear them.

34
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,040
If you like them,

35
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,810
I can have someone buy a few more pairs.

36
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,680
Really?

37
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,760
What I mean is,

38
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,840
don't let outsiders think that the maids in my Xue mansion

39
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,200
can't even afford a pair of shoes.

40
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,560
Yes, yes, of course.

41
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,560
Come.

42
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,720
The medicine has gone cold.

43
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,980
It'll be even more bitter when it's cold.

44
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,079
I'll go brew another bowl.

45
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,440
Aren't you the one who hates bitterness the most?

46
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,100
Wait for me!

47
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,159
Rest assured, Young Lord.

48
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,920
As for that Official Liu,

49
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,720
he has already taken his own life in prison.

50
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,360
His clan members, on their way back home,

51
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,600
were ambushed and killed by the arranged bandits.

52
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,680
None survived.

53
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,840
The incident in Qing'an City

54
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,050
cannot be traced back to us.

55
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,520
I naturally trust my father-in-law's handling of matters.

56
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,780
Early next month is Feng'er's birthday.

57
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,159
At that time,

58
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,880
I would like to invite my father-in-law and mother-in-law

59
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,400
to join in the festivities.

60
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,200
The Young Lord is so thoughtful.

61
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,600
Every year, he personally arranges the birthday celebration for his wife.

62
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,080
My daughter is truly blessed.

63
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:11,920
Father,

64
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,640
you called for me?

65
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,530
You're here.

66
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,730
Feng'er,

67
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,960
we were just talking about your birthday.

68
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,200
The Young Lord

69
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,360
has deep affection and commitment to you.

70
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,560
You should also know how to be grateful.

71
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,720
Your mother and I

72
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,840
both hope that you can quickly

73
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,520
bear children for the Young Lord.

74
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,440
This is what a lady from a noble family

75
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,440
and a well-bred young woman should do.

76
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,500
Do you understand?

77
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,280
The Young Lord's wife naturally understands.

78
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,880
It's getting late.

79
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,880
I shall take my leave now.

80
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,640
Lu Xun,

81
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,860
see Grand Tutor Liu out for me.

82
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,500
Please.

83
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,440
Although you are not loyal to me,

84
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,640
your father is indeed a loyal minister.

85
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,640
Didn't you marry me because of my father

86
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,700
in the first place?

87
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,930
You've achieved your goal.

88
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,120
Then be a good wife to the young city lord,

89
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,640
dress beautifully,

90
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,040
and smile more happily.

91
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,800
Let everyone know

92
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,080
how loving we are.

93
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,240
Have you taken your medicine today?

94
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,170
Young City Lord,

95
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,880
I have finished drinking it.

96
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,600
Whose shoe is this?

97
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,700
What are you doing?

98
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,600
My shoe.

99
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,120
Serves you right. That'll teach you to be so arrogant.

100
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,730
Let her seduce the general.

101
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:14,960
Look.

102
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,480
look at her.

103
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:17,960
still wearing new shoes.

104
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,120
How pathetic.

105
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,680
Exactly.

106
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,010
She doesn't deserve it.

107
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,640
My... my shoes are soaked.

108
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,370
Take off your shoes.

109
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,650
Give them to her.

110
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,320
Bu Nian fell in by accident.

111
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,890
Please investigate carefully, General.

112
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,280
The injury on her foot...

113
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,440
She bumped into Xiao Yun, who was carrying hot water.

114
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,960
The bowl of water fell on her foot, causing this.

115
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,640
Could it be that she's trying to frame us?

116
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,480
to get the General's attention.

117
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,159
So that's what happened.

118
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,210
Actually, I was about to ask...

119
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,090
how did she sprain her foot?

120
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,799
So it was a self-inflicted injury scheme.

121
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,000
We've figured it out.

122
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,720
We didn't say her foot injury was a burn.

123
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,919
How did you know that?

124
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,120
Yes, how did you know?

125
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,960
When we work...

126
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,120
bumps and bruises are unavoidable.

127
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,800
General, aren't you making a mountain out of a molehill?

128
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
I'm making a big deal out of nothing?

129
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,520
Lu Li.

130
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:58,970
Yes, sir.

131
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,160
Let's go.

132
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,040
Do you really intend to let her serve in the inner courtyard?

133
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,700
What if she's Xue Fu's person?

134
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,060
If she were truly Xue Fu's person,

135
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,120
she would have had several opportunities to kill me.

136
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,780
Why hasn't she made a move yet?

137
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,420
What if she has other intentions?

138
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,880
Then let's wait and see.

139
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,840
It smells so good.

140
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,640
She must be poisoning it, right?

141
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,480
Lu Li, stop her!

142
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,200
General, don't go!

143
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,440
A Li, Yi Yang,

144
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,080
what brings you here?

145
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,560
Where I'm from,

146
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,860
we usually eat fruits.

147
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,720
But,

148
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,520
I heard from the cook here

149
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,720
that your dishes need to be stir-fried

150
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,850
and seasoned with various spices.

151
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,360
So,

152
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,200
I followed his instructions

153
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,080
and prepared everything accordingly.

154
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,610
How is it?

155
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,490
Doesn't it look delicious?

156
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,100
Impressive, impressive.

157
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,560
You come.

158
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,290
Fortunately, the general is strong and healthy.

159
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,170
This small amount of poison

160
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,920
shouldn't be too much for him to handle, right?

161
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:54,800
I have something to attend to.

162
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,320
Poisoning?

163
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,180
You should take it to the general.

164
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:03,820
