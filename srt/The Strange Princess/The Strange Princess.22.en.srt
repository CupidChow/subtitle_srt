1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,280
I won't punish you.

3
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,640
What are you still arguing about?

4
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,440
You may leave.

5
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,000
Yes.

6
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,400
Your Majesty.

7
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,210
How can you endure this?

8
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,000
As long as the Lu family is loyal,

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,960
a bad habit

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,160
is nothing.

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,880
The Lu family has a great influence on the army.

12
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,410
I just ascended the throne.

13
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,880
I have to rely on their family to stabilize the morale of the army.

14
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,520
When I control everything,

15
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,800
the Lu family will be useless.

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,920
When the birds have been shot down,

17
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,240
a good bow is stored away;

18
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,320
when the cunning hare is dead,

19
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,920
the hunting dogs are cooked.

20
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,320
You Majesty is wise and thoughtful.

21
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,680
I admire you very much.

22
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,320
Are you praising me?

23
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,280
Study more if you're ignorant.

24
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,720
Don't use it right away.

25
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,960
You are embarrassing me.

26
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,479
Yes.

27
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:43,200
I will study more.

28
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,200
Have Qian'er ever

29
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,680
come across with an old ministers of the previous dynasty?

30
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,240
No.

31
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,240
Has anyone in the community ever questioned

32
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,880
the cause of the late Emperor's death?

33
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,600
No.

34
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,880
Then she's useless.

35
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,120
I understand.

36
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,520
Soon,

37
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,520
Princess Qian'er will be seriously ill

38
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,520
and die.

39
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
No one in the world

40
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,120
can threaten Your Majesty anymore.

41
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,870
Lu Tianxing.

42
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,640
I want to see

43
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,320
if it's really as you said.

44
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,150
Listen up.

45
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,960
Charged into the courtyard

46
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,520
and grab that man.

47
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,079
Yes.

48
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,079
Can you

49
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,960
stop acting like a woman?

50
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,040
I want to.

51
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,960
Lu Tianxing said

52
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,920
he's acting for others.

53
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,880
What is this called?

54
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,120
It's just a show.

55
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,400
Tianxing endures humiliation

56
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,520
to gain the trust of Prince Ying.

57
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,980
You shouldn't say that about him.

58
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,200
Jiang Kelan, what are you doing?

59
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,440
Qian'er, step aside.

60
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,120
I must

61
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,280
kill this guy for us.

62
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,760
Go ahead.

63
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,079
You want to separate Tianxing and me?

64
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:16,800
It is impossible.

65
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,200
You...

66
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,800
Stop!

67
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,370
Don't worry.

68
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,560
With me here,

69
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,780
no one dares to harm even a single hair on you.

70
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,840
Princess.

71
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,720
Why do you have to go against a civilian?

72
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,800
Tianxing,

73
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,920
Aren't you sorry for what you did

74
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,040
to me?

75
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,840
What about Qian'er?

76
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,440
I'm going to beat this man to death with the stick

77
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,360
and take you back.

78
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,280
His Majesty has approved it.

79
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,400
What did you say?

80
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,140
His Majesty has agreed

81
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,020
the matter between me and him.

82
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,560
Impossible.

83
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,920
Absolutely impossible.

84
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,370
If you don't believe me,

85
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,080
you can go to the palace and ask His Majesty.

86
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,000
That's absolutely impossible.

87
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,740
I'm going to ask my father.

88
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,720
This is absolutely impossible.

89
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,120
Princess.

90
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:12,880
Let's go.

91
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,079
Lu,

92
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,000
I think you messed it up.

93
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,600
If she comes every day,

94
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,960
who can stand it?

95
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,160
Don't talk nonsense.

96
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,440
I trust Tianxing.

97
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,440
Get ready.

98
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,810
If nothing happens,

99
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,850
you can leave the city in a few days.

100
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,000
A princess

101
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,040
should be tolerant.

102
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,000
He is with another man.

103
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,159
How can I bear it?

104
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:45,620
Well...

105
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,240
What do you want me to do?

106
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,560
Kill that man.

107
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,400
It's not easy for me to stabilize the Lu family.

108
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,040
How can I start another conflict

109
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,300
over a trivial matter?

110
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,560
I'm guilty.

111
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,240
I came to ask for the exile of that person

112
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,540
to end this ill-fated relationship.

113
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,720
Do you really think so?

114
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,880
I've decided to follow His Majesty.

115
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,360
Even if I don't want to let go, I'll let go.

116
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,240
Is that okay?

117
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
In that case,

118
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,120
let's do it this way.

119
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,720
Also, Princess Qian'er

120
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,080
is the descendant of the late Emperor.

121
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,520
If she remains in the Imperial City,

122
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,120
it'll be unfavorable for Your Majesty.

123
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,880
Why don't we exile them together?

124
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,280
Do you really think so?

125
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,640
I'm loyal to Your Majesty.

126
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,680
Heaven and Earth are witnesses.

127
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,680
Good.

128
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,800
Very good.

129
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,100
I'll do as you said.

130
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

131
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,160
It is the most dangerous after you go out of the city.

132
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,620
Don't let your guard down.

133
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,650
Don't worry.

134
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
I will be careful.

135
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,240
Your Majesty.

136
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,080
How is it?

137
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,400
I've ordered people to deploy troops on the way

138
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,480
to act as robbers.

139
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,240
As long as the Princess of the Former Emperor shows up,

140
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,770
she won't be able to return.

141
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,640
Send someone to keep an eye on the Lu family as well.

142
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,440
If Lu Tianxing doesn't take any action,

143
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,710
we can proceed at ease.

144
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,920
Otherwise,

145
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,350
I have to shed tears to kill my beloved general.

146
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,960
Okay.

147
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,159
I'll send someone to keep an eye on him.

148
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:33,640
No.

149
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,920
Go in person.

150
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:35,880
Yes.

151
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,190
I've finally become an official of the imperial court,

152
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,250
and now I'm here again to rob  someone.

153
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,560
Qian, you're so unkind.

154
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,360
Cheer up.

155
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,000
No matter it's a man or a woman,

156
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,200
kill them all!

157
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,160
Are you nervous?

158
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,960
I-I am a woman now.

159
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,040
If the subordinates of Prince Ying are interested in me,

160
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,240
and what to do something to me,

161
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,040
how can I not be nervous?

162
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,159
Brothers,

163
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,000
charge!

164
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,120
You...

165
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,159
Who are you?

166
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,620
Those who want to kill you.

167
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,960
I shouldn't have listened to Qian.

168
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
Go and have a look.

169
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,960
Trying to rob us?

170
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:22,960
No way.

171
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,850
Princess, don't be scared.

172
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,720
It's me.

173
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,840
As you expected,

174
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,360
Prince Ying arranged his men

175
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,020
to assassinate the princess.

176
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,679
The princess has joined the volunteer army.

177
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,440
She's safe.

178
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,400
But the missing princess

179
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,880
will be heard soon.

180
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,080
I wonder how you can get away.

181
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,860
It's easy for me to escape,

182
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,490
but I'm afraid I can't convince my father.

183
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,880
In order to avoid war,

184
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,610
he had to submit to Prince Ying.

185
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,160
If I raise an army,

186
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,400
he must be in danger.

187
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,560
At this point,

188
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,670
we can only use force.

189
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,360
Okay.

190
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,620
You make the arrangement.

191
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,140
What about you?

192
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,560
Princess Lan'er is watching me closely.

193
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,280
I have to deal with her first.

194
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,080
Otherwise, I can't go anywhere.

195
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,300
Prince Ying is unforgivable.

196
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,810
But Lan'er is innocent.

197
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,960
I can't get her involved.
