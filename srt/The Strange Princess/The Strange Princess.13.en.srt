1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,880
Tianxing.

3
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,920
Ma Dayou?

4
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,560
Why are you here?

5
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,280
Where is the princess?

6
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,240
She went to Kelan's room tonight.

7
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,960
Although you've changed your attire,

8
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,760
you shouldn't walk around in the mansion.

9
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,290
If someone recognizes you,

10
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,860
it'll be another problem.

11
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,880
Are you...

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,039
worried about me?

13
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,200
I'm reminding you

14
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,930
so that you won't cause Qian'er or me trouble.

15
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:18,960
Okay.

16
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,039
I see.

17
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,039
I'm going back first.

18
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,320
Rest early.

19
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,300
Stay here tonight,

20
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,520
just in case.

21
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,240
Why are you laughing?

22
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,500
You sleep on the floor.

23
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,720
Okay.

24
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,000
I'll... sleep on the floor.

25
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,950
Qian'er, it's time to get up.

26
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,600
Let me get some more sleep.

27
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,560
Gosh.

28
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,600
Are all married women like this?

29
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,400
It's so horrible.

30
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,880
A few ladies from noble families

31
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,040
want to see you today.

32
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,360
Why?

33
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,680
I told them

34
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,160
you're the most talented girl in Imperial City

35
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,840
and you're versatile.

36
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
They're not convinced.

37
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,520
They want to compete with you.

38
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,560
I'm here to avenge my father.

39
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,960
I don't want to waste my time on you girls.

40
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,580
Why are you standing here?

41
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,440
I have a stomachache.

42
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,600
I need to go to the toilet.

43
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,120
The toilet is in front.

44
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,920
There's a shooting star!

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,040
There are no shooting stars in the daytime.

46
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,320
Just come with me.

47
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,720
They are waiting for you.

48
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,040
Let's go.

49
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,280
I... I have a stomachache.

50
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,160
Let's go.

51
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,360
How's the investigation going?

52
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,690
I only found it strange.

53
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,920
Nothing else.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,800
If he wants to start a rebellion,

55
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,140
he'll need troops and horses.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,920
Go investigate

57
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,000
where major construction projects have taken place

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,480
or where there have been unexplained disappearances of people these years.

59
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,040
There must be traces.

60
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,160
Yes.

61
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,960
I hope His Majesty's guess is wrong.

62
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,480
This is...

63
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,300
a memorial to impeach officials in Prince Ying's fief.

64
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,880
The weather has been good in Prince Ying's fief these years.

65
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,550
Our country's corvée and taxation burdens are not very heavy.

66
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,640
But it's still difficult

67
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,000
for local civilians to survive.

68
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,440
A few days ago, someone

69
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,130
secretly reported to me

70
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,880
that Prince Ying wants to start a rebellion.

71
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,340
I asked someone to investigate it secretly.

72
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,760
I only caught some unimportant people.

73
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,560
What's strange is

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,710
the huge amount of money

75
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,880
obtained from the civilians

76
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,760
is nowhere to find.

77
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,159
Prince Ying is a thrifty man.

78
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,520
He's known as a virtuous prince.

79
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,000
I had a few dealings with him.

80
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,680
Maybe I was blinded by the officials in his mansion.

81
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,760
Your Majesty, why don't you summon him here and ask him?

82
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,560
I know my own brother well.

83
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,400
He looks plain and honest,

84
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,760
but he's actually very scheming.

85
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,440
If he doesn't want you to know,

86
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,120
you won't be able to notice it at all.

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,760
If he really is a virtuous prince,

88
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,240
he wouldn't have let his servant hurt someone else.

89
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,770
They even went to his mansion to seek revenge.

90
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,700
If he's not a virtuous prince,

91
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,920
he must have been pretending to be like this

92
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,630
on purpose.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,880
Tianxing,

94
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,080
Qian'er will go to Prince Ying's Mansion to visit him and have fun.

95
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,040
This is

96
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,159
a perfect chance to investigate Prince Ying.

97
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,400
Then Qian'er will be in danger.

98
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,440
So,

99
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,620
you can't tell her about this.

100
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,240
Take some elite men with you to investigate in secret.

101
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,280
Once you find out Prince Ying intends to start a rebellion,

102
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,840
return to Imperial City immediately.

103
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,280
Don't act rashly.

104
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,600
After you left last night,

105
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,960
I received news that the servant in Prince Ying's Mansion

106
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,710
who beat your father to death

107
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,560
lives here.

108
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,020
I asked someone to ask around.

109
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,520
After he beat your father to death, he left Prince Ying's Mansion

110
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,030
and became an itinerant businessman.

111
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,680
Let's catch him and ask him

112
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,400
whether it was Prince Ying

113
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,930
who ordered him to beat the old chief to death.

114
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:39,880
Let's go.

115
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,640
Someone has been following us.

116
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,640
Don't look at him.

117
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,280
Let's go.

118
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,480
Tianxing,

119
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,450
why have you been following me?

120
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,400
You ruined my plan.

121
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,240
Princess, you always said

122
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,800
Princess Qian'er is the most talented girl in the capital.

123
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,920
You said it

124
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,680
like she's incomparable in this world.

125
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,560
We have always

126
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,760
wanted to see if it's true.

127
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,720
That's right.

128
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,850
Princess, you must show us what you're capable of today.

129
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Qian'er,

130
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,680
they are very arrogant

131
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,600
just because

132
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,320
they read more books than me.

133
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,080
A few days ago,

134
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,360
they even won some money equal to my two months' salary.

135
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,680
Today, you must teach them a lesson

136
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,940
and win the money back.

137
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,159
These bitches

138
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,760
are really annoying.

139
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,710
Why do they have to compete with me

140
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,400
in poems and songs?

141
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,800
If I had known this,

142
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,730
I would have learned for a few more days in the palace.

143
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,680
Girls,

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,530
why don't we compete in something else today?

145
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,840
How about martial arts?

146
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,240
You married the young general of General's Mansion.

147
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,370
We are no match for you in martial arts.

148
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,520
Besides,

149
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,160
we are all women.

150
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,290
It's inappropriate to wield weapons.

151
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,560
Princess, you don't want to agree to our proposal.

152
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,360
Is it because you are afraid?

153
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,160
Who said Qian'er is afraid?

154
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,960
She's worried you'll be stunned by her.

155
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,720
She's just giving you an out.

156
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,240
Qian'er,

157
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,920
just do me this favor.

158
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,400
Bring it on.

159
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,200
Should we bet something?

160
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,190
Good idea.

161
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,000
How about this?

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,960
Let's not bet money today.

163
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,000
Whoever loses should let the rest of us

164
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,600
draw a turtle on her face. What do you think?

165
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,960
Okay.

166
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,600
Okay, let's begin.

167
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,760
Qingyu,

168
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,400
go find Ma Dayou and Lu Tianxing now.

169
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,040
Yes.
