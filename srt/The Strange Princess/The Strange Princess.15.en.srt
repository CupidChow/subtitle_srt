00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,680
Your Highness!

3
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,040
Qian'er!

4
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,560
Your Highness!

5
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,480
What's wrong?

6
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,440
Your Highness,

7
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,600
if you don't want to compete, it's okay.

8
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,060
Why did you hurt yourself?

9
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,160
There's no wound.

10
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,760
Why is there suddenly blood?

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,960
The wound is on him.

12
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,770
Something happened to him.

13
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,960
Are you okay?

14
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,520
It's just a flesh wound.

15
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,440
I'm fine.

16
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,280
Lu Ming and I will cover for you so that you can leave first.

17
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,680
You take Princess back to the palace immediately

18
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,560
and report everything to His Majesty.

19
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,240
No.

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,820
Let's leave together.

21
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,360
Dayou,

22
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,200
go!

23
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,200
Tianxing, watch out!

24
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,360
Dayou!

25
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,180
Your Highness!

26
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,760
Your Highness, what's wrong?

27
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,120
Hurry!

28
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,720
Your Highness!

29
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,120
Go get a doctor, quickly!

30
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,320
Don't scare me, Your Highness!

31
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,200
Qian'er!

32
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,480
Go get a doctor, quickly!

33
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,760
Go and tell your dad to save them!

34
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,800
Okay, I'll go.

35
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,500
Your Highness!

36
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,360
How do you feel now, Your Highness?

37
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,360
Your Highness, don't scare me.

38
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,240
Your Highness, don't scare me.

39
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,120
Your Highness.

40
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,120
Dayou!

41
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,640
Take him away!

42
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
Your Highness,

43
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,720
Her Highness has no external injuries,

44
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,840
yet there's inexplicable bleeding.

45
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,000
In my opinion,

46
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,200
it's due to being overwhelmed by anger and anxiety.

47
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,880
Overwhelmed by anger and anxiety?

48
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,720
Yes.

49
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,560
I'll go prepare two doses of medicinal decoctions to regulate her condition.

50
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,290
Once she takes them and has a rest, she'll be fine.

51
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,240
You may leave.

52
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,240
Yes.

53
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,280
Tell me,

54
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,160
what exactly happened?

55
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,120
I don't know.

56
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,450
Today, Qian'er and someone else had arranged to compare...

57
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,920
compare...

58
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,000
Tell me.

59
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,520
To compare their husbands.

60
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,760
But we waited for so long,

61
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,480
her husband still hadn't shown up.

62
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,480
Qian'er was so anxious and angry

63
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,480
that she coughed up blood.

64
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,800
Absurd!

65
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,150
You stay here with her

66
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,400
until she recovers.

67
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,399
I'll go find your unreliable brother-in-law.

68
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,920
Lu Tianxing isn't someone who acts irresponsibly.

69
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,920
Qian'er is like this,

70
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,520
yet he still hasn't shown up.

71
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,040
Could it be...

72
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,040
could it be that I was right?

73
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,820
Your Highness.

74
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,060
Close off all four city gates.

75
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,320
If anyone suspicious is found leaving the city,

76
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,400
apprehend them immediately.

77
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:50,960
Yes.

78
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,360
Miss Yang.

79
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,600
Surrender.

80
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,159
Qian Yikuang,

81
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,100
it was Ma Dayou who took you in.

82
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,040
Yet, you betrayed him!

83
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,960
He took me in?

84
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,970
Since it's come to this,

85
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,520
I'll tell the truth.

86
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,360
I was originally a guard in Prince Ying's Mansion.

87
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,760
Prince Ying needed a place to gather troops for his grand cause,

88
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,320
so I pretended to be a bandit

89
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,850
and came to Jimao Mountain.

90
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,990
Now, our king is about to rebel.

91
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,800
You can't stop us.

92
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,360
Miss Yang,

93
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,360
surrender now.

94
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,400
I'll put in a good word for you with His Highness.

95
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,000
Maybe he'll spare your life.

96
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,040
Qian Yikuang.

97
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,560
I'll kill you!

98
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:47,880
Your Highness!

99
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,440
Qian'er.

100
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,600
Your Highness, you're awake.

101
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,460
Your Highness.

102
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,800
Qian'er,

103
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,000
how do you feel?

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,400
Your Highness.

105
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:54,840
Qian'er,

106
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,280
where are you going with your condition?

107
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,360
Something happened.

108
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,040
Something must have happened to him.

109
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,680
I have to find him!

110
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,200
Your Highness, you can't get off the bed now.

111
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,160
Tianxing is wise and brave.

112
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,080
Nothing would happen to him.

113
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,540
I'm not talking about him!

114
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,560
Your Highness.

115
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,820
Your Highness, you can't get off the bed.

116
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,160
Your Highness!

117
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,840
Qian'er!

118
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,320
Your Highness!

119
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:08,920
Your Highness, what's wrong?

120
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,590
Qian'er!

121
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,520
It's burning!

122
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,000
Go get the doctor!

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,280
Yes!

124
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:14,960
Go!

125
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,720
Qian'er?

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,760
Qian'er!

127
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,960
Qian'er!

128
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,000
Why were you so careless?

129
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,200
Well...

130
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,760
I didn't know

131
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,360
that Ma Dayou and Lu Tianxing

132
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,880
would appear at the same time.

133
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,520
Have you found them?

134
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,240
I have arranged manpower on the ways

135
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,600
to the palace and the prince's mansion.

136
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,640
Once they show up,

137
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,320
we'll take them all down.

138
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,880
However,

139
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,120
I'm now worried that perhaps

140
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,570
the Imperial City has made preparations.

141
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
It's impossible.

142
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,880
No, my brother is just suspicious.

143
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,480
If there were solid evidence,

144
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,000
it wouldn't just be Lu Tianxing coming,

145
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,770
it would be an army pressing in.

146
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,880
Brother,

147
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,360
for such matters,

148
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,240
suspicion is enough.

149
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,640
There's no need for evidence.

150
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,120
What should we do next?

151
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,360
Let's prepare on both fronts.

152
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,440
You continue to send people to search for Lu Tianxing.

153
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,840
The rest of the troops stationed in the fortresses

154
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,560
move towards the Imperial City.

155
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,360
No matter whether they have evidence,

156
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,020
we must seize the initiative.

157
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,480
I will have someone keep an eye on Princess.

158
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,370
Lu Tianxing is Prince Consort.

159
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,640
He will come to rescue her no matter what.

160
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,600
Okay.

161
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,800
I'll arrange it now.

162
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,680
Hang in there.

163
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,040
They have arranged a lot of manpower

164
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,770
on the way to the Imperial City.

165
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,280
We can't go any further.

166
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,280
Ma Dayou.

167
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,180
Ma Dayou...

168
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,570
I need to find a place for us to rest.

169
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,200
Tianxing.

170
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,960
Tianxing.

171
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,440
Don't leave me.

172
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,410
Tianxing, I didn't mean it.

173
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,520
Tianxing.

174
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,880
I'm here.

175
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,560
I'm here.

176
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,200
Tianxing, I'm sorry.

177
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,000
What's the use

178
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,770
of saying these now?

179
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,120
You're so badly injured.

180
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,520
I wonder if Qian'er

181
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,200
has been affected.

182
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,480
Your Highness. Your Highness.

183
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,400
Her Highness is awake.

184
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,120
Qian'er,

185
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,160
how do you feel?

186
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,960
Qingyu,

187
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,720
go get some water.

188
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,320
Yes.

189
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,200
I don't feel too bad.

190
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,480
Just a bit weak.

191
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,720
You scared me so badly, Qian'er.

192
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,840
Let's not compete with her.

193
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,640
Let's not.

194
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,920
What are you talking about?

195
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,240
It was all my fault.

196
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,800
It was my competitiveness

197
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,040
that caused you to be angry like this.

198
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,680
I was not angry about this.

199
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,800
But I clearly saw

200
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,560
you were so angry that you coughed up blood.

201
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,090
Even the doctor said you were overwhelmed by anger and anxiety.

202
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,600
Yes.

203
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,440
I was anxiety.

204
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,980
Where are they?

205
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,400
Have they come back?

206
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,240
Tianxing hasn't come back all night.

207
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,120
When I see him,

208
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,640
I'm definitely going to kick his ass.

209
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,100
Where is Study Partner Ma?

210
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,160
I haven't seen him.

211
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,640
Qingyu, hurry.

212
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,560
Go out with me.

213
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,680
Your Highness,

214
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,400
considering your current state of health,

215
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,840
you shouldn't go out.

216
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,080
It's a matter of life and death.

217
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,340
You don't understand.

218
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,400
Hurry!
