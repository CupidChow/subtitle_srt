[Episode 8]

4
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,360
Damn Ma,

5
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,830
where did he go again?

6
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,349
It's time.

7
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,820
The bride and bridegroom come forward.

8
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,750
Take the first bow to Heaven and Earth.

9
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,230
Take the second bow to your parents.

10
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,550
Bow to each other.

11
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,000
Rise.

12
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:40,400
The ceremony has been completed.

13
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,890
Take the bride to the bridal chamber.

14
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,450
Your Highness.

15
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,600
I'm exhausted.

16
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,060
-Who is it?
-It's me.

17
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,900
You scared me.

18
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,900
Why are you here?

19
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:18,880
You can't be here.

20
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,920
Hurry.

21
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,579
-I'm not leaving.
-Leave now.

22
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,870
I feel uncomfortable

23
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,520
at the thought that you're going to sleep with Tianxing.

24
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,760
I'm going to sleep with him on behalf of you.

25
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,200
I won't sleep with him.

26
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,329
If someone finds out

27
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,120
you are here,

28
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,070
we won't be able to explain.

29
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:37,750
Hurry.

30
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,510
Hurry.

31
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,120
Leave.

32
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,150
Promise me

33
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,470
you won't touch him.

34
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,550
I swear to God

35
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,590
I won't let him touch you.

36
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,950
Wait.

37
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,310
Do you mean

38
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,760
you don't want him to touch me

39
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,350
or you don't want me to touch him?

40
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,040
Prince Consort,

41
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,970
you're back.

42
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,750
Qingyu,

43
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:02,860
go to bed early.

44
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,120
You don't need to serve us here.

45
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,670
Yes.

46
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,030
Qian'er,

47
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,110
why did you...

48
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,020
remove the veil?

49
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,430
I...

50
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,280
I'm so happy.

51
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,900
I can't wait.

52
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:21,810
I'm happy too.

53
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,590
I know.

54
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,230
Qian'er.

55
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,530
I forgot to close the door.

56
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,600
Every minute of this night is precious.

57
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,440
I don't want to leave you even just for a moment.

58
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,079
Just

59
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,360
ask Qingyu to close the door.

60
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,650
But I just asked Qingyu to go back.

61
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:58,730
Well...

62
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,150
Qingyu is back.

63
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,070
Look.

64
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,080
The door is closed, right?

65
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,050
That's strange.

66
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:15,950
Whatever.

67
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,320
Let's continue.

68
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,709
Are you tired?

69
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,460
Do you want to rest?

70
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,550
I just...

71
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,260
I...

72
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,870
You know what?

73
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,110
Tonight, you kept me waiting for you.

74
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,350
I'm exhausted.

75
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:37,880
Well...

76
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,000
let me massage your feet.

77
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,530
You stood all day today.

78
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:47,790
It hurts?

79
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,060
I have to use a lot of strength.

80
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,800
Otherwise,

81
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,480
it will hurt more tomorrow.

82
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,510
Who's outside?

83
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,110
Young Master,

84
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,420
Master asked you to go to the front hall.

85
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,020
He has something to tell you.

86
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,470
Why does my father want to see me?

87
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,510
Since he wants to see you at this hour,

88
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,080
it must be something very important.

89
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,920
Go now.

90
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,830
I have to go.

91
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,420
Qian'er, wait for me.

92
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:12,930
Wait for me.

93
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:13,970
Okay. Okay.

94
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,150
Be careful.

95
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,750
What are you doing?

96
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,590
Why did you come in?

97
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,720
What do you want now?

98
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:29,850
Good.

99
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,750
You're still wearing your clothes.

100
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,909
But just now, you...

101
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,890
Why did it sound so...

102
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,630
Your husband massaged my foot.

103
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,030
What else would we do?

104
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:45,990
Do you think we...

105
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,390
Who...

106
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,380
Who asked you to scream so loudly?

107
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,490
Fine.

108
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,840
I'll shut my mouth later, okay?

109
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,070
No.

110
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,930
I'm still worried.

111
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,350
Don't worry.

112
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,020
I won't let him succeed.

113
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,270
I asked you not to sleep with him.

114
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,950
I didn't ask you to murder him.

115
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,570
Then tell me what I should do.

116
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,310
I have an idea.

117
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,670
What's a period?

118
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,500
Don't be so loud.

119
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,450
I got it.

120
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,070
No wonder.

121
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,540
I thought I had internal injuries last time.

122
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,340
Gosh.

123
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:40,909
The blood...

124
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:42,440
The blood flowed like water.

125
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,240
Stop talking.

126
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,800
I'll use this as an excuse.

127
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,040
Good.

128
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,230
Hurry.

129
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,300
He's back so soon.

130
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,560
Why did your father want to see you?

131
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,020
No one wanted to see me.

132
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,880
My father never asked me there.

133
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,830
I wonder

134
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,710
who came up with this idea to joke with us.

135
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,010
Ignore them.

136
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,310
Let's continue.

137
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:20,840
Qian'er.

138
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,920
You still want to continue?

139
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,490
Qian'er.

140
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,110
Qian'er.

141
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,570
Lu,

142
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,159
I want to discuss something with you.

143
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:34,730
Go ahead.

144
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,030
There is...

145
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,790
inconvenience.

146
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,000
What inconvenience?

147
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,640
I mean...

148
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,390
I mean...

149
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,220
I'm the boss of the bandits.

150
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,950
How can I

151
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,930
say this word out?

152
00:07:59,170 --> 00:07:59,850
I got it.

153
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,330
You know this?

154
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,260
Then...

155
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,660
let's sleep with each other

156
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,020
when you feel better.

157
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,940
It's just that...

158
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,090
this is the wedding night.

159
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,030
You must feel disappointed.

160
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,040
Not at all.

161
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,110
Not at all.

162
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,980
Let's go to bed then.

163
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,310
There's a rat.

164
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,110
A rat?

165
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,890
I'm going to beat it to death.

166
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,710
I'm out of breath.

167
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,140
If there's another rat, just ignore it.

168
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,300
I'm going to sleep.

169
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,880
Darn it.

170
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,190
I suffered a great loss.
