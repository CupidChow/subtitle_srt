00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,570
Princess Jiang Qian'er is leading a righteous army to fight against the rebellious prince.

3
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,760
General Qian,

4
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,320
you can go report now.

5
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,520
R-Report.

6
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,680
Report.

7
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,320
Report.

8
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,120
Report.

9
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,800
General!

10
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,240
General.

11
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,940
Your Highness,

12
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,000
please.

13
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,200
Soldiers!

14
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,360
Yes!

15
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,800
Well...

16
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,560
Let's go!

17
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,479
Yes!

18
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,420
Congratulations.

19
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,700
You finally look like a princess.

20
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,880
You're going too?

21
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,040
He killed my parents.

22
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,170
He's my sworn enemy.

23
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,160
I have to go.

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,660
If I can't come back this time,

25
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,850
do well in being Princess Qian'er.

26
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,200
Remember,

27
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,840
don't act like a man.

28
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,640
Stop talking nonsense.

29
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,870
You have to come back.

30
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,040
Otherwise,

31
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,100
I'll be a woman for the rest of my life.

32
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,520
Wait for me.

33
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,160
Lu Tianxing,

34
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,240
I treated you well.

35
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,560
I

36
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
don't accept benefits from a rebel.

37
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,640
I'll never forget to avenge the late emperor.

38
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,640
Today, you're going to be beheaded.

39
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,000
Where's Lan?

40
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,080
Don't worry.

41
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,760
I won't hurt her.

42
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,360
Bring it on then.

43
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,160
Soldiers,

44
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,840
the rebellious prince is going to fall.

45
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,840
Why are you still risking your lives for him?

46
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,420
Don't listen to his nonsense.

47
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,840
If I die,

48
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,000
you will die too.

49
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,160
I swear in the name of General's Mansion,

50
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,240
if you turn against him now,

51
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,680
you can atone for your crimes

52
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,940
and you won't be punished.

53
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,440
Guys,

54
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,770
let's turn against him!

55
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,520
You... You...

56
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,600
Prince Ying,

57
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,730
even God wants you dead.

58
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,160
Good.

59
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,160
There's one left.

60
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,480
You are loyal.

61
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,279
Qian'er,

62
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,000
I know I was wrong.

63
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,200
Since I'm your uncle,

64
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,240
please forgive me this time.

65
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,520
I want to tear you into pieces now

66
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,000
so that my parents can rest in peace.

67
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,159
Ma Dayou,

68
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,200
I'm talking to my niece.

69
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,520
This is the royal family's affair.

70
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
It's none of your business!

71
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,120
He is me, and I am him.

72
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,400
What he says counts too.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,800
If I kill you now,

74
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,720
Kelan will hate me very much.

75
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,440
If someone takes advantage of this,

76
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,360
there won't be an end for taking revenge.

77
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,000
I disagree.

78
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,040
He killed my father.

79
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,120
He's my sworn enemy.

80
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,960
Just kill him.

81
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,240
We can't kill him.

82
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,640
We must kill him.

83
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,100
I agree with the princess.

84
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,480
We're not going to kill him.

85
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,010
Kill him!

86
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,760
No!

87
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,080
Kill him!

88
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,760
No!

89
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,920
Kill him!

90
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,880
Enough!

91
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,600
Might is right.

92
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
I accept my fate.

93
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,520
Both of you

94
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,120
insulted me again and again.

95
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,440
If you want to kill me,

96
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,680
just do it!

97
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,360
Fine.

98
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,490
We're not going to kill him.

99
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,680
Get lost!

100
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,760
You...

101
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,640
really agree to let me go?

102
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,360
Just

103
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,280
stop nagging.

104
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,760
Get lost

105
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,090
before I change my mind!

106
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,000
Since I'm still alive,

107
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,480
one day, I will make a...

108
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,380
This has nothing to do with me.

109
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,200
It's finally peaceful in the palace.

110
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,520
Yes.

111
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,810
Do you want to leave?

112
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,440
Yes.

113
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,810
There are too many rules in the palace.

114
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,159
I live like a puppet every day.

115
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,720
It's not as comfortable as being the bandits' boss in Jimao Mountain.

116
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,560
But

117
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,390
I'm the princess in the eyes of others.

118
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,040
I'm the only decision-maker in the palace.

119
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,200
For you

120
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,080
and the people,

121
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,120
I have to stay.

122
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,520
Yes.

123
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,480
For you

124
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,560
and the brothers in Jimao Mountain,

125
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,800
I will do my best to be the patriarch.

126
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,630
Stay.

127
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,920
Stay here... forever.

128
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,680
Oh no.

129
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,800
Why did my heart flutter?

130
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,320
I...

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,880
Your Highness.

132
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,380
Your Highness.

133
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,320
Your Highness,

134
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,040
a western priest outside the palace wants to see you.

135
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,970
He said he has figured out a way to draw the lightning.

136
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,530
Let's go.

137
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,480
Sir,

138
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,400
will it work?

139
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,450
Don't worry.

140
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,400
I've done an experiment.

141
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,400
The lightning will come down along the rope.

142
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,500
As long as it thunders,

143
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,000
it'll strike the target.

144
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,180
Will the lightning...

145
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,840
strike them to death?

146
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,800
It's very likely.

147
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,840
So, everyone in front of the screen,

148
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,080
do not imitate.

149
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,900
In front of the screen?

150
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,440
What does it mean?

151
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,880
They are from another world.

152
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,320
You can't understand now.

153
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,240
You're so weird.

154
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,760
Thank you.

155
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,130
You're welcome.

156
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,280
Your Highness.
