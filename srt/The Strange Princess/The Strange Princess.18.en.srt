1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,360
Look.

3
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,970
This will be your new place to live.

4
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,320
What a shabby place!

5
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,800
It's not even as good as Jimao Mountain.

6
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,880
Your Highness.

7
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,720
Please touch your head

8
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,440
to see if it's still on your neck.

9
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,200
His Majesty didn't kill you

10
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,400
because of the past affections.

11
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,060
He's already way too lenient.

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,800
Just be content.

13
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,980
It doesn't matter.

14
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,680
Look.

15
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:18,880
Our Master is the most sensible.

16
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,530
He's very flexible.

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,960
However,

18
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,600
I have to warn you.

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,660
Don't run away.

20
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,160
Don't make any trouble as the Princess of the Former Emperor.

21
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,240
Otherwise, you'll die.

22
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,720
Listen up, you guys.

23
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,479
Monitor this place.

24
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,400
If they dare to escape,

25
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,240
execute them immediately.

26
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,170
Don't hesitate.

27
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,200
Yes.

28
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,560
Don't go.

29
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,880
General Qian,

30
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,200
please show us mercy

31
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,039
and let us go back to Jimao Mountain. Okay?

32
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,360
We can at least farm there, right?

33
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,479
You think too much.

34
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,680
Jimao Mountain is the place where His Majesty stations troops.

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,340
It's a crucial military area.

36
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,760
No way.

37
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,640
You...

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,280
Look.

39
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,280
There's a meteor!

40
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,240
Screw you!

41
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,880
You traitor!

42
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,880
Traitor!

43
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,080
How dare you insult me?

44
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,600
You insulted me.

45
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,200
Have you forgotten

46
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,200
the fear of being controlled by him?

47
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,600
Ma Dayou!

48
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,680
Move aside!

49
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,610
The country has been occupied.

50
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,840
Where is my home?

51
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,210
The country has been occupied.

52
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,240
Did you really move aside, as I said?

53
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,520
I can't beat him.

54
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,600
Ma Dayou!

55
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,160
I don't need to argue with a loser.

56
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,970
Don't be afraid.

57
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,000
I never hit women.

58
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,160
Really?

59
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,560
Really.

60
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,760
Qian,

61
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,520
you are really a man.

62
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

63
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,440
Screw you.

64
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,280
Did you really think I was praising you?

65
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,280
You traitor!

66
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,480
You traitor!

67
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,150
You traitor!

68
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,040
Traitor!

69
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,440
Come on, Qingyu.

70
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,320
You kick him, too.

71
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:12,880
No, no, no.

72
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,720
He doesn't hit women anyway.

73
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,920
Just help me kick him.

74
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,800
You've gone too far!

75
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,040
You don't keep your promise?

76
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,120
Help!

77
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,440
Qian Yikuang is hitting women!

78
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,200
Help!

79
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
Wait and see.

80
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,320
Sooner or later,

81
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,680
I'll kill you.

82
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,320
Wait and see.

83
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,760
Father.

84
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,280
Mother.

85
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,079
Qian'er is coming to you.

86
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,380
What are you doing?

87
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,520
Qingyu, help!

88
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:00,880
Okay.

89
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,080
Ma, what's wrong?

90
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,080
I can't lift him.

91
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,520
Your Highness.

92
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,760
Your Highness, what's wrong with you?

93
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,620
Your Highness.

94
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,610
Your Highness, what's wrong with you?

95
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,060
Your Highness.

96
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,720
Your Highness.

97
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,320
Hurry.

98
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,920
Move the chair here.

99
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,360
Okay.

100
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,280
Here, Your Highness.

101
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,260
Be careful.

102
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,620
Your Highness.

103
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,800
Leave him alone.

104
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,360
Let me see how you are.

105
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,960
What are you doing?

106
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,480
Are you going to kill me?

107
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,280
I have no home.

108
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,960
I have no home.

109
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,640
I have experience

110
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,570
in having a dead father.

111
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,160
In the first few days,

112
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,440
it was indeed challenging.

113
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,920
But you have to find some motivation to live on.

114
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,240
Look at me.

115
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,520
Revenge is my motivation.

116
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,000
Revenge?

117
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,170
I'm going to avenge Father and Mother.

118
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,040
But Tianxing betrayed us.

119
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,640
How can I take revenge?

120
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,360
As long as you're alive,

121
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,140
there will always be a chance.

122
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,800
Besides,

123
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,120
you still have me.

124
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,120
And there's also Qingyu.

125
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,680
What's the use of you?

126
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,000
Why are we useless?

127
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,080
We can do many things.

128
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,720
We can…

129
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,120
We...

130
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,600
Qingyu.

131
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,120
What can we do?

132
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,360
I can make the bed,

133
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,240
serve tea,

134
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,360
and serve Your Highness.

135
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,920
Now, I don't need a servant.

136
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,050
What else can you do?

137
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,200
I can say good morning to you in the morning

138
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,480
and good night to you at night.

139
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,520
You are indeed useless.

140
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,160
But that's all I know.

141
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,800
Qingyu,

142
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,040
go get some food.

143
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,440
Okay.

144
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,360
I can do that.

145
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,200
How can I cook without rice?

146
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,890
Do you still want to die?

147
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,480
Then, get up

148
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
and get some food.

149
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,760
Why don't you go?

150
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,680
You're a man.

151
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,010
Of course you should go.

152
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,120
You are a man.

153
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,800
Qingyu.

154
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,560
Which one of us is a man?

155
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,160
Him.

156
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,080
I'm so hungry.

157
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
Your Highness, hang in there.

158
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,960
There will be food soon.

159
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
I'm so hungry.

160
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,600
Yes.

161
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,400
He's out.

162
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,840
How is it?

163
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,760
The boss said

164
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,960
they never accept paying on credit.

165
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,040
Then, do they need any factotum?

166
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,800
No.

167
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,760
What should we do?

168
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,480
You didn't die by hanging yourself.

169
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,800
We can't be starved to death in the end.

170
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,580
You're a woman now.

171
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,720
Why don't you go in and have a try?

172
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,840
I...

173
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,920
I used to be the mountain king.

174
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,440
I never paid for food.

175
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,159
I can't do anything about it.

176
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,240
I have an idea.

177
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,610
Come with me.

178
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,160
Candied haws!

179
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,620
Do you have an idea?

180
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,050
We'll talk when we're full.

181
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:20,760
Okay.

182
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,840
Qingyu,

183
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,800
give me the drumstick.

184
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,970
I can't eat anymore.

185
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,960
I'm full.

186
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,760
Waiter.

187
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,480
Check, please.

188
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,240
Coming.

189
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,919
Are you done?

190
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,600
Yes.

191
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,960
Thank you. Three taels of silver in total.

192
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,560
Three taels?

193
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,360
Okay.

194
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,160
Ask your manager to come here.

195
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,840
Okay.

196
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,920
Manager!

197
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,760
Do you need anything else?

198
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,560
Sir,

199
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,680
let's discuss something.

200
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:00,960
Go ahead.

201
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,820
It seems that your restaurant is in a good location.

202
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,960
The decoration is very elegant, too.

203
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,040
The business must be good, right?

204
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,760
Not bad.

205
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,920
You must need

206
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,200
some factotums to pick vegetables, wash dishes,

207
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,320
serve the food,

208
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,450
or things like that.

209
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,480
Miss,

210
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,160
next, are you going to say

211
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,800
you didn't bring money

212
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,660
and you'd like to pay it with work?

213
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,320
Smart.

214
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,910
No wonder you are the manager.

215
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,720
You're taking advantage of me?

216
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,480
I'm not short of people.

217
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,080
They do need girls in Yihong House next door.

218
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,840
You two look pretty.

219
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,200
Try it.

220
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,320
Forget it, then.

221
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
Pay for the meal.

222
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,040
I really don't have any money.

223
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,440
Really?

224
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,280
Guards!

225
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,360
Coming.

226
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:51,960
Coming.

227
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,680
Send them to Madam Liu next door.

228
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,200
As usual,

229
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,520
30 taels for a girl.

230
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,360
As for the male slave,

231
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,020
five taels.

232
00:09:59,360 --> 00:09:59,920
Okay.

233
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,360
Okay.

234
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,240
Come on.

235
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,040
Fine.

236
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
You, you go.

237
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,600
Up you go.

238
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,000
It's okay that we work next door.

239
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,760
How is it okay?

240
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
That's a brothel.

241
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,600
Brothel?

242
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,320
I'm not going to the brothel.

243
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,200
Don't come over.

244
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,360
So what if I come over?

245
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:13,890
Up you go!

246
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,920
Stop!
