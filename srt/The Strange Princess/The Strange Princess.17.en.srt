00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,000
General Lu.

3
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,600
We have no choice

4
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,380
but to imprison your son here.

5
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,000
When my army arrives at the city,

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,480
please open the city gate.

7
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,860
If you do me this favor,

8
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,880
your son will return safely

9
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,880
without any damage.

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,920
General Lu.

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,959
With Prince Ying's army approaching the city,

12
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,090
once the war starts,

13
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,780
the people of the Imperial City will suffer.

14
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,120
Please consider it carefully.

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,000
If I obey Prince Ying,

16
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,320
my son's life...

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,530
As long as you obey Prince Ying,

18
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,770
Young General Lu will be fine for sure.

19
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,560
For my son's life,

20
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,080
and for the people of the Imperial City,

21
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,120
I have to carry the stigma

22
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,160
of treason.

23
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,160
General Lu,

24
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,920
you're wrong.

25
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,600
When Prince Ying ascends the throne,

26
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,520
you'll be rewarded handsomely

27
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,620
as you contribute to his success.

28
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,520
Both of us are officials in the army.

29
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,760
I hope you can promote me by then.

30
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,600
Promote?

31
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,080
Yes.

32
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,040
Promote.

33
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:16,840
You...

34
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,710
Who do you think you are?

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,040
You are just a servant at Prince Ying's Mansion.

36
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,520
You're just a dog of his.

37
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,600
How dare you compare yourself to me?

38
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,600
Tell Prince Ying.

39
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,400
If he doesn't keep his promise

40
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,400
and hurt the people in the city,

41
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,440
I will risk my whole family

42
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:41,320
to die with him.

43
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,480
It's all my fault.

44
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,810
I knew Prince Ying might rebel,

45
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,920
but I still agreed to Qian'er's request.

46
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,200
Now that we're besieged by Prince Ying's army,

47
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,079
how can Qian'er not be affected?

48
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,280
Qian'er is his niece, after all.

49
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,400
I think Prince Ying will show mercy to her

50
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,200
because she's family.

51
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,640
Your Majesty!

52
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,720
Your Majesty!

53
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,920
Bad news, Your Majesty!

54
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,400
Say it.

55
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,280
General Lu opened the city gate

56
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,280
and let Prince Ying's Imperial Guards enter the city.

57
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,920
What?

58
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,880
They are rushing to the palace at the moment.

59
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,680
Now…

60
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,079
Now, they're almost at the palace gate!

61
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,200
Lu.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,400
How could that be?

63
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,480
Brother,

64
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,920
after so many years,

65
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,520
you still look the same.

66
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,440
Why?

67
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,680
Tell me.

68
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,120
Why?

69
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,760
Your Majesty,

70
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,750
I'm guilty.

71
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,320
I did it to protect the people in the Imperial City.

72
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,800
I had no choice.

73
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,640
Your Majesty,

74
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,640
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

75
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,280
Brother.

76
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,840
At this point,

77
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,320
you still don't understand.

78
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,440
You're a good person

79
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,840
but not a good emperor.

80
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
Where is Qian'er?

81
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,400
What did you do to my Qian'er?

82
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,810
Don't worry, Your Royal Highness.

83
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,000
Qian'er is my niece.

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,800
I watched her grow up.

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,600
She's just like my daughter.

86
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,800
When I ascend the throne,

87
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,400
she will still be a princess.

88
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,320
Your Majesty,

89
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,840
you should use nosism now.

90
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,560
Pass my order.

91
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,600
The late Emperor and Empress were severely ill

92
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,000
and died.

93
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,120
The late Emperor had no sons.

94
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,360
According to the rules of our ancestors,

95
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,600
a brother of the late Emperor should inherit the throne.

96
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,160
Hence, we inherited the throne.

97
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,080
You can't hide it from the world.

98
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,610
What's done is done for now.

99
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,200
Even if someone suspects me,

100
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,880
we'll already be in power.

101
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,760
What are we going to be afraid of?

102
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,440
Qian Yikuang.

103
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:18,960
Yes.

104
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,960
I'll leave the rest to you.

105
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,400
Remember,

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,530
if you dare to hurt Qian'er,

107
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,880
I won't let you go

108
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,360
even if I become a ghost!

109
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,320
Guards!

110
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,560
See the late Emperor and Empress off to the heaven!

111
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,000
Stop pacing back and forth.

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,080
Can you act a bit more like Ma Dayou?

113
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:53,840
Forget it.

114
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,640
I won't argue with you during this special period.

115
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,440
Any news?

116
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,240
Prince Ying...

117
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,600
He has already broken into the Imperial City.

118
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,600
His Majesty and Her Royal Highness hung themselves in the palace.

119
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,660
They've already ascended to heaven.

120
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,140
How could this happen?

121
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,260
How could this happen?

122
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,320
My Father and Mother...

123
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,480
Impossible.

124
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,860
I'm going to find them.

125
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,960
I'm going to find them.

126
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,440
I...

127
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,160
Ma.

128
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,920
Ma, why did you faint?

129
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,440
It’s a long story.

130
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,080
I'll explain it to you later.

131
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,800
Qian'er.

132
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,360
He just said, "My Father and Mother"...

133
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,800
What does that mean?

134
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,640
I don't have time

135
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,100
to explain that to you now.

136
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,280
I know!

137
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,000
I finally know

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,730
why you two feel the same things

139
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,840
and why he fainted

140
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,970
at the news of His Majesty's death.

141
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,440
There is only one answer.

142
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,200
He is a prince who has been living among the commoners.

143
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,880
You two are siblings!

144
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,290
There's no other explanation.

145
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,200
Great explanation.

146
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,930
Great explanation.

147
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,960
The Imperial City was indestructible.

148
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,090
How could it be broken into so quickly?

149
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,320
General Lu opened the city gate

150
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,720
and let Prince Ying in.

151
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,810
That's impossible!

152
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,900
My father would never do such a thing.

153
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,890
I'm going to find my father.

154
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,840
Move!

155
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,720
I'm going to find my father!

156
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,560
Get out of the way!

157
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,240
Get in.

158
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,560
I might as well faint, too.

159
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,640
Your Highness.

160
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,520
The carriage is ready.

161
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,250
Please go to the Imperial City.

162
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's just a matter of time before I die.

163
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,120
I'm going all out.

164
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,720
Guards!

165
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,120
Move them back.

166
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,160
Let's go back to the Imperial City!

167
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,400
Father, you want me to marry my brother-in-law, Tianxing?

168
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,440
The Lu family holds military power

169
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,000
and made great contributions this time.

170
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,530
I can't trust them totally.

171
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,480
If I can't order them around with total trust,

172
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,610
I'll have to eliminate them in secret.

173
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,039
Lu Tianxing is outstanding.

174
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,679
He should be able to be your match.

175
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,320
But he...

176
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,679
But he is Qian'er's husband.

177
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,640
This...

178
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,039
It's not difficult to deal with.

179
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,840
Just ask the Lu family to issue a divorce document.

180
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,140
I will never agree to that.

181
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,160
If you don't,

182
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,300
I can only bear the pain and kill their whole family.

183
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,840
Qian'er knows too much.

184
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,640
I can't keep her, either.

185
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,360
Father.

186
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,600
How could you do that?

187
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,200
Fine.

188
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,320
I'll agree.

189
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,920
That's good.

190
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,920
I'll send someone to inform Lu.

191
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,120
Do you think

192
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,000
I wanted to be a traitor?

193
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,760
Then why did you collude with Prince Ying?

194
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,320
I did it because of you!

195
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,600
You're the only descendant of the Lu family.

196
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,840
I'd rather die

197
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,640
than be a traitor.

198
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,320
Moreover,

199
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,370
His Majesty was Qian'er's father.

200
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,080
People in the city

201
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,200
all have wives, children,

202
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,000
parents, or siblings.

203
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,280
The same goes with the soldiers in the army.

204
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,520
Prince Ying has been planning it for a long time.

205
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,880
He has a big army.

206
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,000
Whether the Imperial City could be guarded

207
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,800
was not yet certain.

208
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,440
If I went full out to defend the city,

209
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,570
there would be war in the city for sure.

210
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,320
The people would be in misery.

211
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,360
One family cry is better than all the families cry.

212
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,640
I had no other choice

213
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,880
but to be a traitor.

214
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,000
Nonsense.

215
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,800
It's all nonsense!

216
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,640
The new Emperor just ordered

217
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,440
to marry Princess Lan to you.

218
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,720
You're going to be the Prince Consort again.

219
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,710
I won't agree.

220
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,400
You have to.

221
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,790
Our Lu family has made too much of a contribution.

222
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,650
The new Emperor will not trust us.

223
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,840
Qian'er is the only child of the late Emperor.

224
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,490
She can't escape death no matter what.

225
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,840
Only by you swallowing the insult

226
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,520
can we save many more lives.

227
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,520
From now on,

228
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,120
you are not allowed to go out.

229
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,640
Just wait for the wedding day.

230
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,600
I won't agree.
