4
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:45,770
Young General Lu,

5
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,030
according to the merchants nearby,

6
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:47,910
a few strangers went into

7
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:48,830
Hu's Rice Store in the afternoon.

8
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,150
I dare not alert them.

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,910
I've ordered someone to keep an eye on them.

10
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:52,750
Tell everyone

11
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,520
to go to Hu's Rice Store.

12
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,180
Dayou.

13
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,000
We're safe now.

14
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:02,910
I'm not Dayou.

15
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,220
I'm not Dayou.

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,680
Hu.

17
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:09,740
Go take a look.

18
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:13,990
Hu.

19
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,940
Open the door.

20
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,620
It's me

[Hu's Rice Store]

22
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:17,850
We're closed.

23
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,120
I'm Ma Dayou.

24
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,160
Be gentle.

25
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,390
Hu.

26
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,800
It's me, Hu.

27
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,550
Hu!

28
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,289
Miss Yang.

29
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,380
We found a spy.

30
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,039
You...

31
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:37,880
You...

32
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,810
I was right.

33
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:53,250
I...

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,890
It's all your fault.

35
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,870
Give it back to me!

36
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,360
Ma Dayou!

37
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,280
-Give it back to me.
-It's all your fault.

38
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,220
Ma Dayou.

39
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,630
You know this girl?

40
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,440
This girl?

41
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,880
He's not a girl.

42
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,080
I'm the girl.

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,320
No.

44
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,570
-I don't know what happened, either.
-It's all your fault.

45
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:06,320
Give me back my body!

46
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:06,920
Stop beating me!

47
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,080
Give me back my body! It's all your fault!

48
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,720
Stop arguing.

49
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,639
It's all your fault.

50
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,570
Say it one by one.

51
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,640
I was here to save my brothers.

52
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,720
I didn't expect that after a crash of thunder,

53
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,800
I would become the Princess.

54
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,880
You are the Princess?

55
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,600
I am the Princess.

56
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,110
I...

57
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,590
Listen, everyone inside.

58
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,600
Come out now.

59
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,400
Or we'll force our way in.

60
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:26,880
Come out!

61
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,040
Young General Lu,

62
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,100
it's the Princess.

63
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,740
It is Qian'er.

64
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,920
You despicable bandits!

65
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,250
I will kill you all!

66
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,480
Come here if you dare.

67
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,400
Let's see if I'll die first

68
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,160
or your Princess?

69
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,030
It's me, Tianxing.

70
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,350
It's me.

71
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,720
Tianxing.

72
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,210
Tianxing.

73
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,410
Hongsu.

74
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,600
Hongsu, watch out!

75
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,220
Hongsu.

76
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:01,760
Hongsu.

77
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,320
My Lady.

78
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,880
Don't come over.

79
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,270
Put your knives down.

80
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,240
Or I'll kill her.

81
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,520
Put them down.

82
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,010
Arrest them.

83
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,690
Your Highness,

84
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,710
I'm incompetent.

85
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,480
Sorry for startling you, Your Highness.

86
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,320
Your Highness,

87
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,250
are you alright?

88
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,400
What do you think?

89
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,510
I didn't check the almanac before going out today.

90
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,960
I'm so unlucky.

91
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,280
Tianxing.

92
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,420
I'm Qian'er, Tianxing.

93
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,310
Ma Dayou.

94
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,150
You won't escape.

95
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,180
You...

96
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,260
Why does no one believe me?

97
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,870
I'm really Qian'er.

98
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,040
Ma Dayou.

99
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,760
You're a man.

100
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,950
It's just death at worst.

101
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,210
What are you afraid of?

102
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,670
Lu,

103
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:54,230
can I have a word with you?

104
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,680
Do you know

105
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,990
why I am here?

106
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:59,020
Didn't those robbers bring you here?

107
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,010
Of course not.

108
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,870
I took His Majesty's…

109
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,960
I took His Majesty's secret order

110
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,310
to make use of this opportunity

111
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,660
to infiltrate Jimao Mountain

112
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,460
and divide them from the inside,

113
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,120
so that the bandits will be eliminated forever.

114
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,180
We'll ask His Majesty to prove it.

115
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,540
It's too late.

116
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,020
You'll make them suspicious.

117
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,410
What do you think we should do?

118
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,660
How about this?

119
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,440
Later,

120
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,730
I'll rush out.

121
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,460
Tell your soldiers to pretend to stop me.

122
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,490
Got it.

123
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,220
Lu Ming.

124
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:35,800
Come here.

125
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,280
Yes.

126
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,960
Take some men

127
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,640
to escort the Princess

128
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,700
back to the palace.

129
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,280
Yes.

130
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,440
Lu.

131
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:42,870
You...

132
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,470
Qian'er.

133
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,330
After I finish my task,

134
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,830
I'll play the game of soldiers and thieves with you.

135
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,690
Your Highness.

136
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,280
You're really something.

137
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,140
Your Highness.

138
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,800
Put your knives down.

139
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,340
Qian'er.

140
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,050
No!

141
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,630
Stop!

142
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,860
What are you doing?

143
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,480
You are forcing me.

144
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,840
If I die here today,

145
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,340
all of you are to be blamed.

146
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,960
Put down the knives.

147
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,760
Put down the knives.

148
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,230
Hongsu.

149
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,000
Hongsu.

150
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,560
Hurry.

151
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,420
Hongsu.

152
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,560
Hongsu.

153
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,230
Thanks.

154
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,490
You're welcome.

155
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,220
I love you.

156
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,520
You evil thief.

157
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,320
How dare you use my body to collude with the robbers?

158
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,520
I won't go with you.

159
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,270
What are you nagging about?

160
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,400
Hu, take him away.

161
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,470
Let's go, My Lady.

162
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,710
Tianxing, help me!

163
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:32,650
Tianxing!

164
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,680
Tianxing, help me!

165
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,430
Don't come over!

166
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,030
Tianxing.

167
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,200
Let's go.

168
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,800
Let's go.

169
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,200
Tianxing.

170
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,600
Go!

171
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,230
Tianxing.

172
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,760
Young General Lu.

173
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,470
Tianxing.

174
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,470
What should we do?

175
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,430
Follow them slowly.

176
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,350
Don't let them notice.

177
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes, sir!

178
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:51,960
Nonsense!

179
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,659
I've never given her a secret order.

180
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
I'm incompetent.

181
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,730
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

182
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,100
Although Qian'er is a little mischievous,

183
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,900
she has never done such a ridiculous thing before.

184
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,880
Could there be

185
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,000
more to it?

186
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,780
How are you going to

187
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,280
to deal with it?

188
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,680
I've decided

189
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,960
to disguise myself

190
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,660
and sneak into Jimao Mountain

191
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,860
to save the Princess.

192
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,760
Thank you for saving me, Your Highness.

193
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,760
I, Yang Hongsu,

194
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,910
am very grateful.

195
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,760
Officials and bandits are on different paths.

196
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,130
That's enough to see us off this far.

197
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,260
If you go further on,

198
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,980
I won't be able to protect you.

199
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,490
We're family. Don't be too polite with me.

200
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,190
Your Highness,

201
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,480
you talk wildly.

202
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,560
You behave just like us, the outlaws in the woods.

203
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,260
That's all I can say.

204
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,720
Where are they taking me?

205
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,680
Father and Mother

206
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,280
must be worried for me now.

207
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,270
I have to find a way to escape.

208
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,680
Ma Dayou,

209
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,360
it is nothing to fail once.

210
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,640
You have to pull yourself together.

211
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,250
He was very close to death.

212
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,000
It's only expected to be like that.

213
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,330
I'll talk to him for you.

214
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,820
Look at me.

215
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,070
Don't play dead here.

216
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,890
Get up!

217
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:09,710
Get up!

218
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,900
What are you doing?

219
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,690
Haven't you figured it out yet?

220
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,390
Now,

221
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,660
in their eyes,

222
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,400
you are the mighty

223
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,370
patriarch of Jimao Mountain.

224
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,760
If you want to live,

225
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,850
you have to play the patriarch well.

226
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,820
Don't act like a sissy all-day

227
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,100
and disgrace me.

228
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,390
Hongsu,

229
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,210
it's already dawn.

230
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,940
Let's go back to the mountain.

231
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,450
You're going, too?

232
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,320
Yes.

233
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,990
Ma Dayou.

234
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,020
What is going on here?

235
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,680
I...

236
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,710
Just find any excuse.

237
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,600
She is my wife.

238
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,650
What did you say?

239
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,310
He...

240
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,870
He's talking nonsense.

241
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,160
It's true.

242
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,990
What about me?

243
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,060
Who are you?

244
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,260
Second Master.

245
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,260
Second Master!

246
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,480
Bad news!

247
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,430
Bad news!

248
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,400
Why are you panicking?

249
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,190
Ma...

250
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,920
Ma Dayou is back.

251
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,880
What did you say?

252
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,200
I saw it clearly on the wall.

253
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,670
It is Ma Dayou, indeed.

254
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,800
But...

255
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,680
But that was a death trap.

256
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,320
Who would expect

257
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,640
that when the executioner's knife

258
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,520
was about to fall onto his neck,

259
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,070
Yang Hongsu suddenly came out

260
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,080
and saved him.

261
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,680
Who?

262
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,960
[Fortress Qingfeng]

263
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:36,919
Hongsu.

264
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,440
It's really not what you think.

265
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,549
Don't worry, Your Highness.

266
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:40,520
After we return,

267
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,200
I’ll ask him to write a divorce agreement.

268
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,789
-It won't affect you.
-Don’t.

269
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,880
Please don't.

270
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,830
Congratulations on your return, Master.

271
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,670
Brothers,

272
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,800
I'm back.

273
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,630
Master, you’re finally back.

274
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,240
I miss you so much.

275
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,480
My Master,

276
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:56,830
you're so…

277
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,670
Just cry over there.

278
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,800
Don't come over.

279
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,480
Second Master, no need to be so polite.

280
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,970
Please get up.

281
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,480
She is...

282
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,670
She is...

283
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,840
my wife.

284
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,580
I...

285
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,270
Then...

286
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,120
She…

287
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,280
Yang…

288
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,080
Yang…

289
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,870
Why are you looking at me?

290
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,030
Hongsu.

291
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,510
Listen to my explanation, Hongsu.

292
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,480
It's fine.

293
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,760
I've set the table for a banquet

294
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,020
to welcome our Master.

295
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,250
Who am I?

296
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,360
Master.

297
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,670
In that case,

298
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,320
should the whole fortress

299
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,000
listen to my orders?

300
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,630
Yes.

301
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,360
We'll all listen to you, Master.

302
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,280
Yes.

303
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:02,780
Good!

304
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,840
I want to take a bath and get changed.

305
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
Go boil the water.

306
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,080
Okay.

307
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,630
What's with Master Ma?

308
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,890
What's with Master Ma?

309
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,920
Go now!

310
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,600
Okay. Okay.

311
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,350
We'll get it ready now.

312
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,880
I'm going to boil the water!

313
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,280
Don't look anything against propriety.

314
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,430
Don't look anything against propriety.

315
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,490
As long as I don't look…

316
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,690
As long as I don't look at it,

317
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,690
It doesn't exist.

318
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,190
As long as I don't look at it…

319
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,450
As long as I don't look…

320
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,940
How did you get in?

321
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,760
The door was latched, wasn't it?

322
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,800
M-Master.

323
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,760
You know

324
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,000
the latch is broken.

325
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,950
Just leave it there and go away. Hurry.

326
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,730
Hurry up.

327
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,120
Close the door.

328
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,800
Okay.

329
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,290
Close the door!

330
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,760
Is he crazy?

331
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,890
He acted like I was molesting him.

332
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,860
Don't these bandits

333
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,410
take a shower?

334
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,340
They stink.

335
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,140
Who are you?

336
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
Where is Ma Dayou?

337
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,270
I am him.
