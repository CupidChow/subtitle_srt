[Episode 5]

4
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:04,830
Oh no.

5
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,160
They've been prepared for this.

6
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,960
Kill them all!

7
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,880
Kill!

8
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,840
Stop!

9
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,400
Who are you?

10
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,000
I am...

11
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,810
Lu Tianxing.

12
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:34,680
Qian'er.

13
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,750
What do you want to do,

14
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,710
dressing like that in the middle of the night?

15
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,460
I almost killed you.

16
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,229
Looks like there'll be no chance tonight.

17
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,180
Uncle,

18
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,490
I haven't seen you

19
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,140
for a long time.

20
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,060
I wanted to give you a surprise.

21
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,340
I think it's a shock instead.

22
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,460
Lu Tianxing.

23
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,040
Yes.

24
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,980
Send Qian'er back to the palace tomorrow.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,560
Yes.

26
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,970
I'm not going back.

27
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,600
Send her back

28
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,000
even if you have to tie her up.

29
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:14,780
Yes.

30
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,900
What a farce! What a farce this is!

31
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:20,560
Let's go!

32
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,400
Don't touch me!

33
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,320
Let's go.

34
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,030
Guards!

35
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,329
Your Highness.

36
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,920
Ask Qian Yikuang to see me.

37
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,920
Yes.

38
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,680
Qian Yikuang.

39
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:35,920
Are you sure

40
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,420
the secret that the soldiers hide in Jimao Mountain isn't exposed?

41
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,500
I'm sure.

42
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,190
That's strange.

43
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,470
No matter what,

44
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,100
you must be careful in the future.

45
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,030
Yes.

46
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,320
Why is Qian'er here?

47
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,520
Could His Majesty be suspecting me?

48
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,160
What a farce!

49
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,320
You're a noble Princess.

50
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,900
How can you risk your life?

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,870
Father,

52
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,780
do you know why I left the palace

53
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,520
without permission this time?

54
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,920
Of course I did it for Father's country

55
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,120
to maintain long-term peace and order.

56
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,300
During this period,

57
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,450
under my education,

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,120
that bandit leader is willing to turn over a new leaf

59
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,640
and serve the court.

60
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,720
I, Ma Dayou,

61
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,329
am here to meet you humbly, Your Majesty.

62
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,430
The heavens pity me.

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,040
I finally see Father again.

64
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,470
Though you're just a villager,

65
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,800
you know the etiquette.

66
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,190
Let me ask you.

67
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,150
His Majesty wants to ask you

68
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,990
if you've turned over a new leaf.

69
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,280
Your Majesty,

70
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,900
I know I am sinful.

71
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,480
I've decided to turn over a new leaf

72
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,740
and start my life anew.

73
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,290
I'll serve Your Majesty

74
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,940
and the court.

75
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,130
Are you really willing

76
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,459
to follow the Princess?

77
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,240
Father.

78
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,320
I am your daughter.

79
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,940
Look into my eyes.

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,150
Do you know me?

81
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,680
Ma Dayou.

82
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,070
Answer me!

83
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,200
Father asked you a question.

84
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,070
From now on,

85
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,580
I

86
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,100
will listen to whatever the Princess says.

87
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,500
Good answer! Good answer!

88
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,120
Good.

89
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,520
From now on,

90
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,020
you'll be an attendant at the Princess's Palace.

91
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,090
If you are disloyal,

92
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,370
I will surely destroy Jimao Mountain.

93
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,680
All right.

94
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,720
Don't scare him.

95
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,400
Let's go.

96
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,370
Stop!

97
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,290
During the period you're out of the palace,

98
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,090
I hid the truth from your mother.

99
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,820
Come with me to greet your mother.

100
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,610
Qingyu,

101
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,580
take him back first.

102
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,980
I'll be back soon.

103
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,220
Yes.

104
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,650
Father.

105
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,040
Remember,

106
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,790
in this palace,

107
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,159
the Princess is at the top.

108
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,510
And I'm the next.

109
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,150
And you are at the bottom.

110
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,030
In the future,

111
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,480
not only do you have to listen to the Princess,

112
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,280
but you also have to listen to me.

113
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,390
Okay.

114
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,010
I'll listen to you.

115
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,780
Qingyu.

116
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,780
How do you know my name?

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,120
I know everything

118
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,360
here.

119
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,320
Don't touch it.

120
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:24,980
Put it down.

121
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,450
That is for combing the Princess's hair.

122
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,690
You can't touch it without permission.

123
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,360
Get up.

124
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,240
Get up.

125
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,470
Eunuch Wang.

126
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,670
You must be Ma Dayou.

127
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,690
Eunuch Wang.

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,510
I am.

129
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:44,720
Follow me.

130
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,540
Where are we going?

131
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,150
You're the new attendant.

132
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,990
Of course you need to be castrated.

133
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,010
I'm not going.

134
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,560
Don't be afraid.

135
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,290
Bear with it.

136
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,620
It'll be done soon.

137
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,440
You guys,

138
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,920
get ready.

139
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,040
I'm exhausted.

140
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,900
Your Highness.

141
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,400
Your Highness.

142
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,280
It's cold.

143
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,470
Only cold tea can quench thirst.

144
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,750
Where is Ma Dayou?

145
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,950
He's in the Service Room.

146
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,550
Your Highness.

147
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,550
-The Service Room?
-Your Highness.

148
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,400
Your Highness, slow down.

149
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,530
If I slow down, the wiener will be gone!

150
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,260
Your Highness.

151
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,260
Your Highness.

152
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,810
Your Highness.

153
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,160
It's not appropriate for women

154
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,410
to enter this dirty place.

155
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,210
Your Highness, please avoid us.

156
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,400
I was scared to death.

157
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,480
What are you waiting for?

158
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,830
Get the Princess out.

159
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,120
I almost lost the happiness

160
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,320
of the rest of my life.

161
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,090
Eunuch Wang, right?

162
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
It's me.

163
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,120
Come here.

164
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,960
Father

165
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,430
ordered to transfer him to my palace.

166
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,919
You know that, right?

167
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,390
This matter is concerning the secrets of the court.

168
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,919
No one else knows about it

169
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,929
except me and Father.

170
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,880
Even Her Royal Highness the Empress

171
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,370
doesn't know about it.

172
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,340
That's because

173
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,290
people who know the secret

174
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,640
will be killed

175
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,970
to prevent it from leaking.

176
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,740
Eunuch Wang, do you still want to know about it?

177
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,470
Your Highness,

178
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,120
I don't want to know about it anymore.

179
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,980
This person...

180
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,450
Take him away with you.

181
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,640
You're a smart guy.
