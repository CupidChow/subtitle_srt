[General's Mansion]

5
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,730
Where are you going?

6
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,160
I'm going to find a way to switch our bodies back.

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,000
You have a solution?

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,400
I'm going to find a solution even if there isn't.

9
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,440
I can't live another day

10
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,500
like this anymore.

11
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,230
Okay, I'm going with you.

12
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,480
C-Calm down.

13
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,080
Calm down.

14
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,440
You liar.

15
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,270
When did I lie to you?

16
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:22,680
Hongsu,

17
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,280
she really didn't lie to you.

18
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,400
Ma Dayou,

19
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,840
what did she do to bewitch you?

20
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,340
I can't believe you...

21
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,640
you decided to be a eunuch.

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,700
You even want to...

23
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:36,509
I...

24
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:36,960
No.

25
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,990
You misunderstood.

26
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,800
Life savior?

27
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,630
Soul switching?

28
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:46,590
I think the truth is you've been holding grudges

29
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,990
and you want to take revenge on us like this.

30
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,330
Hongsu,

31
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,160
I really didn't lie to you.

32
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,610
No need to explain.

33
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:55,850
I've asked around.

34
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,229
The truth can prove everything.

35
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,510
Hurry up.

36
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,830
Show her the evidence.

37
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,910
Otherwise, I'll be beheaded.

38
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:05,910
What evidence?

39
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,889
Take off your pants.

40
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,780
I don't allow you to insult him again.

41
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,670
T-There's another way.

42
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,200
But you'll have to wait a few days.

43
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,890
What is it?

44
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,360
Eunuchs don't grow beards.

45
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,750
Really?

46
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:27,960
Yes.

47
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,300
Give me some more time.

48
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,350
I will give

49
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,680
an intact Ma Dayou back to you.

50
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,320
Okay?

51
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,560
But

52
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,480
the premise is

53
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,700
that you need to do him a favor.

54
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,530
What favor?

55
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,900
Confucius never talked of strange phenomena, feats of strength, disorder, or spirits.

56
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,300
You invited a witch here.

57
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,150
Is this the solution you said?

58
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,960
Shut up.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,840
Just watch.

60
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,440
This...

61
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,870
How inappropriate!

62
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,470
How inappropriate!

63
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,720
It will work.

64
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,079
Trust me.

65
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,800
Your Majesty,

66
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,120
Your Royal Highness,

67
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,079
the princess invited a witch to the mansion.

68
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,430
It was a mess.

69
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,590
She invited a monk today.

70
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,440
This...

71
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,880
This is inappropriate.

72
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,079
You really need to discipline her.

73
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:56,720
We will.

74
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,120
We definitely will.

75
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,630
Qian'er,

76
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,500
it's been half a month.

77
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,890
Your period should be over, right?

78
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,560
I've been so busy that I forgot about this.

79
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,700
I have a stomachache.

80
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:36,640
It's okay.

81
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,970
Your health is more important.

82
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,680
I can put up with it.

83
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,080
I'm going to get you a cup of brown sugar water.

84
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,659
I managed to fool him again.

85
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,000
Abracadabra.

86
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,320
Abracadabra.

87
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,520
Abracadabra.

88
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,680
I need to be psychic

89
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,240
to hunt down monsters.

90
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,560
Abracadabra.

91
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,950
Go!

92
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,510
The monsters have been driven away.

93
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,600
You can stay safe for 30 years.

94
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,030
Okay.

95
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,360
Thank you.

96
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,740
This represents my gratitude.

97
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,700
Please accept it.

98
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,170
Okay.

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,880
You...

100
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,480
Today, I choose you.

101
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,300
General Lu,

102
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,790
Qian'er

103
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,850
didn't cause you any trouble today, did she?

104
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,920
Your Royal Highness,

105
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,760
today,

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,720
she invited a taoist.

107
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,570
There are the sun, the moon, and stars in the sky.

108
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,760
Even ghosts and gods are terrified.

109
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,830
If there are evil spirits,

110
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,790
the evil spirits shall run away.

111
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,670
Abracadabra.

112
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,590
Abracadabra.

113
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,160
Imperial City

114
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,910
is majestic and heavily guarded.

115
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,830
Also, His Majesty and Her Royal Highness are in the city.

116
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,080
It's hard for evil things to enter the city.

117
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,120
Your Highness, I guess

118
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,909
the cause of your mental illness is not in the city.

119
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,300
I've figured it out.

120
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,450
The princess is doing this for the Lu family.

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,960
I... I think

122
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,280
the mansion of the Lu family is haunted.

123
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,790
You have a point.

124
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,830
Do you have

125
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,360
a solution?

126
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,430
I plan

127
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,270
to buy a new house

128
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,470
and move there.

129
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,720
You can search the place

130
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,760
where you got sick.

131
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,740
You'll find something.

132
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,100
-The shabby temple.
-The shabby temple.

133
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,080
Abracadabra.

134
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,880
Ghost, you've got the wrong person. Leave.

135
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,310
Stop

136
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,480
making trouble.

137
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,800
Go back to the place

138
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,920
where you came from.

139
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,430
Your Highness, don't laugh at me.

140
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,240
This

141
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,640
is another spell of mine.

142
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,000
Your Highness, please drip a drop of blood

143
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,080
in the wine.

144
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,159
Sir,

145
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,110
not you.

146
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,890
It should be the princess.

147
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,900
Soul switching?

148
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,200
How could such a strange thing happen?

149
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,400
I've never heard of it.

150
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,120
I...

151
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,240
I'll listen to you.

152
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,340
Please.

153
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,310
Why are you afraid?

154
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,350
Just do it.

155
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,120
Look at me.

156
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,120
That's my hand.

157
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,190
Fine.

158
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,669
I will take care of it in the future.

159
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,000
You won't have a chance.

160
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,360
Mr. Wang.

161
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,870
Where are you going?

162
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,740
It's your turn.

163
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,409
It's my turn?

164
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,080
The magical oriental magic

165
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,240
is amazing!

166
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,240
One bowl for each of you.

167
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,920
Drink it

168
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,820
and it will work immediately.

169
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,350
Just drink.

170
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,720
Don't you want to switch our bodies back?

171
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,270
I want to.

172
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,240
Is the magical oriental magic

173
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,450
going to happen?
