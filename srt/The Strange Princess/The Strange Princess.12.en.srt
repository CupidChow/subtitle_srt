00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,710
visit Prince Ying's place for a few more days.

7
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,340
Don't rush back.

8
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,830
Yes, Father.

9
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,060
Go back now.

10
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:58,700
Okay.

11
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,990
See you.

12
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,200
Bye. Bye.

13
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,130
Close the door.

14
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,350
Is my brother suspicious of me?

15
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,630
No way.

16
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,130
If His Majesty is suspicious of you,

17
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,259
why would he send the princess to Prince Ying's Mansion?

18
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,150
My brother acts with fanciful imagination.

19
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,640
It's hard for all of us to predict.

20
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,550
Maybe

21
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,690
he asked Qian'er to search for evidence.

22
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,080
A good disciple comes from a renowned master.

23
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,160
Does Your Highness want to rebel in advance?

24
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,090
Although I have tens of thousands of soldiers in eight bandit camps,

25
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,580
the armor is not ready yet.

26
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,990
We have to fight fire with fire

look at my handwriting.

38
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,510
Don't call me General, Your Highness.

39
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,620
I'm flattered.

40
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,370
Just call me by my name.

41
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,350
Tianxing.

42
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:06,750
You haven't answered.

43
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,500
How is my handwriting?

44
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,440
Although the character is simple,

45
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,060
but it exhibits remarkable craftsmanship.

46
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,620
This is the best in the world.

47
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,670
You are good.

48
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,910
As soon as your father's decree arrives,

49
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,640
I'll arrange everything.

50
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,980
You can stay here as long as you want.

51
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:31,850
It's just that this mansion is not

52
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,280
as good as the palace.

53
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,760
As long as you ask,

54
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,350

It's Princess Jiang Kelan.

73

With Prince Ying's looks,

74
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,540
it's surprising that he has such a beautiful daughter.

75
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,800
She must not be his biological daughter.

76
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,220
All right.

77
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,970

take your sister on a tour of the mansion.

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,430
and ask the chief to cook some dishes.

Your brother-in-law and I haven't seen each other for days.

82

Don't worry.

84
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,909
I'll show you the mansion.

85
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:50,860
Sure.

86

88
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,140
I have a few pieces of calligraphy here.

89

Take a look.

00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,040
This child is going to master in both literature and martial arts.

91

Qian'er,

93
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,250
do you think the mansion has changed a lot?

94
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,490
You haven't visited me for ten years.

95
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,910
There are no big changes.

97
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,390
Do you think I've changed a lot?

98
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,070
Yes. Big.

99
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,030

Sure.

105
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,340
Think about who you are.

106
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,800
Can you control yourself?

107
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,970
It won't cause a harm if I take a glance.

108
00:05:59,170 --> 00:05:59,900
Besides,

109
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,110
I have to sleep with her tonight.

110
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,870
No, no.

111
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,950
I need to find evidence.

112
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,420
This woman is so talkative.

113
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:07,890
Stupid.

114
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,910
Find Yang Hongsu

115
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,470
and ask her about her progress.

116
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,450
I'm warning you.

00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,520
Don't go too far.

118
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,060
I'm a woman now.

119
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,300
What can I do?

120
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,630
Don't touch me.

122
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,760
Hurry up.

The local government is corrupted, indeed.

127
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,930
The people is suffering a lot.

128
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,270
It's not difficult

129
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
to find evidence.

130
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,310
Does this have anything to do with Prince Ying?

131
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,980
The strange thing lies here.

132
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,150
It is said that

133
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,640
Prince Ying

134
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,140
is quite frugal.

135
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,200
He has quite a reputation for being virtuous.

136
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,130
Unfortunately,

137
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,850
even if the corruption of local officials

138
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,730
has nothing to do with Prince Ying,

139
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,909
he can't escape

140
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,550
for failure in supervision.

141
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,510
I know.

142
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,190
These things have nothing to do with Prince Ying.

143
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,940
Prince Ying's Mansion I visited today is not luxurious.

144
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,660
His clothes are also very simple.

145
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,460
He wrote the word 'thrifty' for self-reflection.

146
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,170
How could he order someone to kill the old chief?

147
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,340
Dayou,

148
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,840
what are you talking about?

149
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,750
N-Nothing.

150
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,790
No matter how wise Prince Ying is,

151
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,260
he indulged his servant to kill your father.

152
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,460
This is the truth.

153
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:26,470
A life for a life.

154
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,000
It is the unchanging truth.

155
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,790

we stay with the princess

157
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,820
and kill him when we seize a chance.

158
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,580
Let's find the evidence first.

159
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,659
Maybe that evil servant made his own decision.

160
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:48,820
You've changed.

161
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,420
People change.

162
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,240
I'm leaving.

163
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,390

165
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,880
What's wrong with him?

166
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,600
My nephew-in-law.

167
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,710
I am not slandering His Majesty.

168
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,920
With your ability,

169
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,460
you should have taken over the battlefield and acted on your own.

170
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,330
But His Majesty

171
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,659
trapped you in the capital

172
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,340
and refused to let you out.

173
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,770
Don't say that, Your Highness.

174
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:42,940
I'm very satisfied with this.

175
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,710
You are the Prince Consort now.

176
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,460
In the eyes of others,

177
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,350
you are living off someone else.

178
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,070
I feel sorry for you.

179
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,450
Watch your words, Your Highness.

180
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,210
Princess is a good girl.

181
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,600
I never had any complaints.

182
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,580
How can a man

183
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,610
be restrained by a woman?

184
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,610
If you are willing,

185
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,270
I'll immediately confer you the title...

186
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,870
I'll ask His Majesty to give you the title of

187
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,760
Commander-in-Chief.

188
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,470
Your Highness.

189
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,560
I can't drink anymore.

190
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,030
Really.

191
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,290
I can't drink anymore.

192
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,640
I can't handle any more alcohol.

193
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,920
I'll leave first.

194
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,120
When you've come to your sense,

195
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,760
come to me.

196
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,870
My words

197
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,190
will always count.

198
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,640
Goodbye.

199
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,430
What does Prince Ying mean?

200
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,660
What's good for him

201
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,560
to win over a Prince Consort?

202
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,100
Could it be that...

203
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,070
What a wasted potential of a capable military leader.
