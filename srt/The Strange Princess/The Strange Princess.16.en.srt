1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,080
Great.

3
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,570
You finally woke up.

4
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,760
It was because I was afraid you might move around in your sleep

5
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,220
and aggravate your wound.

6
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,000
Thank you very much.

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,440
No.

8
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,920
I should thank you.

9
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,180
If it weren't for you taking that arrow for me...

10
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,570
You were very lucky.

11
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,400
The wound isn't serious.

12
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,440
Once it's healed,

13
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,039
you can move.

14
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,729
What about Yang Hongsu and Lu Ming?

15
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,759
Why did you appear at Jimao Mountain last night?

16
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,640
I'd like to ask you,

17
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,720
as the former patriarch of Fortress Qingfeng,

18
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,480
how much do you know about

19
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,880
Qian Yikuang and Prince Ying's rebellion?

20
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,440
Are you saying

21
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,660
Prince Ying is planning to rebel?

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,440
Looks like you know nothing.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,160
I really don't know how you managed

24
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,160
as the patriarch.

25
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,760
Princess is still in the prince's mansion.

26
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,760
Could she be in danger?

27
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,180
Given Prince Ying's cunning,

28
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,340
he might exploit her identity

29
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,120
at a critical moment.

30
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,000
She should be fine.

31
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,770
You are the problem.

32
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,240
I don't know to what extent your peculiar connection

33
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,770
with Princess has reached.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,280
If your injury

35
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,800
would harm her,

36
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,520
then it would be a serious problem.

37
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520
We should quickly

38
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,079
inform the palace.

39
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,120
The roads to the palace and the prince's mansion

40
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,920
have manpower arranged by Qian Yikuang.

41
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,320
With you slowing us down,

42
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,520
we won't make it through.

43
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,880
The current plan

44
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,980
is to wait for your wounds to heal,

45
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,040
and then we'll sneak into the prince's mansion

46
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,100
to rescue Qian'er.

47
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,760
Thank you,

48
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,960
Tianxing.

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,860
Ma Dayou, I'm warning you.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,040
We've only had a drink together once

51
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,560
and compared our martial arts once.

52
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,480
If it weren't for Qian'er,

53
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,880
we wouldn't even be sitting here together.

54
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,000
If you ever address me

55
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,980
without my surname again,

56
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,370
I might really lose my temper and beat you.

57
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,200
Okay.

58
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,920
Young General Lu.

59
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,960
This

60
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,520
is the healing ointment I got from the robbers.

61
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,640
Take off your clothes.

62
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,500
It's time to change the bandages.

63
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,329
Take off my clothes?

64
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,180
If you don't take off your clothes, how can I apply ointment on you?

65
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,400
Well, turn around.

66
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,000
You're a man...

67
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,240
Fine.

68
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,880
Don't look back.

69
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,120
Hurry up and undress.

70
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,100
Or I might really lose my temper and beat you.

71
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,640
The guests in this room didn't come back last night?

72
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,120
That girl?

73
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,050
I didn't see her.

74
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,560
I'll head out first.

75
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,160
Call me if you need anything.

76
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,480
Be careful.

77
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,800
Princess must have been seriously injured yesterday.

78
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,460
Otherwise, I wouldn't suddenly cough up blood.

79
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,960
Lu Tianxing and Hongsu

80
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,890
also disappeared at the same time.

81
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,400
Could there have been a conflict between them,

82
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,960
resulting in a fight?

83
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,810
Impossible.

84
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,890
Lu Tianxing knows that my life is tied to Princess's.

85
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,520
But what could have happened between them?

86
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,040
Qian'er,

87
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,240
are you looking for someone?

88
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,900
We can have the government office post notices.

89
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,960
If we really can't find them,

90
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,570
that's the only option.

91
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,240
Are missing person notices necessary?

92
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,680
Tianxing has only been gone for two nights.

93
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,160
Is it that serious?

94
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,320
It really is that serious.

95
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,480
Uncle,

96
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,400
you must help me this time.

97
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,010
You must have had a quarrel with Tianxing,

98
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,010
so he went out to have fun on his own.

99
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,600
He'll come back in a couple of days.

100
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,840
Uncle, do you know why I coughed up blood?

101
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,580
Don't tell me about the things

102
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,640
between you girls.

103
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,760
I share the same feelings

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,060
as Prince Consort.

105
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,120
His pain is my pain.

106
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,680
If he's injured,

107
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,840
even if it's thousands of miles away,

108
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,360
I can feel it.

109
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,080
What a strange thing.

110
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,320
Yes.

111
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,960
If it's really as the doctor said,

112
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,160
that I coughed up blood due to being overwhelmed by anger and anxiety,

113
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,690
then why is there still fresh blood oozing out

114
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,800
while I have no wounds on my body?

115
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,680
I can feel it.

116
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,560
He must be seriously injured.

117
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,230
No matter whether I believe it or not,

118
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,360
your safety comes first.

119
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,120
If you continue like this,

120
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,840
how can I face my brother?

121
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,440
Guards!

122
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,159
Your Highness.

123
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:33,960
Pass my order.

124
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,400
Spare no effort in searching for Prince Consort.

125
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:36,880
Yes.

126
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,720
Don't worry.

127
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,520
It'll be fine.

128
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,120
All right.

129
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,080
It has been a few days.

130
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,100
Your injury is almost healed.

131
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,220
How do you feel?

132
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,440
Are you ready to hit the road?

133
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,200
I'm fine.

134
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,960
Let's split up.

135
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,640
You return to the Imperial City to report,

136
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,480
and I'll go to the prince's mansion to rescue Qian'er.

137
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:07,960
No.

138
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,730
Let's act together.

139
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,080
Why?

140
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,770
Are you afraid I can't protect Qian'er

141
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,320
and might lose your life?

142
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,700
That's not what I mean.

143
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,440
I've been thinking for days.

144
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,080
If Qian Yikuang is hiding troops for Prince Ying in the fortress,

145
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,160
our last operation

146
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,620
has already alerted them.

147
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,360
Perhaps the Imperial City has already been ready for war.

148
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,090
If Father...

149
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,040
His Majesty sent you to investigate Prince Ying's rebellion,

150
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,840
it means the Imperial City is prepared to respond.

151
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,240
You've said all the reasons.

152
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,540
What else can I say?

153
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:43,880
Let's go.

154
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,960
Qian'er.

155
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,440
Qian'er?

156
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,080
Qian'er.

157
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,400
Qian'er.

158
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,400
Who are you?

159
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,880
It's me.

160
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,920
It's you guys.

161
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,120
You're finally back!

162
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,240
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,320
I shouldn't have made you worry.

164
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,720
How are you?

165
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,300
Where are you injured?

166
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,920
Is it serious?

167
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,490
How are you feeling?

168
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,920
I'm fine.

169
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,070
Hurry up and get dressed.

170
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,200
We need to leave the city immediately.

171
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,360
What happened?

172
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,640
Prince Ying is plotting a rebellion.

173
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,440
Nonsense.

174
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,460
You must be talking nonsense!

175
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,880
My father wouldn't rebel.

176
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,930
He's not talking nonsense.

177
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,720
Father,

178
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,900
are you really planning to rebel?

179
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,600
His Majesty is your own brother!

180
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,520
Lan,

181
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,410
these are adult matters

182
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,970
that you don't understand.

183
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,880
But I know

184
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,800
that if you rebel,

185
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,920
you'll have to kill His Majesty

186
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,760
and Qian'er, right?

187
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,550
Father.

188
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,640
I beg you.

189
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,320
Don't rebel.

190
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,400
Don't do this.

191
