1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,240
It's me.

3
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,000
Tianxing.

4
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,640
What are you doing here?

5
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,700
Let's talk inside.

6
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,360
Qingyu.

7
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,480
Guard the door.

8
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,360
No need.

9
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,360
I let them see me coming here on purpose.

10
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,240
Are you crazy?

11
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,240
Don't interrupt.

12
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,280
Tianxing knows what he's doing.

13
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,120
Tianxing.

14
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,680
What do you want to do?

15
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,160
I'll come every day,

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,130
but I need your help.

17
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,640
No problem.

18
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,800
Compromising!

19
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,920
This is so compromising!

20
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,280
It's compromising.

21
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,320
Hurry up.

22
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,720
Get away from each other!

23
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,120
What are you doing?

24
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,650
There's no other way

25
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,560
to lower Prince Ying's guard

26
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,690
except to smear my reputation myself.

27
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,720
Fine.

28
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,120
I'll just pretend that I don't see it.

29
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,520
I won't look at you, okay?

30
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,920
Okay?

31
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,329
I'm not looking.

32
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,810
You said you were going to forget Qian'er.

33
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,079
Why did you go to her again?

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,720
It's full.

35
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,360
Why do you look so restless?

36
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,400
What happened?

37
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,440
Nothing.

38
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,600
Did Lu Tianxing mistreat you?

39
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,320
No.

40
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,880
The Prince Consort treats me very well.

41
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,600
Maybe I'm tired these days.

42
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,350
Take a rest if you're tired.

43
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,690
You don't have to come to the palace every day.

44
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,680
I'll take my leave.

45
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,360
Lu Tianxing,

46
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,520
I've given your family enough respect.

47
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,520
Don't make me look too embarrassed.

48
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,960
Tianxing,

49
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,450
I can't let you sink deeper and deeper.

50
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,840
Point higher.

51
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,040
A little more.

52
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,400
That's right.

53
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,800
No, no.

54
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,000
Widen your stance.

55
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Don't act like a woman.

56
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,520
Do it if you can.

57
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,160
All the moves are in my mind.

58
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,320
I can't do it physically.

59
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,360
What can I do?

60
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,320
Who is it?

61
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,079
It's me.

62
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,840
Lu Tianxing.

63
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,120
Is she here?

64
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,440
Yes.

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,640
Okay.

66
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,960
It's up to you two.

67
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,360
I'll avoid it now.

68
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,560
I'm here.

69
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,220
You don't have to work so hard.

70
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,780
I don't want to be totally useless

71
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
and hold you back.

72
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,130
Although you have Ma Dayou's body,

73
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,030
the sense of the martial arts should be in your mind.

74
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:05,880
Your current reaction

75
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,960
is only based on your physical instinct.

76
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,320
Once it comes to a real fight,

77
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,920
you'll be at a disadvantage.

78
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,440
Teach me more, then.

79
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:19,760
Here.

80
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,080
Shall we start now?

81
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,520
Yes.

82
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,080
How could it be?

83
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,640
Two men…

84
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,480
How awkward.

85
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,440
If my face makes you uncomfortable,

86
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,440
I can cover it up.

87
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,040
Does it have anything to do with my face?

88
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,960
It's okay.

89
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,720
How you look is not important.

90
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,320
It's fine as long as it's you.

91
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:41,960
I knew

92
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,000
you always have me in your heart.

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,680
Tianxing.

94
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,400
I didn't expect

95
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,720
you...you...

96
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,720
You...

97
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,770
What are you looking at?

98
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,760
Don't look.

99
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,600
It's not appropriate for kids.

100
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,960
It's not appropriate for kids.

101
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,120
What are you doing?

102
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,220
How did you know I was here?

103
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,340
Were you following me?

104
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,680
Yes.

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,560
I was following you.

106
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,640
I thought you didn't listen to my advice

107
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,280
and came meet Qian'er here.

108
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,400
I didn't expect

109
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,960
you would be with a man.

110
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,800
I'm actually competing with a man.

111
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,680
Lu Tianxing.

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,280
You lied to me.

113
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,050
You've been lying to me the whole time!

114
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,400
I'm telling Father.

115
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,740
Your Highness.

116
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,840
Be careful.

117
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,159
Will something bad happen to you?

118
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:55,960
It's okay.

119
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,050
This is just the beginning.

120
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,980
It's just that…

121
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,360
I'm sorry for Lan.

122
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,960
What?

123
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,240
He's gay?

124
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,040
How is that possible?

125
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,520
I saw it with my own eyes,

126
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,440
Father.

127
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,560
He would rather be with a man

128
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,640
than be with me.

129
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,420
I've been so considerate to him. It was all for nothing.

130
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,240
How despicable.

131
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,170
How despicable!

132
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,050
I will punish him severely.

133
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,580
I'll punish him severely!

134
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,240
Guards!

135
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,679
Yes.

136
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,520
Tell Lu Tianxing to come over and see me.

137
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,039
Yes.

138
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,520
Lu Tianxing.

139
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,520
I trusted you so much.

140
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,520
Is this how you repay me?

141
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,000
I deserve to die.

142
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,400
It's just…

143
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,920
It's just…

144
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,680
Get up first.

145
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,370
Thank you, Your Majesty

146
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,240
I didn't know Ma Dayou at first.

147
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,220
When Your Majesty was still Prince Ying,

148
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,480
you asked me to arrest him.

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,400
That's when I met him.

150
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,080
Does Qian'er know about it?

151
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,800
Princess Qian'er and I

152
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,130
were just a fake couple.

153
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,000
We've been married for months,

154
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,440
but have never consummated the marriage.

155
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,440
Your Majesty, you can send a court lady to check it out.

156
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,440
There was no affection

157
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,840
between you two?

158
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,000
Your Majesty,

159
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,720
I like men.

160
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,960
How could I fall in love with Princess Qian'er?

161
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,640
How should I tell Lan about this?

162
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,800
I deserve to die.

163
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,400
Your Majesty,

164
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,160
please cancel my engagement with Princess Lan.

165
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,000
Fine.

166
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,200
The generals in the army often exhibit a tendency towards same-sex behavior.

167
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,520
I've heard about it before.

168
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,000
As long as you are loyal to me,

169
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,260
I will explain it to Lan

170
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,800
for you.

171
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

172
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,600
But...

173
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,200
Enough.

174
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,320
I didn't even punish you.

175
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,720
What are you still concerned about?

176
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,360
It's best if you can stop this vile habit.

177
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,360
If not,

178
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,820
hide that person far away.

179
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,920
Don't let Lan know

180
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,160
so that she won't disturb me again.

181
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,880
You may leave.

182
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,400
Yes.
