[Episode 7]

4
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,240
Take smaller steps.

5
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,640
Study Partner Ma,

6
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,190
don't you feel painful?

7
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,230
I don't.

8
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,270
Chin up and chest out.

9
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,990
Look ahead.

10
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,900
Fine.

11
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,350
You have guts.

12
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,830
If you don't feel painful,

13
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,430
I don't feel painful either.

14
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,310
Don't look around.

15
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:17,660
Learn hard.

16
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,140
Madam,

17
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,420
give me that.

18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,410
Violence can't solve any problem.

19
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,150
That's right.

20
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,910
It can't solve any problem.

21
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,690
You...

22
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,910
should be...

23
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,020
very violent.

24
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:35,830
Your Highness,

25
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,390
please.

26
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:38,750
Hurry!

27
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,789
Chest out!

28
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:49,950
Madam, look.

29
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,479
Her Highness is so elegant.

30
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,470
Yes.

31
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:58,870
Hurry!

32
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,150
I

33
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,630
quit.

34
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,870
I'm not going to learn even if you kill me.

35
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,310
You...

36
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:11,320
Go ahead.

37
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,170
Beat me to death if you dare!

38
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,950
What are you doing?

39
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,070
Why are you crying again?

40
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,390
You asked me to go to the fortress with you.

41
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,150
I went there.

42
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,000
You asked me to exercise with you.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,970
I did it too.

44
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:50,510
For you,

45
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:52,710
I even offended Uncle Ying.

46
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,410
What about you?

47
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,540
You won't even do me a small favor.

48
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,590
As a man,

49
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,630
you're not loyal at all.

50
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,840
No one has ever said

51
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,830
I'm disloyal.

52
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,060
Leave.

53
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,430
You won't help me anyway.

54
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,400
Fine.

55
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,190
For loyalty,

56
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,230
I'll help you.

57
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,760
Let's continue then.

58
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,930
Let's make three rules first.

59
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,980
Don't hit me in my palms.

60
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,150
Deal.

61
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,910
[Blessing]

62
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,760
It's improper for men and women to touch each other.

63
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,360
It's inappropriate.

64
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,070
My study partner,

65
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,630
what is tomorrow's task?

66
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,650
There won't be any task.

67
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,230
Finally, it's over.

68
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,110
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,310
It's fine.

70
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,140
From tonight on,

71
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,270
just be yourself.

72
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,750
Laugh

73
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,310
as you like.

74
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,500
Walk

75
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,950
as you like.

76
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,710
Really?

77
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,470
Yes.

78
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,270
Okay.

79
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,950
Tonight,

80
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,310
I'll ask Qingyu to get us some wine.

81
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,950
Let's drink till we get drunk tonight.

82
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,960
What's wrong?

83
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:38,950
In three days,

84
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,110
you'll marry Tianxing.

85
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,190
I know.

86
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,670
Didn't we make a deal?

87
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,580
I won't sleep with him

88
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,600
before we switch our bodies back.

89
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,230
These days,

90
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,600
at the thought

91
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:57,060
that Tianxing is going to marry someone else,

92
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:58,980
I feel…

93
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,550
I'm not someone else.

94
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,870
I am you.

95
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,550
No!

96
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,820
You're not.

97
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,780
It's all your fault.

98
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,740
You have ruined

99
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,900
the most important moment in my life.

100
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,030
It's all your fault.

101
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,020
It's all your fault.

102
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,150
It's all your fault!

103
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,540
Stop. Stop.

104
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,540
I... I'm going to break into pieces.

105
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,630
I thought I wouldn't mind.

106
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,090
But I...

107
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,380
can't do that.

108
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,940
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,020
If only

110
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,080
I hadn't met you

111
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:55,900
back then.

112
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,580
Do you think

113
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,340
we can still switch our bodies back?

114
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,370
I think...

115
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,420
we can.

116
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,170
I'm sure we can.

117
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,540
You go beg Father and Mother

118
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,930
to postpone the wedding

119
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,070
till we switch our bodies back.

120
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:23,860
Okay.

121
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm going to go all out.

122
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,650
I'm not saying I won't marry him.

123
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,700
Can't we just postpone the wedding by a month?

124
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,930
The Lu family's betrothal gifts

125
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,540
have been delivered to the palace.

126
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,740
It's already too late

127
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,260
to postpone the wedding.

128
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,900
So many?

129
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,010
So many.

130
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,740
They are very valuable, right?

131
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,370
Of course.

132
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,050
Young General Lu made contributions by eliminating the bandits.

133
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,500
He received many rewards.

134
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,060
All of them have been used for the wedding.

135
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,690
They are all mine.

136
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,820
After I leave the palace,

137
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,380
I'll ask someone

138
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,180
to deliver them to the fortress.

139
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,060
My men and I don't have to starve anymore.

140
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,900
How did it go?

141
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,660
It's...

142
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,980
a bit complicated.

143
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,650
Let me explain.

144
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,250
Qingyu,

145
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,890
go out.

146
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:34,340
Listen,

147
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,650
I really did everything I could.

148
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,179
I begged him.

149
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:38,900
I reasoned with him.

150
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,740
But your father

151
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,220
just wouldn't agree.

152
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,179
Then cry.

153
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,740
Father is most afraid of me crying.

154
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,380
As long as you cry,

155
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,040
he will promise you anything.

156
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,760
I cried.

157
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,880
Father, you don't love me anymore.

158
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,500
You don't even have tears.

159
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,500
Stop pretending.

160
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,530
Then make a scene.

161
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,620
I made a scene.

162
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,830
I'm not going to marry him!

163
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,060
I'm not going to marry him!

164
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,720
I'm not going to marry him!

165
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,780
I'm not going to marry him.

166
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,330
Are you exercising?

167
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:08,860
I'm not going to marry him.

168
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,370
Good.

169
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,580
Come on. Continue.

170
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,180
There's another way.

171
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,410
I used it too.

172
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,200
-I'm going to kill myself.
-Wait.

173
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,780
You agree?

174
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,350
No.

175
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,330
Go to a higher place.

176
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,180
What should I do?

177
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,060
It's the most important moment

178
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,420
in a girl's life.

179
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,370
Do I really

180
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,210
have to let you marry him on behalf of me?

181
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,530
This is the only way.

182
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,540
This is the only way.

183
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,910
No way.
