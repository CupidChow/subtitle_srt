[Episode 6]

4
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,270
I was scared to death.

5
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:55,540
Tell me.

6
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,670
What should we do in the future?

7
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,030
Did you forget

8
00:00:59,030 --> 00:00:59,940
what I just told you?

9
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,590
Is there a place for you to sit in the Princess's Palace?

10
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,110
Get up.

11
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,230
Get up.

12
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,670
All right.

13
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,830
Let him sit.

14
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,070
There is an order of precedence.

15
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,550
The servants can't sit.

16
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,710
We're family.

17
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,190
No need to stress the precedence.

18
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,150
Family?

19
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,530
Your Highness, you didn't...

20
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,700
No wonder you didn't agree to get him castrated.

21
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,380
W-What are you talking about?

22
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,350
You can't even understand that?

23
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,000
She said we have an affair.

24
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,970
Who would want to have an affair with you?

25
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,150
Your Highness, how could you do that?

26
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,479
What do you want Young General Lu to think?

27
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,759
I couldn't care less about him.

28
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,830
What did you say?

29
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:41,030
Father.

30
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,150
The Princess and I

31
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,080
love each other.

32
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:43,670
Besides,

33
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,190

[Lu Lang, Nation-guarding General]

35
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,870
Alright.

36
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:52,210
I'll go to His Majesty

37
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,400
to discuss your marriage.

38
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,950
Ma Dayou?

39
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:15,830
Tianxing.

40
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,170
Tianxing!

41
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,630
Let me explain, Tianxing.

42
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,510
He will listen to my explanation, right?

43
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,280
I don't know if he'll do that,

44
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,150
but I'm sure

45
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,230
I will never marry

46
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,470
a man.

47
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,390
Then, help me.

48
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,430
How can I help you?

49
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,030
Just don't get married. That's it.

50
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,710
My marrying Tianxing

51
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,710
is just like your revenge for your father.

52
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,510
Will you not avenge your father?

53
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,970
It'll be big trouble, then.

54
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,550

55
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,260
How am I inferior to her?

56
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,390
My Lady,

57
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,950
Ma Dayou...

58
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,020
Don't mention him.

59
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,800
Something happened to him.

60
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,900
What happened to him?

61
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,220
He fell into the Princess's trap.

62
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,770
He was taken to the palace

63
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,270
and became a eunuch.

64
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,120
What did you say?

65
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,790
General Lu.

66
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,610
Qian'er

67
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,920
grew up in the palace,

68
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,670
so she's inevitably a little spoiled.

69
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,540
General Lu,

70
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,760
please bear with her.

71
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,740
However,

72
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,670
if she is too arrogant because of her favor,

73
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,400
just let Tianxing to come to me,

74
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,240
I will help him discipline her.

75
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,880
Before I get my body back,

76
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,430
I can't be with a man.

77
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,960
I have to scuttle

78
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,820
this marriage.

79
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,250
The Princess raised by Your Royal Highness

80
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,370
must be gentle, considerate,

81
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,750
and elegant.

82
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,150

Greetings, Mother.

Greetings, General Lu.

86

Greetings,

87
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,890
Your Highness…

88
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,110
What fruit is this?

89
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,260
The peel is so thick.

90
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,870
I'll try this one.

91
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,210
This one is delicious.

92
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,350
This one is delicious.

93
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,820
General Lu, you have one.

94
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,750
Your Highness.

95
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,390
I…

96
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,150
don't eat grapes.

97
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,660
Have a seat.

98
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,490
Thank you, Your Highness.

99
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:24,750

100
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,770
Sit properly.

Your Royal Highness.

103
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,230
If

104
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,120
there's nothing else,

105
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,110
I will…

106
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,250
take my leave.

107
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,120
General, don't leave.

108
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,320
Qian'er is not usually like this.

109
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,350
Come again when you're free.

110
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,280
Jiang Qian'er!

111
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:53,950
Guards.

112
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,230
Yes.

113
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,930
Take the Princess back to her room

114
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:57,950
and wait for her punishment.

115
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,470
Yes.

116
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,290
Now I'm in big trouble.

117
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:01,630
Let go!

118
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,030
Why?

119
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,030
Why did you do that?

120
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,510
Let go!

121
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,070
Why?

122
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,910
Let go of the Princess.

123
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,750
Calm down.

124
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,080
I'm doing this for your own good.

125
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,510
I can't let you watch me

126
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,230
marry Lu Tianxing.

127
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,100
I am going to marry him, not you.

128
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,030
You're a man now.

129
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,270
How can you marry him?

130
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,310
Mother,

131
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,070
I finally get to see you in person.

132
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,070
Do you know how much I've missed you?

133
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,930
Jiang Qian'er.

134
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:35,550
Stand up.

135
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,550
Look at you.

136
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,909
These

137
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,480
are "Lessons for Women" and "Women's Moral Code," which you've been reading since childhood.

138
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,820
Recite them ten more times.

139
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,780
That's "Etiquette Rules for Women."

140
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,750
Reread them

141
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,850
until the Lu family

142
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,710
is willing to take you in as Young General Lu's wife.

143
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,980
Do I still have to get married?

144
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,780
So, this marriage is not ruined?

145
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,320
Madam Zhang.

146
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,920
Yes.

147
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,640
Now, teach her again

148
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,960
in the way you taught her before.

149
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,920
I understand.

150
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,110
Qingyu.

151
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,230
Yes.

152
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,230
You must report

153
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,170
the Princess's speech and deportment to me in the future.

154
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:09,940
Yes.

155
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:11,910
And you.

156
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,560
Don't bring in those bad habits from outside the palace.

157
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,550
I will

158
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,670
assist the Madam

159
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,160
in teaching the Princess.

160
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,370
You're educated?

161
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,700
Don't act recklessly.

162
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,140
Don't wear too much makeup and overdress.

163
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,580
Don't laugh out loud.

164
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,770
Don't be a soft touch or gossip.

165
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,240
You are just a bandit.

166
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,390
You even know about "Lessons for Women."

167
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,550
Being a personal attendant is a waste of your talent.

168
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,590
Be a study partner

169
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,870
for the Princess.

170
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,990
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

171
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,320
Goodbye, Your Royal Highness.

172
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,340
Your Highness,

173
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,260
please read.

174
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:52,970
Your Highness,

175
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,310
please learn the etiquette.

176
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:54,990
Please.

177
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,350
Please.

178
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,040
Father.

179
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,280
Xing,

180
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,020
judging from Princess Qian'er's manner,

181
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,030
I don't think she's a good match for you.

182
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,390
Father, you don't know about this,

183
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,060
but a while ago,

184
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,770
Princess Qian'er was kidnapped by bandits

185
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,070
and was struck by lightning.

186
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,270
That's why she acts foolishly sometimes.

187
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,440
But I believe

188
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,230
as long as I wait patiently,

189
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,110
one day,

190
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,960
she will return to her old self.

191
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,270
I hope so.

192
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,360
According to "Advice for Women,"

193
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,470
women should look in the mirror and wipe their faces,

194
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,070
which reflects the purity of their hearts.

195
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,710
Therefore,

196
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,830
I...

197
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,470
Therefore, I...

198
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,110
Therefore...

199
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,190
women should look in the mirror and wipe their faces,

200
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,590
which reflects the purity of their hearts.

201
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,670
So we are connected.

202
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,300
You also hurt when you hit me.

203
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,630
That's more convenient.

204
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,860
Be gentle.

205
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,890
Hurry up and recite it.

206
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:16,730
Okay.

207
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,820
Women should apply cream,

208
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,460
which means to clean up…

209
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,470
their

210
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,430
act…

211
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,730
♫God is taking a nap and doesn't open his eyes♫

212
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,300
♫They swapped their bodies by accident♫

213
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,960
♫She was unhappy about entering the underworld accidentally♫

214
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,870

215
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,250
♫Year after year♫

216
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,990
♫Times are tough, and it's my turn to show my abilities♫

217
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,340
♫I didn't expect to become a woman♫

218
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,799
♫I am tortured by all the etiquette and rules♫

219
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,770
♫It's hard to pretend to be a woman♫

220
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,200
♫I have no choice, and my love is drifting away♫

221
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,360
Do you think you can stop me with this low wall?

222
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,620
Watch me!

223
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,020
♫I work hard to go towards tomorrow♫

224
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:58,590
♫My love is there, so I'm going back to the mountain♫

225
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,620
That is an illusion.

226
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,420
I'll fly again

227
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,080
♫I'm ardent♫

228
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,190
Oh no.

229
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,070
I've lost my light-body skill, too.

230
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,740
♫The sparks are everywhere♫

231
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,720
♫God is taking a nap and doesn't open his eyes♫

00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,460

♫I didn't expect to become a woman♫

238
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,830
It's so late.

239
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,290
Your Highness, where are you going?

240
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,820
♫I am tortured by all the etiquette and rules♫

241
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,780
♫It's hard to pretend to be a woman♫

242
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,430
The moon is so round tonight

243
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,680
♫I have no choice, and my love is drifting away♫

244
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,430
Are you here to admire the moon, too?

245
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:34,070
♫I work hard to go towards tomorrow♫

246
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,170
Today is the first day of the lunar month.

247
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,500
How can you see the moon?

248
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:39,610
♫My love is there, so I'm going back to the mountain♫

249
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,820
I'm a bit early.

250
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,670
I'm going to bed.

251
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,950
♫I'm ardent♫

252
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,210
You...

253
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,840
Let's play

254
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,200
♫The sparks are everywhere♫

255
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,210
Goodbye, Your Highness.

256
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,370
♫I am the mountain king♫
