♫Times are tough, and it's my turn to show my abilities♫

192
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,730
Not bad.

193
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,400
One more time!

194
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,060
♫I didn't expect to become a woman♫

195
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,510
♫I am tortured by all the etiquette and rules♫

196
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:19,880
You.

197
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:20,940
Come here.

198
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,410
♫It's hard to pretend to be a woman♫

199
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,810
He's so big.

200
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,100
♫I have no choice, and my love is drifting away♫

201
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,860
Practice with Master.

202
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,840
Yes.

203
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,659
♫I work hard to go towards tomorrow♫

204
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,870
I've been practicing martial arts for several years.

205
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,190
But in this useless body,

206
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,010
♫My love is there, so I'm going back to the mountain♫

207
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,050
I can't use even a little bit of it.

208
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,659
♫I'm ardent♫

209
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,300
♫The sparks are everywhere♫

210
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,630
Sit.

211
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,909
Get up!

212
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,880
See?

213
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,490
This is what a mountain king looks like.

214
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,630
One more time.

215
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,890
Actually, it's not hard to imitate you.

216
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:23,790
Not hard?

217
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,570
Come on.

218
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,860
Show me.

219
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,049
Are you ready?

220
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,990
Bold!

221
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,450
How dare you criticize me!

222
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,990
Are you tired of living?

223
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,260
Bravo! Bravo!

224
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,860
It's more imposing than I was before.

225
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,260
That's right!

226
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,990
Insolent!

227
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,620
How dare you,

228
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,360
a little girl,

229
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,270
criticize my actions!

230
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,520
Kneel!

231
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,090
Not bad.

232
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,240
That's right.

233
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,820
I used to be like this before.

234
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,820
Keep practicing.

235
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,320
Do I still need to practice?
