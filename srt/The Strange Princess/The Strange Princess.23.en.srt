00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,760
Lan.

3
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,640
Tianxing.

4
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,960
Are you waiting for me?

5
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,520
Come here.

6
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:00,880
Lan,

7
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,160
I neglected you a few days ago.

8
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,560
I apologize.

9
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,480
I hope you can forgive me.

10
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,039
On the wedding day,

11
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,960
not only did I not consummate the marriage,

12
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,860
but I also didn't drink the nuptial cup with you.

13
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,440
I'll make it up today.

14
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,720
I'm very happy

15
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,880
with your attitude tonight.

16
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,520
I've been fighting battles with my father since I was young.

17
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,250
I've killed countless people.

18
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,160
This toast is

19
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:49,120
to those who died under my sword.

20
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,330
If you don't want to fight and kill,

21
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,360
I'll ask Father

22
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,020
to find you another position.

23
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,720
Here, Lan.

24
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,360
The country's disaster is not over yet.

25
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,490
How can a general remove his armor?

26
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,720
This toast is

27
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,320
to

28
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,640
my future enemy.

29
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,000
Tianxing,

30
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,960
no matter what you do in the future,

31
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
I'll support you.

32
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,450
As long as you...

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,360
Tianxing.

34
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,420
Your Highness,

35
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,840
I'm sorry.

36
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,480
You can pass the four gates with my father's token.

37
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,480
No one will stop you at the city gate.

38
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,450
What I'm worried about is the people outside.

39
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,400
How about this?

40
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,840
I'll help you to hold them.

41
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
You take my father away first.

42
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,400
Yes.

43
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,600
How are you going to leave?

44
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,860
I'll find another way.

45
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,840
We must meet

46
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,600
before dawn.

47
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,120
Yes.

48
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,560
I risked my life

49
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,240
and finally became a general,

50
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,570
and now I'm doing this lowly job of monitoring people again.

51
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,120
Any news about Wu Fugui?

52
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,650
What are you talking about?

53
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,470
You don't take me as a general anymore?

54
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,800
Are you crazy?

55
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,000
Screw you!

56
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,440
Why did you hit me?

57
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,040
I'll even kill you!

58
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,720
General.

59
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,600
I'm here.

60
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,720
Who is he?

61
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,440
He's a real beggar.

62
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,040
Get lost!

63
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,120
Watch your mouth.

64
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,440
You don't even know what capital crime you committed.

65
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:30,920
Get lost!

66
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,360
Fine, I'll get lost.

67
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,530
Wait and see.

68
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,120
Wait and see.

69
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,370
Any news about Wu Fugui?

70
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,920
No.

71
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,680
Do you think Wu Fugui

72
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,680
has messed things up?

73
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,880
I don't think so.

74
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,610
As long as we keep a close eye on this place,

75
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,240
nothing will go wrong there.

76
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,450
This is him. This newcomer!

77
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,760
He not only occupied our territory,

78
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,440
but also hit people.

79
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,000
Beat him!

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,840
How dare you!

81
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,880
I'm a general.

82
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,080
Then, I'm the Emperor!

83
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,880
Beat him!

84
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,880
He's really a general.

85
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,720
Beat him to death!

86
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,050
Are you really doing it?

87
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,120
Stop it.

88
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,950
I'll kill you!

89
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,600
Beat him up!

90
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,160
Beat him!

91
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:15,960
I'll kill you!

92
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,020
What are you doing?

93
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,740
Get out!

94
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,760
Officer.

95
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,200
Run!

96
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,800
Run!

97
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,920
Hurry up.

98
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,270
After this,

99
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,040
I'll chop off your heads.

100
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,740
General, are you alright?

101
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,200
General.

102
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,560
It hurts!

103
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,960
General Qian.

104
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm not a general. I'm a beggar.

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,800
Qian Yikuang,

106
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
I know it's you.

107
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,760
Get up.

108
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:53,920
General Lu.

109
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,880
I wonder where you're going

110
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,340
in the middle of the night?

111
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,450
I want to ask you, General Qian,

112
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,760
what are you doing in front of my mansion

113
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,360
in the middle of the night, dressing like that?

114
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,040
Are you here to spy on me?

115
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,840
General Lu, how can you say that?

116
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,040
You're the Prince Consort now.

117
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,500
I can't wait to fawn on you.

118
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,080
We...

119
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,440
Oh, right!

120
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,800
We're here to share His Majesty's burden.

121
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,160
We disguised ourselves as beggars

122
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,280
and sneaked among the commoners

123
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,610
to investigate their living conditions.

124
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,340
General Qian, you care so much about the people.

125
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,320
I admire you.

126
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:27,960
Thank you.

127
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,360
This is the best wine in my cellar.

128
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,960
I'm willing to drink it with you.

129
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,120
How can I do that?

130
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,320
If you refuse,

131
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,440
then you must have been spying on me.

132
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,800
I'll go to the palace and report to His Majesty

133
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,000
to see if he wants to spy on me

134
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,560
or you, Qian Yikuang?

135
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,010
Isn't he behaving like a rogue?

136
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:51,960
Forget it.

137
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,840
I'd better not offend this guy.

138
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,600
Okay.

139
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,480
I'll drink it.

140
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,040
I'll drink it.

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,880
Good wine.

142
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,980
You put knockout drops in it, didn't you?

143
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,720
I'll go to the palace now.

144
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,420
General Lu.

145
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,680
I was just joking.

146
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,920
Why did you take it seriously?

147
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,000
Please forgive me.

148
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:31,960
Come on.

149
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,420
Let's drink until we drop.

150
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,400
Come on.

151
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,300
Come on.

152
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,280
Here.

153
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,000
Why aren't you drunk?

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,440
I dare not get drunk.

155
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,680
Why not?

156
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,480
Look.

157
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,210
What are you doing?

158
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,240
I can tell you now.

159
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,000
You...

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,880
I'm going to the palace.

161
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,360
Are you rebelling?

162
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,200
Prince Ying, the rebellious prince,

163
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,120
killed his brother to usurp power.

164
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,680
Both gods and mortals are indignant about it.

165
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,280
We are ordered by Princess Qian'er

166
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,930
to set things right.

167
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,360
Let's charge into the palace

168
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,800
and take down the rebellious prince!

169
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,200
Take down the rebellious prince!

170
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,640
Take down the rebellious prince!

171
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,500
Take down the rebellious prince!

172
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,880
Princess Jiang Qian'er leads the volunteer army to take down the rebellious prince.
