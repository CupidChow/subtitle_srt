00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:53,830
Qian'er,

5
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,220
did I do something wrong?

6
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,420
Why do you hate me so much?

7
00:01:11,289 --> 00:01:17,440
♫I'm no longer attached to my childhood dream♫

8
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,030
You came at the right time.

9
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,220
♫Live my life again in a wrong way♫

10
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:19,580
Here.

11
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:29,750
♫I miss you so much, no need to wait for you♫

12
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,030
Young General Lu, no need to be upset.

13
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,900
I guess Her Highness must have her reasons.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,620
♫I know who I love and I'm affectionate♫

15
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,400
You don't understand.

16
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,850
But I do understand.

17
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:42,009
♫How can breeze and mountain creeks compare to time?♫

18
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,420
You don't know

19
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,539
how much I like her.

20
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,030
♫Fancy things are like the passing clouds♫

21
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,340
I fell in love with her

22
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,330
when I first met her.

23
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:54,110
♫My ambition is to fight bravely on battlefields♫

24
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:59,780
♫Conspiracies are just illusions♫

25
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,420
Then...

26
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,530
she's really happy.

27
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:06,630
♫Love is like water, flowing slowly♫

28
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,110
You don't understand.

♫I'm worried I might let you down♫

30
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:07,750

Let's drink.

32
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,340
I understand.

33
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:18,860
♫We're destined to meet and I look forward to our future♫

35
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,900
Study Partner Ma,

36
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,020
I drank too much last night.

37
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,620
Did I say anything improper?

38
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:14,940
No.

39
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,730
That's good.

40
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,370
What?

41
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,030
You know kung fu too?

42
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,570
I... I don't.

43
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,740
I almost forgot who you are.

44
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,020
How could you not know kung fu?

45
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,500
Come here.

46
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
Practice with me.

47
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,190
I really don't know kung fu.

48
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,190
What are you talking about?

49
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,570
Come.

50
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Practice with me.

51
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,090
Come.

52
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,980
Are you ready?

53
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,900
Ma Dayou, what are you doing?

54
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,020
Let go of me!

55
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,500
Let's have another competition in swordsmanship.

56
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,410
What do you think?

57
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,780
I... I need to go to the toilet.

58
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,340
Let's not compete today.

59
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,620
You were standing when peeing.

60
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,810
Ma Dayou,

61
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,500
you were not castrated?

62
00:04:59,500 --> 00:04:59,920
I...

63
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,120
No wonder you wouldn't sleep with me.

64
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,370
No wonder you risked your life

65
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,650
to save Ma Dayou.

66
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,980
I really don't understand.

67
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,780
What makes a bandit outshine me?

68
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,420
Tell me.

69
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,820
Do you like him or me?

70
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,980
I'm the boss of the bandits.

71
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,200
I didn't expect that I'm being forced to like a man.

72
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,290
I like you.

73
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,060
Okay?

74
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,250
Then sleep with me tonight.

75
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:31,980
No.

76
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,090
Lu, listen.

77
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,250
Don't push me.

78
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,330
Otherwise,

79
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,780
I'll run away from home.

80
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,840
To Jimao Mountain?

81
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,909
I'm going to kill Ma Dayou now.

82
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,659
Then I'll lead a troop of soldiers to destroy Jimao Mountain.

83
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:46,500
Don't. Don't.

84
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,020
I give in, okay?

85
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,820
At this point,

86
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,659
I can only tell you the truth.

87
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,650
Do you still remember

88
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,380
the lightning when you saved me

89
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,020
after Ma Dayou kidnapped me?

90
00:05:59,050 --> 00:05:59,970
Stop talking nonsense.

91
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,740
I'm not.

92
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,020
The truth is after getting struck by that lightning,

93
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,420
I don't know why

94
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,340
my feelings have become his feelings

95
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,670
and his feelings have become my feelings.

96
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,820
Can you understand?

97
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,540
You don't understand, right?

98
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,810
Simply put,

99
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,980
when I feel painful, he feels painful too.

100
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,700
When he feels painful, I feel painful too.

101
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,760
I don't believe it.

102
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,740
Fine.

103
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,330
Then let's do an experiment.

104
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,930
I'm going to ask him here now.

105
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,260
You can just explain it to Tianxing.

106
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,580
Why bother?

107
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,330
Will he believe me?

108
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,220
Now, I don't have time

109
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,340
to comfort his broken heart.

110
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,100
Hongsu has found out the whereabouts of the evil servant.

111
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,880
Don't you want

112
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,830
to clear your Uncle Ying's name?

113
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,100
Fine.

114
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,760
Let's do as you say.

115
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,740
Ready.

116
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,410
The right hand. You pricked the right hand.

117
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,650
Hair.

118
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,940
How could this happen?

119
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,840
Now you believe me, right?

120
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,370
So, being castrated hurts a lot.

121
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,210
I disagree.

122
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,690
I heard having sex hurts a lot too.

123
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,490
He disagrees.

124
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,360
But I'm your husband after all.

125
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,260
You are with another man all day long.

126
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,530
Moreover,

127
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,630
your feelings are connected.

128
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Have you thought about my feelings?

129
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,540
Are you worried I'll fall in love with him?

130
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,860
No.

131
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,690
Does it hurt?

132
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,280
He's the one who feels painful.

133
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,430
It doesn't hurt anymore.

134
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:14,630
Your Majesty,

135
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,980
the princess and prince consort entered the palace.

136
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,310
I don't want to see them.

137
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,170
Honey,

138
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,530
let's hide now.

139
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,360
Why?

140
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,930
Let's ask them first.

141
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,960
Did General Lu come with them?

142
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:26,700
No.

143
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,500
It's good that he didn't come.

144
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,100
He came to complain to me every day.

145
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,289
Who can stand it?

146
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,340
Tell them to come here.

147
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:34,880
Yes.

148
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:47,580
-Greetings, Father, Mother.
-Greetings, Father, Mother.

149
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:48,620
Rise.

150
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:49,670
Have a seat.

151
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,620
Qian'er.

152
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,460
I heard that you did something strange

153
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,050
in Lu's Mansion.

154
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:05,570
Did I?

155
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,690
Lu.

156
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,290
Did I?

157
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,700
Father,

158
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,700
Qian'er has always been well-behaved.

159
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,300
Qian'er,

160
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,800
I heard

161
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,950
you always hung out

162
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,830
with a group of monks and taoists.

163
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,250
That was because...

164
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,850
Because...

165
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,610
Father,

166
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,980
I'm a general.

167
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,500
It's inevitable to engage in battles.

168
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,180
Qian'er invited them to pray for us

169
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,150
so that we can stay safe.

170
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,690
I knew it.

171
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,610
Qian'er wouldn't be so immature.

172
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,250
Father,

173
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,600
I'm in Imperial City every day.

174
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,680
I'm bored to death.

175
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,580
I want to stay at Uncle Ying's place for a few days.

176
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,220
Okay.

177
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,820
I'll tell Prince Ying

178
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,840
to get ready.
