1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,080
I'm not going to the brothel.

3
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,960
Don't come over.

4
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,120
So what if I come over?

5
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,880
Up you go!

6
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,680
Stop!

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,920
I'll pay for them.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,920
Thank you.

9
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,280
You're lucky.

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,170
Let's go.

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,879
Lu Ming.

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,500
You didn't expect me to be alive, did you?

13
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,810
Where's Hongsu?

14
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,560
Miss Yang...

15
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,200
Miss Yang.

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,320
Surrender.

17
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,400
If I put in a good word for you before His Highness,

18
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,920
he might spare your life.

19
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,080
Qian Yikuang.

20
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,480
Bring it on!

21
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,199
If Miss Yang hadn't risked her life to resist Qian Yikuang,

22
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,000
I wouldn't have survived.

23
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,800
Those cuts hurt my organs.

24
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,480
It took me some time

25
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,920
to get back on my feet.

26
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,840
I didn't expect that things would have changed so much.

27
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,440
Nothing is the same anymore.

28
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,840
Hongsu.

29
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,400
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,079
If it weren't for me,

31
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,440
you wouldn't have been killed by Qian Yikuang.

32
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,240
Don't worry.

33
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,770
If I don't take revenge for you,

34
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,920
I will not live.

35
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,320
Hongsu.

36
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,920
Thank you.

37
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,840
I will avenge you.

38
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,180
Your Highness,

39
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,080
I heard that General Lu surrendered to Prince Ying.

40
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,740
Even Young General Lu also...

41
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,320
Is...

42
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,560
Is that true?

43
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,520
Ask him yourself.

44
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,240
Okay.

45
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,040
I'll ask him now.

46
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,079
Young General Lu,

47
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:32,210
please don't make it difficult for me.

48
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,920
Who are you?

49
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,320
Food delivery.

50
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,079
Young General Lu.

51
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,840
Lu Ming?

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,130
You're still alive?

53
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,280
Great!

54
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,100
The heavens pitied me.

55
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,420
I'm still lucky enough to follow you.

56
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,079
Don't waste time on catching up.

57
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,040
Let's hurry up.

58
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,000
Someone is waiting for you outside.

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,640
Who?

60
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,490
Her Highness the Princess.

61
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,240
Let's go.

62
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,960
Young General Lu.

63
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,690
You go first.

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,660
I'll deal with the guy outside

65
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,160
in case someone sees him, and it causes trouble.

66
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,680
Okay.

67
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,680
Qian'er.

68
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,840
I am Jiang Qian'er.

69
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,640
I'm not Ma Dayou.

70
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
At this point,

71
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,780
whether you believe it or not,

72
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,060
we don't need to hide it from you anymore.

73
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,000
Actually,

74
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,240
I am Ma Dayou.

75
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,450
What are you talking about?

76
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,560
This is not a place where we can talk properly.

77
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,290
Come with me.

78
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,680
That's what happened.

79
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,560
I see.

80
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,840
No wonder I always feel

81
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,840
something is wrong between you two.

82
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,400
Let me calm down.

83
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,480
So what if we've swapped our bodies?

84
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,480
I'm going to kill you today! You hypocrite!

85
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,409
Unfaithful man!

86
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,120
Enough.

87
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,120
Are you done?

88
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,320
Are you the Princess

89
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
or the mountain king?

90
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,080
You should at least give him a chance to explain.

91
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:51,840
Right, Lu?

92
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,810
So, since you fainted in the derelict temple,

93
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,720
you've switched bodies?

94
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,360
Bingo.

95
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,520
Then,

96
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,810
since the wedding night, the one who's been sleeping in the same bed with me

97
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,330
has always been…

98
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,880
My soul and her body.

99
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,440
Does it sound a bit complicated?

100
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,040
But that is the truth.

101
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,210
Prince Consort.

102
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,570
Prince Consort.

103
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,650
Prince Consort, are you all right?

104
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,680
Alright.

105
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,810
Give him some space.

106
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,840
Lu.

107
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,240
Consider yourself lucky.

108
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,080
Luckily, you didn't really sleep with me.

109
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,210
Otherwise, you'll be more disgusted.

110
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,290
Now, you should understand

111
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,340
that I, Jiang Qian'er,

112
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,610
have never done anything wrong to you.

113
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,980
But you and your father

114
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,080
betrayed me and Father.

115
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,480
I never said yes to them.

116
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,720
If I weren't worried for your safety,

117
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,520
I would have died to show my determination.

118
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,440
Are you telling the truth?

119
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,490
When have I ever lied to you?

120
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,520
Tianxing.

121
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,160
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,440
I wronged you.

123
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,280
Do my looks make you uncomfortable?

124
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,760
Why does it sound so harsh?

125
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,080
No matter what you become,

126
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,240
you'll always be Qian'er, the most beautiful girl in my heart.

127
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,040
Same here.

128
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,560
Enough.

129
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,520
It's not appropriate for kids to watch.

130
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,000
Qingyu is still here.

131
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,160
I'm not a kid.

132
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,440
I've grown up.

133
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,440
Now that you learned I'm not the Princess,

134
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,240
your attitude changed so quickly.

135
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,960
Tell me, how have you grown?

136
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,160
Let me have a look.

137
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,600
You...

138
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,280
Don't dream of taking advantage of me

139
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,080
by being in the Princess's body.

140
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,760
Fine.

141
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,320
The last benefit for me

142
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,280
was taken away ruthlessly.

143
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,440
Enough.

144
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,360
Let's think about

145
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,240
what we should do next.

146
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,240
Prince Ying announced the sudden death of the late Emperor to the public.

147
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,080
That's why he inherited his brother's throne.

148
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,080
Once the people believe that,

149
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,440
your identity as the Princess of the Former Emperor

150
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,039
will become a killing charm.

151
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,560
We have to run away.

152
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,280
Let's run…

153
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,920
Let's run as far as possible.

154
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,380
Let's run to a place where they can't find us.

155
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,320
I'm not leaving.

156
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,000
Me neither.

157
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,920
Prince Ying doesn't kill you now,

158
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,520
but it doesn't mean he won't do it in the future.

159
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,080
I want revenge.

160
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,760
That's right.

161
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,890
I want revenge, too.

162
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,600
How?

163
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,520
I...

164
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,760
I don't know.

165
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,800
I have an idea.

166
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,200
But...

167
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,900
Tianxing has to sacrifice himself for the plan.

168
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,680
If it can really avenge you,

169
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,520
it's nothing that I sacrifice a little.

170
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,160
Tell me.

171
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,960
Be the groom again.

172
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,920
Okay.

173
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,000
I'll do it one more time.

174
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,880
You call that sacrifice?

175
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,780
I wish I could suffer like that every day.

176
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,240
Xing.

177
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,280
Have you finally come to your senses?

178
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,160
Yes, I have.

179
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,440
Okay.

180
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,160
I'm going to discuss

181
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,160
your wedding date with His Majesty.

182
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,480
Father,

183
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,280
I have one more thing.

184
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,570
I wonder if the new Emperor will put me in an important position.

185
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,400
I don't want to rely on you anymore.

186
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,000
I've been called Young General Lu all day long.

187
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,800
I want to be a real general.

188
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,120
You've grown up.

189
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,720
I'll report to His Majesty now.

190
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,440
After you get married,

191
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,720
I'll hand over the military affairs of Nation-guarding General's Mansion

192
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,400
to you gradually.

193
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,110
I want to have a grandson

194
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,460
and enjoy a peaceful retirement.

195
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,120
Lu Tianxing is the Prince Consort of the Former Emperor, after all.

196
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,720
We must be cautious about his leading the army.

197
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,880
He will be my son-in-law soon.

198
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,280
As long as he doesn't collude with the Princess of the Former Emperor,

199
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,140
it's fine to let him lead the army.

200
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,720
After all,

201
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,680
who else can he be loyal to?

202
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,640
Should we find a chance

203
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,640
to kill the Princess of the Former Emperor

204
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
to prevent future troubles?

205
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,480
Later,

206
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,720
when the people forget the Princess of the Former Emperor,

207
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,840
we can take action.

208
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,560
Yes, Your Majesty.
