[The Strange Princess]

00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,150
[Episode 10]

4
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,470
Is the magical oriental magic

5
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,830
going to happen?

6
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,750
Darn it.

7
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,950
You really are a liar.

8
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:09,750
Calm down.

9
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,770
Your Highness, you said

10
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,470
you switched your souls

11
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,030
after you woke up from sleep.

12
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,240
Go back and sleep.

13
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,270
After you wake up,

14
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,210
everything will go back to normal.

15
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,510
Take it.

16
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:29,670
I dare not.

17
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,680
Take it.

18
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,210
Just wait here.

19
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:38,270
If we can't switch our bodies back,

20
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,190
you know what will happen.

21
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:47,600
Let's go.

22
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,190
I can't stay here for long.

23
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,840
I have to leave now.

24
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,770
Why are you leaving?

25
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,170
I don't have time for you.

26
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,590
I got it.

27
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,910
You were lying.

28
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,509
My God.

29
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,000
As if you would never lie.

30
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:10,949
Stop.

31
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:11,830
You can't leave.

32
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,760
You can't leave.

33
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,070
You want to wait for death here.

34
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,000
But I don't want to.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,520
Let go!

36
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,350
No.

37
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,120
Abracadabra.

38
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,260
It's none of your business!

39
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,040
It's none of your business!

40
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,560
Yellow Hair, mind your own business.

41
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,240
Stop!

42
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,320
Stop!

43
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,340
Guys, wait for me.

44
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,530
I'll be back soon.

45
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,310
Tianxing,

46
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,290
wait for me.

47
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:50,320
I can be by your side soon.

48
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,880
Why am I still like this?

49
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,210
Darn it!

50
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,690
That jerk.

51
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,160
I won't forgive him!

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,079
Darn it!

53
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,180
I was fooled by a quack.

54
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,670
Maybe it's fate.

55
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,950
I don't believe in fate.

56
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,079
Who's there?

57
00:03:59,390 --> 00:03:59,990
It's them.

58
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,810
Get up!

59
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:02,530
Get up!

60
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,230
Move.

61
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,470
Move.

62
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,550
God bless me.

63
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,900
You finally came.

64
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,150
He's a liar.

65
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,990
You dishonest liar!

66
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,110
You liar!

67
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,550
How dare you lie to me!

68
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,430
I have an idea.

69
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,060
You want to fool me again?

70
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,610
Your Highness.

71
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,020
Listen to me. There really is a way.

72
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,070
It depends on

73
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,750
whether you have the guts to do it or not.

74
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,970
Get struck by lightning again.

75
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,040
Get struck by lightning again?

76
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,750
Yes.

77
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:35,970
Nonsense.

78
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,870
Are you trying to fool me?

79
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:37,710
Beat him! Beat him!

80
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,150
No.

81
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,030
No.

82
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,360
Listen to me.

83
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,659
According to Buddhist scriptures,

84
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:42,860
fate is arranged by God.

85
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,560
Changing fate is up to ourselves.

86
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,510
You reap

87
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,790
what you sow.

88
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,500
Everything is the cause.

89
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,420
Everything is the result.

90
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,150
Aren't you a taoist?

91
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,550
Why did you read Buddhist scriptures?

92
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,710
I read a lot of books.

93
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,790
I've learned a lot.

94
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,270
Anyway,

95
00:04:58,409 --> 00:04:59,710
that lightning is the cause.

96
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,340
Body switching is the result.

97
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,140
It is up to the doer to undo the knot.

98
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,310
Why didn't you tell us yesterday?

99
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,870
Exactly.

100
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,970
It's too dangerous.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,310
Even if you dared to believe it,

102
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,350
I didn't dare to tell you.

103
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,250
Get struck by lightning again?

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,660
Let's do it!

105
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,630
Do you have any relative in Heaven?

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,240
If you do,

107
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,909
please tell him to ask Thunder God and Lightning Goddess

108
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:40,150
to be gentle,

109
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,700
so that we won't turn into ashes.

110
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,530
You are quite bold now.

111
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,330
Handsome oriental warriors,

112
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,280
God will bless you.

113
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,340
This has nothing to do with me.

114
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,150
Amen.

115
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,780
Your Highness,

116
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,920
if we really can switch our bodies back,

117
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,050
please

118
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,080
spare my men.

119
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,910
Their lives are miserable too.

120
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,240
Stop talking.

121
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,770
I dare not lie again.

122
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,390
I want to go home.

123
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,610
God, please forgive me.

124
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,870
I won't peep at nuns while they are taking a shower anymore.

125
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,450
Immortal,

126
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,760
can you aim more accurately?

127
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,080
Qian'er, be careful!

128
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,880
Come back now!

129
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,160
-Stay away! It's dangerous!
-Stay away! It's dangerous!

130
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,570
You can just tell me if you don't want to sleep with me.

131
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,010
Why are you doing this?

132
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,650
Here, Qian'er.

133
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:42,659
Hurry.

134
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:44,430
It's still hot.

135
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,850
Lu,

136
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,060
I have something to discuss with you.

137
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:56,870
I've drunk too much brown sugar water.

138
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,440
I don't want to drink it anymore.

139
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,800
If I feel uncomfortable, just let it be.

140
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,900
It's been over a month since we got married.

141
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,300
You've been using this excuse to fob me off.

142
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,130
If you didn't want to marry me,

143
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:14,600
you...

144
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,430
I can't stay here anymore.

145
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,130
I have to go to Hongsu as soon as possible.
