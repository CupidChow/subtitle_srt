1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,360
Ma Dayou,

3
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,960
I knew you just won't give up.

4
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,400
Now you should be with Qian'er

5
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,530
and stay by her side.

6
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,000
Don't forget

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,360
your life is Qian'er's life.

8
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,960
If you act recklessly like this again,

9
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,480
I'll ask someone to take you back to the mansion immediately.

10
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,210
Don't expect to come out again.

11
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,740
Go back to the mansion with me now.

12
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,320
No.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,600
I have my own things to do.

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,960
If possible,

15
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,160
I will take revenge

16
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
for your father.

17
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,039
Really?

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,740
Have I ever lied to you?

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,920
Deal.

20
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,490
What does this mean?

21
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:33,100
Give me a high five and it's a promise.

22
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:41,640
Prince Consort,

23
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,680
Ma,

24
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,920
I finally found you.

25
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,640
Her Highness...

26
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,840
-What happened to her?
-What happened to her?

27
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,440
Go take a look now.

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,640
Let's go.

29
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,080
Just now, he said

30
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,040
your life is the princess's life.

31
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,640
What does that mean?

32
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,470
Now I don't have time to explain this to you.

33
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,670
We'll talk about this later.

34
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,560
Ma Dayou.

35
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,759
Remember what I did for you.

36
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,360
It's not convenient for me to enter this place.

37
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,480
I'll find a way to find that evil servant.

38
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,800
Remember to come to me when you come out next time.

39
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,520
I will.

40
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,960
Again.

41
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,720
What took you so long?

42
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,200
Look.

43
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,440
Look.

44
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,680
It hurts.

45
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,520
Your Highness, you asked someone to help you.

46
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,680
Girls, we should brace ourselves up.

47
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,240
You set the first two questions.

48
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,680
It's my turn to set the next question, right?

49
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,120
Of course.

50
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,800
We don't want others to say we're bullying you.

51
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,120
Good.

52
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,160
Tomorrow,

53
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,400
take your husbands here.

54
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,160
Why?

55
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,960
The next question is about a competition among men.

56
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,290
This is the last batch of supplies.

57
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,640
I'll transport them to Jimao Mountain with you.

58
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,560
When His Highness gives the order,

59
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,800
you and I will go straight to Imperial City.

60
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,600
If we help him ascend the throne,

61
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,360
we can enjoy a wealthy and luxurious life soon.

62
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,400
Why are you looking at me?

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,280
What's wrong?

64
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,280
Is there still ink on my face?

65
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,200
Why?

66
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,320
I remember you were very impressive.

67
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,920
Well...

68
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,500
Even a sharp shooter may miss the target.

69
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,120
You win some, you lose some.

70
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,440
But the current you

71
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,720
are not like the past you.

72
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,120
are not like the past you.

73
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,520
What was I like in the past?

74
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,000
Let me think.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,640
In the past, you were

76
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,000
knowledgeable,

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,400
elegant,

78
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,800
considerate,

79
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,660
well-educated, and reasonable.

80
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,290
Something is wrong.

81
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,020
Where is he?

82
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,480
I heard a businessman

83
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,080
has been secretly buying prohibited products

84
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,600
like beef tendons, deer-horn glue, and pig iron.

85
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,530
They will be transported to Jimao Mountain tonight.

86
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Now it seems

87
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,040
even if Prince Ying doesn't intend to start a rebellion,

88
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,770
there must be something wrong in Jimao Mountain.

89
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,159
Let's go.

90
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,010
Let's go to Jimao Mountain.

91
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,560
What are you doing?

92
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,520
Tell us.

93
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,800
Where is that villain?

94
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,040
I don't know.

95
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,520
Are you going to tell us or not?

96
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,920
If you are not going to tell us,

97
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,520
I'm really going to kill you.

98
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,770
Jimao Mountain.

99
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,360
I didn't expect this to have something to do with Jimao Mountain.

100
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,240
It seems that

101
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,760
Ma Dayou is the mastermind behind this.

102
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,840
If Ma Dayou is the mastermind,

103
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,120
the princess...

104
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,659
has invited a wolf into her house, right?

105
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,810
Did you see clearly?

106
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,370
We need to ask Qian Yikuang about this.

107
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,080
You go back now

108
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,480
to protect the princess.

109
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,170
I'm going to ask him.

110
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Ma Dayou?

111
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,320
It really is you.

112
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,840
Tianxing,

113
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,960
why are you here?

114
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,620
I'm here to catch you, a rebel!

115
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,400
Tianxing,

116
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,660
you misunderstood me.

117
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
Young General Lu.

118
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,700
Who are you?

119
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,600
Someone broke into the fortress.

120
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,440
Second Master,

121
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,300
someone broke into the fortress!

122
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,680
Ma Dayou?

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,880
Lu Tianxing?

124
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,760
Qian Yikuang,

125
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
why are you with this evil servant?

126
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,280
Do you have anything to do

127
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,280
with the old chief's death?

128
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,159
Ma Dayou,

129
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,960
isn't it good for you to be a eunuch

130
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,120
beside the princess?

131
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,180
Why did you come back to Jimao Mountain to ask for death?

132
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,090
Something is wrong.

133
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,320
We can talk about the misunderstanding later.

134
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,640
Just cut the crap.

135
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,640
Kill them!

136
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,680
Go!

137
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,200
Your Highness, you set this question yourself.

138
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,960
What?

139
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,559
Prince Consort doesn't dare to come?

140
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,159
Nonsense!

141
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,600
My brother-in-law is the young general of General's Mansion.

142
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,640
He is versed in both literature and martial arts.

143
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,100
Of course he dares to come.

144
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,000
He... must have been delayed by something.

145
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,000
Lu Tianxing kept pestering me every day

146
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,040
when he wanted to sleep with me.

147
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,370
Now he is not here at this critical moment.

148
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,380
Your Highness.

149
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,500
Your Highness.

150
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,620
Your Highness,

151
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,000
I've searched the whole mansion,

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,280
but I still couldn't find Prince Consort.

153
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,480
What about Ma Dayou?

154
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,730
I couldn't find him either.

155
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,520
Where did these two jerks go?
