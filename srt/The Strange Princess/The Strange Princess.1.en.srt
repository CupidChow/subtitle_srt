took over the mountain as his personal domain,

193
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,590
committed various crimes,

194
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,130
and harmed the people.

195
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,740
His identity has been confirmed,

196
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,680
and he will be beheaded in public.

197
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,070
It's time.

198
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,900
Execute!

199
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,070
Hurry up!

200
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,810
Stop them!

201
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,100
Don't let them escape.

202
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,140
Tell them to release him!

203
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,680
Stop!

204
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,710
Let him go!

205
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,850
Lu Tianxing,

206
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,730
I give you a free hand to handle this matter.

207
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,900
You must arrest

208
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,040
the bandit leader.

209
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,180
Lu Tianxing! Lu Tianxing!

210
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,450
Wait for me!

211
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,360
Qian'er.

212
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,270
I just want to know

213
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,750
what's with Ma Dayou.

214
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:34,919
After the two robbers

215
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,240
made a scene in the execution square,

216
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,090
I've ordered my men to block the city gate.

217
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,240
They won't come out.

218
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,150
Go back now.

219
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:41,840
Lu Ming.

220
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:42,620
Yes.

221
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,600
Send the Princess back to the palace.

222
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,039
Yes.

223
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:45,870
Your Highness.

224
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,920
Please return to the palace.

225
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,280
[Green Chamber]

226
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:51,670
Okay.

227
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,570
I'm going back to the palace.

228
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,140
My stomach hurts.

229
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,770
I need to go to the toilet.

230
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,130
Your Highness.

231
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,640
You two guard the back door.

232
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,030
If the Princess comes out,

233
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,050
bring her here immediately.

234
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,250
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

235
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,100
Idiot.

236
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,150
Consider it your day of bad luck.

237
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,600
Lend me your clothes.

238
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,290
I'm going away.

239
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,750
He can't see me.

240
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,210
What's going on?

241
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,060
Why is there another Ma Dayou?

242
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,200
I became the Princess.

243
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,810
That means the original Princess

244
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,770
could be me.

245
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,460
Could the woman who broke into the execution square...

246
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,490
be…

247
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,490
Yang Hongsu?
