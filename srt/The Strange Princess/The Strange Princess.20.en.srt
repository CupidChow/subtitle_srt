1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,520
We should

3
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,640
think of a way

4
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,520
to switch our bodies back as soon as possible, right?

5
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,920
I feel like vomiting

6
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,150
at the thought that you're using my pretty face

7
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,150
to be lovey-dovey with another man.

8
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,440
There's no rush.

9
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,690
Your body is still useful to me.

10
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,680
What do you want to do?

11
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,020
Practice martial arts

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,960
and avenge my father.

13
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,360
Go away.

14
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,200
Why?

15
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,560
I'm going to make the bed for the princess.

16
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,920
I'm not like someone.

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,440
Except looking the same as the princess,

18
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,520
she's useless.

19
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,200
You...

20
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,120
How unreasonable!

21
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,880
How many princesses do I have to marry?

22
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,220
Your Highness.

23
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,480
Brother-in-law.

24
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,720
Tianxing.

25
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,520
This

26
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,560
was your wedding room with Qian'er, right?

27
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,980
Your Highness,

28
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,620
it's all in the past. Don't mention it again.

29
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,240
Now you must hate me

30
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,000
for taking you away from Qian'er.

31
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,880
I know you still love her.

32
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,840
I promised my father to marry you

33
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,880
in order to save you and her.

34
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,440
Maybe this is fate.

35
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,070
I can't resist it.

36
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,520
I accept my fate.

37
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,720
Thank you.

38
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,480
It's all my father's fault.

39
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,240
I'm just atoning for his sins.

40
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,880
Tianxing,

41
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
remember,

42
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,760
from now on,

43
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,800
we are a couple.

44
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,410
I don't allow you to think of her again.

45
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,680
You have to erase her

46
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,880
from our life.

47
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,680
It's good for both you and her.

48
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,560
Promise me.

49
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,920
Tianxing,

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,860
you must be having a hard time now.

51
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,640
Yes.

52
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,280
Very hard.

53
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,120
Very very hard.

54
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,830
For me,

55
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,840
Tianxing used his body to exchange for a chance.

56
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
He has suffered great humiliation.

57
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,120
Yes.

58
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,320
Great humiliation.

59
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,410
The humiliation is beyond the description of words.

60
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,640
He's not like you.

61
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,240
You are not manly at all.

62
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,520
I'm a woman now.

63
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,560
I...

64
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,320
Forget it.

65
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,580
I won't argue with you.

66
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,520
I'm going to bed.

67
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,200
Your Highness,

68
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,080
it's late.

69
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,080
It's time to rest.

70
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,240
Okay.

71
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,600
The princess looks so handsome after she became a man.

72
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,080
The bedroom is for the princess to rest.

73
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
You can't come in.

74
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,040
Little girl,

75
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,080
I've had enough of you.

76
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,280
Don't force me to hit a woman.

77
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,010
Who asked you to say I'm little?

78
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,400
Where should I sleep?

79
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,330
In the woodshed.

80
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,560
Fine.

81
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,960
It's not like I haven't slept there before.

82
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,680
Tianxing,

83
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,000
you're awake.

84
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,680
Drink the hangover soup now.

85
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,010
I specially asked the servants to make it.

86
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,920
If it were Qian'er here now,

87
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,970
it would be so great.

88
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,000
No need.

89
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,500
What do you want to eat?

90
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,380
I'll ask the servants to cook now.

91
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,320
Don't bother.

92
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,650
Where are you going?

93
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,680
His Majesty ascended the throne not long ago.

94
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,540
There are many military affairs.

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,400
I'm going to handle them.

96
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,720
Tianxing.

97
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,600
Remember what I said last night.

98
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,280
I know.

99
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,920
I will do better than Qian'er

100
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,520
and strive to make you forget her soon.

101
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,720
You'll understand me

102
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,880
sooner or later.

103
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,720
Young General Lu, you've gained Prince Ying's trust.

104
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,560
I think we can carry out the next step.

105
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,240
Although I can handle military affairs,

106
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,360
I just got married.

107
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,320
I think Prince Ying is still suspicious of me.

108
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,790
It's inconvenient for me to contact the generals in the army frequently.

109
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,520
Everyone in the army knows that I trust you.

110
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,240
You go on behalf of me.

111
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,120
Yes.

112
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,200
But General Lu is the greatest contributor

113
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,400
who welcomed Prince Ying into the city.

114
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,320
If you stand against Prince Ying,

115
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,280
I'm afraid those generals who are dissatisfied with Prince Ying

116
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,640
will feel confused.

117
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,600
Tell them

118
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,170
I'm not the one summoning them.

119
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,730
It's Princess Qian'er,

120
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,060
the only heir of the late emperor.

121
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,200
Yes.

122
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,760
I will tell them this.

123
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,660
Anything else?

124
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,170
I planned to discuss with the princess today,

125
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,200
but I discovered her residence is under surveillance.

126
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,920
They are Qian Yikuang's men.

127
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,240
I'm afraid

128
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,970
it'll be difficult to make her meet the generals.

129
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,940
You just need to contact them.

130
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,000
Leave this to me.

131
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,600
Yes.

132
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,480
Why are you back so late?

133
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,900
I met some old friends in the army.

134
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,890
So I got delayed.

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,960
You must be tired.

136
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,490
I'm going to get you some water for a foot bath.

137
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,740
Your Highness,

138
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,520
I'm sorry.

139
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,460
What are you trying to say?

140
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,600
Don't do this again.

141
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,280
I still can't forget her.

142
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,640
But you...

143
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,870
But you promised me.

144
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,460
You are different.

145
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,160
But if you do this,

146
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,710
will my father spare her?

147
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,800
Give me some more time.

148
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,450
After I completely forget her,

149
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,880
we'll be a couple.

150
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:52,960
Okay?

151
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,720
Okay.

152
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,610
I'll be waiting for you.

153
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,500
If I approach Qian'er rashly,

154
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,680
Prince Ying will definitely be suspicious.

155
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,610
Then the plan can't be carried out.

156
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,090
But if I let Qian'er be under their surveillance,

157
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,160
it'll be very difficult to escape from Imperial City,

158
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,960
not to mention

159
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,280
meeting those generals in private.

160
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,360
Although I married Princess Lan'er,

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,480
I can't betray Qian'er.

162
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,770
I can't sleep with her against my will.

163
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,760
As time goes by,

164
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,760
Prince Ying will notice this.

165
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,320
What should I do?

166
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,680
I guess this is the only way.
