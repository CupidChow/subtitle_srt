We are always so busy so we seldom have the chance to talk.

485
00:34:30,942 --> 00:34:33,840
We are here to talk with you and catch up.

486
00:34:34,596 --> 00:34:39,480
I think I had nothing going on all day

487
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,680
here in the company for a while.

488
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,092
You've never come to me to catch up.

489
00:34:44,092 --> 00:34:46,410
Why today?

490
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,259
Brother Morry, you know that we actually miss you.

491
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:59,030
Lucy always yells at us and beats us up.

492
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:05,840
We all broke several brooms in our office.

493
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:08,824
My poor things.

494
00:35:08,825 --> 00:35:10,405
She yelled at you?

495
00:35:10,405 --> 00:35:12,684
She beat you up?

496
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,530
Then, why did you two gain weight?

497
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,336
Get lost!

498
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,320
Speak if you want to, but I'm busy.

499
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,859
Brother Morry, we came to you, because

500
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:29,365
on behalf of everyone, we want to say that we want to come back...

501
00:35:29,366 --> 00:35:30,852
Brother Morry! Brother Morry!

502
00:35:30,853 --> 00:35:32,873
This is bad! Check the news!

503
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:34,589
Breaking news!

504
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:38,010
A video of You Xi and Shen Yiling meeting at a hotel has been released.

505
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,480
The rumor about You Xi's secret relationship has been proven true.

506
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,162
We are just here to check up on you.

507
00:35:45,163 --> 00:35:47,229
Since you are doing well, we have nothing to worry about anymore.

508
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:50,099
- We won't bother you anymore.
- See you, Brother Morry.

509
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,431
From the video, we can see

510
00:35:56,432 --> 00:36:00,509
that You Xi and Shen Yiling arrived at Room 9019 of Huateng Hotel.

511
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,709
They spent the night together

512
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,480
and didn't leave until the next morning.

513
00:36:10,728 --> 00:36:12,207
I didn't.

514
00:36:13,393 --> 00:36:15,096
I'm telling the truth!

515
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:19,732
Hello?

516
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,479
This thing has to go away no matter what!

517
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,640
Otherwise, you know what happens!

518
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,700
I swear!

519
00:36:40,463 --> 00:36:43,146
I didn't go to a hotel with Shen Yiling!

520
00:36:43,147 --> 00:36:45,457
I'm not interested in her in any way.

521
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,953
You have to believe me!

522
00:36:47,953 --> 00:36:50,723
You Xi, just tell us the truth.

523
00:36:50,724 --> 00:36:52,578
We are all friends here.

524
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:54,324
Shut up!

525
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,600
Don't listen to him.

526
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,101
I swear! If I went there,

527
00:37:00,101 --> 00:37:03,008
I'll be single for the rest of my life.

528
00:37:03,008 --> 00:37:06,000
Mr. You, you don't have to say that.

529
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,180
You did go to the hotel.

530
00:37:14,289 --> 00:37:16,110
I was framed.

531
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,459
We went together, don't you remember?

532
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:24,151
We went together?

533
00:37:24,151 --> 00:37:26,448
I was there for you during the recording.

534
00:37:26,448 --> 00:37:30,930
After that, you said that you were going to the dress-up party in the amusement park.

535
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,959
The party ended late,

536
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,747
so we stayed in the hotel nearby.

537
00:37:35,748 --> 00:37:39,010
At Huateng Hotel.

538
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:41,767
Your room number happens to be 9019,

539
00:37:41,767 --> 00:37:44,510
and you were wearing the exact clothes in the video.

540
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,080
Now I remember!

541
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,430
I stayed in 9019, and you were in 9018.

542
00:37:51,968 --> 00:37:55,714
So, you asked Shen Yiling to stay the night when your girlfriend was in the next room?

543
00:37:55,714 --> 00:37:56,959
You animal!

544
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,682
Haven't you played around enough? Stop making this worse!

545
00:38:00,682 --> 00:38:04,160
So how would you explain why Shen Yiling entered Room 9019?

546
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,545
How would I know?

547
00:38:05,546 --> 00:38:07,350
There is only one possible explanation.

548
00:38:09,006 --> 00:38:10,996
Film cuts.

549
00:38:13,151 --> 00:38:14,760
What are you talking about?

550
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,470
I'm saying that Shen Yiling did stay in Huateng Hotel,

551
00:38:18,471 --> 00:38:21,669
and her room number was 9019.

552
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:27,600
But who can actually tell if she was there on the same day as us?

553
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,320
So, you're saying that this video was put together using two different CCTV videos

554
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,590
from a different time point?

555
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:37,490
Then we just have to get our hands on the original video,

556
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:40,200
and their lies will no longer stand.

557
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,943
Understood.

558
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:46,894
I will find the original surveillance video within an hour.

559
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,045
Wait!

560
00:38:51,046 --> 00:38:52,260
What's wrong, Mr. You?

561
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,319
There is one thing that I don't understand.

562
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,820
What is it?

563
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,610
It's Shen Yiling.

564
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:01,550
As soon as the video came out, I wouldn't have been the only one affected.

565
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:04,310
What good does she get

566
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,450
for sacrificing herself to frame me?

567
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,950
Song Qiege!

568
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,974
Care to explain?

569
00:39:14,975 --> 00:39:17,010
You're asking me to explain?

570
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:19,316
You are the one who's involved in the news.

571
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:21,540
Do you care to explain?

572
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,130
I knew you were a jackass.

573
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:26,705
You are even worse than I thought. You even threw me under the bus.

574
00:39:26,705 --> 00:39:30,004
You tricked me in order to frame You Xi.

575
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,534
It's you?

576
00:39:37,535 --> 00:39:39,396
Surprise!

577
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:54,030
I can sell everyone besides myself.

578
00:39:56,322 --> 00:39:58,850
You think you can secure the leading role

579
00:39:58,851 --> 00:40:01,631
and relax just like that?

580
00:40:02,598 --> 00:40:05,048
You think I will let you?

581
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,079
I will tell everyone about all the things you did.

582
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,229
Every one of them.

583
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:14,999
I won't remain silent about this!

584
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,839
Let's see if you still have that chance.

585
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,634
Ten minutes ago, Shen Yiling posted on Weibo

586
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:24,920
confirming her secret relationship with You Xi.

587
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,190
Oh, right!

588
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:31,776
- And she expressed her desire to quit the entertainment industry.
- You…

589
00:40:31,776 --> 00:40:34,000
Looks like your assistant...

590
00:40:34,713 --> 00:40:36,960
has held a grudge against you for a long time.

591
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,510
It was easy to convince him.

592
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,845
By the way, I almost forgot.

593
00:40:43,846 --> 00:40:49,526
The board of directors decided to fire you.

594
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:53,660
That's impossible!

595
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,762
That's impossible! Song Qiege!

596
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:02,779
Shen Yiling! You're out!

597
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,190
Oh, and one other thing.

598
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:19,070
You were supposed to be the leading actress.

599
00:41:34,644 --> 00:41:36,834
Song Qiege!

600
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,854
The filming hasn't even started yet, and there's already a scandal between the two leads.

601
00:41:41,854 --> 00:41:43,566
How can we continue?

602
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:47,562
Times Entertainment just announced that Shen Yiling has been fired.

603
00:41:47,562 --> 00:41:49,740
There's no way she can participate now.

604
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,619
I think that we should prepare to find new candidates for the leading roles.

605
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,345
Things are spreading too fast.

606
00:42:00,346 --> 00:42:03,229
Within just a few hours after the video was played,

607
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:06,369
the forum's server crashed and went offline.

608
00:42:06,369 --> 00:42:08,340
As for Weibo, not only You Xi

609
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:12,106
but also Shengguo Entertainment and all the other actors and actresses in the company have taken a hit.

610
00:42:12,106 --> 00:42:13,839
The people are furious.

611
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,149
They want You Xi to explain everything.

612
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:19,356
As for Director Wei Ran, he has postponed the announcement of the leading roles.

613
00:42:19,356 --> 00:42:21,479
There were supposed to be five endorsement deals

614
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,479
but every company involved canceled negotiations.

615
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,581
And there are two companies that are on their way here to retrieve their contracts.

616
00:42:26,581 --> 00:42:29,899
What did I hire you all for? Is there no one handling this?

617
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,377
We are trying to prove that the video was edited.

618
00:42:37,378 --> 00:42:42,000
But Huateng Hotel insists that their CCTV record for the last month was lost,

619
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,960
and they cannot provide any proof.

620
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:49,300
Our Technical Department has analyzed the video, and they've found something.

621
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,399
Our stock prices are dropping.

622
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,009
If it keeps dropping like this, I'm afraid that...

623
00:42:54,009 --> 00:42:55,709
More endorsement deals will be canceled.

624
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,549
The other actors and actresses will be affected.

625
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,359
Wen Moxuan has twenty contracts that are about to be canceled,

626
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,442
Pan Duo has fifteen and Zheng Jia'er has eight.

627
00:43:01,442 --> 00:43:02,899
It's getting worse.

628
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,974
This is too much.

629
00:43:04,975 --> 00:43:08,659
If we don't tell people something, our stock prices will keep going down.

630
00:43:08,659 --> 00:43:11,998
And that will affect how the world sees this company.

631
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,977
I can't even imagine how this will end.

632
00:43:13,977 --> 00:43:19,111
Times Entertainment took the initiative when the video was first exposed and terminated the contract with Shen Yiling.

633
00:43:19,111 --> 00:43:21,879
They managed to make their stock prices stable.

634
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,989
Director Zhang, you have to stop hesitating and put the interest of our company first.

635
00:43:24,989 --> 00:43:26,919
Director Zhang, just give us a little more time.

636
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,589
I believe that the Technical Department will have a result soon.

637
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:32,969
The Technical Department just sent a message saying that they couldn't find anything.

638
00:43:32,969 --> 00:43:36,590
The video is genuine.

639
00:43:40,345 --> 00:43:43,629
Prepare the announcement.

640
00:43:43,629 --> 00:43:48,107
Shengguo Entertainment will terminate its contract with You Xi.

641
00:43:48,107 --> 00:43:50,951
- Do it.
- You can't do that!

642
00:44:22,204 --> 00:44:23,680
♫  The world is so big,  ♫

643
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,780
♫  yet a word of love from you makes me melt  ♫

644
00:44:27,781 --> 00:44:31,448
♫  Watching you decorate this little home,  ♫

645
00:44:31,449 --> 00:44:36,394
♫  the overflowing happiness can barely be contained  ♫

646
00:44:36,395 --> 00:44:39,368
♫  The noise of spring and autumn, the temperature difference between winter and summer  ♫

647
00:44:39,368 --> 00:44:41,874
♫  they've all become picturesque  ♫

648
00:44:41,875 --> 00:44:45,427
♫  Even if worries accompany sunsets,  ♫

649
00:44:45,427 --> 00:44:50,476
♫  is there any reasons not to cherish the moment?  ♫

650
00:44:50,477 --> 00:44:54,027
♫  I'll be with you when you cry  ♫

651
00:44:54,028 --> 00:44:57,573
♫  I'll pamper you so that you won't ruin your makeup  ♫

652
00:44:57,574 --> 00:45:03,182
♫  I will take you wherever you want to go  ♫

653
00:45:03,182 --> 00:45:06,153
♫  You are my girl  ♫

654
00:45:06,154 --> 00:45:09,693
♫  I want you to be my goddess for the rest of my life  ♫

655
00:45:09,694 --> 00:45:13,475
♫  I'll gently light the lamp in the quiet of the night  ♫

656
00:45:13,475 --> 00:45:17,375
♫  I'll hold you in my arms and let you sleep soundly  ♫

657
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:20,323
♫  I'm your man  ♫

658

♫  I will take care of you with my all  ♫

659
00:45:23,802 --> 00:45:27,784
