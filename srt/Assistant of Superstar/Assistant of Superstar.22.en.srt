So... are you ready?

35
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,120
Third Uncle, you can rest assured.

36
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,329
I have read "Sun Tzu's Art of War" repeatedly

37
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,698
and prepared 49 sets of tactics,

along with plans marked from A to Z.

The horn of battle has sounded.

The death knell of Shen Yiling and Song Qiege has rung.

Welcome to today's Superstar Night Live.

56
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:57,219
We have two groups of superstar guests today.

57
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:00,750
The first group is the leading actors of "The Realm of the Three Kingdoms,"

58
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,620
Zheng Jia'er, Pan Duo, and You Xi.

59
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,279
The next group is the leading actors of "Torn Apart,"

60
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:20,390
Song Qiege and Shen Yiling.

61
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,870
[Song Qiege]

62
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:33,959
These two TV dramas are all quite high-profiled popular dramas that are about to air soon.

63
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,859
So, what kind of interesting things could they provide us today?

64
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:41,420
Please stay tuned with me for our upcoming show.

65
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:47,219
First, let's talk about the kind of difficulties you met during filming.

66
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:48,760
Qiege, why don't you start first?

67
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,119
It's true we often run into difficulties during filming.

68
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:55,749
But I believe that those are inevitable for an actor.

69
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:57,249
We can only adjust ourselves

70
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,130
and show the audience our best side.

71
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,949
Although, I can always see news about you when I'm looking through Weibo.

72
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,900
One day, you'd catch a cold when filming in the water.

73
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,170
The next day, you'd have a fever during filming.

74
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,920
You're constantly on the front page. That's how popular you are.

75
00:04:19,624 --> 00:04:22,919
The media nowadays tends to exaggerate a lot.

76
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,819
I find it disturbing, too.

77
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,400
Speaking of which,

78
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,560
I haven't seen any news about You Xi for a long time.

79
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,920
I heard that after you were shelved,

80
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,910
you started a career as a delivery man.

81
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,289
Why is that?

82
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,700
What's going on?

83
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,720
Let's change the topic.

84
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,420
- I heard that during the filming...
- That's right.

85
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,390
I have been making deliveries.

86
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,930
Actually, I've been reflecting on myself.

87
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,560
I can't change my past.

88
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,740
What I can do is be responsible for who I can become.

89
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,760
Mr. Lu Xun once said

90
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,799
"Either burst in silence

91
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:22,100
or die in silence."

92
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,470
I'm trying to be better.

93
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,580
Whether it's by making deliveries

94
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,070
or taking small parts

95
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,920
that the old me would never pick,

96
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,950
those are all unique experiences for me.

97
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,299
I hope that one day my fans can see a brand new me.

98
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:46,020
A person who is brilliant

99
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,500
rather than a person who dies in silence.

100
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:58,239
You Xi! You Xi! You Xi!

101
00:05:58,239 --> 00:05:59,870
Thanks for sharing that with us, You Xi.

102
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,699
We now have seen the unique, hidden lifestyle of actors.

103
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:05,920
My turn! My turn!

104
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,760
Speaking of difficulties during filming,

105
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,020
I just have so much to share.

106
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,959
Do you have any idea how difficult it is to go to the restroom?

107
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,370
Especially when filming a historical show, wearing those costumes.

108
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,899
Once when we were shooting in the East Region Forest,

109
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,480
- I found one…
- Excuse me, Jia'er.

110
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,370
We have to consider the time.

111
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,599
Okay. Pan Duo, you are up!

112
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:35,869
I think that I'm not exactly an idol

113
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:38,509
nor a skilled actor.

114
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:42,429
But I would hope that one day, I could become a skilled actor.

115
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,699
Actually, I can understand Duo Duo.

116
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:49,949
Not too long ago, people on the internet suddenly started to slander her.

117
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:53,109
They said that her acting was hard to watch and that she should leave the entertainment industry.

118
00:06:53,109 --> 00:06:56,169
I just couldn't stand it. So, I spoke up for her.

119
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:59,120
After all, we all have to go through something,

120
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,799
especially for actors who are just starting out.

121
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,149
The road to becoming a skilled actor is a very long journey.

122
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:11,369
I've been through that. I can understand.

123
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,920
I think Sister Yiling is right on the point.

124
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,700
After all, she's been in the industry for seven years.

125
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,769
It's not easy for her to achieve what she has now.

126
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:28,710
Especially since a lot of her peers

127
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,069
have won so many awards while she misses them every time.

128
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,760
I empathize with her.

129
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,100
What a pity!

130
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:46,179
So, Sister Yiling, you must feel anxious like I do, right?

131
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:49,579
Not long ago, a bunch of people suddenly started posting on the internet.

132
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:53,829
They kept talking about how her acting skills were bad.

133
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:55,529
Also, that she's such a diva.

134
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:58,290
Her meal has to be from a Michelin three-star restaurant

135
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,530
and she has to stay at five-star hotels.

136
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,169
The crew was overwhelmed by her demands.

137
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:05,439
She even asked her assistant to drive to another city

138
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,160
in the middle of the night to buy her some stinky tofu...

139
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,240
as her midnight snack.

140
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,750
How hilarious is that!

141
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,620
How horrible!

142
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,219
Does she really think she's the center of the world?

143
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,630
That is very arrogant of her.

144
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,800
Her goddess figure is ruined.

145
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,459
Bad acting skill plus bad character.

146
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,560
Agreed.

147
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,400
Third Uncle, did you see Shen Yiling's face back there?

148
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,690
So hilarious!

149
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,419
You haven't seen Song Qiege's face yet. That's even more hilarious.

150
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:47,339
Okay, that's enough.

This is not the final round yet. Don't get too carried away.

You mean Yaoyao?

00:09:14,469 --> 00:09:18,039
We should switch to another person. What's the difference?

162
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:21,380
No! She's my girlfriend!

163
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,459
If it's not her, then should I call you?

164
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,800
You Xi, you… How could you…

165
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,159
I can't lay hands on him, but you are a different story.

166
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:35,530
My hairstyle is messed up.

167
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,869
The next half is about to begin. Get ready.

168
00:09:40,869 --> 00:09:42,420
See you later.

169
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,610
We are in the lead in the first half of the match.

170
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,420
Let's keep it that way in the next half!

171
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,990
Uncle You, my stomach hurts.

172
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,929
It's probably because I was trying to hold in so hard. I'm going to the restroom.

173
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:00,400
Be quick!

174
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,560
What a disappointment!

175
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,300
What? Did you forget to bring toilet paper?

176
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,830
Shen Yiling, did you forget how to read?

177
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,850
Look at the sign on the door.

178
00:10:25,851 --> 00:10:28,140
It says "The Realm of the Three Kingdoms" Lounge!

179
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,330
You Xi, who would've thought that you'd end up like this?

180
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,869
You were once the most popular superstar,

181
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,069
and now, Song Qiege gets the leading roles

182
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:42,709
while you can only be a nameless extra.

183
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,370
Isn't it horrible being overpowered by him like that?

184
00:10:49,307 --> 00:10:51,817
Are you listening to me?

185
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,199
Was someone talking?

186
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:58,499
- Because I just heard…
- You…

187
00:11:01,732 --> 00:11:04,350
You Xi, don't get too pleased with yourself.

188
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,980
Let me tell you something.

189
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,360
The leading actor and actress of Director Wei Ran's new movie

190
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,410
will be Song Qiege and me.

191
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,980
You and Pan Duo have no resources to compete with us at all.

192
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,550
Having no rivals is such a lonely thing.

193
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,200
Welcome back to our live show.

194
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,600
We have just learned something

195
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,400
about our guests in a series of interviews.

196
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,400
What we are going to do now will be quite exciting.

197
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,500
They will call the first person in their contact lists

198
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,000
and they have to say

199
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
"I miss you."

200
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,000
I believe that you are as excited as I am, right?

201
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,800
Then let's stop talking and start calling.

202
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,800
Shen Yiling, who's the first person on your contact list?

203
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,400
The first person on my contact list

204
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
is a young fan of mine.

205
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,900
On my last birthday,

206
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,200
she drew a painting for me.

207
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,800
We have been contacting each other.

208
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,200
[Miao Miao]

209
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,900
Hello?

210
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,000
Miao Miao, I miss you.

211
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Sister Yiling, I miss you too.

212
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,300
Mom!

213
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Mom, I haven't let you down.

214
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,600
I still remember that on my sixth birthday,

215
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,000
you told me…

216
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,400
Jia'er, I'm sorry.

217
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,400
Our time is limited.

218
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,800
Mom, take care of yourself.

219
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,400
I love you.

220
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,800
That's really sensational.

221
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
All right, Qiege.

222
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,100
Who is the first person on your contact list?

223
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,000
That would be my teacher from college.

224
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,800
He taught me so much and took care of me.

225
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,700
I am very grateful to him.

226
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,300
Respect for teachers is the foundation of being a gentleman.

227
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,400
Well, let's call him.

228
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,000
Mr. Yu! It's me, Qiege.

229
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,700
Qiege?

230
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,400
It's really you?

231
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Mr. Yu, how have been lately?

232
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,700
I'm fine. Really good.

233
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,600
I can't believe that you still remember an old man like me.

234
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,800
Qiege, do you remember

235
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,400
that you were the most hardworking student

236
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,000
and the top one at that, right?

237
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,600
I always tell the others

238
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,200
that of all the students I have taught over the years,

239
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,400
you were the most promising one.

240
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,700
After all these years,

241
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:36,400
you are the only one missing from the reunion parties.

242
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,000
Your assistant called me yesterday.

243
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
He said that you would be on a show

244
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,100
and you would call me.

245
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
I was so excited.

246
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,600
Mr. Yu, I will visit you when I have the opportunity.

247
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,400
Take care of yourself. See you.

248
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,100
He hung up.

249
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,000
It was arranged!

250
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,600
That's so pretentious.

251
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,600
And he wanted to put on a show depicting the love between teacher and student.

252
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,800
What a hypocrite.

253
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,400
Your relationship with your teacher

254
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,200
is truly moving.

255
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,400
That's okay. We should make the next call.

256
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,300
Pan Duo, who's the first person on your contact list?

257
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,000
It's my idol.

258
00:14:22,638 --> 00:14:24,638
[Qi Chao]

259
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,000
Hello?

260
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
My Idol, it's me. I miss you.

261
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,000
He's too busy.

262
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,100
Then we shall move on to the next call.

263
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,800
You Xi, I wonder who you have first on your contact list

264
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,900
It's my… girlfriend.

265
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,600
Since it's your girlfriend, we shall wait no more.

266
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Let's make the call now.

267
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
We can think of the Spring and Autumn Period

268
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,600
as an era of endless violence.

269
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,000
The people suffered due to the wars.

270
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,300
[You Xi]
We all know that it was the time when…

271
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,300
Hello,

272
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,800
[Little Wood]
the number you dialed is busy right now.

273
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,200
I miss you.

274
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
It turns out that Miss Yuchi is quite busy.

275
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,700
Since she can't take the phone call right now, we shouldn't disturb her anymore.

276
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,500
That's it for our show today.

277
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,500
I'd like to thank our guests for coming.

278
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,900
[Little Wood]

279
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,400
Third Uncle, it's Yaoyao! Pick up!

280
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Hello?

281
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,200
Hello, Mr. You. Can you hear me?

282
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,700
Yes.

283
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
My class is over now.

284
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,900
I miss you, too.

285
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,700
So... what are you doing?

286
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,300
I'm heading to the cafeteria

287
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,000
to buy the red bean cakes that you like the most.

288
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,900
Do you need anything else?

289
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,000
Small wonton?

290
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,700
It's Wednesday. There's no little wonton.

291
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,600
How about some sweet dough twists?

292
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,300
And mixed yogurt.

293
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Blueberry flavor, no nuts.

294
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
Red beans, raisins,

295
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,500
pineapple, cantaloupe, peach,

296
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,700
dragon fruit, and kiwi fruit.

297
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,800
Yaoyao, you and Third Uncle

298
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,400
were so sweet during the show.

299
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,600
But why won't my idol pick up?

300
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,800
That's so disappointing.

301
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,400
Because he's not interested in you.

302
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,000
Shen Yiling, you creep.

303
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,600
Why were you eavesdropping on me?

304
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,000
You talked so loudly,

305
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
and you're blaming me for eavesdropping?

306
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,900
Little girl, I'm teaching you right now.

307
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,000
Before you make a move on a man, you better check his love history first

308
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,600
to learn his preferences.

309
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,800
That would save you some unnecessary troubles.

310
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
It's none of your business.

311
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
Psychopath!

312
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,800
What are you doing?

313
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,000
Second Uncle, I have a question for you.

314
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,600
I ate your potato chips.

315
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,200
That's not it.

316
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,500
It's about my idol.

317
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,800
You want to know his love history?

318
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,200
Qi Chao once had a girlfriend.

319
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,200
And they were deeply in love.

320
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,800
Am I his type?

321
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,500
No.

322
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,900
Okay.

323
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,400
He broke up with her, didn't he?

324
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,000
That means he changed

325
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,600
and he finally found the type that he truly likes.

326
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,700
Which means I have a chance.

327
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,800
Who told you that they broke up?

328
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,500
Then… Then where is she now?

329
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,500
It's a long story.

330
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,400
Back then, Qi Chao was still in the film industry.

331
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,400
He was still a young actor.

332
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,300
As for his girlfriend, who was an actress,

333
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,600
she was not so lucky.

334
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,100
She graduated as an acting major,

335
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,100
but she never had her chance.

336
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,300
She refused to rely on Qi Chao.

337
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:33,100
And then, there was a director who had been looking at her.

338
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,300
He told her to do an audition

339
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,200
and asked her to go to a hotel in the middle of the night.

340
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,600
What he really wanted was to force her to have sex with him.

341
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
The girl didn't give in.

342
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,000
She jumped from the hotel window

343
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and the doctors couldn't save her.

344
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,200
No wonder my idol's love life is blank.

345
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,000
I've been searching for such a long time,

346
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,100
and he never had a girlfriend apparently.

347
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:00,100
That's why Qi Chao quit the film industry

348
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,400
after the incident.

349
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,000
His girlfriend's story is so tragic.

350
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,200
I'd like to remind our audience again that while you are watching the show,

351
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,000
you can vote on Weibo.

352
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,600
Do you prefer "The Realm of Three Kingdoms" or "Torn Apart"?

353
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Your votes are important to us.

354
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,000
They will decide the popularity of our guests.

355
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
All right, unlock your cell phones now

356
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,600
and start voting.

357
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,200
Why would you two come to watch TV in my place?

358
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,300
Third Uncle, don't even mention it.

359
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,300
Second Uncle packed my TV with the intent of selling it.

360
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,200
You... Stop eating.

361
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,689
You are eating up our snacks.

362
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,600
So stingy!

363
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,700
You Xi, it looks like your vote is so much higher than Song Qiege's.

364
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,000
The people are always right.

365
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,400
The number of followers on Weibo is going up.

366
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,000
Why did you turn off my phone?

367
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,400
I was checking your follower growth rate!

368
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,600
The number is always rising or falling.

369
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,700
Aren't you tired?

370
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,000
What do you know?

371
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,310
Happiness is the most important thing.

372
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:36,639
Mr. You, it's on the front page.

373
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:39,920
Mr. You is not the name you can use.

374
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,339
I'm saying that the term, "Mr. You," has become a top topic.

375
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,400
Look!

376
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,979
You Xi's girlfriend calls him Mr. You.

377
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,449
Girls are following the trend

378
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,299
and calling their boyfriends "Mister."

379
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,920
It's become a new buzzword.

380
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,500
Is that even possible?

381
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,100
- Hello?
- Hello? Is that You Xi?

382
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,409
I don't need any insurance or a new card. See you.

383
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:07,350
I'm Wei Ran.

384
00:22:09,274 --> 00:22:11,169
Nice to meet you, D-Director.

385
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,400
Although, I can always see news about you

386
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,930
when I'm looking through Weibo.

387
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,450
One day, you'd catch a cold when filming in the water.

388
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,679
The next day, you'd have a fever during filming.

389
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:22,649
You're constantly on the front page.

390
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,230
That's how popular you are.

391
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:32,399
Boss, Wei Ran made an appointment with You Xi.

392
00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:34,230
What?

393
00:22:39,523 --> 00:22:41,780
I heard that Wei Ran asked to see You Xi.

394
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,560
It's just a small role. We have nothing to worry about.

395
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,010
I don't want anything to go wrong.

396
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,300
You Xi,

397
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,889
I asked you to meet with me

398
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,740
because I have a question.

399
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,800
Please. Tell me.

400
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,700
Do you think that...

401
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:13,980
Song Qiege is the right person for the role.

402
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,700
Director,

403
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,130
I think I have made myself clear enough.

404
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,130
I can only say that you deserve someone better.

405
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,650
Actually, I already have someone on my mind.

406
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:33,550
I went to the set a while ago

407
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,310
and caught sight of him.

408
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,480
He was wearing armor and waving a sword on a horse.

409
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,500
His figure fits the character.

410
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,090
He's the ideal candidate for the leading role.

411
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,160
Do you mean…

412
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,210
You guys have worked together before.

413
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:54,840
What do you think of Zhao Yi?

414
00:23:57,613 --> 00:23:59,263
Zhao Yi?

415
00:24:00,927 --> 00:24:03,550
Mr. You, so what did you say?

416
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,440
I said that Zhao Yi's acting skills are awful.

417
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,169
He has no boundaries and he's bossy.

418
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:10,469
Also, he tried to hit on my girl. He brings bad luck to whoever hires him.

419
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,763
His acting skills are commendable and he has good character.

420
00:24:18,763 --> 00:24:21,853
Better than Song Qiege in every way.

421
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,480
Let's go home!

422
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,070
Tonight is the premiere of "The Realm of Three Kingdoms"

423
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,980
and the time Song Qiege and I finally fight it out.

424
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,850
He just has to launch on the same day.

425
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,600
Bad luck for him!

426
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:44,028
Attention, all personnel.

427
00:24:44,029 --> 00:24:46,890
The battle begins in…

428
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,479
- Two minutes and fifteen seconds.
- Two minutes and fifteen seconds.

429
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:51,339
How can I affect your rating?

430
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,689
Union is strength, don't you know that?

431
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,941
Pandora, how about you?

432
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:57,700
Third Uncle, it's Second Uncle's fault.

433
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,929
He sold everything including our TV.

434
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:02,929
Then what? Are you going to pay for our rent and utilities?

435
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,019
I… Who paid for the hair dryer?

436
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,469
Who needs it? Just you!

437
00:25:07,469 --> 00:25:08,649
You just have to keep such long hair!

438
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,259
Look! Your hair is all over the place.

439
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,499
You hairy monster!

440
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,779
Can I hang up for now?

441
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,210
No!

442
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,449
We have to witness this sacred moment together.

443
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,830
Pandora, are our allies ready?

444
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,929
Third Uncle, you can rest assured.

445
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,059
I have posted on all my family chat groups

446
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,140
and shopping chat groups.

447
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,639
I have even blended into my cousin's nursery chat group.

448
00:25:26,639 --> 00:25:28,169
My mom's barbecue restaurant has agreed

449
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:30,210
that they will promote our show.

450
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:33,059
Watch "The Realm of the Three Kingdoms," post on Weibo, and make phone calls,

451
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,299
and we will deduct 80 Yuan for each 100 Yuan on your bills for your Weibo screenshots.

452
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:38,260
And you'll get a roasted kidney for free!

453
00:25:38,896 --> 00:25:40,300
Great!

454
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:44,210
Song Qiege. He dares to compete with us for ratings.

455
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,099
I'll beat him to the ground.

456
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,640
Mr. You, I'll start the countdown.

457
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:55,450
Five, four, three, two, one!

458
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,150
[The Realm of the Three Kingdoms]

459
00:26:17,407 --> 00:26:19,410
The battle has begun!

460
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,339
Second Uncle, it's all your fault.

461
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,180
I've missed the beautiful voice of my idol.

462
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,181
My fault?

463
00:26:25,181 --> 00:26:28,539
If you are so anxious, why don't you make do with Uncle Wang from the security room?

464
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,350
Just leave me alone!

465
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:35,040
I'll ask my idol to do a live show for me.

466
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,099
My Idol, are you watching the show?

467
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,300
Yes.

468
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,270
Did I act well?

469
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,371
It was fine.

470
00:26:41,371 --> 00:26:43,920
What do I look like?

471
00:26:53,843 --> 00:26:56,003
Dressed in green.

472
00:26:57,013 --> 00:26:58,590
Sitting by a river.

473
00:27:00,101 --> 00:27:02,280
The sun is shining.

474
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,100
And it makes…

475
00:27:09,998 --> 00:27:11,740
I've lost the TV signal.

476
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:20,609
My idol must be so obsessed with me,

477
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,369
that he can't even hear me anymore.

478
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,840
Maybe.

479
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,650
Keep me updated.

480
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,789
Mr. You, the theme song performed by Mr. Qi Chao

481
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:54,369
has given us a starting advantage.

482
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,649
The comments are positive.

483
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,350
Of course!

484
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:00,600
Brother Chao's voice is so beautiful.

485
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,739
It has the tenderness of spring water.

486
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,099
Deep but resonant.

487
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,310
Vivid, yet heart-breaking.

488
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,360
The sound belongs to Heaven.

489
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,080
What are the odds that we men can hear it?

490
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,699
How could those internet singers compare with our Brother Chao?

491
00:28:20,341 --> 00:28:22,860
Mr. You, the topics have changed.

492
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,480
It says that Sun Quan, acted by Song Qiege,

493
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,150
has just kissed his wife.

494
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,000
What? But this is just the first episode!

495
00:28:32,498 --> 00:28:36,459
Song Qiege really put his shoulders to the wheel for the ratings.

496
00:28:36,459 --> 00:28:39,160
Take a look at it for me. What is Lü Bu doing?

497
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,059
It's okay, Mr. You.

498
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,449
We'll take the subtle style.

499
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:58,129
We'll tell the story with patience to draw the audience in.

500
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,540
And we will not be concerned by the temporary status.

501
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,339
This patience thing is taking so long!

502
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,650
The baby is coming out!

503
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,760
[SG Ent]

504
00:29:25,946 --> 00:29:29,680
Yesterday's ratings are out.

505
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,880
At the top is…

506
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,930
"The Realm of the Three Kingdoms"!

507
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,240
Third Uncle, we are number one!

508
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,040
Okay! Calm down!

Send a post on Weibo now!

510
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:58,060
"Torn Apart" was criticized by everyone after just the first half of the episode.

511
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,900
People say that they've made a historical show into a kid's show.

512
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,779
They kissed in the first episode.

513
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,250
Kiss, kiss!

514
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:09,170
And there's a sex scene in the next episode.

515
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:11,889
Who can tolerate this kind of progress?

516
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,099
I'm sending a post now,

517
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,170
and I'm going to remind Shen Yiling.

518
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:23,380
"The brain behind Pan Duo's success story, Second Uncle!"

519
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,130
Lucky for me. I have a trick up my sleeve.

520
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:34,110
Pan Duo, even though I lost,

521
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,210
you will not be able to enjoy your success.

522
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,460
Shen Yiling, our common enemy is You Xi, not Pan Duo.

523
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,100
Don't get this wrong.

524
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,490
Our common enemy?

525
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:47,250
I don't think so.

526
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,540
What do you mean?

527
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,970
Will You Xi compete with me for leading actress?

528
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:53,720
Or the best actress award?

529
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,860
I'm not a fool.

530
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,689
My biggest enemy is Pan Duo.

531
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,390
Not You Xi.

532
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,910
If you didn't ask the editor to cut the show like that

533
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,729
and said that we need to stand out, we wouldn't have lost!

534
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,960
Have you heard the saying,

535
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,870
"Couples are birds from the same forest,

536
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:21,630
and they split when the disaster comes"?

537
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,880
Not to mention that we are not a couple.

538
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,550
"Morry is also known as Zhu Dazhuang.

539
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,879
He's the top-notch manager of Shengguo Entertainment.

540
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,999
With his help, Pan Duo bought her way into the show and aims to be lead actress."

541
00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:51,829
Brought her way into the show and aims to be lead actress?

542
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,639
Zhu Dazhuang, you are quite ambitious!

543
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,719

"But because the investor of Zheng Jia'er is too powerful,

she failed as leading actress

546
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,720
and had to make do with the second leading actress role.

547
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,349
And then, the second man appeared.

548
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:11,867
That is the popular upcoming star of Shengguo Entertainment,

549
00:32:11,867 --> 00:32:13,527
You Xi."

550
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,590
"Zhu Dazhuang introduced Pan Do to You Xi through extreme means,

551
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:23,420
and the two of them made an unspeakable deal."

552
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,590
Unspeakable deal!

553
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,040
What the heck?

554
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,070
With you?

555
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,549
"With the falling of You Xi, the most popular star,

She's been searching for her new prey.

That's when the third man came into the picture.

00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,801
Qi Chao, the King of Love Songs."

561
00:32:46,802 --> 00:32:47,961
Let me see!

562
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,639
"Pan Duo has been sticking to Qi Chao's heels.

563
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,340
However, Qi Chao's attitude is vague.

564
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,699
After a while, Pan Duo still hasn't gotten what she wanted and has become anxious.

565
00:32:57,699 --> 00:32:59,639
That's why she decided to launch her final strike:

566
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,559
To call Qi Chao on the talk show and confess her feelings.

567
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:05,749
Her intention cannot be more obvious.

568
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,239
However, Qi Chao has been in this industry for years.

569
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,439
He's quite sensitive.

570
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,569
After picking up the call, he sensed that something was not right and hung up immediately.

571
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:14,930
Pan Duo's plan failed."

572
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,070
The story actually came through.

573
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:20,040

Oh no. Could my idol believe that gibberish?

576
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,020
Could he think that I have been treating him like that for his fame

577
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,690
or that I want to borrow his aura?

There is nothing she wouldn't do to get what she wants. Shame on her!

651
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,279
Who are you?

652
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,950
I just want to say things about her. What can you do?

653
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,070

654
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,120
Brother Chao,

655
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,300
are you trying to clear my reputation?

656
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,987
You…

657
00:40:38,987 --> 00:40:42,211
Just leave the internet trolls to me.

658
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:09,510
Brother Chao, is that okay?

659
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,860
It's… It's pretty good.

660
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,279
I have met my opponent this time.

661
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,959
For his typing speed and vocabulary,

662
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,730
he must have experience of ten years or so.

663
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,320
Now what?

664
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:32,430
I'll show him what I can do!

665
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:34,920
Let's report him!

666
00:42:12,544 --> 00:42:13,990
♫  The world is so big,  ♫

667
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:18,120
♫  yet a word of love from you makes me melt  ♫

668
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:21,589
♫  Watching you decorate this little home,  ♫

669
00:42:21,589 --> 00:42:26,734
♫  the overflowing happiness can barely be contained  ♫

670
00:42:26,735 --> 00:42:29,907
♫  The noise of spring and autumn, the temperature difference between winter and summer  ♫

671
00:42:29,908 --> 00:42:32,214
♫  they've all become picturesque  ♫

672
00:42:32,215 --> 00:42:35,566
♫  Even if worries accompany sunsets,  ♫

673
00:42:35,567 --> 00:42:40,517
♫  is there any reasons not to cherish the moment?  ♫

674
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:44,367
♫  I'll be with you when you cry  ♫

675
00:42:44,368 --> 00:42:47,814
♫  I'll pamper you so that you won't ruin your makeup  ♫

676
00:42:47,814 --> 00:42:53,422
♫  I will take you wherever you want to go  ♫

677
00:42:53,447 --> 00:42:56,294
♫  You are my girl  ♫

678
00:42:56,294 --> 00:42:59,734
♫  I want you to be my goddess for the rest of my life  ♫

679
00:42:59,734 --> 00:43:03,614
♫  I'll gently light the lamp in the quiet of the night  ♫

680
00:43:03,615 --> 00:43:07,415
♫  I'll hold you in my arms and let you sleep soundly  ♫

681
00:43:07,415 --> 00:43:10,364
♫  I'm your man  ♫

682
00:43:10,364 --> 00:43:13,842
♫  I will take care of you with my all  ♫

683
00:43:13,842 --> 00:43:17,825
♫  I'll silently follow the perfect script in your heart  ♫

684
00:43:17,825 --> 00:43:25,855
♫  It's you who makes everything become possible
and love to be flawless  ♫
