Both of them.

Yes, that's right. Song Qiege wants this part, too.

Actually, I think it's not bad.

It could be useful.

65

It could help you better interpret your role.

let alone Dot Four, even...

168
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,200
Yaoyao, take his seat.

169
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,400
Mr. You, I've never played before.

170
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,500
It's fine. I will help you.

171
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,100
Okay.

172
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,012
Dot Four.

173
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
It seems like I won.

174
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,160
Didn't you say that you didn't know how to play?

175
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,400
Bamboo Nine.

176
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,200
Sorry, Mr. You.

177
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,800
I won again.

178
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,100
Even with Bamboo Nine?

179
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,200
All of one suit by my own draw.

180
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,000
I won.

181
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,700
I won again.

182
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,000
Well done.

183
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,800
I won again.

184
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,900
- You Xi! You Xi!
- Go, go, go.

185
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,200
Third Uncle, remember to play Mahjong with us again.

186
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,678
Didn't you say that you didn't know how to play Mahjong?

187
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,158
I've never played before.

188
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:50,471
But today after seeing you play it,

189
00:09:50,472 --> 00:09:52,409
I learned the tricks.

190
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,307
It's like playing chess.

191
00:09:54,308 --> 00:09:57,005
You need to be observant and alert.

192
00:09:57,006 --> 00:09:59,510
You need to remember what others discarded.

193
00:09:59,511 --> 00:10:01,278
According to the tiles they chow and pong,

194
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,618
you can get which tile they need in order to win.

195
00:10:04,618 --> 00:10:06,878
Couldn't you just let me win sometimes?

196
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,320
Look at Pandora.

197
00:10:08,321 --> 00:10:09,799
She always intentionally lost to Chao.

198
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,319
Mr. You, it's a game

199
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,579
but also a match, which needs fairness.

200
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:19,239
Losing is not shameful.

201
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,160
Less competent people who refuse to focus on improving their skills

202
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,924
and seek to be opportunistic

203
00:10:23,925 --> 00:10:26,740
by doing things in a dishonest way should be ashamed.

204
00:10:40,898 --> 00:10:45,289
Hi, everyone.

205
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:46,947
I am...

206
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,196
I am Yuchi Yaoyao.

207
00:10:51,196 --> 00:10:54,202
Do you know why I'm a tutor?

208
00:10:54,202 --> 00:10:59,401
Because my dream is… to become a teacher.

209
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:02,219
But I couldn't due to my demophobia.

210
00:11:02,219 --> 00:11:06,922
So, I have to tell myself every day,

211
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,499
as long as I get stronger,

212
00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:15,039
work hard to make progress,

213
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:20,815
then one day, I will be able to stand in front of a classroom.

214
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,504
Then, the specific…

215
00:11:33,504 --> 00:11:36,032
the specific arrangement is that…

216
00:11:39,602 --> 00:11:40,979
Hi, You Xi.

217
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,140
I heard that the cast of "The Realm of the Three Kingdoms" is hiring an assistant.

218
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,678
Let Yaoyao have it.

219
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,559
I don't make the decisions.

220
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:49,601
It's up to the boss.

221
00:11:49,602 --> 00:11:54,599
So, I can't even decide on such little things now?

222
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,959
Of course not.

223
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,924
Look. There may be a way.

224
00:11:58,925 --> 00:12:03,199
I heard that the cast is in Jiangzhou University holding an audition right now.

225
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,823
All the students of Jiangzhou University can try out.

226
00:12:07,824 --> 00:12:11,200
All the students of Jiangzhou University,

227
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,619
and who is…

228
00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:15,680
Hello? Hi?

229
00:12:30,441 --> 00:12:33,119
You didn't need to come with me.

230
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,917
It's my school so I know my way around here.

231
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:37,959
No, this is important.

232
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,940
I'd like to see you sign up with my own eyes.

233
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,319
Go.

234
00:12:55,132 --> 00:12:56,622
What's going on?

235
00:12:56,622 --> 00:12:58,740
Are you having second thoughts?

236
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,940
- Listen.
- I can do it.

237
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,017
For you, I'll try my best.

There is something in your hair.

Really?

244
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,581
Let me get it for you.

245
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,000
It seems nice to have the training at school.

246
00:13:43,607 --> 00:13:45,680
Mr. You.

247
00:13:50,575 --> 00:13:53,092
How was your interview today?

248
00:13:53,092 --> 00:13:55,174
When I came in,

249
00:13:55,175 --> 00:14:02,063
- the interviewer asked me to explain the history of the Three Kingdoms.
- And then?

250
00:14:02,063 --> 00:14:06,132
Then, when I was talking about Liu Bei going south to Jingzhou,

251
00:14:06,132 --> 00:14:07,319
the interviewer gave me a pass.

252
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,559
That's great.

253
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:11,798
This is very important.

254
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,487
We have to be well-prepared.

255
00:14:13,488 --> 00:14:15,221
When is your next round of interviews?

256
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:19,379
- The day after tomorrow.
- The day after tomorrow?

257
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:22,295
This audition is too short.

258
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:23,791
Not really.

259
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:25,697
It's actually pretty competitive.

260
00:14:25,697 --> 00:14:26,959
It's all right.

261
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,883
You'll pass for sure.

262
00:14:28,883 --> 00:14:31,702
Underestimating your competitors is not a good thing.

263
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,816
You just passed the first part ofthe interview. Don't be too happy.

264
00:14:37,816 --> 00:14:39,901
Without the losers for you to compare with,

265
00:14:39,902 --> 00:14:42,460
don't cry too hard when you fail the final.

266
00:14:47,195 --> 00:14:49,588
Who was that?

267
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,541
She takes herself more seriously than I do.

268
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,581
What's the big deal with carrying a dictionary?

269
00:14:53,581 --> 00:14:55,960
Does she think she's Einstein?

270
00:14:57,922 --> 00:15:02,742
Mr. You, Einstein was a scientist.

271
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,480
I don't care.

272
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,520
You must beat her in the next interview.

273
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:14,916
She is Duan Feifei, a celebrity in our school.

274
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,002
She has been on a TV show

275
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:18,783
and is a postdoc in the history department.

276
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,654
A postdoc, so what?

277
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:22,510
She still won't be my assistant.

278
00:15:22,511 --> 00:15:26,190
I said you can make it. That means you'll make it.

279
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,774
Come. Let's go home.

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,996
I know what it is. It must be because this microphone is too high.

334
00:18:57,996 --> 00:18:59,880
It limited my capability. Let me lower it a little bit.

335
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,100
Don't.

336
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,880
I can do it!

337
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,239
I'm doomed.

338
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,789
Not only did I sing badly in front of my idol,

339
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,219
I also broke his favorite microphone.

340
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,339
My idol must not want to see me ever again.

341
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:31,796
It's fine.

342
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,515
Mr. Qi Chao is generous.

343
00:19:33,516 --> 00:19:35,480
He won't get mad at you.

344
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:43,998
Yaoyao, you're right. He sent me a WeChat message.

345
00:19:43,998 --> 00:19:45,764
Really?

346
00:19:45,764 --> 00:19:47,664
[My Idol: Stop following me around!]

347
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,701
Nope.

348
00:19:53,701 --> 00:19:55,901
I'm going to grab a snack.

349
00:19:57,307 --> 00:19:58,610
Wait for me.

350
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:24,821
Mr. You, what are you doing?

351
00:20:35,782 --> 00:20:37,820
What are you looking at?

352
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,691
I'm...

353
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,700
looking at the scenery.

354
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,363
Do you know what time it is?

355
00:20:59,622 --> 00:21:01,019
Sorry, Mr. You.

356
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,479
I did get back a little late today.

357
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,390
Did you know when you weren't home,

358
00:21:05,391 --> 00:21:08,237
I had to let out the hot water myself and get the takeout myself,

359
00:21:08,237 --> 00:21:11,594
even the mosquitoes that fly inside were chased out by myself.

360
00:21:11,594 --> 00:21:14,818
Sorry, Mr. You. I shouldn't have left you alone in our house.

361
00:21:14,818 --> 00:21:17,906
Yes, it's your fault. It is because you left me alone in…

362
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,919
Did you just say "o-our house"?

363
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,740
I'm sleepy.

364
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,258
Pidan, she just said "our house".

365
00:21:44,325 --> 00:21:46,999
Our house. Our house.

366
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,924
Our house.

367
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:39,075
Our house.

368
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,500
What are we going to have this morning in "our house"?

369
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,559
I'll make noodles for you.

370
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:58,839
Don't worry about it. Have a seat.

371
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,838
You stay here and study.

372
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,939
I'll do it.

373
00:23:02,939 --> 00:23:05,959
There's still ham in "our house's" fridge.

374
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,580
Have it with noodles, okay?

375
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:10,826
Okay.

376
00:23:10,826 --> 00:23:12,683
Then I'll do it.

377
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:19,159
See you in "our house's" dining room.

378
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,660
- Hello.
- Hi, You Xi.

379
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,860
I've investigated Duan Feifei as you asked.

380
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,742
This girl had a tragic life.

381
00:23:42,742 --> 00:23:45,358
She has a single parent. Her mother is a janitor.

382
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,960
Her brother has leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant now.

383
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,820
She's a straight-A student.

384
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,620
She's also a top student in the history department.

385
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,439
- Hello?
- Xiao Fei.

386
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,999
- Mom, what is it?
- It's an emergency.

387
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,820
All right. I understand.

388
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,157
How much more time will it take?

389
00:24:22,158 --> 00:24:24,798
If I pass the second interview today, I'll get money tomorrow.

390
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,479
Okay. Hurry up.

391
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,811
We need money here.

392
00:24:27,812 --> 00:24:30,153
Your brother can't hold on for much longer.

393
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:38,059
Yuchi Yaoyao!

394
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,200
I'm here.

395
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,420
Let's do it! You can do it.

396
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,834
Let's do it!

397
00:24:46,245 --> 00:24:47,735
I'm going.

398
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:53,372
Attention, please.

399
00:24:53,373 --> 00:24:54,704
Now we'll start to ask questions.

400
00:24:54,705 --> 00:24:57,159
In the Three Kingdoms, the incarnation of loyalty was Guan Yu.

401
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,520
In what events did we find him to be loyal, righteous, and brave?

402
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,850
[Heroes are not afraid to enter the final battle]

403
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:07,039
Riding alone for thousands of miles, releasing Cao Cao at Huarong,

404
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,839
surmounting numerous difficulties, defeating seven armies on the water, and his own failures.

405
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:12,500
That's right.

406
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,058
The sworn brothers of the peach garden, Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei.

407
00:25:15,058 --> 00:25:17,785
What were the weapons that they used?

408
00:25:17,785 --> 00:25:22,099
Twin blade, Green Dragon Crescent Blade, and Snake Lance.

409
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:23,560
That's right.

410
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:35,239
Incredible.

411
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,539
Both of you proved to be brilliant in literature.

412
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:41,325
Next is the last question.

413
00:25:41,326 --> 00:25:44,981
This will decide our final winner.

414
00:25:44,981 --> 00:25:48,799
The final question. Currently, what is the most representative performance award

415
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,500
for the new generation of artists?

416
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,253
A. Golden Dragon Award.

417
00:25:53,253 --> 00:25:55,633
B. Golden Radish Award.

418
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,880
Golden Radish Award.

419
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,144
It sounds like Golden Dragon Award.

420
00:26:01,145 --> 00:26:04,125
Golden Radish Award sounds like a joke.

421
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,451
No wonder you were in so many bad movies.

422
00:26:07,452 --> 00:26:09,017
Bad?

423
00:26:09,018 --> 00:26:11,619
I once won the Golden Radish Award.

424
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:15,459
B. Golden Radish Award.

425
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,380
To complicate simple things is to fall into their trap.

426
00:26:21,273 --> 00:26:22,992
Tricky.

427
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:26,140
A. Golden Dragon Award.

428
00:26:45,073 --> 00:26:47,345
- Hello.
- Xiao Fei.

429
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,159
Mom.

430
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,798
Your boss already wired the money to the hospital.

431
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:54,340
Xiao Yu will be saved.

432
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,960
We really met some nice people.

433
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:00,499
My boss?

434
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,000
Brother Dazhuang.

435
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,487
Find out which hospital Duan Feifei's brother is in,

436
00:27:14,487 --> 00:27:16,339
and pay for his surgery.

437
00:27:16,339 --> 00:27:18,145
Okay. Got it.

438
00:27:18,145 --> 00:27:20,219
Doing charity work.

439
00:27:20,219 --> 00:27:22,679
I'll call the press and have an announcement ready.

440
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,798
Do it anonymously.

441
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:25,558
What? Anonymously?

442
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:26,872
Hello?

443
00:27:38,632 --> 00:27:40,044
How was it?

444
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,140
Oh.

445
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,979
You didn't pass? It's fine.

446
00:27:49,979 --> 00:27:51,639
At least you tried.

447
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,000
We'll try harder next time.

448
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,586
Mr. You.

449
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:01,131
I passed! I made it!

450
00:28:01,131 --> 00:28:02,700
Really?

451
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:05,438
That's great.

452
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:07,286
Yuchi Yaoyao.

453
00:28:09,706 --> 00:28:12,420
Academically, I didn't lose to you.

454
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,759
I am not satisfied with today's result.

455
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,403
B. Golden Radish Award.

456
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,038
A. Golden Dragon Award.

457
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,841
Yuchi Yaoyao. Congratulations.

458
00:28:20,841 --> 00:28:22,939
Your answer was right.

459
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,799
Thank you all.

460
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,760
I'll beat you if I get a chance in the future.

461
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:35,759
I said you can make it.

462
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,156
Let's go.

463
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,660
Here you go.

464
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,535
- You…
- I got the role of Tian Jing…

465
00:28:53,535 --> 00:28:57,938
She's a prostitute and a concubine of Guan Zhong.

466
00:28:57,938 --> 00:28:59,758
How can she become the lead?

467
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:02,999
There were no other wives or concubines of Guan Zhong in history.

468
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,351
People only know about Tian Jing.

469
00:29:06,352 --> 00:29:09,092
Who cares if she's a prostitute?

470
00:29:09,093 --> 00:29:11,637
I think it's also an ability

471
00:29:11,638 --> 00:29:14,260
to make people remember you.

472
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,119
Congratulations.

473
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,667
Contract for "Torn Apart"?

474
00:29:23,668 --> 00:29:26,954
It's a new project that will start shooting in a few days

475
00:29:26,954 --> 00:29:28,543
around the same time as "The Realm of the Three Kingdoms."

476
00:29:28,544 --> 00:29:32,992
Song Qiege, you really fight with You Xi for everything.

477
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:38,160
Would you like to be the female lead?

478
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,058
Forget it.

479
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:42,639
Since I've already gotten the role in "Zhongfu,"

480
00:29:42,639 --> 00:29:46,839
next time, we can focus on beating You Xi.

481
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,199
In honor of your assistant job, I personally cooked.

482
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,100
Don't get emotional.

483
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,200
What do you think?

484
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:33,459
Is it good?

485
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,078
I…

486
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:39,870
I'll eat some vegetables.

487
00:30:41,546 --> 00:30:42,877
Just a little.

488
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,235
Mr. You.

489
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,038
I can't do it anymore.

490
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:25,751
You were the one who asked me to run with you.

491
00:31:25,752 --> 00:31:27,580
Really.

492
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,440
I can't do it anymore.

493
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,920
[Yin Jiu]

494
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,765
I'm going to take this call.

495
00:31:36,766 --> 00:31:38,388
What a jerk.

496
00:31:41,823 --> 00:31:44,935
- Hello?
- Yaoyao, how have you been lately?

497
00:31:44,935 --> 00:31:45,969
Did you need something?

498
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,480

What do you think it's like to be a teaching assistant?

Why are you so quiet?
