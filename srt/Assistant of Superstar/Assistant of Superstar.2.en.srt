00:10:33,016 --> 00:10:34,465
Yes, Mr. You.

164
00:10:34,465 --> 00:10:35,719
Explain this!

165
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,247
This is your study plan. It works better over here.

166
00:10:38,247 --> 00:10:41,290
It will remind you to focus on your studies.

167
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,000
Get rid of it!

168
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:48,523
Mr. You, it's time to study.

169
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,910
Finally, Guan Zhong asked the Emperor of Qi

170
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:02,200
to summon a meeting with the states of Song, Yan, Wei, and Zheng to form an alliance.

171
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,993
Later, the Emperor of Qi became a widely recognized overlord.

172
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,764
All right, today's class ends here.

173
00:11:09,764 --> 00:11:10,790
Do you have any questions?

174
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,597
No.

175
00:11:12,597 --> 00:11:13,795
You can review on your own.

176
00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:15,447
I need to go back home to get some things.

177
00:11:15,447 --> 00:11:16,928
Go ahead! Go.

178
00:11:18,215 --> 00:11:21,684
And no need to rush back. See you later.

179
00:11:21,684 --> 00:11:23,257
See you.

180
00:11:46,893 --> 00:11:48,770
It's raining so hard.

181
00:11:49,433 --> 00:11:51,286

Mr. You, I think I forgot to lock my electrical bike.

What do you want? I'm in the bathtub.

196
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:37,716
Mr. You, where did you put my luggage?

197
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,439
How would I know?

198
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:42,897
Unbelievable.

199
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,858
- Who's that?
- Delivery.

200
00:13:47,858 --> 00:13:48,999
Leave it at the door.

201
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,570
Thank you.

202
00:13:56,442 --> 00:14:00,460
Who would have thought anyone would still be using woven bags for clothes?

203
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,588
It will take some time for your clothes to dry.

204
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:04,349
Wear mine for now.

205
00:14:07,303 --> 00:14:10,571
Hey! Why are you spacing out?

206
00:14:14,817 --> 00:14:16,517
Mr. You,

207
00:14:17,943 --> 00:14:21,073
I just remembered something.

208
00:14:23,415 --> 00:14:25,292
Don't tell me. I don't want to hear.

209
00:14:25,293 --> 00:14:29,394
The day I first met Yin Jiu was a rainy day like this one.

210
00:14:29,394 --> 00:14:32,676
I am such an idiot! Why did I even ask?

211
00:14:36,205 --> 00:14:39,820
It's all right for a girl to cry after a breakup.

212
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:43,825
You can talk to your best friend if you want to.

213
00:14:43,825 --> 00:14:47,906
Yin Jiu has never been happy in the years he spent with you.

214
00:14:47,906 --> 00:14:50,453
No, no, no.

215
00:14:50,453 --> 00:14:54,547
I mean… A friend other than Tong Jin.

216
00:14:58,086 --> 00:15:00,418
If that doesn't work, you can come to me.

217
00:15:00,418 --> 00:15:01,869
Drink, eat, as long as it's not difficult.

218
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:06,383
But it's quite late today.

219
00:15:06,383 --> 00:15:08,606
I'm going to bed.

220
00:15:09,219 --> 00:15:11,037
Good night.

221
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:26,693
Not like this. If this continues, it's not going to work.

00:15:34,885 --> 00:15:35,980
The driver is not here yet.

You can drive.

00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,509

No.

Mr. You, when can we start our class?

I have already signed you up.

231
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:05,629
Hello.

232
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,832
Hi.

233
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,613
These three will be your coaches.

234
00:16:10,465 --> 00:16:12,000
Are you asking me to pick one?

235
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,309
No, no, no. They are all your coaches.

236
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:18,465
- All of them?
- That's right. All of them.

237
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:22,600
Finally, some peace.

238

- Hello?
 - Hello, this is the hospital.

239

What? Hospital?

240
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:47,736
Mr. You.

241
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:54,047
Do you have any idea how serious the consequence of today's accident is?

242
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:56,519
And how great a loss our driving school has suffered?

243
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,786
What happened?

244
00:16:57,786 --> 00:17:00,650
Why don't you ask our victims?

245
00:17:10,902 --> 00:17:14,319
To ensure the safety of our coaches and students,

246
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,580
we must expell Yuchi Yaoyao.

247
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,999
And the tuition fees are not refundable.

248
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:22,391
You have to cover their medical expenses and compensate for their mental damage.

249
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:26,300
Otherwise, I'll have to call the police.

250
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,134
- What are you doing?
- Calling the police!

251
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:32,995
- You are calling the police?
- I'm filing a complaint about your driving school.

252
00:17:32,995 --> 00:17:36,701
Firstly, the coaches got off the car to chat, leaving the student alone.

253
00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:37,969
This is a violation of the law.

254
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:42,206
Secondly, there's not a term in the contract that says the student can't get a refund when expelled.

255
00:17:42,206 --> 00:17:45,395
Thirdly, those three big guys can't even teach a little girl.

256
00:17:45,395 --> 00:17:48,190
- I cannot but doubt your ability to teach.
- What are you saying?

257
00:17:48,197 --> 00:17:50,288
Relax, I'll cover your medical expenses.

258
00:17:50,288 --> 00:17:52,035
We are not going back to your school.

259
00:17:52,035 --> 00:17:54,205
It's not because she's being expelled,

260
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:56,690
we are withdrawing!

00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,247

Come on! Time for driving practice! Stop dilly-dallying!

264
00:18:12,957 --> 00:18:14,609
Come on!

265
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,480
What's all this?

266
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,474
Mr. You, I don't trust myself when it comes to driving.

267
00:18:23,474 --> 00:18:25,394
I'm an experienced driver. What are you afraid of?

268
00:18:25,394 --> 00:18:26,780
Take those off.

269
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:30,680
I'll show you some advanced techniques!

270
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,292
I'll show you how to reverse the car.

271
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:33,663
Reverse the car?

272
00:18:33,663 --> 00:18:37,504
If you can master that, driving will be easier for you.

273
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:40,492
Step on the brake.

274
00:18:40,493 --> 00:18:41,501
Shift gears.

275
00:18:41,501 --> 00:18:42,791
Check the mirrors.

276
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:45,367
Release the brake. Step on the accelerator.

277
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:50,408
Mr. You, they have indicating poles in the driving school.

278
00:18:50,408 --> 00:18:52,729
I'll be your indicating pole.

279
00:18:58,376 --> 00:18:59,666
Can you see me?

280
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:00,604
Yes.

281
00:19:00,604 --> 00:19:02,425
Come to me!

282
00:19:02,425 --> 00:19:05,316
Further, a little further!

283
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:10,479
Mr. You!

284
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:12,070
Hospital… Hospital again!

285
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,660
What happened?

286
00:19:14,277 --> 00:19:16,810
Mr. You got injured.

287
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,900
- How come?
- He was hit by a car—

288
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,230
- Who was the driver?
- Me…

289
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,509
Yuchi Yaoyao!

290
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,415
Mr. You said to hit the brake,

291
00:19:24,415 --> 00:19:26,484
but I stepped on the accelerator by mistake.

292
00:19:26,484 --> 00:19:28,558
Don't you know it's illegal?

293
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:30,190
I know that now.

294
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,124
The traffic police were there to educate me and I got fined.

295
00:19:33,124 --> 00:19:35,099
What did I tell you?

296
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:37,619
If anything happens to Mr. You again, I'll be dismissed.

297
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:39,229
Then leave.

298
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,520
I'm sorry, Brother Dazhuang.

299
00:19:43,129 --> 00:19:44,601
I'm sorry, Mr. You.

300
00:19:44,602 --> 00:19:47,307
Bring me some porridge when you get back. No sugar!

301
00:19:47,307 --> 00:19:49,300
You Xi!

302
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:52,309
But Brother Dazhuang said…

303
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,560
Who's your boss? Me or him?

304
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,259
Go!

305
00:19:56,259 --> 00:19:58,386
Okay, Mr. You.

306
00:20:00,085 --> 00:20:03,165
You Xi! Your arm just recovered and now your foot is hurt.

307
00:20:03,165 --> 00:20:04,882
If something happens again, who will take responsibility?

308
00:20:04,882 --> 00:20:06,912
I will.

309
00:20:08,603 --> 00:20:11,842
It's just a scratch, no big deal.

310
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,100
Yuchi Mumu!

311
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,000
Yuchi Mumu!

312
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,200
Yuchi Mumu! What are you doing?

313
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,000
Mr. You, I'm writing up some suggestions.

314
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,200
I carefully read the script of "Accidently Fall In Love With You"

315
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,800
and found that the script is full of errors.

316
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,600
A lot of the content doesn't make sense.

317
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,600
So I'm making a list of suggestions.

318
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,300
What do you care? Are you a screenwriter?

319
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,600
Does a good script have anything to do with you?

320
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,500
It does, Mr. You.

321
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,600
You're an actor. You'll be working with this script.

322
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,100
- And it's my duty to help you bring the best work to the audience.
- I don't need that.

323
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,900
Yes, I am an actor and my job is acting.

324
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,400
I'm not responsible for the script! You got it?

325
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,900
No wonder you were in so many awful shows.

326
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,100
Awful? How are they awful?

327
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,600
I've even won the Golden Radish Drama Award.

328
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,100
You know nothing.

329
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,400
Golden Radish?

330
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,600
Are you all right, Mr. You?

331
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,200
Are you okay?

332
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,300
What do you think?

333
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,700
Slopw down, Mr. You.

334
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,600
- What are you doing?
- Article 8 of the Code.

335
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm not allowed to mingle, hear, or see anything around your bedroom.

336
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,300
You're letting me go in by myself?

337
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,800
Wait a minute.

338
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,500
Close your eyes before you go inside.

339
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Okay.

340
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,500
Let's go.

341
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,000
A little to the right.

342
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,800
Right, right, right!

343
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,000
Stop, stop, stop!

344
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,500
Stop here.

345
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,300
- Water!
- Water?

346
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,100
On your right!

347
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,000
Eyes closed!

348
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,700
Mr. You, here's your water.

349
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,800
Open your eyes!

350
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,600
I'm sorry, Mr. You.

351
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,900
Water!

352
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:20,400
From now on, you don't need to close your eyes in my room.

353
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,000
Okay, Mr. You.

354
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,700
- What are you looking at?
- Mr. You, you won't let people in your room

355
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,000
because you are obsessed with cleanliness

356
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,400
or…

357
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,600
What do you know?

358
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,900
This is the only space that I have to myself.

359
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,400
I get it.

360
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,800
You can't eat what you want

361
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
or decide what clothes to wear.

362
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,400
There are so many things in your life that you can't control.

363
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,000
Get out!

364
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,200
Hello, Mr. You.

365
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,100
You Xi! We heard that you recovered and came to visit.

366
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,700
This is…

367
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,500
This is Reporter Deng.

368
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,200
He'd like an interview with you. Will that be okay?

369
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,200
Sure. No problem.

370
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,400
Then I'll cut to the chase.

371
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,600
You Xi, thousands of fans are concerned about your injury.

372
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,400
People can't wait to see your new work.

373
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,600
Meanwhile, there are rumors that your injury is so severe

374
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,700
that you have to quit the show you're on.

375
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,600
Some even say that the shooting is still on hold

376
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,300
because you are being a diva.

377
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:58,500
So, I'd love to take this opportunity to get an answer for your fans.

378
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,400
So, when do you plan to start shooting again?

379
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,900
Mr. You's foot…

380
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,000
What was your aspiration to begin with?

381
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,700
As an actor, my aspiration is to give the audience my best.

382
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,100
That's right. That's our aspiration, too.

383
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,100
To let the audience see the best work.

384
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,400
Then we should pause the project.

385
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,300
Pause the project?

386
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,800
Recently, I took a look at the script and found a lot of problems.

387
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,100
The number is substantial.

388
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,700
There's a lot that doesn't make sense.

389
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,300
There are many literary related problems

390
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,400
that could confuse the actors

391
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,000
and hinder the comprehension of the audience.

392
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,600
Wait a moment.

393
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,100
Deputy Director Chen. Producer Cai.

394
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,200
Please revise the script carefully.

395
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,000
My assistant can send you

396
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,700
a list of the suggestions if you need it.

397
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,000
Mr. You, your assistant is…

398
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,800
- excellent!
- I agree.

399
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,700
All right. We'll get going then.

400
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,100
You…

401
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,700
Why are you giving me that look?

402
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,600
Mr. You, I thought you disagreed with me.

403
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,000
You are right. I don't agree with you.

404
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,800
It's just that...

405
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,700
I hurt my foot and don't want to work.

406
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,600
Mr. You.

407
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,500
I take back what I said last night.

408
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,600
Your shows are not so bad.

409
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,200
What are you waiting for?

410
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,200
Clean the places where they've touched.

411
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,000
Got it.

412
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,800
Producer Cai, You Xi hasn't fully healed from the injury yet.

413
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,400
We'll be risking a lot if we ask him to return to work right now.

414
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,800
Don't worry.

415
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,800
From now on, we won't let anything happen to You Xi.

416
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,700
Since we've made such a great sacrifice,

417
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,600
shouldn't you do us a favor in return?

418
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,900
What do you mean?

419
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:30,400
I heard the actress for the supporting role is having trouble clearing up her schedule.

420
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,400
She'll terminate her contract.

421
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,200
We happen to have a great candidate for that role.

422
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,600
That's not a problem. Brother Morry—

423
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,000
- Then we have an agreement.
- That's right.

424
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,800
My foot is recovered.

425
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,500
Get this ugly cushion off me, Yuchi Mumu.

426
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,100
Okay. See you, Brother Dazhuang.

427
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,700
Mr. You, Brother Dazhuang said you'll start work tomorrow.

428
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,000
Don't stay up late.

429
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,100
Tomorrow?

430
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,600
I'm still hurt!

431
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,100
I thought you said your foot was recovered.

432
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,200
Zhu Dazhuang is so eager to put me back to work.

433
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,600
He's up to something.

434
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,000
You mean… You think he's hiding something?

435
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,200
Pretty much.

436
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,000
Go to sleep.

437
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,500
Wait, Mr. You, when will my bed arrive?

438
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,300
The bed needs to be customized so that it matches the interior.

439
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,000
It'll take a while.

440
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,400
Just make do with the sofa for a couple more nights.

441
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,800
Oh.

442
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,300
This is your turf.

443
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,900
I'll leave.

444
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,000
Who's the supporting actress?

445
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,829
I've never heard of this name before.

446
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,875
Of course, you haven't. Just tell me. Who is it?

447
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:54,000
- Pan Duo.
- This name...

448
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,900
It doesn't sound familiar.

449
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,000
A new actress taking the supporting role.

450
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,100
She must have an investment behind her.

451
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,700
Mr. You, it's not an investment.

452
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,200
She brought assets.

453
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,600
Look! The brokerage company is Shengguo Entertainment.

454
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,600
Shengguo Entertainment?

455
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,400
And her agent is Brother Dazhuang.

456
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:19,090
I wonder what's so special about her that Dazhuang would take her in personally.

457
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,600
Mr. You Xi, welcome back to work.

458
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,200
First of all, thank you all.

459
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,000
I'm sorry this show was delayed because of me, costing everyone time.

460
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,700
I'm inviting everyone here to dinner after work today.

461
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,600
Great!

462
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,900
Congratulations on recovery, my male lead.

463
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,500
Sorry, I'm allergic to lilies.

464
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,000
Here. I'll take it.

465
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,200
I didn't know you were allergic to lilies.

466
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,100
I wouldn't have picked them if I had.

467
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,000
- Next time—
- Time to do makeup.

468
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,500
Excuse me.

469
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,700
Oh, right!

470
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:19,100
Director Chen Fei, please secure the site when shooting,

471
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,600
or our photos might be leaked.

472
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,400
That won't be good.

473
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,700
Of course!

474
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,400
All right then. Let's get back to work.

475
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,200
Time to work.

476
00:30:31,903 --> 00:30:35,533
This Zheng Jia'er, she took the initiative and I took the blow.

477
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:37,616
Now she's acting like nothing happened.

478
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,159
Take those away! Now!

479
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,386
Mr. You, are you really allergic to lilies?

480
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:47,550
Why would I even lie—

481
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:50,378
- Take them away!
- All right!

482
00:30:54,915 --> 00:30:58,429
Lilies! Those are my favorite flowers!

483
00:31:00,086 --> 00:31:01,536
Can I have one?

484
00:31:01,536 --> 00:31:03,074
They are all yours.

485
00:31:03,075 --> 00:31:06,069
That's so kind of you. Thank you.

486
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:09,979
Um… Do you know where Brother You Xi's lounge is?

487
00:31:09,979 --> 00:31:12,684
- Over there.
- Thank you.

488
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:15,161
- How do you do, Brother You Xi!
- Who are you?

489
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:16,770
Stay right there!

490
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:20,790
- Where did you get the flowers?
- From a beautiful sister I just met.

491
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,473
- Brother You Xi! You like lilies, you just...
- Get away!

492
00:31:22,473 --> 00:31:23,673
Don't get any closer! No, no, no!

493
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:26,589
- Lilies!
- Brother You Xi!

494
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:28,520
Yuchi Mumu!

495
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:31,736
This is the sister who gave me the flowers.

496
00:31:35,003 --> 00:31:37,467
You Xi, nice to meet you. I'm Pan Duo.

497
00:31:37,467 --> 00:31:38,993
I have a scene with you today.

498
00:31:38,994 --> 00:31:41,024
So you are Pan Duo.

499
00:31:42,206 --> 00:31:44,898
Brother Dazhuang's judgment is not so sharp anymore.

500
00:31:44,898 --> 00:31:48,038
I think she's cute.

501
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:50,110
She's not cute at all.

502
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,565
Brother You Xi, how about we rehearse a little?

503
00:31:52,565 --> 00:31:54,185
I don't have a habit of rehearsing with anyone.

504
00:31:54,186 --> 00:31:57,789
- Get out!
- You can start now.

505
00:31:57,789 --> 00:31:59,780
Get out!

506
00:32:05,915 --> 00:32:09,776
Brother You Xi, I may not have your attention just yet.

507
00:32:09,777 --> 00:32:11,761
But that's okay.

508
00:32:11,761 --> 00:32:14,802
I will work hard and prove myself worthy.

509
00:32:17,713 --> 00:32:22,413
Mr. You, don't you think you were too harsh on her?

510
00:32:23,629 --> 00:32:27,295
Pan Duo, come back!

511
00:32:27,295 --> 00:32:28,899
How was my acting?

512
00:32:28,899 --> 00:32:30,479
Did you notice how I built up to that?

513
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:31,721
It was so on point!

514
00:32:31,721 --> 00:32:34,390
Brother You Xi, can we start rehearsing now?

515
00:32:40,423 --> 00:32:42,520
Shot 1, take 1.

516
00:32:48,023 --> 00:32:49,224
You're awake!

517
00:32:49,225 --> 00:32:51,755
You've been sleeping for three days.

518
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:55,091
- Where am I?
- This is my place.

519
00:32:55,091 --> 00:32:58,042
I found you by the sea.

520
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:01,433
Do you remember what happened?

521
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,970
It's okay.

522
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:06,859
Everything will be okay.

523
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:10,600
Until then, I can be your friend.

524
00:33:18,516 --> 00:33:20,206
Cut!

525
00:33:20,902 --> 00:33:23,272
You Xi did a good job.

526
00:33:23,272 --> 00:33:25,387
The newbie is not bad. Good.

527
00:33:25,387 --> 00:33:28,284
You Xi took the lead and gave me the chance to show my skills.

528
00:33:28,285 --> 00:33:31,470
Brother You Xi, I'm glad to be working with you.

529
00:33:33,605 --> 00:33:34,749
Great to work with you.

530
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,949
Miss Pan, get ready for the next scene.

531
00:33:36,949 --> 00:33:38,906
Coming!

532
00:33:41,325 --> 00:33:42,954
Death is inevitable.

533
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,265
Don't be too harsh on yourself.

534
00:33:51,879 --> 00:33:53,739
Cut!

535
00:33:57,086 --> 00:33:58,879
Emotions. Understand?

536
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,211
Can't you put in some emotions?

537
00:34:00,211 --> 00:34:01,872
What kind of emotions?

538
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,260
- Can you repeat?
- You are asking me?

539
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,237
The man you love is dead. How would you feel?

540
00:34:07,237 --> 00:34:10,100
Look at you! Even the new girl is better than you.

541
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,099
At first, this Pandora seemed unreliable, but now I'm surprised that

542
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:15,495
she's quite good at acting.

543
00:34:15,495 --> 00:34:17,394
Better than Zheng Jia'er, at least.

544
00:34:17,395 --> 00:34:19,185
No wonder Brother Dazhuang took her in personally.

545
00:34:19,185 --> 00:34:20,686
You don't say!

546
00:34:20,687 --> 00:34:22,429
Brother Dazhuang, what's up?

547
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:24,947
I'm here to check on You Xi.

548
00:34:24,947 --> 00:34:27,476
I don't think that's why you're here.

549
00:34:27,476 --> 00:34:29,660
You didn't even tell me about the newbie,

550
00:34:29,661 --> 00:34:31,601
Brother Dazhuang!

551
00:34:31,601 --> 00:34:34,411
- Second Uncle!
- Second Uncle?

552
00:34:34,411 --> 00:34:37,297
You Xi, this is my niece, Pan Duo.

553
00:34:37,297 --> 00:34:39,609
She just started acting, so please help her.

554
00:34:39,609 --> 00:34:43,186
If you think about it, she's like your own niece, too.

555
00:34:43,186 --> 00:34:45,400
Third Uncle!

556
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,906
I'm not your third uncle!

557
00:34:47,906 --> 00:34:51,579
Now that you've seen me, you should go. Brother Dazhuang!

558
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:52,802
I can't leave just yet.

559
00:34:52,803 --> 00:34:54,973
I have some urgent things to tell you.

560
00:34:54,973 --> 00:34:56,354
What is it?

561
00:34:56,355 --> 00:34:58,119
It's too crowded here.

562
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,850
I'll talk to you after work.

563
00:35:04,355 --> 00:35:06,269
You Xi, my people did some checking.

564
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:07,986
The wires were tampered with.

565
00:35:07,987 --> 00:35:11,382
The guy that Yaoyao saw is definitely suspicious.

566
00:35:11,382 --> 00:35:13,540
- Where is he?
- He got away.

567
00:35:14,306 --> 00:35:18,059
- Got away?
- Apparently, he's taking a few days off for family matters, that doesn't mean he's on the run.

568
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:21,199
But don't worry. I will find him no matter what it takes.

569
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,898
So, why did he do that to Mr. You?

570
00:35:22,899 --> 00:35:25,539
Of course, he's working for somebody.

571
00:35:25,539 --> 00:35:28,539
Otherwise, how could a true superstar like me

572
00:35:28,539 --> 00:35:30,889
have someone inexplicable dar to hurt me?

573
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:34,364
When I find out who wanted to hurt You Xi, I will tear him apart!

574
00:35:34,364 --> 00:35:35,893
Isn't it obvious?

575
00:35:35,893 --> 00:35:37,449
It's definitely Song Qiege!

576
00:35:37,449 --> 00:35:39,329
I played Zhu Geliang. Then, he played Si Mayi.

577
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,199
I modeled for a milk tea shop. He picked a slimming tea brand.

578
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,584
I set up a fan meeting, and he held a celebration party next door.

579
00:35:43,585 --> 00:35:45,008
Always looking for trouble.

580
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,314
Song Qiege is the number one suspect indeed.

581
00:35:47,315 --> 00:35:49,113
Suspect?

582
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:50,683
He's no better than a murderer!

583
00:35:50,684 --> 00:35:52,724
We shouldn't have just kicked him out of the company.

584
00:35:52,724 --> 00:35:55,311
We should've kicked him out of the entertainment industry.

585
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:01,920
I'm going to bed.

586
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,326
Don't bother me with anything. Just don't bother me.

587
00:36:05,326 --> 00:36:08,506
Song Qiege, a popular up-and-comer at Times Entertainment.

588
00:36:08,506 --> 00:36:10,079
He has starred in many TV dramas.

589
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,509
His first work was "A Glamorous Summer."

590
00:36:12,509 --> 00:36:14,783
You are not googling Song Qiege, are you?

591
00:36:14,784 --> 00:36:18,489
- I am, Brother Dazhuang.
- As an assistant, you don't even know your boss's nemesis!

592
00:36:18,489 --> 00:36:21,264
This guy, Song Qiege, he's always on You Xi's heels.

593
00:36:21,264 --> 00:36:23,482
He's nothing but a second-rate star.

594
00:36:23,483 --> 00:36:24,878
Why does Mr. You hate him so much?

595
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:28,893
It all started with just one man.

596
00:36:29,793 --> 00:36:32,317
I'm not sure if you know,

597
00:36:32,318 --> 00:36:34,327
but Song Qiege and You Xi trained and debuted together,

598
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:36,484
and there was another guy who debuted with them.

599
00:36:36,484 --> 00:36:38,112
His name was Cai Xunwei.

600
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,443
Thank you, Mr. Photographer.

601
00:36:41,313 --> 00:36:45,003
I auditioned for the character of Director Ouyang's new work. The director likes me.

602
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:47,688
- I think this show will be a hit.
- That's good for you!

603
00:36:47,688 --> 00:36:49,319
It's so hard for trainees to debut now.

604
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,399
It's good that you auditioned for that one.

605
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,894
We are trainees now. We just need to work hard.

606
00:36:53,894 --> 00:36:57,182
- Here, let's have it.
- Three, two, one! We can do it!

607
00:36:57,182 --> 00:36:58,437
The three of them were very close.

608
00:36:58,438 --> 00:37:01,403
But to debut together, competition was inevitable.

609
00:37:01,403 --> 00:37:05,860
That's when the incident happened.

610
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,299
Look how nervous you are.

611
00:37:07,299 --> 00:37:10,319
Don't worry. You got this.

612
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:15,257
Smell this. It'll help you clear your mind.

613
00:37:15,257 --> 00:37:17,073
I use it every time I get nervous.

614
00:37:17,074 --> 00:37:18,928
- Does it work?
- It totally works.

615
00:37:18,928 --> 00:37:20,870
Quick, smell it.

616
00:37:22,585 --> 00:37:25,219
- Cai Xunwei, get ready.
- All right!

617
00:37:25,219 --> 00:37:28,204
This time, we will talk in more detail

618
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:30,675
about your opinion on the character.

619
00:37:31,496 --> 00:37:33,010
I…

620
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,789
I think this character…

621
00:37:37,395 --> 00:37:39,879
- Since then, Cai Xun Wei changed his career path.
- Xunwei!

622
00:37:39,879 --> 00:37:42,689
Song Qiege took the role in the show and became a top-notch star.

623
00:37:42,689 --> 00:37:44,105
He signed with Shengguo Entertainment.

624
00:37:44,106 --> 00:37:47,858
A year later, You Xi started in the TV industry and signed with Shengguo Entertainment.

625
00:37:47,858 --> 00:37:49,215
He became a top-notch star.

626
00:37:49,216 --> 00:37:51,521
After that, the first thing he did

627
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:55,571
was kicking Song Qiege out of Shengguo Entertainment.

628
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,850
Boss, You Xi has returned to work.

629
00:38:13,523 --> 00:38:16,393
You Xi and I are destined to be nemeses.
