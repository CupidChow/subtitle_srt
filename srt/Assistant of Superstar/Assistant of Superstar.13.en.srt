[Episode 13]

34
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:32,200
I'm a hero,

35
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,205
but I can't even...

36
00:01:36,992 --> 00:01:39,107
protect a woman.

37
00:01:39,107 --> 00:01:40,425
What's the point of my life?

38
00:01:40,425 --> 00:01:42,081
Cut!

39
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,580
You Xi, you have to remember the lines.

40
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:46,600
Sorry, Director.

41
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:48,999
I'm not myself today.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,606
Okay. Try it again.

43
00:01:51,606 --> 00:01:53,157
Okay.

44
00:01:53,745 --> 00:01:57,456
You Xi, don't get discouraged.

45
00:01:57,457 --> 00:01:59,431
Just learn the lines as best as you can.

46
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:01,240
That's all the actors do.

47
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,755
You don't have any lines in the entire show except to cry.

48
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:07,102
And you have the nerve to lecture me?

49
00:02:07,102 --> 00:02:08,639
What are you staring at?

50
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:12,119
Director…

51
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,598
Director… I'm sorry.

52
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:30,059
Please give us a little more time. We'll prepare for it.

53
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:33,185
Fine. But you'd better hurry.

54
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:34,079
Let's go.

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,612
We'll shoot Pan Duo's scene first.

56
00:02:36,612 --> 00:02:39,852
Okay, Director. I'm ready.

57
00:02:39,852 --> 00:02:42,201
- Good luck, Third Uncle.
- Okay.

58
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,911
I'm a hero,

59
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:54,211
but I can't even protect a woman.

60
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:56,500
What's the point of my life?

61
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,173
If I can't marry Diao Chan,

62
00:02:59,173 --> 00:03:02,513
I will give up my life.

63
00:03:05,383 --> 00:03:07,380
Let me see...

64
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,479
who's practicing lines here.

65
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,721
You Xi, you're an idol whose popularity is only second to mine.

66
00:03:18,721 --> 00:03:21,800
But don't you think you're acting is amateur?

67
00:03:22,513 --> 00:03:26,479
It's a disgrace to all the actors.

68
00:03:27,218 --> 00:03:28,718
Why are you everywhere?

69
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,119
I have no time to chat with you.

70
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,680
You have no time, but we do.

71
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,900
We finish in one take

72
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,298
unlike someone who can't even remember his lines.

73
00:03:38,298 --> 00:03:40,187
Sorry, but who are you?

74
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:41,108
You!

75
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:42,320
Shen Yiling.

76
00:03:42,321 --> 00:03:45,347
Does the makeup artist hold a grudge against you?

77
00:03:45,347 --> 00:03:49,080
Or maybe you need to touch up your face a bit more.

78
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,098
You Xi, I haven't gotten my revenge yet.

79
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:54,818
What revenge?

80
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:57,679
You walked away after you did something bad to me.

81
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:59,914
Don't you remember?

82
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,297
You…

83
00:04:04,298 --> 00:04:06,390
You have to explain things to me today.

84
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,220
What have I done to you?

85
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,999
It was one night.

86
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:12,559
You Xi is so cute.

87
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,219
Right. He looks so cute even without his makeup.

88
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,857
I wonder what kind of girl will win his heart.

89
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:20,024
I want to take a photo with him.

90
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:22,040
Let's take some photos with him together.

91
00:04:23,032 --> 00:04:25,817
You Xi, let's go and have dinner together.

92
00:04:25,817 --> 00:04:27,438
There's a new and great restaurant nearby.

93
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,500
I heard that it tastes good.

94
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,632
You Xi?

95
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,301
"There's a new and great restaurant nearby."

96
00:04:37,302 --> 00:04:39,800
Your pick-up lines are too old-fashioned.

97
00:04:41,989 --> 00:04:44,640
You have to separate your real life from the drama.

98
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,716
The point is that...

99
00:04:47,716 --> 00:04:51,509
I don't find you interesting.

100
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,099
Let's call it a day.

101
00:04:56,408 --> 00:04:58,397
Do you have nothing else to do?

102
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:01,580
Stop taking photos.

103
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:09,680
No one has ever dared to refuse me,

104
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,719
especially in front of so many people.

105
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,890
But you actually forgot about it.

106
00:05:13,891 --> 00:05:15,271
Sorry.

107
00:05:15,272 --> 00:05:17,872
I've refused countless people in the past.

108
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,660
You're not special enough for me to remember you.

109
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:29,339
You!

110
00:05:30,608 --> 00:05:34,731
You Xi, there's no point in being a slick talker.

111
00:05:34,731 --> 00:05:39,120
I'll wait and see your future performance.

112
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:43,440
Don't go!

113
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,305
Mr. You, let's hurry.

114
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:48,506
We can't let them laugh at us.

115
00:05:58,204 --> 00:06:01,684
I want to know how many mistakes You Xi will make.

116
00:06:01,684 --> 00:06:04,444
The shooting may continue until it gets dark.

117
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,922
Cut! Let's try again!

118
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:14,920
Director…

119
00:06:17,215 --> 00:06:20,526
Director, no matter how I try, I can't do it right.

120
00:06:20,526 --> 00:06:22,402
Why don't you just use a stuntwoman?

121
00:06:22,403 --> 00:06:25,229
I might as well replace you.

122
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:26,498
No!

123
00:06:26,498 --> 00:06:28,363
I'll do it.

124
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,004
Where's You Xi?

125
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,999
Mr. You Xi? He finished shooting a while ago.

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,899
He asked me to tell you that if you would like to see his wonderful performance,

127
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,721
you must remember to come early.

128
00:06:58,304 --> 00:07:01,546
Mr. You, you did such a good job today.

129
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,778
You actually finished in such a short time,

130
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:06,182
and the director couldn't scold you.

131
00:07:06,182 --> 00:07:09,027
I've told you that I have a good brain.

132
00:07:09,027 --> 00:07:11,294
It's just that I don't use it as much.

133
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,417
We've finished the shoot for today.

134
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:17,334
As the story progresses,

135
00:07:17,335 --> 00:07:19,795
acting will definitely become more difficult.

136
00:07:19,796 --> 00:07:24,699
We must be well-prepared in advance so that you don't forget your lines.

137
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:27,111
I've recited the lines,

138
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:28,662
but...

139
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,319
last night…

140
00:07:35,907 --> 00:07:37,903
What happened last night?

141
00:07:43,907 --> 00:07:44,979
Nothing.

142
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:47,775
Last night... I slept pretty well.

143
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,782
There isn't enough time today,

144
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:02,411
so I'll just tell you some basic information.

145
00:08:02,412 --> 00:08:03,980
In the next scenes coming up,

146
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,629
you'll have to understand every phrase and even every word

147
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:13,008
to better understand and get the proper feel of the role.

148
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,203
It's very difficult to learn classical Chinese.

149
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,840
Is there pinyin?

150
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,079
Student You Xi,

151
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:26,907
you should ask the director this question.

152
00:08:29,855 --> 00:08:32,800
Miss Yuchi, please continue.

153
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,200
Where are you going?

154
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,014
Student You Xi, I'll get you a glass of water.

155
00:08:40,014 --> 00:08:43,820
Then come back quickly to supervise me.

156
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,698
Yaoyao, my third uncle has been studying really hard lately.

157
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,615
He's a completely different person now.

158
00:09:18,095 --> 00:09:22,400
Mr. You has been taking acting very seriously.

159
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,878
Don't be so modest.

160
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:26,526
It's because of you that he's been studying hard lately.

161
00:09:26,526 --> 00:09:28,819
He's afraid that you will leave him again.

162
00:09:38,695 --> 00:09:41,051
We're about to shoot Sun Shangxiang's monologue.

163
00:09:41,051 --> 00:09:43,910
- Miss Pan Duo, it's your turn.
- Coming.

164
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,575
Watch me.

165
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,205
Cut!

166
00:10:09,205 --> 00:10:11,680
Miss Pan Duo, let's try it again.

167
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,758
Your movement is wrong.

168
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,079
You should walk a little slower

169
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,004
and look straight.

170
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:18,540
Don't swing your arms back and forth.

171
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,539
Okay.

172
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:21,251
I understand. One more time.

173
00:10:21,251 --> 00:10:22,878
Thank you.

174
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:24,544
Come on! Again.

175
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:31,137
Three, two, one. Action!

176
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:35,298
Cut!

177
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:36,920
Again.

178
00:10:40,295 --> 00:10:42,560
Cut!

179
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,640
Call the etiquette instructor!

180
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,550
Where's the etiquette instructor?

181
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,588
I've made so many mistakes in the scene.

182
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:56,158
Yaoyao, I run into the biggest obstacle of my career.

183
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,598
Duo Duo, it's all right.

184
00:11:00,598 --> 00:11:02,918
It's your first costume drama after all,

185
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:05,940
so it's natural that you're not used to it.

186
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,319
But you're so clever.

187
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,940
I'm sure you can make it with enough practice.

188
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,499
But… But I've been uncoordinated since I was a kid.

189
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:15,535
Is that my fault?

190
00:11:15,535 --> 00:11:18,171
Even the etiquette instructor got mad at me and left.

191
00:11:18,172 --> 00:11:20,480
How can I learn how to do it?

192
00:11:25,782 --> 00:11:32,090
I heard that someone made twenty mistakes in a scene today.

193
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,518
Where did you hear that from?

194
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:37,020
I just made three or four mistakes.

195
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,981
It's really an eye-opener.

196
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:42,861
By the way, if you were to play Diao Chan,

197
00:11:42,861 --> 00:11:45,590
our show would definitely be criticized by the viewers.

198
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:47,319
- You—
- Me?

199
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,720
What about me?

200
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:52,121
I've finished my shoot.

201
00:11:52,121 --> 00:11:56,814
Little Sister, just get through the hard time.

202
00:11:59,223 --> 00:12:01,682
Don't just run away.

203
00:12:01,682 --> 00:12:03,394
Duo Duo.

204
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:06,640
Duo Duo! Don't argue with her.

205
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:12,026
Duo Duo, I'll teach you.

206
00:12:12,026 --> 00:12:14,995
You'll teach me?

207
00:12:14,995 --> 00:12:16,242
Come on.

208
00:12:16,243 --> 00:12:19,360
Women in the past couldn't walk too quickly.

209
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,717
You have to use your waist to move your feet.

210
00:12:22,717 --> 00:12:24,422
Straighten your neck.

211
00:12:25,903 --> 00:12:27,814
Look ahead.

212
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:29,604
Lower your chin slightly.

213
00:12:29,604 --> 00:12:31,400
Relax your shoulders.

214
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,400
Cross your hands over your stomach.

215
00:12:35,502 --> 00:12:37,440
Keep your fingers together.

216
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:42,100
Try it now.

217
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,401
Just walk like this?

218
00:12:43,402 --> 00:12:45,360
Take two steps.

219
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,965
Like this?

220
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:24,138
Cut! Good job!

221
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,620
She finally passed!

222
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,619
I did it!

223
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:32,526
She finally passed! She finally passed!

224
00:13:32,526 --> 00:13:35,324
Third Uncle, I'm telling you! Yaoyao had done a great job today.

225
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:37,798
She not only helped me pass the previous scene in one take,

226
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:41,476
but she also told the director that Zheng Jia's postures weren't right.

227
00:13:41,477 --> 00:13:42,803
The director was baffled,

228
00:13:42,804 --> 00:13:46,798
and he called Zheng Jia back to reshoot everything again.

229
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,780
Yaoyao, you're really my friend.

230
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,504
Her postures did not fit the historical record indeed.

231
00:13:52,505 --> 00:13:53,878
Although Diao Chan was a singer,

232
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:56,296
- according to the history books—
- You haven't found one yet?

233
00:13:56,296 --> 00:13:58,896
What? Is it that hard to find an extra?

234
00:13:58,897 --> 00:14:00,234
These people…

235
00:14:00,235 --> 00:14:03,367
Assistant Director, when will you shoot my scene?

236
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:05,038
Mr. You, I'm really sorry.

237
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,571
We need an extra actress for the previous scene.

238
00:14:06,572 --> 00:14:07,808
We're still looking for one.

239
00:14:07,808 --> 00:14:10,308
We can't start your scene until we finish the previous one.

240
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:17,019
Yaoyao can do it. She can.

241
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:19,833
I-I-I can't do it.

242
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:21,398
Yaoyao, you can.

243
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:23,593
Your postures are even better than the etiquette instructor.

244
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:26,799
Besides, you look pretty.

245
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,599
You're more than qualified to be an extra.

246
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,220
Am I right, Third Uncle?

247
00:14:40,394 --> 00:14:41,931
With me here...

248
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:43,420
Don't be afraid.

249
00:14:44,355 --> 00:14:45,788
If we can finish the shoot early,

250
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:49,380
I'll make you peppered chicken if you're hungry.

251
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,586
I'm the one who recommended her. So I get to eat the chicken as well.

252
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,099
Just go.

253
00:14:56,099 --> 00:14:58,704
Me? Then I…

254
00:14:58,704 --> 00:14:59,708
Let's go.

255
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:00,786
Me?

256
00:15:00,787 --> 00:15:02,693
- Come quickly.
- Come on.

257
00:15:04,732 --> 00:15:05,696
With me here...

258
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,280
Don't be afraid.

259
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,673
Do you think...

260
00:15:14,674 --> 00:15:16,038
that the script makes sense?

261
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:17,021
No.

262
00:15:17,022 --> 00:15:20,399
Then, why are you playing it this way? Are you stupid?

263
00:15:36,817 --> 00:15:40,600
♫  Watching the leaves fall in the yard  ♫

264
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,000
♫  and listening as the seasons pass silently  ♫

265
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,480
♫  Watching the sun set behind the hillside in the distance  ♫

266
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,420
♫  It's natural for flowers to bloom and wither,  ♫

267
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:59,989
♫  but love is full of twists and turns  ♫

268
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,415
♫  Our future will be unpredictable and full of challenges  ♫

269
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:06,205
♫  But the love song for you is like the windmill from afar  ♫

270
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:10,431
♫  But the love song for you is like the windmill from afar  ♫

271
00:16:10,431 --> 00:16:12,899
♫  It's spinning more and more slowly  ♫

272
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,172
Third Uncle.

273
00:16:15,172 --> 00:16:17,220
Third Uncle, wake up.

274
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:24,568
Does it look weird?

275
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:27,813
No. You're very beautiful.

276
00:16:27,813 --> 00:16:29,740
Am I right, Third Uncle?

277
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,906
It's so-so.

278
00:16:39,295 --> 00:16:41,940
Not bad. Let's do it.

279
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,815
Next is a scene where a hero saves a beauty.

280
00:16:43,816 --> 00:16:45,355
Come on!

281
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:49,680
A hero saves a beauty?

282
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,722
You have to act with everything you've got.

283
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,119
What a pretty girl!

284
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,120
Play with me.

285
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,394
Help!

286
00:17:06,395 --> 00:17:09,713
Even if you scream as loud as possible, no one will come to save you.

287
00:17:09,714 --> 00:17:12,619
Just listen to us.

288
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:14,109
Let her go!

289
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,900
Get lost!

290
00:17:40,674 --> 00:17:41,716
You just wait and see!

291
00:17:41,717 --> 00:17:43,399
You just wait and see!

292
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:49,206
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

293
00:17:49,206 --> 00:17:50,840
Let her go!

294
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,457
A gang of bastards!

295
00:17:52,457 --> 00:17:55,900
Third Uncle, what are you angry about? It's just a scene.

296
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,990
It's just a scene.

297
00:18:03,198 --> 00:18:07,845
Who the hell is this guy playing Zhao Zilong?

298
00:18:07,845 --> 00:18:09,958
Third Uncle, he's Zhao Yi,

299
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:12,310
a new, accomplished actor.

300
00:18:12,311 --> 00:18:14,537
He's been formally trained as an actor. He is a great actor and looks cute,

301
00:18:14,537 --> 00:18:17,421
but he keeps a low profile and is modest.

302
00:18:17,422 --> 00:18:19,603
Many girls like him.

303
00:18:19,603 --> 00:18:21,604
If I can recall,

304
00:18:21,605 --> 00:18:24,440
he's three years younger than you.

305
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:29,020
He looks about ten years older than me.

306
00:18:31,502 --> 00:18:33,874
This role originally belonged to Wen Moxuan.

307
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,078
Do you remember Wen Moxuan?

308
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:37,921
He's the boy who gave Yaoyao a hairpin last time.

309
00:18:39,674 --> 00:18:42,993
His band's touring schedule

310
00:18:42,994 --> 00:18:44,719
clashed with the shoot,

311
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,680
so Zhao Yi came to take over the role temporarily.

312
00:18:50,527 --> 00:18:53,423
Wen Moxuan left, but here comes Zhao Yi.

313
00:18:56,513 --> 00:19:00,092
You weren't scared just now, were you?

314
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:03,884
It was my first time acting, so I was a little nervous.

315
00:19:03,884 --> 00:19:07,903
It's fine. You'll get used to it if you act more often.

316
00:19:10,841 --> 00:19:13,400
What are you doing?

317
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,425
Mr. You, allow me to introduce you.

318
00:19:16,425 --> 00:19:18,903
This is Brother Zhao Yi.

319
00:19:18,903 --> 00:19:21,735
Brother… Zhao Yi?

320
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:26,326
Hi, Brother You Xi. I'm Zhao Yi.

321
00:19:26,326 --> 00:19:28,266
We've worked together before.

322
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:29,709
I can't recall.

323
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,920
Sorry,

324
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,360
I can't remember minor supporting roles.

325
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,104
Let's go.

326
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,919
What can I do?

327
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,145
I'm not a scriptwriter.

328
00:19:50,146 --> 00:19:52,125
I don't care.

329
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,818

and make her realize spontaneously

496
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,000
that she can't live without you.

497
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,200
And you have to awaken her emotions.

498
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,380
I see...

499
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,800
What do you mean?

500
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,800
- Jealousy.
- Jealousy?

501
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Brother Chao, you're also here.

502
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,200
You Xi, I have something to tell you.

503
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,600
Brother Dazhuang, just get straight to the point.

504
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,900
I have something important to tell Brother Chao.

505
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,100
You Xi, I have an idea.

506
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:35,800
We can publish a memoir about your secret emotions

507
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,000
since you debuted.

508
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,600
What do you think?

509
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,800
- Okay.
- Okay?

510
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,800
I said okay!

511
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,200
Do you have anything else to say?

512
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,600
No. No. No. That's a deal then.

513
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,400
Ten thousand words per week.

514
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,300
I'll come and check your work next week.

515
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,100
I'm off.

516
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,300
Bye-bye.

517
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,700
Ten thousand words per week.

518
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,000
Brother Chao,

519
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,600
tell me how to make her jealous?

520
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,600
Tell me.

521
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,700
Shot One. Take Three.

522
00:34:21,621 --> 00:34:24,190
Ready! Action!

523
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,000
Cut!

524
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,900
Next is the scene where Lü Bu and Diao Chan kiss in the garden.

525
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,400
Mr. You, why are there five kissing scenes this afternoon?

526
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,000
Why do you ask me?

527
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I do as the script says and as the director wants me to do.

528
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,500
Director…

529
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,000
I want to talk to you...

530
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,600
about the script.

531
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:42,586
You don't want to have another behind-the-scenes tidbit, do you?

532
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,300
No. No.

533
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,900
I just want to ask...

534
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,700
whether you can shoot...

535
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,800
Lü Bu's kissing scenes in one go.

536
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,600
Okay, okay.

537
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,400
As long as you are not asking for additional scenes, everything is okay.

538
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,800
I don't need additional scenes.

539
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,700
Good. Good. Good.

540
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,400
Any problems?

541
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,000
No.

542
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,300
I'll get ready for the next scene.

543
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,600
Shot One. Take Eight.

544
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,000
Action!

545
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,400
Cut!

546
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,800
Scene changes.

547
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,400
Next is the scene where Lü Bu and Diao Chan kiss in the kitchen.

548
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,700
Oh no!

549
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,000
Cut!

550
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
It's good. Not bad.

551
00:39:51,804 --> 00:39:53,390
♫  The world is so big,  ♫

552
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:57,380
♫  yet a word of love from you makes me melt  ♫

553
00:39:57,381 --> 00:40:01,048
♫  Watching you decorate this little home,  ♫

554
00:40:01,049 --> 00:40:05,994
♫  the overflowing happiness can barely be contained  ♫

555
00:40:05,995 --> 00:40:09,167
♫  The noise of spring and autumn, the temperature difference between winter and summer  ♫

556
00:40:09,168 --> 00:40:11,500
♫  they've all become picturesque  ♫

557
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,000
♫  Even if worries accompany sunsets,  ♫

558
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
♫  is there any reasons not to cherish the moment?  ♫

559
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,600
♫  I'll be with you when you cry  ♫

560
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:27,100
♫  I'll pamper you so that you won't ruin your makeup  ♫

561
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:32,800
♫  I will take you wherever you want to go  ♫

562
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,800
♫  You are my girl  ♫

563
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,200
♫  I want you to be my goddess for the rest of my life  ♫

564
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,800
♫  I'll gently light the lamp in the quiet of the night  ♫

565
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,100
♫  I'll hold you in my arms and let you sleep soundly  ♫

566
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,800
♫  I'm your man  ♫

567
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,400
♫  I will take care of you with my all  ♫

568
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,300
♫  I'll silently follow the perfect script in your heart  ♫

569
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:05,000
♫  It's you who makes everything become possible and love to be flawless  ♫
