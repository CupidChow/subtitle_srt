[Assistant of Superstar]

34
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,620
[Episode 5]

35
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,105
"The perfume body spray endorsed by You Xi has caused severe allergies in many people."

36
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:34,592
The company business card turned out to be a fake.

37
00:01:34,593 --> 00:01:38,722
He didn't know about the company until we came to him.

38
00:01:38,722 --> 00:01:41,740
So, President Sun is the one who is behind all this.

39
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,999
But we still lack evidence to implicate him for the company's wrongdoings.

40
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,472
You Xi,

41
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:51,599
I think you should take full responsibility for

42
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,678
the poor quality of the perfume.

43
00:02:46,053 --> 00:02:49,413
During my first solo debut performance as a trainee,

44
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,520
someone splashed red paint all over me.

45
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:57,539
On that day, I was terrified.

46
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:07,713
But then I found out that

47
00:03:07,713 --> 00:03:10,819
one of our fellow trainees was behind it.

48
00:03:11,706 --> 00:03:16,012
Then our company poached the trainee.

49
00:03:18,905 --> 00:03:21,485
They wanted me to reconcile with him.

50
00:03:23,926 --> 00:03:25,913
And did you?

51
00:03:27,454 --> 00:03:29,210
What do you think?

52
00:03:32,064 --> 00:03:34,558
I think you didn't.

53
00:03:35,764 --> 00:03:37,091
That's right.

54
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:41,112
I quit and became an actor.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,265
So, that's how you ended up in Shengguo Entertainment.

56
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,220
Dazhuang told you.

57
00:03:52,485 --> 00:03:55,698
Brother Dazhuang said you were a legend with splendid achievements.

58
00:03:55,699 --> 00:04:00,930
And you beat the hell out of Song Qiege to avenge Cai Xunwei.

59
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,806
I didn't take him seriously.

60
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:07,963
Mr. You,

61
00:04:07,963 --> 00:04:14,540
will you be… sealed… this time?

62
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,492
Sealed?

63
00:04:19,032 --> 00:04:21,533
You mean blacklisted?

64
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:22,872
Yeah.

65
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,312
Don't worry.

66
00:04:26,312 --> 00:04:28,292
Your boss is so blessed

67
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:30,213
that nothing will happen to him.

68
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:37,900
Besides, I am not who I used to be anymore.

69
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,259
Hey, Brother Dazhuang,

70
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:02,406
arrange a press conference for me tomorrow.

71
00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:06,550
I want to explain to everyone about the perfume body spray issue.

72
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,750
Right. I'm on it now.

73
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,367
[I will hold a press conference regarding the perfume body spray incident, You Xi.]

74
00:05:23,036 --> 00:05:25,279
You Xi posted on Weibo.

75
00:05:26,772 --> 00:05:31,638
Is it a selfie without self-awareness or the chicken soup for the soul?

76
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,787
Tomorrow, there will be a press conference concerning the perfume body spray issue.

77
00:05:35,787 --> 00:05:38,519
This is an official response to the people.

78
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:45,120
Will this be a problem for President Sun?

79
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:52,204
I have already handled it and told him to go abroad for a while.

80
00:05:52,204 --> 00:05:56,580
As soon as President Sun leaves, the company will no longer exist.

81
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,112
And You Xi will have to shoulder all the responsibility.

82
00:05:59,112 --> 00:06:01,605
What else can he say at the press conference…

83
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:04,426
besides… begging for pity?

84
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:06,599
It is all a desperate struggle.

85
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,500
Tomorrow, I will be found innocent. So today is my treat.

86
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,390
All right.

87
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:19,480
- Let's enjoy.
- Great.

88
00:06:26,593 --> 00:06:30,066
This chicken drumstick is so big that I don't think I can finish it all.

89
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:32,033
Is there any drumstick you can't finshed?

90
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,228
My idol, please have it.

91
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:38,080
I don't like chicken drumsticks.

92
00:06:49,297 --> 00:06:50,885
Me, neither.

93
00:06:50,886 --> 00:06:52,530
Yaoyao, go ahead.

94
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,202
Brother Dazhuang, take it.

95
00:06:58,202 --> 00:07:00,779
Okay, thanks.

96
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:07,210
I am on a diet.

97
00:07:08,112 --> 00:07:10,408
The chicken drumstick is Duo Duo's favorite.

98
00:07:13,505 --> 00:07:16,529
My idol, how about a chicken wing?

99
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:17,432
I'm full.

100
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:18,986
I need to use the restroom.

101
00:07:18,987 --> 00:07:21,026
Did you finish eating?

102
00:07:21,993 --> 00:07:23,645
I need to go, too.

103
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:38,465
My idol!

104
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,386
Now that there's just the two of us, you can tell me anything you want.

105
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:45,846
What do you want to know?

106
00:07:45,846 --> 00:07:47,025
My idol,

107
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:49,925
I know that going to the restroom was just an excuse.

108
00:07:49,926 --> 00:07:52,699
You wanted to tell me something in private, right?

109
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:54,159
I know it's a code.

110
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,020
It was indeed an excuse.

111
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,605
- I knew it.
- An excuse to get away from you.

112
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:01,787
It is Qi Chao. It really is Qi Chao.

113
00:08:01,787 --> 00:08:04,259
Can you take a picture for us?

114
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,604
No.

115
00:08:10,605 --> 00:08:11,682
Take it now.

116
00:08:11,683 --> 00:08:13,293
- Hurry up.
- Now.

117
00:08:13,294 --> 00:08:14,812
- Take your hands off him.
- No.

118
00:08:14,813 --> 00:08:15,919
- Take your hands off him.
- No.

119
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,609
Keep your distance from him.

120
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,279
- Take the picture now.
- Keep your distance.

121
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,440
Take it.

122
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,122
Come on.

123
00:08:33,118 --> 00:08:34,600
Done.

124
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,898
What did you take exactly?

125
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:39,979
- We weren't even in the picture.
- Yeah.

126
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,918
What does it have to do with me?

127
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,279
It is so ugly. What is this?

128
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,986
You.

129
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,240
My idol, squeeze harder.

130
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:04,659
Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to hold onto me.

131
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,307
What did you do to Pandora?

132
00:09:19,307 --> 00:09:21,200
She's been like this since she came back.

133
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,919
Shut up!

134
00:09:25,818 --> 00:09:28,718
Love can make people blind.

135
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,019
How are your friend and his secretary?

136
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,498
What else would be happening?

137
00:09:39,498 --> 00:09:40,999
Her work abilities barely meet the demands.

138
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:43,380
I mean romantically.

139
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,012
Third Uncle, don't just eat that.

140
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,580
Here are some mushrooms.

141
00:10:12,513 --> 00:10:14,126
Mr. You.

142
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:17,920
Why didn't you throw that away?

143
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,091
You said it was from your mother.

144
00:10:20,092 --> 00:10:23,147
So, I thought it must be something special for you.

145
00:10:23,148 --> 00:10:25,260
So I...

146
00:10:30,618 --> 00:10:32,889
That is so ugly.

147
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:33,639
Throw it out.

148
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,614
Do you not like this color?

149
00:10:35,614 --> 00:10:37,639
Because I can change the color.

150
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,860
Throw it away.

151
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:43,095
Although it is a little bit ugly,

152
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:46,840
you can keep it as a token of cherishing your mother's gift.

153
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,192
Isn't it nice?

154
00:10:50,193 --> 00:10:51,753
There's no need.

155
00:10:51,753 --> 00:10:54,360
I can just ask my mother to buy a new one for me.

156
00:10:58,413 --> 00:11:00,232
Why aren't you leaving?

157
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,100
- Mr. You, let me do it.
- Let me.

158
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:06,040
- No, I can do it.
- Let me.

159
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,000
You seriously can't recall

160
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,740
what happened the other night?

161
00:11:27,397 --> 00:11:29,459
What?

162
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:34,626
Do you think kissing is a big deal?

163
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:40,600
It isn't a big deal if two people are

164
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,160

You will be part of the main cast.

490
00:35:17,314 --> 00:35:19,398
And the compensation is quite big.

491
00:35:19,398 --> 00:35:24,419
Director Zhang, you mean I can help the newbies while making money for the company.

492
00:35:24,419 --> 00:35:27,407
Just tell me. Is it Pandora or Zheng Jia'er?

493
00:35:27,407 --> 00:35:29,501
Both. Both.

494
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:31,300
I won't do it.

495
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,759
I heard that Song Qiege wants this part, too.

496
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:37,016
That's right. Song Qiege wants this part, too.

497
00:35:37,016 --> 00:35:38,878
I don't care who wants to do it.

498
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:40,800
I refuse.

499
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,100
♫  The world is so big,  ♫

500
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:17,270
♫  yet a word of love from you makes me melt  ♫

501
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:20,900
♫  Watching you decorate this little home,  ♫

502
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:25,870
♫  the overflowing happiness can barely be contained  ♫

503
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:29,010
♫  The noise of spring and autumn, the temperature difference between winter and summer  ♫

504
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:31,430
♫  they've all become picturesque  ♫

505
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:34,910
♫  Even if worries accompany sunsets,  ♫

506
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:39,900
♫  is there any reasons not to cherish the moment?  ♫

507
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,500
♫  I'll be with you when you cry  ♫

508
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,040
♫  I'll pamper you so that you won't ruin your makeup  ♫

509
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:52,760
♫  I will take you wherever you want to go  ♫

510
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,690
♫  You are my girl  ♫

511
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:59,170
♫  I want you to be my goddess for the rest of my life  ♫

512
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,960
♫  I'll gently light the lamp in the quiet of the night  ♫

513
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,940
♫  I'll hold you in my arms and let you sleep soundly  ♫

514
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,800
♫  I'm your man  ♫

515
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,310
♫  I will take care of you with my all  ♫

516
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:17,310
♫  I'll silently follow the perfect script in your heart  ♫

517
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:24,320
♫  It's you who makes everything become possible and love to be flawless  ♫
