[Five More Days]

38
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,828
Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya had done business together.

39
00:02:38,828 --> 00:02:41,499
Bao Shuya knew that Guan Zhong was very poor,

40
00:02:41,499 --> 00:02:45,740
so he would give much of the profit to Guan Zhong.

41
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,092
Later, when they were on the battlefield,

42
00:02:48,092 --> 00:02:51,493
Guan Zhong ran away many times.

43
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,475
Ran away many times!

44
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,200
People ridiculed him for being timid

45
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,053
while Bao Shuya explained to others that it was because Guan Zhong was a filial son

46
00:03:02,053 --> 00:03:04,719
who had an old mother to attend to.

47
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,860
Later, after Prince Jiu's failure of attaining the throne,

48
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,939
Guan Zhong was imprisoned.

49
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:16,338
Bao Shuya believed that Guan Zhong would not feel humiliated by losing his freedom

50
00:03:16,338 --> 00:03:20,701
but would be upset about never being able to achieve success.

51
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,382
So, he recommended Guan Zhong to Duke Huan of Qi,

52
00:03:23,382 --> 00:03:25,100
who made Guan Zhong a prestigious official.

53
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,944
Guan Zhong once said that his parents had given him a life,

54
00:03:27,944 --> 00:03:30,203
but Bao Shuya was the one who understood him the most.

55
00:03:30,203 --> 00:03:35,128
This is the famous story of the friendship between Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya.

56
00:03:36,238 --> 00:03:40,039
But Guan Zhong did some disloyal things when he was young.

57
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:43,819
Guan Zhong made more money in the business that he founded with Bao Shuya,

58
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:45,980
yet he joined the war and became a deserter.

59
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,888
I think he is greedy, timid, and disloyal.

60
00:03:50,888 --> 00:03:55,199
He doesn't deserve to be friends with Bao Shuya.

61
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,916
I think you need to think in his shoes

62
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:02,099
before judging a person.

63
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:09,356
I believe Guan Zhong must have some good merits besides his talent and knowledge

64
00:04:09,356 --> 00:04:15,739
that won the respect and understanding of Bao Shuya.

65
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,840

I couldn't grab it. Let's go.

182
00:13:32,941 --> 00:13:35,859
- I'm craving ice cream.
- Sure, I will buy it for you.

189
00:14:00,864 --> 00:14:02,585
Mr. You.

190
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,520
I could have grabbed ten more dolls if we had more time.

191
00:14:09,452 --> 00:14:13,038
But Mr. You, how come you wouldn't show me how you grabbed the dolls

192
00:14:13,038 --> 00:14:15,120
every time you played the claw machine?

193
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,146
Because it is a secret that no one should know.

194
00:14:17,146 --> 00:14:18,787
Wait.

195
00:14:32,522 --> 00:14:34,002
Mr. You.

196
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,953
Good luck with tomorrow's exam.

197
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,120
Guan Zhong, Prince Jiu had been killed by Lu Zhuang,

198
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,849
and you had also shot Prince Bai with an arrow.

199
00:14:54,849 --> 00:14:59,174
We were not going to survive during the journey to the Kingdom of Qi.

200
00:14:59,174 --> 00:15:03,519
So why don't we follow Prince Jiu?

201
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,406
That's not right.

202
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,480
Guan Zhong shot Duke Huan of Qi with an arrow.

203
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,056
Why didn't he just commit suicide and keep his good reputation?

204
00:15:16,056 --> 00:15:18,395
But instead, he went back to the Kingdom of Qi.

205
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:20,754
Wasn't he afraid of being killed by Duke Huan of Qi?

206
00:15:22,126 --> 00:15:23,820
Kingdom of Qi.

207
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,290
Kingdom of Qi. Kingdom of Qi.

208
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,489
Bao Shuya was in the Kingdom of Qi.

209
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,779
My parents have given me my life yet Bao Shuya understood me the most.

210
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:39,148
Bao Shuya knew that I would not be humiliated by losing my freedom

211
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:42,240
but would die from never being able to achieve any success.

212
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,539
As long as Bao Shuya is in the Kingdom of Qi,

213
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:47,340
I will survive.

214
00:16:44,693 --> 00:16:48,763
You Xi, I didn't expect you to come.

215
00:16:48,763 --> 00:16:50,202
Relax.

216
00:16:50,202 --> 00:16:53,759
I will cut you some slack and not make you look so bad.

217
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,520
You are crazy.

218
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,790
Stop.

219
00:16:59,422 --> 00:17:01,143
What now?

220
00:17:01,995 --> 00:17:03,620
Good boy.

221
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,955
How do you think Guan Zhong left his old master

222
00:17:14,955 --> 00:17:18,895
and came to Duke Huan of Qi and helped him unite the kingdom?

223
00:17:18,895 --> 00:17:22,340
I think it depends on which angle you are looking at.

224
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:26,452
In terms of loyalty, he betrayed his old master.

225
00:17:26,452 --> 00:17:29,780
That's disloyalty.

226
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,766
But Guan Zhong had always been a very revolutionary reformer.

227
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:37,837
I think criticisms of him have been misunderstandings.

228
00:17:37,837 --> 00:17:42,079
In terms of humanity, he helped Duke Huan of Qi unite the kingdom,

229
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:44,361
saving people from war.

230
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:46,060
As Confucius has once said,

231
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,440
you love people by showing mercy.

232
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,700
I believe that I share something in common with him in this aspect.

233
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,739
I always believe that there is a certain connection between

234
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,849
the actors and characters.

235
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:58,217
If you were Duke Huan of Qi, would you use Guan Zhong?

236
00:17:58,217 --> 00:18:00,570
If it were me,

237
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,240
I would not.

238
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,872
I think it is because Guan Zhong was talented.

239
00:18:03,872 --> 00:18:08,788
Because I am not as broad-minded as he was.

240
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:14,890
- Personally speaking, he took a risk.
- Why am I trusting someone who once tried to kill himself.

241
00:18:29,828 --> 00:18:32,219
Last question.

242
00:18:32,219 --> 00:18:36,139
Why did Bao Shuya help and recommend Guan Zhong several times?

243
00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:40,688
It seemed that Guan Zhong had never done something successful when he was young.

244
00:18:40,688 --> 00:18:42,827
Bao Shuya, with the talent of spotting people,

245
00:18:42,827 --> 00:18:45,834
found the special talent of Guan Zhong.

246
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:48,051
Bao Shuya was right,

247
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:51,271
judging from the success Guan Zhong had achieved while helping Duke Huan of Qi.

248
00:18:55,279 --> 00:19:02,480
I believe Guan Zhong must have some good merits besides his talent and knowledge

249
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,900
that won the respect and understanding of Bao Shuya.

250
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,319
Friends.

251
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,240
Because they were friends.

252
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,960
Friends?

253
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:18,303
Yes.

254
00:19:18,303 --> 00:19:20,153
Guan Zhong once said that his parents had given him life,

255
00:19:20,153 --> 00:19:22,640
but Bao Shuya knew him the best.

256
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,880
Bao Shuya took Guan Zhong as a friend.

257
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,773
Therefore, he appreciated Guan Zhong,

258
00:19:27,773 --> 00:19:31,480
trusted him without any condition, and stood in his shoes.

259
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,889
Guan Zhong treated Bao Shuya as a friend as well.

260
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:37,584
So he trusted Bao Shuya wholeheartedly.

261
00:19:37,584 --> 00:19:41,170
I think that they were true friends.

262
00:19:42,002 --> 00:19:46,794
Director Wei, do you think I am qualified for this part?

263
00:19:47,612 --> 00:19:51,112
We still need to discuss it as a team.

264
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,709
You Xi, I am impressed

265
00:19:57,709 --> 00:19:59,949
by the way that you understood the character.

266
00:20:01,474 --> 00:20:06,661
And I believe you will certainly portray a vivid Zhongfu.

267
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:18,164
But I don't like the green color.

268
00:20:28,357 --> 00:20:31,600
Mr. You, how did it go?

269
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,147
I…

270
00:20:41,209 --> 00:20:43,462
I got the part.

271
00:20:43,462 --> 00:20:45,939
I knew it! I knew you could do it.

272
00:20:45,939 --> 00:20:47,039
Good job!

273
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,119
Let's go. We should celebrate.

274
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,370
I will let Brother Dazhuang know.

275
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,190
Okay, go ahead.

276
00:20:53,072 --> 00:20:54,811
Good news.

277
00:20:54,811 --> 00:20:56,739
Everyone is here.

278
00:20:56,739 --> 00:20:59,739
I will announce the good news.

279
00:20:59,739 --> 00:21:01,380
Let's congratulate You Xi

280
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,019
on getting the male lead role in Zhongfu.

281
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,750
Morry, should we go celebrate tonight?

282
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,519
Definitely.

283
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,559
You know what? You Xi will successfully transform

284
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,752
into another phase of acting now that he got the part.

285
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:20,381
He will be popular for another ten years.

286
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:22,420
No, twenty years.

287
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:29,146
So, tonight, everyone, just enjoy the food and have fun.

288
00:21:29,146 --> 00:21:30,899
It will be on me.

289
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,960
Boss, I got it.

290
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,620
There are four investors for Zhongfu.

291
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,880
The biggest one is Tong Tianming.

292
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,899
- Tong Tianming?
- Yes.

293
00:21:44,899 --> 00:21:48,170
The CEO of Huateng Corporation, Tong Tianming.

294
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,340
I'd like to meet him.

295
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,126
I will schedule it now.

296
00:22:00,675 --> 00:22:03,598
Yuchi Mumu, what are you doing?

297
00:22:05,802 --> 00:22:07,222
Mr. You,

298
00:22:09,196 --> 00:22:13,517
you've gotten the part, so my job is done.

299
00:22:13,517 --> 00:22:16,480
- I will move out tomorrow.
- You can't.

300
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,956
Why not?

301
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,550
Why not? Because…

302
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:25,422
Because you are my assistant…

303
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:29,811
That's right. Because you are my assistant,

304
00:22:29,811 --> 00:22:31,492
you can't leave.

305
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:36,722
Mr. You, I have to go to school.

306
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,543
I can't be your assistant anymore.

307
00:22:42,488 --> 00:22:44,528
But…

308
00:22:47,828 --> 00:22:50,488
you can come to school and hang out with me.

309
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,450
Why would I do that?

310
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,781
I understand.

311
00:22:56,781 --> 00:22:58,351
You are a celebrity.

312
00:22:58,351 --> 00:23:00,394
That's why you can't come.

313
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,895
What do you know?

314
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,910
[Master Lü's Spring and Autumn Annals]

315
00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:32,749
It's going to rain.

316
00:24:36,913 --> 00:24:38,257
Yuchi Yaoyao!

317
00:24:38,257 --> 00:24:40,459
It's going to rain. Come back.

318
00:24:44,187 --> 00:24:46,227
Fine, don't come back then.

319
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:01,300
Ugly as hell.

320
00:25:15,953 --> 00:25:18,679
[Sealed]

321
00:25:44,636 --> 00:25:45,859
Hello?

322
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:49,079
Third Uncle, congratulations on getting the part.

323
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,432
Yeah!

324
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:01,612
I should be happy that I got the part.

325
00:26:14,556 --> 00:26:16,714
Why did you leave me?

326
00:26:16,714 --> 00:26:18,960
Why?

327
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,179
I've become a different person because of you.

328
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:24,473
And now you're going to leave me?

329
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,339
I didn't want to.

330
00:26:48,251 --> 00:26:49,735
I'm coming.

331
00:26:50,658 --> 00:26:52,937
Hey, is this 1201?

332
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:57,615
Thank you.

333
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,682
"Mother has told me many times the story of being brave.

334
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:25,665
Yet the minute I look outside the window, I become nervous."

335
00:27:25,665 --> 00:27:29,680
Good. Let's practice writing this character, shall we?

336
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,295
Miss Yaoyao, I want to go to the bathroom.

337
00:27:34,295 --> 00:27:37,775
You've gone to the bathroom three times in less than half an hour…

338
00:27:41,138 --> 00:27:42,735
What is it now?

339
00:27:43,355 --> 00:27:45,304
I want to go to the bathroom.

340
00:27:45,304 --> 00:27:48,906
You've gone to the bathroom three times in less than half an hour.

341
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:56,313
Can I go, Miss Yaoyao?

342
00:27:56,313 --> 00:28:00,092
- You can.
- Thank you, Miss Yaoyao.

343
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:20,069
Third Uncle, it's your turn.

344
00:28:26,345 --> 00:28:27,701
I won.

345
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,456
Third Uncle, you mean that you won this round?

346
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:43,700
I know. I said that I won.

347
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:46,420
That's right.

348
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,207
How boring.

349
00:28:50,207 --> 00:28:54,200
You Xi, let's spice things up.

350
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,592
For example?

351
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,120
How about checking out the resume of your new assistant?

352
00:29:09,698 --> 00:29:11,478
What do you think?

353
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,859
You Xi! You Xi.

354
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:18,580
- Hey.
- What's going on?

355
00:29:19,496 --> 00:29:21,213
It is all your fault, Second Uncle.

356
00:29:21,213 --> 00:29:23,436
You knew how upset he was because Yaoyao left.

357
00:29:23,436 --> 00:29:26,576
- Why would you talk about a new assistant?
- It's my fault then?

358
00:29:26,576 --> 00:29:29,666
You are not his manager, so how would you know my position?

359
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:32,460
Just give him time to calm down.

360
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,034
My idol.

361
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,427
You can do overtime today, Second Uncle.

362
00:29:37,427 --> 00:29:38,893
- There's no need to come home early.
- Tonight, I have—

363
00:29:38,893 --> 00:29:40,807
Don't worry. My idol will escort me home.

364
00:29:40,807 --> 00:29:42,540
- Don't worry about it.
- But, I—

365
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,270
My idol, my second uncle abandoned me.

366
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,845
So you are all I have.

367
00:29:46,845 --> 00:29:48,246
No way.

368
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:50,620
I won't mind sleeping at your place.

369
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,719
There's no room for you.

370
00:29:51,719 --> 00:29:54,413
My idol, I can do the house chores.

371
00:29:54,413 --> 00:29:56,634
I won't trouble you.

372
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:02,884
Can you please teach your daughter, Sister?

373
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,120
Wait for me.

374
00:30:07,851 --> 00:30:09,240
You want me

375
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,559
to help you get the lead part of Zhongfu?

376
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,899
Why would I do that?

377
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,260
From what I learned,

378
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:23,060
you have withdrawn your investment for "The Realm of the Three Kingdoms" because of You Xi.

379
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,820
Let me guess.

380
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,620
You don't want to see him happy.

381
00:30:28,343 --> 00:30:30,279
The reason why the investment got withdrawn

382
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:33,079
was because of my company's internal decision,

383
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,820
not because of You Xi.

384
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,480
I am a businessman.

385
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,159
I only care about making money.

386
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:41,025
Please leave.

387
00:30:41,766 --> 00:30:43,200
Fine.

388
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,776
You will come back to me begging.

389
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,540
Liu Bei was a bastard.

390
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,296
How could he be so ungrateful and forget that

391
00:31:27,296 --> 00:31:29,440
Lü Bu had once helped him?

392
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,059
Instead of helping Lü Bu after he was caught by Cao Cao,

393
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:35,212
Liu Bei stabbed him behind his back.

394
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:37,720
Bastard.

395
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,720
- Bastard.
- Mr. You.

396
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,189
Bastard.

397
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:08,140
Mr. You,

398
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,540
I have to go to school.

399
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,947
I can't be your assistant anymore.

400
00:32:14,219 --> 00:32:16,180
But…

401
00:32:19,529 --> 00:32:22,409
you can come to school and hang out with me.

402
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,720
- Hi.
- Good morning, Uncle.

403
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:01,200
- Your teachers are very nice.
- Yeah.

404
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,646
Hey!

405
00:33:04,062 --> 00:33:05,394
Is that You Xi?

406
00:33:05,394 --> 00:33:06,964
It is.

407
00:33:06,964 --> 00:33:08,909
Is he really You Xi?

408
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,240
You Xi came to our school.

409
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,359
Seriously?

410
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:18,200
He's here?

411
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,880
Let's go.

412
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,279
- I'll come with you.
- Wait for me.

413
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,057
You Xi is here.

414
00:33:38,235 --> 00:33:40,734
[You Xi showed up at our school! Ladies, go and catch him!]

415
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:10,000
You Xi!

416
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,726
Mr. You!

417
00:34:26,726 --> 00:34:27,940
Come with me. Come on.

418
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,979
Let's go.

419
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,210
Here we are.

420
00:34:36,323 --> 00:34:37,823
Here.

421
00:34:40,831 --> 00:34:43,132
Come on.

422
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:54,239
Mr. You.

423
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,287
Relax.

424
00:34:55,287 --> 00:34:57,094
It's safe in my dad's office.

425
00:34:57,094 --> 00:34:59,136
Barely anyone comes here in the day.

426
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:01,709
But...

427
00:35:01,709 --> 00:35:04,409
Why did you come to our school?

428
00:35:05,659 --> 00:35:07,760
Shouldn't you be moved?

429
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,159
I came to your school under so much risk.

430
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:12,400
So why aren't you moved?

431
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,239
So… Mr. You,

432
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,228
why are you here?

433
00:35:19,228 --> 00:35:20,624
I…

434
00:35:25,259 --> 00:35:27,700
- Professor Yuchi.
- Dad.

435
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,144
I have something to do.

436
00:35:29,144 --> 00:35:30,400
The dean is asking for me.

437
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,509
Feel free to talk.

438
00:35:31,509 --> 00:35:33,148
Just talk.

439
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,920
The company wants to

440
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,451
hire a new assistant for me.

441
00:35:41,451 --> 00:35:43,016
Okay.

442
00:35:44,366 --> 00:35:46,276
That's it?

443
00:35:46,276 --> 00:35:48,431
You don't want to be my assistant?

444
00:35:48,431 --> 00:35:49,380
Mr. You,

445
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,943
you know that I want to be a teacher.

446
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:54,025
Besides,

447
00:35:54,025 --> 00:35:55,280
I have classes

448
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,030
and I don't have time.

449
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:18,580
Hello?

450
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:22,992
I heard that someone caused a scene in Jiangzhou University today.

451
00:36:23,972 --> 00:36:26,119
What's your point?

452
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:29,199
Your friend hasn't come to me in a while.

453
00:36:30,395 --> 00:36:31,960
Don't worry about it.

454
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,910
She said yes?

455
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:34,880
She left.

456
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,764
You don't want to ask her to stay?

457
00:36:37,376 --> 00:36:38,392
No.

458
00:36:38,392 --> 00:36:39,550
Fine.

459
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,559
What a pity.

460
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:43,421
I may have a solution for you.

461
00:36:44,127 --> 00:36:45,105
You…

462
00:36:45,105 --> 00:36:46,670
spit it out.

463
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:51,100
Outsiders can see clearly while insiders are too involved.

464
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,885
You keep coming on too strong,

465
00:36:52,885 --> 00:36:56,259
which will only make her more resistant.

466
00:36:56,259 --> 00:36:59,199
So, a third party needs to get involved.

467
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:02,387
A third party?

468
00:37:09,753 --> 00:37:11,179
Hey.

469
00:37:11,179 --> 00:37:12,639
Hey!

470
00:37:24,417 --> 00:37:26,039
Third Uncle.

471
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:28,812
How much longer do we have to wait?

472
00:37:28,812 --> 00:37:32,953
Why don't we go eat something? I saw a barbecue restaurant over there when we passed.

473
00:37:32,953 --> 00:37:35,700
It looks pretty good, Third Uncle.

474
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,956
Shut up!

475
00:37:36,956 --> 00:37:39,526
Fried rice cake is not enough for you?

476
00:37:39,526 --> 00:37:42,080
Do you remember what I just taught you?

477
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,420
I am a professional.

478
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,252
Don't worry.

479
00:37:47,414 --> 00:37:49,012
I will keep looking.

480
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,639
She's coming. She's coming.

481
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:01,593
Where?

482
00:38:01,593 --> 00:38:04,039
Let me see. Let me see.

483
00:38:09,779 --> 00:38:11,251
Come on.

484
00:38:19,036 --> 00:38:21,036
Are you ready?

485
00:38:22,597 --> 00:38:24,047
Go.

486
00:38:30,685 --> 00:38:32,187
Yaoyao!

487
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:35,845
Duo Duo, why are you here?

488
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:41,939
Give me a hug.

489
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:48,131
So clever.

490
00:38:48,131 --> 00:38:50,630
You will be the next queen in the movie industry.

491
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,520
You have to come back.

492
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,771
Without...

493
00:38:55,771 --> 00:38:57,482
you,

494
00:38:57,482 --> 00:38:59,767
I am so lonely...

495
00:39:00,855 --> 00:39:03,435
and so miserable...

496
00:39:03,435 --> 00:39:05,254
that I can't eat

497
00:39:05,254 --> 00:39:07,140
nor sleep well every day.

498
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:10,748
And I…

499
00:39:11,867 --> 00:39:13,027
And I…

500
00:39:13,027 --> 00:39:14,616
What's wrong, Duo Duo?

501
00:39:14,616 --> 00:39:17,239
My eyes are sore.

502
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:19,000
Let me see.

503
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,734
What's going on?

504
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,939
What is with your eye?

505
00:39:28,939 --> 00:39:31,188
What?

506
00:39:31,188 --> 00:39:32,877
There is a piece of pepper on it.

507
00:39:32,877 --> 00:39:35,476
A piece of pepper.

508
00:39:35,476 --> 00:39:39,258
A piece of pepper?

509
00:39:50,666 --> 00:39:51,960
Is this

510
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,510
clean?

511
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,760
Will I get diarrhea if I eat it?

512
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,568
That's all right, Mr. You.

513
00:39:56,568 --> 00:39:58,800
I used to eat this quite often.

514
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,093
Try it.

515
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:02,053
It is very good.

516
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:09,690
- Sir, two more roasted chicken wings.
- Coming.

517
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:12,000
How could you eat?

518
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,619
Third Uncle, this is not my fault.

519
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:18,267
If it is anyone's fault, it should be the fried rice cake's.

520
00:40:18,267 --> 00:40:22,136
The peppers and my saliva mixed together.

521
00:40:22,136 --> 00:40:24,134
My eyes were in pain.

522
00:40:24,134 --> 00:40:26,053
You should not have bought it for me in the first place.

523
00:40:26,053 --> 00:40:28,872
So who was the one crying about it?

524
00:40:30,751 --> 00:40:33,248
Third Uncle, so what should we do now?

525
00:40:33,248 --> 00:40:34,855
Nothing.

526
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,280
What should we do?

527
00:41:09,104 --> 00:41:14,681
♫  The world is so big,
yet a word of love from you makes me melt
 ♫

528
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:18,449
♫  Watching you decorate this little home,  ♫

529
00:41:18,449 --> 00:41:23,449
♫  the overflowing happiness can barely be contained  ♫

530
00:41:23,449 --> 00:41:26,215
♫  The noise of spring and autumn, the temperature difference between winter and summer  ♫

531
00:41:26,215 --> 00:41:28,675
♫  they've all become picturesque  ♫

532
00:41:28,675 --> 00:41:32,148
♫  Even if worries accompany sunsets,  ♫

533
00:41:32,148 --> 00:41:37,377
♫  is there any reasons not to cherish the moment?  ♫

534
00:41:37,377 --> 00:41:40,928
♫  I'll be with you when you cry  ♫

535
00:41:40,928 --> 00:41:44,574
♫  I'll pamper you so that you won't ruin your makeup  ♫

536
00:41:44,574 --> 00:41:48,183
♫  I will take you wherever you want to go  ♫

537
00:41:48,183 --> 00:41:50,012
♫  I will take you wherever you want to go  ♫

538
00:41:50,012 --> 00:41:53,083
♫  You are my girl  ♫

539
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:56,631
♫  I want you to be my goddess for the rest of my life  ♫

540
00:41:56,631 --> 00:42:00,175
♫  I'll gently light the lamp in the quiet of the night  ♫

541
00:42:00,175 --> 00:42:04,275
♫  I'll hold you in my arms and let you sleep soundly  ♫

542
00:42:04,275 --> 00:42:06,937
♫  I'm your man  ♫

543
00:42:06,937 --> 00:42:10,802
♫  I will take care of you with my all  ♫

544
00:42:10,802 --> 00:42:14,539
♫  I'll silently follow the perfect script in your heart  ♫

545
00:42:14,539 --> 00:42:18,192
♫  It's you who makes everything become possible and love to be flawless  ♫

546
00:42:18,192 --> 00:42:22,219
♫  It's you who makes everything become possible and love to be flawless  ♫
