Miss Pan Duo, this is the revised script.

00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,899
Today is the first day back to filming.

36
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:37,138
Your scenes might be tough. Good luck.

37
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,900
That's fine.

Pan Duo, hello again.

Who wants to see you? Get out.

I'm here to congratulate you on your return.

Where is You Xi?

Oh, I forgot.

43
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,739
He is not the lead anymore.

44
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:05,479
And even his waiting room is now Zhao Yiling's.

45

Could you ask him for me?

I'll show you something.

54
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,380
You took a sneak photo of me.

55
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,319
You were so happy over that ugly photo of me.

56

This is called payback in kindness.

What is your relationship with her?

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,638
Under this circumstance, it won't be a secret anymore.

65

I won't say it a second time.

66
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,179
No.

67

What are you going to do?

68
00:03:02,338 --> 00:03:07,239
Maybe your money transfer to the arranger last time might not be evidence enough.

69
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,880
But...

70
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,120
This is a recording of your assistant and the arranger.

How did you get it?

72
00:03:16,538 --> 00:03:17,818
As easy as pie.

73
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:20,820
Ask your assistant to be cautious next time.

74
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,038
Delete the photo. I'll let it go.

75

My idol, no. Don't worry about me.

Shut up!

00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:29,880
What? Don't you want it?

78
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,919
You can't trick me. It's definitely fake.

79
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:36,618
Since you're willing to wager on this, I won't mind.

85
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,498
I didn't realize I meant so much to you.

86
00:04:06,498 --> 00:04:09,838
I can't believe because of me, you gave her that important evidence.

87
00:04:09,838 --> 00:04:11,990
There's nothing in it.

88
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,019
My idol is really smart.

89
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:19,530
You tricked Shen Yiling with ease.

By the way, why are you here?

91
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:25,699
You had a hunch I was in danger.

92
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,778
So you came to save me, right?

93
00:04:27,778 --> 00:04:30,480
We do have chemistry indeed.

94
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,119
You left this in my car last time.

95
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,140
No wonder I couldn't find it.

96
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,958
Did you hide it deliberately to create a chance to see me?

97
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:47,840
My idol, you didn't have to go through so much trouble.

98
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,078
My idol, don't go.

99
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,499
Why don't you stay and watch me shoot the scene?

100
00:04:53,499 --> 00:04:55,658
I have bed scenes today.

Dear You Xi,

103
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,139
The most beautiful starlight can only be seen on the darkest night.

104
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:20,378
The most beautiful scenery can only be seen from afar.

105

The future is promising and wide

106
00:05:24,146 --> 00:05:26,800
rather than plain and noisy.

107
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,839
Go across the Milky Way and the moon

108
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:33,210
to meet a better self.

109
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,879
I'm always here for you.

00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,560
- Hello?
- Hey, You Xi.

111
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,418
I gave Xiao Qi a talking to.

112
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:44,459
Don't take this too seriously.

113
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:46,019
What are you talking about?

114
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:47,840
Those letters of your anti-fans.

115
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,159
What was up with Xiao Qi?

116
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,499
Why send those to your house?

117
00:05:50,499 --> 00:05:54,139
If you get those letters, don't take them seriously.

118
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:58,299
They are just jealous of you. That's all.

119
00:05:58,299 --> 00:06:01,059
Because of this, I scolded Xiao Qi.

120
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:02,899
There's nothing to worry about.

121
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:04,858
Don't worry, really.

Isn't it enough to be in so many bad movies?

Acting doesn't suit you.

126
00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:29,438
Get out of show business quickly.

127

You don't care about the quality of the work.

128
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,530
You're only after money.

129
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,318
Boycott the king of bad movies.

130
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,340
Get out of show business.

131

Have you noticed that all the magazines have Wen Moxuan on the cover this month?

136
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:20,579
Yes, that's true. Look.

Think about it. How many mistakes have you made?

Such an easy line.

You still call yourself an actor?

There's nothing you or I can do for him.

00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:35,479
- It looks terrible. Don't.
- No. No. No.

332
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,560
It tastes... good.

333
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,459
Really?

334
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:55,019
Hold on.

335
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,399
You made it for me.

336
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,240
Only I can eat it.

337
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:02,279
Help yourself.

338
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:12,897
My girlfriend made me such delicious food.

339
00:23:12,898 --> 00:23:15,200
Then I'll cook for you every day.

340
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,400
Tomorrow…

341
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,079
Let's discuss it later.

342
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,479
I have no classes tomorrow.

343
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,938
Let's think about where to go.

344
00:23:31,938 --> 00:23:33,078
How about fishing?

345
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,960
Fishing?

346
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,519
Boring.

347
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,318
Can you think of something exciting?

348
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,558
Like what?

349
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:42,660
Such as bungee jumping,

350
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,800
underwater diving, or skateboarding.

351
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:53,119
Mr. You.

352
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,999
I… I don't know how to skateboard.

353
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,400
Let's do something else.

354
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,958
Mr. You, please. Put me down.

355
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,399
I've done a few rounds already.

356
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,079
You haven't moved at all.

357
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,358
Mr. You, I don't want to do this.

358
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:11,719
Help me down.

359
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,160
Okay. Then that'll be it for the warm-up.

360
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,416
Next, let's get to the real deal for today.

361
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,799
W-What are we going to do?

362
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,280
Bungee jumping.

363
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,039
Underwater diving.

364
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,770
And ghost adventure.

365
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,640
Let's go, Yuchi Yaoyao.

366
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,199
What? Come on, you're the lead actress.

367
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,479
But you are working so hard.

368
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,759
I'm not like you.

369
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:49,038
You Xi has been shelved.

370
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,921
You have nothing to worry about.

371
00:24:50,921 --> 00:24:54,278
As for me, I still have an opponent to handle.

372
00:24:54,278 --> 00:24:56,359
You mean...

373
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
Pan Duo.

374
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:04,699
As far as I know, she auditioned for Lady Xumu, the second female lead.

375
00:25:04,699 --> 00:25:06,880
She is not a threat to you.

376
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,798
In my first movie,

377
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,039
I also auditioned for the second female lead.

378
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:13,679
But you know what?

379
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,860
I got the leading role in the end.

380
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,318
Letting your guard down is to give others chances.

381
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:22,519
I won't let such a thing happen.

382
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:27,698
Also, I want revenge for what she did to me.

383
00:25:50,981 --> 00:25:53,038
What do you think? Were you happy today?

384
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,859
Yes.

385
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:56,540
But next time we go out,

386
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,319
can we buy insurance first?

387
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:00,279
What are you saying?

388
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:03,078
With me, nothing will happen to you.

389
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:07,319
I'll go cut up some fruits. And you can turn on the TV.

390
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:10,480
Let's watch a show while eating fruits.

391
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,800
Sounds great, right?

392
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,960
Good.

393
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,539
Awesome! Awesome!

394
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,439
The preparation work for Director Wei Ran's new film

395
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,639
is in full swing, catching the attention of many.

396
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,199
Who will be the leading actor and actress?

397
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,358
Please wait for…

398
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,518
Wait a second!

399
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:31,441
I'll be ready in a minute.

400
00:26:31,441 --> 00:26:32,900
Okay.

401
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:48,298
You Xi, I have guests today.

402
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:50,799
Let's skip the class for today.

403
00:26:53,541 --> 00:26:56,359
- I see.
- You see what?

404
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,318
Is he here to see you again?

405
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,679
Who are you talking about?

406
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,518
I really have something to do.

407
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:03,860
Step aside.

408
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,559
I'm really in the middle of something. Trust me.

409
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,919
I told him that I'll beat him every time I see him.

410
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,078
How dare he come here again?

411
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:15,060
- Are you stupid? You…
- You son of a... You…

412
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,120
Director Wei Ran.

413
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:26,940
Go on.

414
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,700
Goodbye, Director.

415
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:31,739
- Close the door.
- Okay.

416
00:27:31,739 --> 00:27:33,380
Brat!

417
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,018
Is he your student?

418
00:27:41,018 --> 00:27:42,580
Yes.

419
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:46,518
He sure does have the looks.

420
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:49,780
But his acting is also good. He is sensitive, as well.

421
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,399
Have you found the lead actor for "Zhongfu"?

422
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,759
You can give him a shot.

423
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,800
Tell me. Why did you want to see me?

424
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,758
Just to catch up with you.

425
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:19,678
After all, when I was in Shengguo Entertainment, you always looked after me.

426
00:28:19,678 --> 00:28:22,699
Don't get me wrong, but I looked after you

427
00:28:22,699 --> 00:28:25,359
because I was an artist agent.

428
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,818
And you were a signed actor of Shengguo Entertainment.

429
00:28:28,818 --> 00:28:30,999
So stop playing the emotion card.

430
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,839
Get straight to the point.

431
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:34,759
What a sharp tongue.

432
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:38,359
Worthy of the nickname, the golden agent of Shengguo Entertainment.

433
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:41,159
Or should I say,

434
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,160
the former golden agent.

435
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,360
What are you implying?

436
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,860
Brother Morry, You Xi and I were signed actors of Shengguo Entertainment.

437
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:56,180
But I respect you very much.

438
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:59,039
If we two can work together…

439
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,160
Got it.

440
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,959
You want me to work for Time Entertainment

441
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,880
and to help you, right?

442
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:14,839
Everyone has the right to choose their own path.

443
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:18,159
But You Xi's career is ruined.

444
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,880
You don't have to go through this with him.

445
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,199
What's funny?

446
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,200
What's funny, you ask?

447
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,459
Song Qiege, I'm not a greedy and shameless guy

448
00:29:31,459 --> 00:29:35,039
you might think I am.

449
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,278
Now is the time when You Xi needs my help and support the most.

450
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,640
You are asking me to betray him.

451
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,239
What makes you think I'll do that?

452
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,459
Brother Morry, you need to know.

453
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,509
It is You Xi who caused this situation.

454
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,779
Did You Xi think about you when he announced his relationship?

455
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,340
You don't have to think about him all the time.

456
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,160
With all the talk today,

457
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:07,019
Song Qiege, you must be very jealous of You Xi.

458
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:10,739
Am I right?

459
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:17,798
That's right. I know that

460
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:23,159
I am a considerate, smart, and talented agent, which is hard to find.

461
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,345
But working together also depends on the bond.

462
00:30:26,346 --> 00:30:31,799
I am not an extraordinary man by any means.

463
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:36,062
But… I have nothing to hide.

464
00:30:36,062 --> 00:30:40,720
I can't do anything at the expense of others.

465
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,146
I particularly don't do well with snobs,

466
00:30:47,146 --> 00:30:50,559
because we don't match.

467
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,680
Do you know why you can't beat You Xi all the time?

468
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,359
The reason is simple.

469
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:57,838
You Xi has feelings.

470
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:00,238
He laughs and cries.

471
00:31:00,238 --> 00:31:01,519
He's sincere.

472
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,680
He'll do anything for the people and things he loves,

473
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:10,319
while you have always been...

474
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,939
a cold commodity.

475
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:23,698
And you will always be a commodity.

476
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,799
It was good.

477
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,020
Thanks for the coffee.

478
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,657
I'll get going.

479
00:31:37,173 --> 00:31:38,640
Also,

480
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,660
I prefer to be called Brother Dazhuang.

481
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,440
[You Xi's Script]

482
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,518
Mr. You, what are you doing?

483
00:32:01,518 --> 00:32:06,159
My mentor said that I should study up on the roles I've played and find some shortcomings.

484
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,999
That way, I can find a breakthrough.

485
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:11,039
Sounds reasonable.

486
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,699
What did you get out of it?

487
00:32:12,699 --> 00:32:15,193
Of course, why don't you take a look?

488
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:18,499
Sorry.

489
00:32:20,013 --> 00:32:21,933
I'm a policeman.

490
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,580
My role was a policeman.

491
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,779
I found out that he was undercover.

492
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:30,580
He tried to intervene but I stood firm and stuck to justice.

493
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:35,580
But I think acting like this was wrong.

494
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:38,119
It should be…

495
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:49,600
Sorry.

496
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,480
I'm a policeman.

497
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,939
How was my acting?

498
00:32:58,939 --> 00:33:01,519
Better than his.

499
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,879
- Next one.
- Okay.

500
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,734
Let's try this one.

501
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,599
This is it.

502
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:17,240
I discovered that the person who killed my father was someone I loved.

503
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,380
There should be agony, guilt, and self-reproach when killing her.

504
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,340
Look.

505
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,039
The way I was acting was so immature.

506
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,700
It's totally wrong.

507
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,243
Watch this.

508
00:33:34,886 --> 00:33:36,233
Work with me.

509
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:50,276
I love you.

510
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,666
But… it's too late.

511
00:34:03,098 --> 00:34:05,439
What do you think?

512
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:07,659
- Anything else?
- Let's see the next one.

513
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,440
For this one…

514
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:39,519
the girl I like misunderstood my relationships with other female friends.

515
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:43,979
I needed to kiss her to make her stay.

516
00:34:43,979 --> 00:34:47,500
But I was being too rude.

517
00:34:48,572 --> 00:34:49,972
It should have been...

518
00:34:53,705 --> 00:34:55,126
like this.

519
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:35,680
I-I'll get the door.

520
00:35:40,186 --> 00:35:43,166
Third Uncle, I've been blacklisted.

521
00:35:46,325 --> 00:35:48,006
Yaoyao.

522
00:35:52,006 --> 00:35:53,980
Third Uncle, tell me.

523
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,044
Is my acting that bad?

524
00:35:56,045 --> 00:35:59,286
They scolded me instead of Zheng Jia.

525
00:36:00,171 --> 00:36:02,678
I thought it was a big deal.

526
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:05,080
Listen. This will happen every day.

527
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,039
If you can't take it,

528
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,380
just go home early and sell barbecue.

529
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,118
You're a public figure.

530
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,300
Some people like you and some people hate you.

531
00:36:13,301 --> 00:36:16,440
The internet just amplifies the voices.

532
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,484
Don't take it seriously.

533
00:36:20,484 --> 00:36:22,218
- But…
- All right.

534
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,479
That's all for today's therapy.

535
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,399
Go home and sleep.

536
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,678
Forget everything.

537
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:30,439
We're going to watch a movie. Bye.

538
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,140
- A movie? I'll join as well.
- No.

539
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,379
Yaoyao.

540
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,620
With all that happened to me,

541
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:42,660
are you going to leave me alone?

542
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,437
Okay. We'll watch the movie together.

543
00:36:48,437 --> 00:36:51,184
- You…
- Yaoyao, you are the best.

544
00:36:51,184 --> 00:36:52,776
What movie are we going to watch later?

545
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:53,716
What do you like?

546
00:36:53,717 --> 00:36:55,399
That one with superheroes.

547
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,938
Do you like it?

548
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,238
It's all right.

549
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:03,650
- Then, how about… a romantic movie?
- Duo Duo?

550
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,858
- There are some emotional scenes in romantic movies.
- Duo Duo.

551
00:37:05,858 --> 00:37:08,471
- Or how about historical movies.
- Brother Chao.

552
00:37:08,471 --> 00:37:11,119
Brother Chao? Brother Chao?

553
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,139
He loves being a listening ear.

554
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:17,519
If you go to him now, he won't say no to you.

555
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:20,220
And he also knows how to act.

556
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,038
You can practice with him.

557
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:26,179
Practice things like kissing scenes

558
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:28,540
or bed scenes.

559
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:53,311
My idol, I need comfort.

560
00:38:13,486 --> 00:38:15,007
I don't want any.

561
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:40,101
My idol.

562
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:47,259
Is my acting good or Zheng Jia's?

563
00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:50,319
- I never saw your acting.
- You haven't?

564
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,139
It's okay.

565
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:55,419
I'll show you.

566
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:59,039
Like a scene where a girl is proposed to.

567
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,259
I was like…

568
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,519
"I do.

569
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:10,619
Do you know how long I've been waiting for this moment?

570
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:14,260
I do. I do. I do."

571
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,805
She was like…

572
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,380
"Baby."

573
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:25,638
"Honey. Dear.

574
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:28,379
I do."

575
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,518
My idol, tell me.

576
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:32,660
Who is better?

577
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:34,138
You…

578
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:35,939
See?

579
00:39:35,939 --> 00:39:37,439
My acting is better.

580
00:39:37,439 --> 00:39:38,826
They all called me names.

581
00:39:38,826 --> 00:39:40,940
I mean...

582
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,800
Are you done?

583
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,611
I am.

584
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:50,220
Let's move on to the next step now.

585
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,220
Next step?

586
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,179
My idol, practice with me.

587
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,579
There is a kissing scene.

588
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:13,499
I can't do it right.

589
00:40:18,496 --> 00:40:20,260
This one.

590
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:23,339
My idol, can you teach me?

591
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:30,405
I haven't acted in a long time.

592
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:36,879
Why? My idol.

593
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,400
You are a movie king.

594
00:40:38,401 --> 00:40:41,100
I didn't want to steal your third uncle's place.

595
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,718
That's right.

596
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:46,820
My idol, if you were in a popular drama,

597
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,220
there would be nothing to do with my third uncle.

598
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,444
At that time, you would be the leading actress

599
00:40:52,445 --> 00:40:54,238
and I would be the leading actor.

600
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:58,479
The two of us working together would be perfect.

601
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,352
Get up.

602
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:08,120
My idol, I missed your bed so much.

603
00:41:58,544 --> 00:42:04,120
♫  The world is so big,
yet a word of love from you makes me melt  ♫

604
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:07,788
♫  Watching you decorate this little home,  ♫

605
00:42:07,789 --> 00:42:12,734
♫  the overflowing happiness can barely be contained  ♫

606
00:42:12,735 --> 00:42:15,907
♫  The noise of spring and autumn, the temperature difference between winter and summer  ♫

607
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,214
♫  they've all become picturesque  ♫

608
00:42:18,215 --> 00:42:21,566
♫  Even if worries accompany sunsets,  ♫

609
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:26,816
♫  is there any reasons not to cherish the moment?  ♫

610
00:42:26,817 --> 00:42:30,367
♫  I'll be with you when you cry  ♫

611
00:42:30,368 --> 00:42:33,913
♫  I'll pamper you so that you won't ruin your makeup  ♫

612
00:42:33,914 --> 00:42:39,447
♫  I will take you wherever you want to go  ♫

613
00:42:39,447 --> 00:42:42,294
♫  You are my girl  ♫

614
00:42:42,294 --> 00:42:45,934
♫  I want you to be my goddess for the rest of my life  ♫

615
00:42:45,934 --> 00:42:49,614
♫  I'll gently light the lamp in the quiet of the night  ♫

616
00:42:49,615 --> 00:42:53,715
♫  I'll hold you in my arms and let you sleep soundly  ♫

617
00:42:53,715 --> 00:42:56,464
♫  I'm your man  ♫

618
00:42:56,464 --> 00:43:00,042
♫  I will take care of you with my all  ♫

619
00:43:00,042 --> 00:43:04,025
♫  I'll silently follow the perfect script in your heart  ♫

620
00:43:04,025 --> 00:43:11,355
♫  It's you who makes everything become possible
and love to be flawless  ♫
