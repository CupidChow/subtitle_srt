[EPISODE 9]

34
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:31,616
Please wait.

35
00:01:34,722 --> 00:01:36,620
We're through.

36
00:01:39,191 --> 00:01:42,312
Zheng Jia'er is such a bad actress.

37
00:01:42,313 --> 00:01:46,298
Uncle, you're wasting your talents by cooperating with her.

38
00:01:46,298 --> 00:01:49,221
Stop. We are colleagues.

39
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:51,040
Show some mercy.

40
00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:55,091
Mr. You did a good job portraying a character

41
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:58,700
who got rejected by his crushes frequently.

42
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:04,500
Mr. You showed deep emotions in this scene. It's very moving.

43
00:02:05,548 --> 00:02:07,780
He demonstrated how much experience he has.

44
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,392
Mosquito. Mosquito.

45
00:02:19,392 --> 00:02:22,987
Third Uncle, don't send it this way.

46
00:02:22,987 --> 00:02:26,299
- Just let it suck your blood.
- Let it bite you!

47
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:28,075
So what if I fan it towards you?

48
00:02:28,075 --> 00:02:30,417
- Get bit. Get bit. Get bit.
- I'll fan it to you!

49
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,151
Use the fan on yourself.

50
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:34,870
I am exhausted. Can I go home now?

51
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,480
- Don't leave!
- Don't leave!

52
00:02:38,497 --> 00:02:41,324
My idol, I'll be appearing soon. Just wait for a few more seconds.

53
00:02:41,325 --> 00:02:45,434
Why would I want to see you appear as a village girl?

54
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:49,320
I will save the damsel in distress and become a hero. Just watch me.

55
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,102
Your acting was cliche and too old school!

56
00:02:53,102 --> 00:02:57,600
Doesn't even compare the lady waiting for her prince to rescue her.

57
00:02:59,283 --> 00:03:02,780
My idol, prepare to be amazed!

58
00:03:06,335 --> 00:03:14,520
- Watch me.
- Watch me.

59
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,900
Why is there another blackout?

60
00:03:23,435 --> 00:03:25,495
Two eggs, please.

61
00:03:25,495 --> 00:03:27,109
Thanks.

62
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,825
Two sesame seed balls.

63
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:33,399
- I want a steamed stuffed bun.
- And a steamed stuffed bun.

64
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:37,179
How many more fans did we get after the premiere yesterday?

65
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,046
Today, all the online reviews praised your acting skills.

66
00:03:41,047 --> 00:03:43,330
There are 50,000 more fans on your Weibo account.

67
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:46,990
50,000 more fans make you this happy?

68
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:51,464
As my assistant, you should get used to these tiny changes.

69
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,560
Third Uncle!

70
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,345
I have more followers on my Weibo.

71
00:03:57,345 --> 00:03:59,760
Can you start acting like an actor?

72
00:04:00,604 --> 00:04:02,632
So, how many thousands is it?

73
00:04:02,632 --> 00:04:06,134
Third Uncle, you should ask me how many tens of thousands?

74
00:04:06,134 --> 00:04:07,871
Tens of thousands?

75
00:04:09,194 --> 00:04:10,982
20,000?

76
00:04:10,982 --> 00:04:14,074
You still have a long way to go.

77
00:04:14,074 --> 00:04:17,480
Third Uncle, it is not 20,000

78
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,353
but 200,000.

79
00:04:21,604 --> 00:04:23,380
200,000?

80
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,160
I will send a WeChat to my idol.

81
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:33,668
She has 200,000 followers.

82
00:04:33,668 --> 00:04:37,180
Why does Pandora have so many followers?

83
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,866
Duo Duo is beautiful and good at acting.

84
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:41,503
It is only right that she has more and more followers.

85
00:04:41,504 --> 00:04:43,683
Why does she have four times more followers than me?

86
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,206
Duo Duo is a newcomer.

87
00:04:45,207 --> 00:04:46,636
She only had a few followers before,

88
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:48,644
leaving her more space to gain more followers.

89
00:04:48,645 --> 00:04:52,419
But, Mr. You, you have been in this business for much longer.

90
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:55,195
So your follower capacity is already full.

91
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,286
You will gain followers at a slower rate than her.

92
00:04:57,286 --> 00:04:59,360
It is normal.

93
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,895
You know how to comfort people.

94
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:04,820
Aren't you Duo Duo's third uncle?

95
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,801
You should be happy for her.

96
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:10,280
I'm not her real uncle.

97
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,554
Hello.

98
00:05:18,555 --> 00:05:21,648
My king, your new drama is a hit.

99
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:25,153
A number of companies called this morning hoping to collaborate with you.

100
00:05:25,154 --> 00:05:28,659
You can choose any endorsement you want. You're at the advantage.

101
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:32,481
Brother Morry, twelve more calls came asking if they could work with us.

102
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:35,442
There's no need to rush. Just tell them to wait.

103
00:05:35,442 --> 00:05:38,298
They shouldn't have left us in the first place.

104
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:40,621
Okay.

105
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,900
Sorry, I am late.

106
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,232
Song… Qiege?

107
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:58,385
Mr. Yin Jin, you are indeed quite handsome.

108
00:05:58,386 --> 00:06:01,340
No wonder you are the legend of the History Department at your university.

109
00:06:03,724 --> 00:06:05,645
I am flattered.

110
00:06:09,473 --> 00:06:11,569
Let's cut to the chase and talk business.

111
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:16,055
I have read through the cultural analysis and character explanation you gave me last time.

112
00:06:16,055 --> 00:06:17,960
I have learned a lot.

113
00:06:22,946 --> 00:06:28,242
Actually… I have a personal favor to ask...

114
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:29,398
What?

115
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:32,240
I hope that you win against You Xi.

116
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:36,642
Liu Bei is such a bastard.

117
00:06:36,642 --> 00:06:40,159
How can he forget the fact that Lü Bu helped him?

118
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,369
You Xi?

119
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,840
How could he betray him like that?

120
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,243
Bastard. Bastard.

121
00:06:46,243 --> 00:06:48,066
Mr. You?

122
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:54,107
How did someone like Liu Bei have so many followers who supported his rise to power?

123
00:06:54,107 --> 00:06:57,760
You Xi, long time no see.

124
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,640
I see that you are still so childish.

125
00:07:08,568 --> 00:07:10,393
Bastard and a scumbag.

126
00:07:10,394 --> 00:07:11,594
You…

127
00:07:11,594 --> 00:07:13,235
Why are you two here together?

128
00:07:13,235 --> 00:07:15,623
You stole my mentor

129
00:07:15,623 --> 00:07:17,237
so I had to find someone else.

130
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:18,590
That's right.

131
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,540
I'll also get the lead role in "Zhongfu."

132
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,939
Not a chance. I will definitely get the part.

133
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:29,701
You Xi will play the lead in "Zhongfu" under Director Yu Ran as Guan Zhong.

134
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:32,080
It will be official soon.

135
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,936
How is that possible?

136
00:07:36,513 --> 00:07:38,740
They are dreaming.

137
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,791
Yeah. That's right.

138
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:45,600
In a month, this will be in the news.

139
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:51,703
You Xi, I won't continue standing here to argue with you.

140
00:07:51,703 --> 00:07:54,360
Let's just see who wins in the end.

141
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,318
Hey, don't go.

142
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:02,218
With your attitude, you…

143
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:14,104
According to the news, Director Yu Ran cast Song Qiege to be the male lead.

144
00:08:14,104 --> 00:08:16,263
What? Show me.

145
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:17,903
That will be the news in two months

146
00:08:17,904 --> 00:08:20,800
if you don't take it seriously.

147
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:24,049
Don't be angry, Mr. You.

148
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,591
After a month, you'll get the part of Guan Zhong.

149
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,079
Mr. You, I promise you.

150
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,005
A month later, you will play Guan Zhong.

151
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:34,291
Guaranteed! Definitely!

152
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,058
Don't worry about me. Really.

153
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,894
I eat and sleep well.

154
00:08:38,895 --> 00:08:42,303
Everyone takes care of me. Just relax.

155
00:08:42,778 --> 00:08:44,360
Brother You Xi.

156
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,529
Sister, did you see my three-point shot?

157
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:52,040
- Sister?
- I will show you my new clothes.

158
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:55,541
Hang on, I'll be back.

159
00:09:08,104 --> 00:09:12,125
Hey! Yuchi Mumu, come out.

160
00:09:18,002 --> 00:09:19,596
Sisters!

161
00:09:19,596 --> 00:09:22,188
You Xi is video-chatting with me.

162
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:25,318
You Xi, you are so handsome.

163
00:09:25,318 --> 00:09:27,727
I've been your fan for a long time.

164
00:09:30,722 --> 00:09:32,205
You…

165
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:33,717
I…

166
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,022
Brother You Xi, she is my twin sister.

167
00:09:37,022 --> 00:09:39,332
She likes you very much and has always wanted to video chat with you.

168
00:09:39,332 --> 00:09:41,931
She even dreams of marrying you someday.

169
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:50,740
Say thank you to her for me.

170
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,445
Sister, Brother You Xi says thank you.

171
00:09:57,737 --> 00:10:00,874
Students, class is dismissed.

172
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:10,344
Third Uncle, the class is over. Why are you still reading?

173
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:11,726
You don't even understand it anyway.

174
00:10:11,727 --> 00:10:13,940
Why don't we take a stroll to the store?

175
00:10:14,438 --> 00:10:17,493
You go. Leave me alone.

176
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,520
Then I will ask Wen Moxuan.

177
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:31,445
You Xi, can you understand this?

178
00:10:31,445 --> 00:10:33,959
Do you know why Zhuge Liang killed Ma Su?

179
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,840
Do you know why Cao Cao sent his army to encircle Xu State?

180
00:10:37,907 --> 00:10:40,620
Stop wasting your efforts.

181
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,700
You are the last person who Yaoyao will ever like.

182
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,420
You know she despises illiterate people like you.

183
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:51,592
You scumbag. Stop trying to provoke me.

184
00:10:53,314 --> 00:10:55,092
Just ask yourself this…

185
00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:58,234
Do you and Yaoyao have anything in common?

186
00:10:58,235 --> 00:11:00,641
Do you understand the books she enjoys reading?

187
00:11:00,642 --> 00:11:03,780
Can you respond to her using poems she wrote?

188
00:11:09,907 --> 00:11:16,611
I heard Wen Moxuan ask Yaoyao to help him study in the library again.

189
00:11:16,611 --> 00:11:22,626
You know there are more things to do there besides studying.

190
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,724
By the way, thanks, Sister Yaoyao.

191
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,691
She was on the phone with me for three hours straight last night.

192
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,200
Thanks for being so caring and encouraging.

193
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:52,596
Hello?

194
00:11:56,228 --> 00:11:58,409
Is she that happy with chatting?

195
00:11:58,409 --> 00:11:59,508
All right.

196
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:01,180
I will not tolerate this.

197
00:12:07,604 --> 00:12:10,026
Here are your milk teas.

198
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,475
Thank you.

199
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:15,720
Two cups of milk tea?

200
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,380
- Is Wen Moxuan really inside?
- He is.

201
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,740
I just saw him go in.

202
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,803
- Keep up.
- Good. Let's go.

203
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,617
- Little Wood!
- Mr. You?

204
00:12:35,618 --> 00:12:38,100
I will not allow you to go on a date with Wen Moxuan.

205
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,120
Me going on a date with Wen Moxuan?

206
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,539
What are you talking about?

207
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,020
I saw everything.

208
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,300
Who did you buy this milk tea for?

209
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,414
- This is for—
- Yaoyao, why aren't you coming inside?

210
00:12:50,414 --> 00:12:52,274
Everyone is there but you.

211
00:12:52,274 --> 00:12:55,888
- This is for me, right? Thank you.
- I got it. I'll be right there.

212
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:58,448
- Okay. I will go inside then.
- Okay.

213
00:13:00,716 --> 00:13:04,995
So you… are not going on a date with Wen Moxuan?

214
00:13:04,995 --> 00:13:07,660
We are preparing for a cultural exhibition in the school.

215
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,509
But why are you here?

216
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:13,173
I just had lunch...

217
00:13:14,766 --> 00:13:16,520
and wanted to walk.

218
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,593
[Notice - Opening Hours between 7:00 - 10:00.
Vehicles and pets prohibited.]

219
00:13:24,594 --> 00:13:26,852
It turned out to be a false alarm.

220
00:13:26,852 --> 00:13:29,124
But it can't be like this forever.

221
00:13:29,828 --> 00:13:33,139
We have to quickly make her understand my friend's feelings for her.

222
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:36,626
Brother Chao, what do you think?

223
00:13:36,626 --> 00:13:39,695
The first one is the direct method and the other's more subtle.

224
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:44,589
I am afraid my friend can't take the direct way.

225
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,441
So subtle it is.

226
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:48,260
Try to make subtle hints.

227
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:51,290
Hints?

228
00:13:52,947 --> 00:13:56,180
- The food looks delicious.
- It really does.

229
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:01,273
Let's eat.

230
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,103
No.

231
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:16,495
This won't work on her dumb mind at all.

232
00:14:16,495 --> 00:14:18,480
It has to be more effective.

233
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:22,912
Then… try to stimulate her emotions.

234
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:26,777
- How?
- Get her to be jealous.

235
00:14:30,994 --> 00:14:33,544
Really, Mr. You? You are so funny.

236
00:14:33,545 --> 00:14:34,824
How was the singing yesterday?

237
00:14:34,825 --> 00:14:38,281
Did I sing very well?

238
00:14:38,281 --> 00:14:39,247
Mr. You,

239
00:14:39,248 --> 00:14:41,653
- Say, I'm here.
- I am so lucky to act with you.

240
00:14:41,654 --> 00:14:43,631
- Can't you see the seat I saved for you?
- That's right.

241
00:14:43,631 --> 00:14:45,240
I'm so excited.

242
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,466
- What are you looking at?
- Let's eat.

243
00:14:46,466 --> 00:14:50,138
There's no room here. Find your own seat.

244
00:14:50,138 --> 00:14:52,040
Okay, Mr. You.

245
00:14:53,784 --> 00:14:57,339
- This is so delicious.
- Mr. You, this tastes good.

246
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:01,484
Mr. You, this tofu is good.

247
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:03,421
This, too.

248
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,350
You have a try. And this.

249
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,346
Fine.

250
00:15:08,346 --> 00:15:11,985
No. This will be useless on her.

251
00:15:11,985 --> 00:15:16,479
Brother Chao, is there anything more effective?

252
00:15:18,842 --> 00:15:23,720
- Then we have to use the ultimate method.
- What?

253
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,581
Have your friend confess his feelings.

254
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:29,737
Confess… Confess his feelings?

255
00:15:29,737 --> 00:15:32,905
That… That's not possible.

256
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:37,630
Someone has to take the first step on the road of love.

257
00:15:37,631 --> 00:15:40,530
The girl shows no feeling towards your friend.

258
00:15:40,531 --> 00:15:44,340
So your friend has to take the initiative.

259
00:15:46,505 --> 00:15:50,249
Confess… Confess his feelings?

260
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,874
- You two again? Stop running!
- Go! Go!

261
00:15:55,874 --> 00:15:57,854
You bastards!

262
00:15:57,854 --> 00:16:00,526
Stop running!

263
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:02,798
Stop running.

264
00:16:02,798 --> 00:16:04,229
I finally caught you.

265
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,818
Let's go to the security room.

266
00:16:09,099 --> 00:16:11,544
What are you looking at? This isn't my fault.

267
00:16:11,544 --> 00:16:14,008
- Move it!
- Go.

268
00:16:23,196 --> 00:16:25,086
Is this your first time here?

269
00:16:35,218 --> 00:16:38,199
Mr. Security, they know that they made a mistake.

270
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:40,405
- Please forgive them.
- No.

271
00:16:40,406 --> 00:16:44,760
There's no exception to this rule. Doesn't matter who tries to help them.

272
00:16:45,718 --> 00:16:48,788
- Uncle Security.
- We don't deserve forgiveness.

273
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:51,779
What we did was just too evil.

274
00:16:52,546 --> 00:16:54,529
We accept any punishment.

275
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:56,079
This student is quite cooperative.

276
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,754
All right. Come and sign this.

277
00:16:58,754 --> 00:17:01,425
Okay. Let's go.

278
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,240
Hurry up.

279
00:17:16,822 --> 00:17:19,799
- I will write for him.
- Yeah, yeah.

280
00:17:24,132 --> 00:17:25,932
Okay.

281
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,860
You are Yin Jiu?

282
00:17:34,836 --> 00:17:36,600
Yes.

283
00:17:38,664 --> 00:17:40,663
And you are Tong Jin?

284
00:17:44,512 --> 00:17:48,674
My mother… always wanted a daughter.

285
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,384
Uncle Security, I...

286
00:17:53,385 --> 00:17:55,953
Thank you. Thank you for your hard work, Uncle.

287
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:02,298
Brother Chao.

288
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:05,434
I mean… Yin Jiu.

289
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,060
Why are you looking at me like that?

290
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,600
I didn't say your name.

291
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,079
Isn't this wrong?

292
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:17,642
What's wrong with it?

293
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:20,000
I wanted to teach him a lesson.

294
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,425
I said I would avenge you.

295
00:18:21,426 --> 00:18:23,610
I've got to keep my word.

296
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,251
Let's go.

297
00:18:29,597 --> 00:18:31,735
- Chun Hua.
- Mother.

298
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,318
You must take good care of yourself.

299
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,601
Eat three meals and don't have instant noodles.

300
00:18:36,602 --> 00:18:40,221
Mother, don't worry about me. I'm doing fine.

301
00:18:40,221 --> 00:18:43,117
I'm busy. I'll talk to you later.

302
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,150
Do you have something to say?

303
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,741
I…

304
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:03,440
I want to report them for giving you false names.

305
00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:07,599
Okay.

306
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,540
So, Tong Jin and Yin Jiu are not their real names?

307
00:19:17,947 --> 00:19:21,399
Tell me. What's going on between you and Yaoyao?

308
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,362
- I…
- "Yuchi Yaoyao, undergraduate history major, 2017.

309
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:28,725
And Yin Jiu, postgraduate history major, 2015.

310
00:19:28,726 --> 00:19:31,256
They have been caught fooling around

311
00:19:31,256 --> 00:19:32,952
in the playground multiple times by security guards

312
00:19:32,953 --> 00:19:35,135
and thus were shamed on campus."

313
00:19:35,135 --> 00:19:38,447
I asked my father to give you a teaching assistant position because you lack experience.

314
00:19:38,447 --> 00:19:39,922
And you pay me back by getting back with your ex?

315
00:19:39,922 --> 00:19:42,025
A'Jin, I have no idea what you're talking about.

316
00:19:42,026 --> 00:19:45,540
I swear that I didn't go to the playground with her.

317
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:50,240
Baby, you have to trust me.

318
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,556
Like hell I will.

319
00:19:55,642 --> 00:19:58,380
I really didn't do this.

320
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,846
Please listen to me. I didn't go to the playground.

321
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:05,132
A'Jin, I really didn't do it.

322
00:20:05,132 --> 00:20:07,430
Please hear me out.

323
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:10,793
Bravo.

324
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:14,238
Why didn't I know that you were a genius?

325
00:20:14,238 --> 00:20:19,107
Mr. You, I wanted to change Yin Jiu's name to mine.

326
00:20:19,107 --> 00:20:23,689
But somehow, the guard mistook my name for Tong Jin.

327
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,479
I will take it for you.

328
00:20:34,046 --> 00:20:36,639
Mr. You, my father wants to see me. I have to go.

329
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:38,439
Okay.

330
00:20:45,342 --> 00:20:49,384
Dad, you wanted to see me?

331
00:20:49,384 --> 00:20:52,760
I read the notice.

332
00:20:55,983 --> 00:20:57,681
My daughter is all grown up.

333
00:20:57,681 --> 00:20:59,220
Dad.

334
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,480
It's normal for two lovers to want to spend time together.

335
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:06,798
Dad, it's not what you think it is.

336
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,506
Don't be shy.

337
00:21:09,506 --> 00:21:12,120
Your father is not an old-fashioned man.

338
00:21:12,743 --> 00:21:14,720
When I was dating...

339
00:21:15,751 --> 00:21:20,600
your mother, we never wanted to be separated.

340
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,197
After the evening study, I escorted your mother to her dormitory.

341
00:21:24,197 --> 00:21:26,360
- On the way—
- Dad!

342
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,340
Miss Yuchi, I am from the Home-Loving Renovation company.

343
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,759
I wanted to inform you that the renovation is done at your house,

344
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,635
so you can come back at any time.

345
00:21:39,635 --> 00:21:41,240
Okay. Thank you.

346
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,800

Hey, student!

Sorry, kid. There's an activity going on inside, so no one's allowed in.

But I have an appointment at 2:00 p.m.

Hey, Bro. Are you done with the light?

407
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,591
If so, you need to give it back.

408
00:28:15,591 --> 00:28:17,960
- Almost done.
- Hurry up.

409
00:28:22,392 --> 00:28:24,728
I wanted to sing a song and surprise you,

410

but the music hall is not available now.

411
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:29,721
So I borrowed this room and this light, too.

412

But it is so strange. I…

413
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,280
Mr. You, I love this song.

No one has ever done this for me before.

Little Wood, I want to tell you something.

I…

Hello? What is it!?

418
00:28:58,462 --> 00:29:02,634
You Xi, the investors from The Realm of the Three Kingdoms want to invite you to dinner tonight.

00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,113
Me? Why?

427
00:29:35,113 --> 00:29:37,620
Why so many questions?

428
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,937
Put it on. I will be at the door.

429
00:29:59,152 --> 00:30:01,280
Are you done?

430
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,796
Yes.

431
00:30:46,081 --> 00:30:48,960
Mr. You, do I really have to wear this?

432
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,020
It feels weird.

433
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,220
You are so beautiful.

434
00:30:56,991 --> 00:31:00,299
I mean hurry up. We are going to be late.

435
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,524
Take the necklace off. It is so ugly.

00:31:08,296 --> 00:31:10,360
No.

438
00:32:00,737 --> 00:32:04,557
Yuchi Yaoyao!! What are you wearing?

439
00:32:04,557 --> 00:32:07,319
How can you come to such an important dinner?

440
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,162
Go back.

441
00:32:09,162 --> 00:32:10,849
Yes, Brother Da Zhuang. I'll leave.

442
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,900
Good, just go.

443
00:32:15,819 --> 00:32:17,465
I asked her to come.

444
00:32:17,466 --> 00:32:21,142
- What is the problem?
- But... You Xi, she is just an assistant.

445
00:32:21,142 --> 00:32:23,040
What's wrong with being an assistant?

446
00:32:32,802 --> 00:32:34,420
Together?

447
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,639
Why are you here?

448
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:44,072
How could I miss the birthday party of the daughter of Hueteng Corporation?

449
00:32:44,072 --> 00:32:46,863
Just go. You know the temper of Tong Jin.

450
00:32:46,863 --> 00:32:48,779
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

451
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:52,616
Birthday party?

452
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:55,444
Let's talk in private. Lets.

453
00:32:55,444 --> 00:32:57,206
Come here.

454
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,461
My superstar, just listen to me.

455
00:33:03,462 --> 00:33:05,314
You'd better explain yourself.

456
00:33:05,314 --> 00:33:07,278
Wasn't this supposed to be a dinner hosted by the investor?

457
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,219
But it was actually Tong Jin's birthday party?

458
00:33:09,219 --> 00:33:12,263
Tong Jin's father is the investor of The Realm of the Three Kingdoms.

459
00:33:12,264 --> 00:33:16,664
Today is his daughter's birthday, so he invited a lot of celebrities.

460
00:33:16,664 --> 00:33:18,113
We can't afford to upset him.

461
00:33:18,114 --> 00:33:19,970
Why is that?

462
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,726
The worst case is that I quit the show.

463
00:33:21,727 --> 00:33:25,558
Yaoyao, long time no see.

464
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:28,751
Sorry. I forgot to invite you to my birthday party.

465
00:33:28,751 --> 00:33:31,809
Are you here to be a server?

466
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:35,656
Did the servers' uniforms get fancier?

467
00:33:35,656 --> 00:33:37,855
I…

468
00:33:37,855 --> 00:33:39,748
Let's just go inside.

469
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,194
Why the rush? We are a couple. What is there to hide?

470
00:33:45,194 --> 00:33:47,693
It is better to clear any misunderstanding.

471
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:51,495
- It's just a dumb film. Who cares about it?
- No.

472
00:33:51,495 --> 00:33:54,155
Besides, you and Yaoyao are senior and junior, brother and sister,

473
00:33:54,156 --> 00:33:57,328
and we're friends.

474
00:33:57,328 --> 00:33:58,810
You got lucky this time.

475
00:33:58,811 --> 00:34:00,920
We'll see what happens next time.

476
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,720
Let's go together.

477
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:08,137
Why do you stand here? Let's go.

478
00:34:08,137 --> 00:34:09,861
You Xi?

479
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:13,260
What's your relationship with her?

480
00:34:18,404 --> 00:34:20,760
It's just like what you see here.

481
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,040
Please excuse us.

482
00:34:30,846 --> 00:34:34,956
Miss Tong, this is a misunderstanding.

483
00:34:34,956 --> 00:34:37,639
How can she hook up with a popular star like You Xi?

484
00:34:39,196 --> 00:34:42,643
It seems that I underestimated Yuchi Yaoyao.

485
00:34:42,644 --> 00:34:44,975
So what? Are you regretting it?

486
00:34:44,976 --> 00:34:46,600
No way.

487
00:34:53,434 --> 00:34:55,496
- Happy birthday, Miss Tong.
- Happy birthday, Miss Tong.

488
00:34:55,497 --> 00:34:57,865
A'Jin. A'Jin!

489
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,942
What I had with Yaoyao is in the past.

490
00:35:00,942 --> 00:35:03,440
But your eyes betray you.

491
00:35:08,377 --> 00:35:11,748
- Don't throw a trantrum.
- Don't be angry.

492
00:35:11,748 --> 00:35:13,699
Who is that?

493
00:35:13,699 --> 00:35:17,216
Sister Dan, she is Tong Jin, the heroine of tonight's party.

494
00:35:17,217 --> 00:35:19,617
She is the daughter of the Tong Family. She seems quite mediocre.

495
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:23,714
Of course, she can't compete with Sister Dan.

496
00:35:23,715 --> 00:35:26,399
She is nothing without her father.

497
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,197
It is her honor to have you give a toast.

498
00:35:31,197 --> 00:35:33,980
Sister Dan, we'll go over there for a bit.

499
00:35:36,984 --> 00:35:38,801
Sister Dan, long time no see.

500
00:35:38,802 --> 00:35:40,400
You've gotten more beautiful.

501
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,436
Thank you, Director Sun. You are still so sweet.

502
00:35:43,436 --> 00:35:48,500
Sister Dan, you must support my next movie.

503
00:35:54,913 --> 00:35:58,293
You Xi, I need to go say hi.

504
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,556
Let's go.

505
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,463
You have to support me.

506
00:36:09,464 --> 00:36:13,067
Sister Dan. Director Sun. Long time no see.

507
00:36:13,067 --> 00:36:15,420
Long time no see.

508
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,962
Director Sun, your movie is good.

509
00:36:19,962 --> 00:36:21,479
But I will provide my support on one condition.

510
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,960
If You Xi is in it.

511
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:31,645
You Xi, we should go say hi

512
00:36:31,645 --> 00:36:34,016
to the director and investor over there.

513
00:36:37,006 --> 00:36:38,723
I am going to go. I will be back in a minute.

514
00:36:38,723 --> 00:36:40,039
Are you going to be okay?

515
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,097
I'm fine, Mr. You. You should go.

516
00:36:43,097 --> 00:36:45,536
If you need anything, just come to me.

517
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,216
I will be here in a minute.

518
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,603
Let's go.

519
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,119
You Xi, can I take a photo with you?

520
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:02,002
- Just one. Just one photo.
- Sorry.

521
00:37:02,002 --> 00:37:04,663
Tonight, You Xi is just a guest at Miss Tong's birthday party.

522
00:37:04,664 --> 00:37:06,587
We can take pictures next time if you want.

523
00:37:06,588 --> 00:37:09,168
Thank you. Have fun.

524
00:37:09,168 --> 00:37:10,566
Let's go.

525
00:37:12,806 --> 00:37:14,019
You Xi, allow me to introduce these people.

526
00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:16,038
This is our famous investor, Sister Dan.

527
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:17,619
And this is Director Sun.

528
00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:18,723
Thank you.

529
00:37:18,724 --> 00:37:21,607
- You Xi, it's nice to meet you.
- Good evening, Sister Dan.

530
00:37:21,608 --> 00:37:23,560
Good evening, Director Sun.

531
00:37:37,326 --> 00:37:39,300
You look more handsome in person.

532
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,020
That's right.

533
00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:52,720
Why are you sitting here alone?

534
00:37:54,682 --> 00:37:59,339
Your demophobia has not improved at all.

535
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,860
Where is your lover?

536
00:38:08,949 --> 00:38:11,388
He's abandoned you so soon?

537
00:38:11,388 --> 00:38:12,993
What are you talking about?

538
00:38:12,994 --> 00:38:16,860
How long have you and your boss been together?

539
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:19,945
Let me guess.

540
00:38:19,946 --> 00:38:25,103
Was it after we broke up or… before?

541
00:38:27,529 --> 00:38:32,490
Yuchi Yaoyao, I really underestimated you.

542
00:38:35,812 --> 00:38:39,246
Sister Dan, you are so beautiful and elegant.

543
00:38:39,247 --> 00:38:41,344
What facial mask do you use?

544
00:38:43,442 --> 00:38:45,477
Mr. You is my boss.

545
00:38:45,477 --> 00:38:47,661
That's all.

546
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:49,701
Sister Dan, you are being so modest.

547
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,713
Please take care of You Xi.

548
00:38:51,714 --> 00:38:55,098
He can hide from you but not from me.

549
00:38:57,173 --> 00:38:58,633
Just take a look.

550
00:38:58,634 --> 00:39:01,292
He is looking at you

551
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:06,080
even when he is talking with others.

552
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:14,811
Of course, thanks to Sister Dan,

553
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:18,241
that will be great. Right, You Xi?

554
00:39:18,241 --> 00:39:19,640
Yeah.

555
00:39:24,284 --> 00:39:26,798
It seems he knows we are together.

556
00:39:29,221 --> 00:39:31,120
He must be anxious.

557
00:39:33,034 --> 00:39:34,968
Don't say that.

558
00:39:34,969 --> 00:39:36,608
You don't believe me?

559
00:39:48,121 --> 00:39:51,758
- Excuse me. Pardon me.
- You Xi.

560
00:39:51,758 --> 00:39:53,587
- Excuse me.
- Ladies and gentlemen.

561
00:39:53,587 --> 00:39:55,048
Wait.

562
00:39:56,298 --> 00:39:59,212
Thank you for attending my birthday party.

563
00:39:59,212 --> 00:40:02,693
I want to thank my father for hosting such a grand party for me.

564
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:08,110
In fact, the one I want to thank the most is my best friend,

565
00:40:09,097 --> 00:40:11,010
Yuchi Yaoyao.

566
00:40:13,131 --> 00:40:17,440
She has encouraged and helped me a lot during the past year.

567
00:40:17,441 --> 00:40:21,999
So… please welcome her to the stage.

568
00:40:24,281 --> 00:40:26,440
Yaoyao, come here.

569
00:40:30,747 --> 00:40:32,399
No, no, no.

570
00:40:34,718 --> 00:40:37,000
Don't cause a scene.

571
00:40:47,234 --> 00:40:50,620
Yaoyao, please introduce yourself to everyone.

572
00:41:28,844 --> 00:41:30,620
♫  The world is so big,  ♫

573
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:34,720
♫  yet a word of love from you makes me melt  ♫

574
00:41:34,721 --> 00:41:38,389

576
00:41:43,235 --> 00:41:46,207

577
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:48,915
♫  they've all become picturesque  ♫

00:41:48,915 --> 00:41:52,367
♫  Even if worries accompany sunsets,  ♫

579
00:41:52,367 --> 00:41:57,517
♫  is there any reasons not to cherish the moment?  ♫

580
00:41:57,517 --> 00:42:00,868
♫  I'll be with you when you cry  ♫
