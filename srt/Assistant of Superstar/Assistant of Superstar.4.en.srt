You Xi, why are you so late?

166
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,400
I've waited for a whole night.

167
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,400
- Would you like to sing with us?
- No.

168
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,200
Then, would you like to drink with us?

169
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,500
No.

170
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,100
Forget it then.

171

Cheers! Come on.

172
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,200
Come. Let's go home.

Hang in there!

Keep your mouth shut!

175
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,960
How can you be so mean?

176
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,479
Why are you so rude to me?

177
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:00,639
I'm not trying to be mean to you.

178
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,539
You used to be…

179
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:12,084
very nice to me.

180
00:10:12,084 --> 00:10:13,630
Used to?

181
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,779
Yin Jiu.

182
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,923
No! No!

183
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,070
No! No! No!

184
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:02,089
Yuchi Mumu.

185
00:11:03,336 --> 00:11:05,157
Yuchi Mumu.

186
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,659
What are you doing?

187
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:42,436
You… You… You vomited.

188
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:44,760
It was disgusting.

189
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,060
Your face is red.

190
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:08,697
Yaoyao, can you tell who I am now?

191
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,560
Mr. You,

192
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:25,879
you… finally got my name right.

193
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,046
Hang in there!

Keep your mouth shut!

How can you be so mean?

196

I'm not trying to be mean to you.

00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,640
No! No! No!

198
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,855
Duo Duo?

199
00:13:46,855 --> 00:13:48,518
Duo Duo, why are you here?

200
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:53,080
My third uncle called me at 2:00 a.m. in the morning.

201
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,879
He asked me to come over to help you wash up and change clothes.

202
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:59,879
But I was so tired so I fell asleep.

203
00:14:03,774 --> 00:14:07,354
Did I get really drunk…

204
00:14:07,354 --> 00:14:11,920
last night?

205
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,219
What do you mean by really drunk?

206
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:17,939
You were completely smashed.

207
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:20,719
You were a completely different person.

208
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:24,373
You dragged my third uncle to sing and dance, and then threw up all over the floor.

209
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:28,772
The scene was breathtaking.

210
00:14:28,772 --> 00:14:31,459
And it pissed my third uncle off.

211
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:37,540
Yaoyao, I didn't expect you to be so interesting when you're drunk.

212
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,900
Why are you so…

213
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,819
Mr. You, last night, I…

214
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,292
What to do? What to do? What to do?

215
00:15:57,292 --> 00:16:01,257
Pidan, she just asked me about last night.

216
00:16:01,257 --> 00:16:03,199
What an embarrasment!

217
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,719
We both feel ashamed.

218
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:08,038
I dirtied Mr. You's clothes.

219
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:11,599
I won't be blacklisted from him, right?

220
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,668
Relax. Let's just relax.

221
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,080
You know, Little Wood, we're adults.

222
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,636
It was just a kiss. No big deal.

223
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,539
Mr. You seems to be very angry.

224
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:30,739
Why don't you let him calm down?

225
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:34,132
I'll take responsibility for what I've done to you, Little Wood.

226
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,559
You're nuts. What responsibility?

227
00:16:39,907 --> 00:16:40,979
Forget it.

228
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,301
It's going to happen anyway.

229
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:45,579
I won't be afraid.

230
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:47,014
Let's go.

231

Go ahead.

235

How would you like to handle it?

236
00:17:11,183 --> 00:17:14,230
Mr. You, I don't care how you'll handle it.

237
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,919
What do you mean "you don't care"?

238
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,627
How am I supposed to know what you're thinking if you don't tell me?

239
00:17:21,627 --> 00:17:24,560
It doesn't matter what I'm thinking.

240
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,140
- Mr. You, do you want to fire me?
- You want to quit?

241
00:17:32,499 --> 00:17:34,319
Why would I want to fire you?

242
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,518
Because… I threw up all over you yesterday.

243
00:17:38,518 --> 00:17:40,601
It looks like she doesn't remember.

244
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,872
Yes.

245
00:17:42,872 --> 00:17:45,069
You didn't just throw up on me

246
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:47,061
but also messed up my house

247
00:17:47,061 --> 00:17:48,922
and tortured me for a night.

248
00:17:49,939 --> 00:17:51,882
I'll go and clean up your house.

249
00:17:51,883 --> 00:17:53,613
Sit down.

250
00:17:53,613 --> 00:17:54,820
You're going to leave just like that?

251
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,979
I'm not done yet.

252
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,920
Did I do something else last night?

253
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,819
You really don't… remember what happened last night?

254
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:17,518
- No.
- Great.

255
00:18:17,518 --> 00:18:18,679
It doesn't matter.

256
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,318
Your boss is very generous and forgiving.

257
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,850
I won't argue with you.

258
00:18:22,865 --> 00:18:24,595
Hold on.

259
00:18:26,776 --> 00:18:28,797
I remembered something.

260
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:38,755
Yesterday I got drunk and laid in there,

261
00:18:38,755 --> 00:18:41,599
and you helped me up.

262
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,150
And…

263
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,259
Forget it. Just forget it!

264
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:52,387
If you can't remember, no need to remember.

265
00:18:52,388 --> 00:18:54,062
No.

266
00:18:54,062 --> 00:18:55,879
You have to correct mistakes.

267
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,780
So I have to know what I did wrong so that I can change.

268
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:04,245
And then…

269
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,820
And then…

270
00:19:11,178 --> 00:19:14,000
And then you made a big hole on my carpet with your teeth.

271
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,175
Me?

272
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:23,468
Mr. You, do you mean to tell me that I did this with my teeth?

273
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,838
Are you implying that I've wronged you?

274
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:30,029
My mom brought this to me from Iran.

275
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:33,010
Tell me how you'll compensate.

276
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,655
I didn't say I would compensate you.

277
00:19:35,655 --> 00:19:39,100
It's obviously been cut using scissors.

278
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,060
That's enough. Let's stop.

It's… It's not what you think.

282
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:05,030
You actually didn't tell me...

that you have good food here.

284

Third Uncle, I'm hungry. Why don't you cook?

285
00:20:18,579 --> 00:20:19,823
- You're hungry?
- Yes.

286
00:20:19,824 --> 00:20:21,168
Go home and have dinner.

287

Third Uncle, you're a good cook. I want to try your food.

No.

Then I'll tell Second Uncle that you mistreated your niece.

290

00:23:50,465 --> 00:23:52,180
I'll scare you to death if I post one.

330
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,593
[Scumbag of the Year Award]

331
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,459
Mr. You, what's going on?

332
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,599
Isn't the post very funny?

333
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:34,592
Why would you read such things?

334
00:24:34,592 --> 00:24:36,878
I…

335
00:24:36,878 --> 00:24:39,869
I think the jerk is awfully mean.

336
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,250
He's not a jerk.

337
00:24:43,365 --> 00:24:45,731
He's a coward at best.

338
00:24:45,731 --> 00:24:48,723
He took away the girl's first kiss, but only dared to post it online.

339
00:24:48,723 --> 00:24:50,350
His life must be pathetic.

340
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:54,020
He has no idea what a first kiss means to a girl.

341
00:24:57,472 --> 00:24:58,972
Yes.

342
00:25:04,562 --> 00:25:07,362
I'm not a jerk.

343
00:25:07,362 --> 00:25:10,495
Isn't it just a first kiss? I'll admit it.

344
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,240
Mr. You.

345
00:25:24,203 --> 00:25:26,802
The fact is…

346
00:25:28,051 --> 00:25:30,139
yesterday evening…

347
00:25:30,139 --> 00:25:32,339
Third Uncle!

348
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:34,079
Actually, what?

349
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:36,259
Go ahead. I want to know, too.

350
00:25:41,693 --> 00:25:43,593
Mr. You.

351
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:50,659
The thing is…

352
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,419
What?

353
00:26:01,668 --> 00:26:03,608
What?

354
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:07,015
Yuchi Mumu.

355
00:26:20,116 --> 00:26:21,339
The fact is…

356
00:26:21,339 --> 00:26:23,652
Third Uncle, what?

357
00:26:23,652 --> 00:26:25,613
Why are you everywhere?

358
00:26:27,459 --> 00:26:29,640
Third Uncle. Third Uncle.

359
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,694
Third Uncle! Just say it. Rest assured.

360
00:26:31,694 --> 00:26:33,580
I promise to keep your secret.

361
00:26:37,134 --> 00:26:38,794
Say what?

362
00:26:44,078 --> 00:26:46,358
What is it?

363
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,169
She actually forgot.

364
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:54,160
Was I such a bad kisser?

365
00:27:01,312 --> 00:27:04,699
- Third Uncle!
- What are you doing?

366
00:27:04,699 --> 00:27:06,145
Third Uncle!

367
00:27:06,145 --> 00:27:09,219
You're acting a little weird today.

368
00:27:09,219 --> 00:27:11,962
Is something bothering you?

369
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,943
No.

370
00:27:13,943 --> 00:27:18,206
If a man has something on his mind, he shouldn't keep it to himself.

371
00:27:18,206 --> 00:27:22,998
You can talk to Qi Chao, who is your best friend

372
00:27:22,998 --> 00:27:24,719
and my idol.

373
00:27:27,388 --> 00:27:28,990
That's right.

374
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,619
Third Uncle, are you going to meet my idol? Take me with you.

375
00:27:43,511 --> 00:27:46,719
- Why are you wearing that?
- Why are you wearing that?

376
00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:51,819
Why are you here? Why not go to my house to talk?

377
00:27:51,819 --> 00:27:53,381
Stop bringing that up.

378
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:57,575
Pandora has followed me all the way. So that's why I found this hidden place.

379
00:27:57,575 --> 00:28:01,069
She's probably waiting outside your house right now.

380
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,758
- The couple's dinner, our restaurant's specialty.
- Thanks.

381
00:28:08,758 --> 00:28:10,720
Enjoy, please.

382
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,079
Couple's dinner?

383
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:15,592
There are just the two of us.

384
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:18,614
If we don't order the couple's dinner, shall we get a parent-children's dinner?

385
00:28:22,736 --> 00:28:25,317
Why is yours green while mine is pink?

386
00:28:25,317 --> 00:28:27,680
I have never tasted this. I want to try it.

387
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,540
What's going on? Tell me.

388
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,759
Let me figure out a way to say it properly.

389
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:39,318
If you don't say it now, I'll just leave—

390
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:41,224
Hold on. Have a seat.

391
00:28:41,225 --> 00:28:43,037
I'll tell you.

392
00:28:45,449 --> 00:28:48,188
It's not a big deal.

393
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:51,099
It's just that…

394
00:28:55,368 --> 00:28:57,468
One of my friends

395
00:28:57,468 --> 00:29:01,859
kissed his secretary by accident.

396
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:04,079
How did he do this by accident?

397
00:29:05,067 --> 00:29:07,028
That's none of your business.

398
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:10,959
His secretary was drunk and forgot all of it.

399
00:29:12,514 --> 00:29:14,158
The main point.

400
00:29:14,158 --> 00:29:15,920
The main point is that

401
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,508
it happens to be his secretary's first kiss,

402
00:29:18,508 --> 00:29:20,529
so my friend should take responsibility.

403
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:22,890
Get him to tell her then.

404
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:25,980
Tell her? That'd be embarrasing.

405
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,850
Don't tell her then.

406
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:30,499
If he doesn't tell her,

407
00:29:30,499 --> 00:29:34,218
she would act like nothing happened at all, which would annoy him.

408
00:29:34,218 --> 00:29:36,918
Tell her then. Let them hurt each other.

409
00:29:36,918 --> 00:29:38,480
If he tells her,

410
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,539
what if she thinks of my friend as a pervert?

411
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:44,479
Don't tell her then.

412
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:46,972
Answer my question first. Should he tell her or not?

413
00:29:46,972 --> 00:29:49,460
You are not giving me a real answer.

414
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,719
I don't know.

415
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,240
Prince of love songs.

416
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:59,340
Little Prince of idol dramas.

417
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:04,679
My dramas don't really have any substance.

418
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:07,459
My love songs do not involve sexual harassment in the workplace.

419
00:30:07,459 --> 00:30:11,119
You… What are you saying? What sexual harassment?

420
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:14,247
Even if it's sexual harassment, she's the one who harassed me.

421
00:30:15,473 --> 00:30:17,273
My friend…

422
00:30:18,522 --> 00:30:22,734
And my friend is handsome and tall.

423
00:30:22,734 --> 00:30:24,860
How could he possibly sexually harass others?

424
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:28,153
Does your friend like her?

425
00:30:28,153 --> 00:30:31,376
Like her? Impossible!

426
00:30:31,376 --> 00:30:34,459
Clever people never say no with ease.

427
00:30:35,995 --> 00:30:41,861
Then, how can I know if my friend likes her?

428
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,739
You starred in dramas for nothing.

429
00:30:55,116 --> 00:30:58,156
He would peek at her from time to time,

430
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,219
and feel nervous when he sees her getting hurt.

431
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:08,614
What happened here?

432
00:31:08,615 --> 00:31:10,079
I don't know either.

433
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,140
When he touches her, his heart beats faster,

434
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,479
and he grows to like the things she likes.

435
00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:31,260
What the hell is that?

436
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,619
No. That's not right.

437
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:35,038
My friend doesn't like her.

438
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:37,358
He gets three out of four.

439
00:31:37,358 --> 00:31:39,400
It's pretty close.

440
00:31:39,914 --> 00:31:41,141
Is your method scientific?

441
00:31:41,142 --> 00:31:44,559
No, but it's accurate.

442
00:31:48,035 --> 00:31:50,119
I'm tired. I'm going home.

443
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:53,221
Hold on, the last question.

444
00:31:53,221 --> 00:31:55,020
If…

445
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,958
I mean if…

446
00:31:56,958 --> 00:32:02,569
my friend… wants to confess to her about what happened last night,

447
00:32:02,569 --> 00:32:04,523
what should he say?

448
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:06,519
Let me give you a suggestion.

449
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:10,210
Before you tell her that she had lost her first kiss,

450
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:13,012
you better prepare her for it.

451
00:32:13,012 --> 00:32:14,746
Or…

452
00:32:14,746 --> 00:32:16,980
Go ahead. Or what?

453
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,019
...the consequences will be very severe.

454
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,460
I'm leaving. Bye.

455
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,891
It was just a kiss. It wasn't a big deal.

456
00:32:49,891 --> 00:32:54,699
Yuchi Mumu, as a human, we should have the spirit of exploration.

457
00:32:54,699 --> 00:32:57,680
We should always take the first step in life, right?

458
00:33:01,303 --> 00:33:03,182
What do you want?

459
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:04,747
You…

460
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:08,062
You…

461
00:33:10,263 --> 00:33:12,524
Why are you holding a knife?

462
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,490
I'm sharpening a pencil.

463
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:20,457
What a coincidence.

464
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:24,377
I was trying to peel an apple, but I couldn't find a knife.

465
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:34,979
You've read for so long. Are you tired?

466
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:37,083
- No.
- How is that possible?

467
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:38,567
You must be tired.

468
00:33:38,567 --> 00:33:41,245
Come on. Let's watch TV.

469
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,076
We've already broken up.

470
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:50,475
Why are you so reluctant to let go of me?

471
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:52,899
Am I the only one like that?

472
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:55,300
Don't you miss me at all?

473
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,320
Yes, but what can I do?

474
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,440
Our relationship was wrong from the beginning.

475
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:12,380
Since it's wrong, let it be.

476
00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:48,420
So… what do you think?

477
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,546
I thought you did well in the scene.

478
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,966
You got all the lines right. Your emotions were on point.

479
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:56,626
That's not what I was talking about.

480
00:34:56,626 --> 00:35:00,975
Look, sometimes it's normal

481
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:04,099
for men and women to kiss.

482
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,440
It's not normal at all.

483
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,712
What…

484
00:35:16,712 --> 00:35:18,573
What's not normal?

485
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:24,767
It's a very sacred contract.

486
00:35:24,768 --> 00:35:26,135
It's like lovers giving plums

487
00:35:26,136 --> 00:35:28,376
and red beans to each other as a token of love in ancient times.

488
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,060
Once this contract is formed,

489
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:34,375
the two of them must honor the contract for life, hold hands,

490
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:37,519
and grow old together until death separates them.

491
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:47,560
I was just kidding, Mr. You.

492
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,508
You can't joke about that.

493
00:35:53,296 --> 00:35:55,652
- I'll get the door.
- Okay.
