[Happy Birthday, Tong Jin]

39
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:54,760
Since freshman year, Yaoyao and I had been good friends for almost four years.

40
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,686
Although there had been

41
00:01:56,686 --> 00:02:01,020
something unpleasant between us in the past,

42
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,120
I still want to be your best friend.

43
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,815
But you clearly knew that Yin Jiu was my boyfriend.

44
00:02:12,816 --> 00:02:14,794
So why did you still…

45
00:02:14,794 --> 00:02:15,845
What?

46
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:18,005
Stealing her best friend's boyfriend?

47
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,718
She seems to be honest

48
00:02:19,718 --> 00:02:21,903
but she's actually not.

49
00:02:21,903 --> 00:02:24,062
How dare she showing up here.

50
00:02:24,063 --> 00:02:26,483
- She should be ashamed of herself.
- Stealing her best friend's boyfriend.

51
00:02:26,483 --> 00:02:27,616
So disgusting.

52
00:02:27,617 --> 00:02:29,939
Having such a friend is really unfortunate.

53
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:31,478
Look at her.

54
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,538
She admitted it in the end.

55
00:02:36,798 --> 00:02:37,979
Say something.

56
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:42,090
Say it. Say it.

57
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,505
Is it because nobody likes you?

58
00:02:44,506 --> 00:02:47,065
Is that why you stole another girl's boyfriend?

59
00:02:49,715 --> 00:02:51,380
You Xi.

60
00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:03,974
You Xi?

61
00:03:05,907 --> 00:03:08,200
Didn't I tell you to call me if you needed help?

62
00:03:09,012 --> 00:03:11,190
I…

63
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,101
Don't be afraid.

64
00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:14,566
I'm here.

65
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,210
Next,

66
00:03:24,312 --> 00:03:27,090
let's move on to the next part of the party.

67
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,012
I'm the guest speaker.

68
00:03:30,012 --> 00:03:31,400
Good evening, everyone.

69
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,481
What? The guest speaker should have been me.

70
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,502
Firstly,

71
00:03:36,502 --> 00:03:40,474
happy birthday to Miss Tong Jin.

72
00:03:40,474 --> 00:03:42,605
May you be forever young.

73
00:03:45,614 --> 00:03:48,398
You said Yuchi Yaoyao had stolen your boyfriend.

74
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:52,014
But they were dating two years ago.

75
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:55,109
Meanwhile, you and Yin Jiu have been together for just a few months.

76
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,616
I believe everyone can see with their own eyes

77
00:03:58,616 --> 00:04:00,468
the real person who stole her best friend's boyfriend.

78
00:04:00,468 --> 00:04:01,483
No way.

79
00:04:01,483 --> 00:04:03,310
Turns out she's the one stealing other people's boyfriends.

80
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:06,083
I can't imagine Old Tong's daughter being such a person.

81
00:04:06,084 --> 00:04:07,890
How shameless.

82
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,985
And the main character of it all, Mr. Yin Jiu.

83
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:13,592
When you cheated on your girlfriend with her best friend,

84
00:04:13,592 --> 00:04:17,860
did you think about how this might affect their friendship?

85
00:04:20,964 --> 00:04:23,760
You just said nobody loves Yuchi Yaoyao.

86
00:04:25,801 --> 00:04:27,805
I don't think so.

87
00:04:30,096 --> 00:04:35,296
Yuchi Yaoyao is modest and kind-hearted.

88
00:04:35,296 --> 00:04:37,620
Even if she has been wronged,

89
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,325
she would always never defend herself.

90
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:43,014
Other than having a low EQ,
(T/N: emotional quotient or intelligence)

91
00:04:43,015 --> 00:04:45,382
there is nothing wrong with her.

92
00:04:45,382 --> 00:04:47,213
In my opinion,

93
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:49,816
everyone loves her.

94
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:58,378
She stayed up all night to mend a blanket,

95
00:04:58,378 --> 00:05:01,197
because she thought that it was important to me.

96
00:05:01,197 --> 00:05:05,204
Although… it ended up being very ugly.

97
00:05:05,894 --> 00:05:07,883
When I make a mistake,

98
00:05:07,883 --> 00:05:11,847
she'd criticize me and not hold back on it.

99
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:14,695
Even children know it, so why wouldn't you?

100
00:05:14,696 --> 00:05:16,626
When I'm sad,

101
00:05:16,626 --> 00:05:20,206
she'll be there to comfort me.

102
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:25,769
Although… she's not good at comforting at all.

103
00:05:27,816 --> 00:05:32,210
She would even fight for me.

104
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:38,644
Although…

105
00:05:49,611 --> 00:05:51,896
I'm more afraid that she'd get hurt.

106
00:05:54,302 --> 00:05:55,679
Don't. Don't shoot. Don't.

107
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,067
There's nothing to shoot.

108
00:05:57,067 --> 00:06:01,914
Actually, there's something I've been wanting to say to you.

109
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,585
You Xi has gone mad.

110
00:06:58,604 --> 00:06:59,981
Stop right there.

Don't go! Stop him.

00:13:38,872 --> 00:13:40,840
Does that sound good?

166
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:57,500
Xiao Yi, review tonight's guest list, check the monitors,

167
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,390
and find out who brought their phones in and who took pictures.

168
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,380
These pictures must be deleted at all costs.

169
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,717
Xiao Wu, keep a close eye on all the media, pull all strings,

170
00:14:04,717 --> 00:14:07,260
and when the news gets out, intercept it. Got it?

171
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,999
Xiao Jiu, you're in charge of the Weibo, Douban, Tianya forums.

172
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,521
If there's a whiff of trouble, nip it in the bud.

173
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:15,287
Xiao Qi. Xiao Qi!

174
00:14:15,892 --> 00:14:17,860
Brother Morry, we've run into some trouble.

175
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,837
Director Tong wants to cancel the investment and replace You Xi in the cast.

176
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:21,503
What?

177
00:14:27,293 --> 00:14:28,695
My superstar...

178
00:14:28,696 --> 00:14:32,290
Yesterday, you ruined the birthday party of Director Tong's daughter.

179
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:37,752
Director Tong was very mad and said he'll pull the plug if you're not replaced.

180
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,099
- That's it?
- That's it.

181
00:14:41,099 --> 00:14:43,503
I don't care. I wanted to quit a long time ago.

182
00:14:43,503 --> 00:14:45,450
You Xi, this is serious.

183
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,166
Stop joking around.

184
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,296
I'm not. I'm serious.

185
00:14:49,296 --> 00:14:50,993
You still…

186
00:14:50,993 --> 00:14:52,978
Lower your voice.

187
00:14:52,978 --> 00:14:56,081
If Little Wood hears, I…

188
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:02,147
Mr. You. Brother Dazhuang.

189
00:15:02,147 --> 00:15:03,776
Good morning.

190
00:15:03,776 --> 00:15:05,979
Go wash up and get ready for breakfast.

191
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,726
I heard it all.

192
00:15:07,726 --> 00:15:09,605
It's all my fault.

193
00:15:09,605 --> 00:15:11,075
I'm going to apologize to Tong Jin.

194
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:12,526
Hurry up and go!

195
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:14,087
Come back.

196
00:15:15,087 --> 00:15:16,611
Who said it was your fault?

197
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:18,196
Whether it's my fault or not,

198
00:15:18,197 --> 00:15:21,091
you can't get into trouble because of this.

199
00:15:21,091 --> 00:15:24,297
- I'll go find her.
- Go. Go. Go.

200
00:15:24,297 --> 00:15:26,393
Come back!

201
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,495
Who said you got me into trouble?

202
00:15:28,496 --> 00:15:31,784
I'm the one who made this happen, so it's none of your business.

203
00:15:31,784 --> 00:15:33,887
Stay here and don't go anywhere.

204
00:15:33,888 --> 00:15:36,404
Sit down. Eat your noodles.

205
00:15:42,978 --> 00:15:44,720
It's a new dish. Try it out.

206
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:48,092
No, I'm not in the mood. Take it away from me.

207
00:15:57,182 --> 00:15:59,600
Tell Director Zhang that I'll be at the office right away.

208
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,223
Brother Morry, it's not Director Zhang.

209
00:16:01,224 --> 00:16:03,029
They are the "The Realm of the Three Kingdoms" crew,

210
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,870
and they said that they have something important to talk about.

211
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,626
They are here so soon.

212
00:16:07,626 --> 00:16:11,388
Listen. Get the termination agreement ready.

213
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,512
They want to breach the contract for no reason.

214
00:16:13,512 --> 00:16:15,514
It's their fault.

215
00:16:15,514 --> 00:16:19,611
Make the terms as favorable as possible to us.

216
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,195
And try to recover our losses.

217
00:16:21,195 --> 00:16:23,040
Understood, Brother Morry.

218
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:29,075
Look at that. Look!

219
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:31,401
They even called me.

220
00:16:33,187 --> 00:16:37,078
It's really unfortunate to be your agent.

221
00:16:38,162 --> 00:16:40,919
I'm going. Enjoy your meal.

222
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:43,856
Take care, Brother Dazhuang.

223
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,053
[I'm sorry for what happened yesterday.]

224
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:05,337
[I'm sorry for what happened yesterday. Don't be mad.]

225
00:17:05,337 --> 00:17:07,209
What are you doing?

226
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:08,974
Mr. You.

227
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:14,000
Give it to me.

228
00:17:21,193 --> 00:17:23,760
I can't believe that you haven't blocked her.

229
00:17:24,516 --> 00:17:26,536
And you even said some cheesy things.

230
00:17:26,536 --> 00:17:29,323
"I'm sorry for what happened yesterday. Don't be mad."

231
00:17:29,324 --> 00:17:32,107
Mr. You, this was my fault.

232
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:34,672
I'd like to apologize to Tong Jin and ask her to talk to her dad.

233
00:17:34,672 --> 00:17:36,782
You want to apologize to her?

234
00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:41,404
Mr. You.

235
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:46,619
[You are just a rich and fake friend. Without your father, you are nothing.]

236
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,569
[Shame on you. Have your father withdraw the investment.]
[I'm done with that.]

237
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:58,102
Apologize? No way!

238
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,419
[You are just a rich and fake friend. Without your father, you are nothing.]

239
00:18:08,466 --> 00:18:11,920
You Xi. Yuchi Yaoyao.

240
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,259
I'm not going to make it easy for both of you.

241
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:22,207
Producer Cui, we can cancel the contract.

242
00:18:22,207 --> 00:18:25,899
But You Xi didn't break any terms.

243
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:27,498
You're the ones who breached the contract without a reasonable cause.

244
00:18:27,498 --> 00:18:29,364
So…

245
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,110
[The Three Kingdoms]

246
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:11,491
Mr. You.

247
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:17,205
No more reading finally. Great.

248
00:19:17,205 --> 00:19:19,906
But you've prepared for the role for a long time.

249
00:19:19,906 --> 00:19:22,700
Now you have to give up halfway.

250
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,508
I didn't want to play this role since the beginning.

251
00:19:26,509 --> 00:19:29,086
And there are lots of movie companies asking for me

252
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:30,753
and waiting in line.

253
00:19:44,827 --> 00:19:46,548
Coming!

254
00:19:49,406 --> 00:19:53,682
Just let me in so that I can drink some water.

255
00:19:56,703 --> 00:19:58,260
What's going on?

256
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,624
What's going on? Tell me.

257
00:20:03,924 --> 00:20:06,703
When I stepped into the office, I sensed the tension.

258
00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:09,612
I was thinking that they were up to no good.

259
00:20:09,612 --> 00:20:14,595
So I was well-prepared for whatever that could possibly happen with—

260
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:16,000
Get to the point.

261
00:20:16,001 --> 00:20:19,341
The point is they won't cancel the contract.

262
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:22,217
Really, Brother Dazhuang?

263
00:20:22,217 --> 00:20:23,476
What happened?

264
00:20:23,477 --> 00:20:26,947
In fact, here's what happened.

265
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,125
You're the ones who breached the contract without a reasonable cause.

266
00:20:32,126 --> 00:20:34,118
So…

267
00:20:34,118 --> 00:20:36,353
Brother Morry, you misunderstood us.

268
00:20:36,353 --> 00:20:39,457
We're not here to cancel the contract.

269
00:20:41,193 --> 00:20:42,558
Tong Tianming won't withdraw his investment anymore?

270
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,502
No. He will.

271
00:20:44,502 --> 00:20:47,904
So, we canceled the contract with him.

272
00:20:47,904 --> 00:20:49,928
Are you kidding me?

273
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:57,000
Brother Morry, I'd like you to meet Director Wang and Director Li.

274
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,600
Both of them would like to invest in "The Realm of the Three Kingdoms."

275
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,700
And they asked to talk to you face-to-face.

276
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,700
Really?

277
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,800
Yes.

278
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,200
I'm very optimistic about this movie.

279
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,300
Especially the role of Lü Bu.

280
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:15,000
- It's made exactly for You Xi.
- It has to be him.

281
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
If You Xi is willing to play the part,

282
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,900
I'll double my investment immediately.

283
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,500
Thank you.

284
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,800
Fans.

285
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,600
They must be my fans.

286
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,600
How else could it happen?

287
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,400
They came just in time.

288
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,600
They must love me dearly and were moved by me.

289
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,600
That's what I thought.

290
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,500
But with my highly sensitive professionalism,

291
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,200
I did a little investigation.

292
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,000
Three successful people are from different professions

293
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,400
without connections.

294
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,600
However, the only thing they have in common is…
[Personal Information]

295
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:13,200
Dad, I've caused you trouble this time.

296
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,300
I've been teaching for decades

297
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,800
and I do have a few students.

298
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,500
Yaoyao,

299
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,200
why didn't you tell me that you broke up with Yin Jiu?

300
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,400
Dad, I didn't want you to worry about me.

301
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,700
Baby girl, I'm your dad.

302
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,300
I'd like everyone that you like.

303
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,000
Dad, what are you talking about?

304
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,400
You and You Xi. When…

305
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,200
Dad, you misunderstood.

306
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,300
I'm not in a relationship with Mr. You.

307
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:54,500
What? Then in front of so many people, why did he…

308
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,700
How did you know that?

309
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,100
Yin Jiu told me.

310
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,800
Yin Jiu?

311
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,200
He told me that you got together with You Xi first,

312
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,200
so he got together with Tong Jin.

313
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:14,682
Yin Jiu, how can he know you better than I do?

314
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,700
Anyway, I'm not in a relationship with Mr. You.

315
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,200
I've been through the same thing for a while.

316
00:23:24,586 --> 00:23:28,400
In the past, when I was in love with your mom,

317
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,400
everyone in the entire school knew about it back then.

318
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,000
But I didn't care.

319
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,300
I…

320
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,800
Yaoyao.

321
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,100
How did it go?

322
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,600
What did your dad say?

323
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,400
He said…

324
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,800
Nothing.

325
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,500
Anyway, let me go in and thank your dad myself.

326
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,000
Mr. You... don't.

327
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,400
My dad now is busy grading papers.

328
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,800
Let's leave him alone and go home.

329
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,000
You have homework to do.

330
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,100
Homework? I threw them all away.

331
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,000
You threw them away?

332
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,700
Mr. You, why did you throw all your textbooks in the trash?

333
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,400
It took me forever to find them.

334
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,400
The contract was supposed to be canceled. Who knew it would suddenly get overturned?

335
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,500
Now we've got all the homework back.

336
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,800
Are you hungry?

337
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,300
I can make very good sweet dumplings now.

338
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,100
I'll make them for you.

339
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,200
- I'll do the homework after I eat.
- Mr. You, I…

340
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,200
Mr. You, hurry up.

341
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,200
We need to finish the class later.

342
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,000
Last time, we learned about the gathering and didn't finish "Jiang Gan is Trapped."

343
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,400
- Today we'll learn Kong Ming—
- Shut up.

344
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,900
This is your spoon.

345
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,200
What? Are you worried about that?

346
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,000
Don't you have OCD?
(Obsessive-compulsive disorder)

347
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,400
I used to.

348
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,000
Now I don't.

349
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,200
Eat more of the sweet dumplings I made.

350
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,500
- It's hot!
- Where? Let me see.

351
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:44,977
In 280 AD,

352
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,500
the Western Jin Dynasty destroyed the Kingdom of Wu and unified China.

353
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,400
And just like that,

354
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,800
the 60-year period of the Three Kingdoms ended.

355
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:00,500
Class, this is also the end of our last lesson.

356
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,600
During the ten days of training,

357
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,800
I saw the growth and progress of each one of you.

358
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,400
As a professor,

359
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,300
I am touched and relieved.

360
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,300
I hope all of you will stay true to your original aspiration,

361
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,000
take your roles seriously,

362
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
present this glorious history to more people,

363
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,400
and pass on the time-honored Chinese culture.

364
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,000
Thank you, everyone.

Do you have any questions?

367
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,100
I'd like to recite a poem.

368
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,300
Which poem would you like to recite?

369
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,800
"The Sea"

370
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,800
"The Sea" by Cao Cao is my favorite poem.

371
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,500
Recite it when you have the chance.

372
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,800
"I come to view the boundless ocean

373
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,400
from Stony Hill on the eastern shore.

00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,200

375
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,000
and islands stand amid its roar.

00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,300
Tree upon tree grows from peak to peak.

377

Grass upon grass looks lush far and nigh.

378
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,300
The autumn wind blows dreary and bleak.

379
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,000
The monstrous billows surge up high.

380

381

appear to rise up from the deep.

382
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,400
The Milky Way with stars so bright

383
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,800
sinks down into the sea in sleep.

384
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,000
How happy I feel at this sight!

385

In truth, the student's house was demolished,

455
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,900
so he quit school and went home to inherit the family property.

Yaoyao never talked about it to anyone before.

A lot of things.

you got up late for school and cried after the bus left.

486

Or when you were three,

487
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,200
you were chased by a rooster in the yard.

488
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,000
Why did my dad say these things?

489
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,200
I…

490
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,100
Mr. You, my dad was lying to you.

491
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,200
Don't take the bait.

492
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,200
How come I felt that he was telling the truth?

493
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,000
Director Zhang, don't worry.

494
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,600
I've taken care of everything.

495
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,800
The money was wired, and the photos were destroyed.

496
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,800
I promise nothing will leak out.

497
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,500
Okay, Director Zhang.

498
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,000
Bye.

499
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,800
These people are really greedy.

500
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,600
Just a photo and they wanted this number.

501
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,200
Is this a normal photo?

502
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,100
This is about You Xi, the superstar.

503
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:43,500
Listen! Even for things a hundred times more than this,

504
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,500
I wouldn't hesitate to pay for it.

505
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:59,600
Shen Yiling, you acted so fast.

506
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,200
I'll call the press right now.

507
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,600
Hold on.

508
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,800
Not now.

509
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,400
Not now? Then when?

510
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,000
Do you know how leopards hunt?

511
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,400
Every time the leopard sees its prey,

512
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,700
it inches closer and closer,

513
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,600
making almost no sound

514
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,150
until it reaches favorable terrain.

515
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,200
Then, it pounces.

516
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,000
That's how you get a real kick out of the opponent.

517
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,800
He got away with it last time.

518
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,600
This time, I'll see how he deals with it.

519
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,000
Hi, Mr. Song.

520
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,800
You Xi.

521
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,200
You're the newbie that the company signed.

522
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Congratulations You Xi for having more than ten million followers on Weibo.

523
00:38:32,008 --> 00:38:35,477
This endorsement of OJ. They chose...

524
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,700
You Xi.

525
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,800
Take a look.

526
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,500
Thank you, Director Zhang.

527
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,400
Congratulations.

528
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,500
Congratulations, You Xi.

529
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,100
Home at last.

530
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,200
No more exams, no more early mornings, and no more classes.

531
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
What's wrong with you?

532
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,400
The training is over. Why are there so many books?

533
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,900
The training is over,

534
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,200
but we haven't finished "Zhongfu."

535
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,500
You have five days until you meet Director Wei Ran.

536
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,200
What? How many days?

537
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,770
♫  The world is so big,  ♫

538
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:27,600
♫  yet a word of love from you makes me melt  ♫

539
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,400
♫  Watching you decorate this little home,  ♫

540
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:36,200
♫  the overflowing happiness can barely be contained  ♫

541
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,300
♫  The noise of spring and autumn, the temperature difference between winter and summer  ♫

542
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,900
♫  they've all become picturesque  ♫

543
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,300
♫  Even if worries accompany sunsets,  ♫

544
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:50,400
♫  is there any reasons not to cherish the moment?  ♫

545
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,800
♫  I'll be with you when you cry  ♫

546
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,500
♫  I'll pamper you so that you won't ruin your makeup  ♫

547
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:02,900
♫  I will take you wherever you want to go  ♫

548
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,074
♫  You are my girl  ♫

549
00:41:06,074 --> 00:41:09,513
♫  I want you to be my goddess for the rest of my life  ♫

550
00:41:09,514 --> 00:41:13,295
♫  I'll gently light the lamp in the quiet of the night  ♫

551
00:41:13,295 --> 00:41:17,494
♫  I'll hold you in my arms and let you sleep soundly  ♫

552
00:41:17,495 --> 00:41:20,143
♫  I'm your man  ♫

553
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,821
♫  I will take care of you with my all  ♫

554
00:41:23,822 --> 00:41:27,704
♫  I'll silently follow the perfect script in your heart  ♫

555
00:41:27,705 --> 00:41:35,235
♫  It's you who makes everything become possible and love to be flawless  ♫
