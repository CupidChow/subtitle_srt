Lü Bu was not a man who was just immersed in love.

00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,900
Uncle, is it true that you and my Second Uncle can't work in Shengguo Entertainment anymore?

165
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,300
Your niece's part was stolen by that girl.

166
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,500
You're not my real niece.

167
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,800
What are you upset about?

168
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
If she wants to play Diao Chan, let her be.

169
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,700
Anyway, she won't be popular.

170
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,600
Third Uncle, how do you know that?

171
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,200
Diao Chan is a peerless beauty, but whoever plays her would be reviled.

172
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,800
Wouldn't she be a target with her terrible acting?

173
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,400
Who else will they criticize except her?

174
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,800
Think about it.

175
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,600
Sun Shangxiang exists in both seasons

176
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,800
and her character is endearing.

177
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,200
Mr. You is right.

178
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,800
I've also read the script.

179
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,600
Sun Shangxiang's characterization is complete.

180
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,200
But Diao Chan is different.

181
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,000
She's just eye candy.

182
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,400
There is little room for the actress.

183
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,000
Just be good and listen to me, and play Sun Shangxiang.

184
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,600
If you can't be popular, blame me for it.

185
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,200
Third Uncle, you're really an old fox.

186
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
What did you call me?

187
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,500
Second Uncle, you'll be Third Uncle's biological child from now on.

188
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,600
What nonsense!

189
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,300
You Xi, Mr. Zhang's 50th birthday dinner party

190
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,700
will be held at 7:00 tomorrow night.

191
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,800
He has just invited you and a few other popular celebrities

192
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,000
and his closest confidants.

193
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,200
This is a top priority for Shengguo Entertainment.

194
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,300
You have to show up and be on time.

195
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,200
Am I the kind of person who likes to be late?

196
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,800
Good.

197
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,500
Wake me up at 2:00 tomorrow afternoon.

198
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,500
I will get a new hairstyle.

199
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,500
It's only five?

200
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,700
I did wake up early this morning, didn't I?

201
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,200
What is this dark thing here?

202
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,000
Is it eatable? How can it be?

203
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,800
Dinner!

204
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,300
5:00 p.m.

205
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,700
- Hello.
- Yuchi Mumu!

206
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,800
Didn't I tell you to wake me up at 2:00 in the afternoon?

207
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,000
Look what time it is now.

208
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
Sorry, Mr. You.

209
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,400
I'm a little sick today.

210
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,200
You… You're sick?

211
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,100
What's wrong? Have you seen a doctor?

212
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,800
I just feel a little dizzy.

213
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,200
I just need to get some sleep.

214
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,600
Hello?

215
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,200
Yuchi Mumu.

216
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,000
Yuchi Mumu!

217
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,000
Yuchi Mumu!

218
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,800
Yuchi Mumu!

219
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,100
Mr. You.

220
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,800
Are you okay?

221
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,600
What's wrong?

222
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
How are you not feeling well?

223
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm fine, Mr. You.

224
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,200
It's so hot.

225
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,600
Let's go! I'll take you to the hospital.

226
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,200
Mr. You, I don't have to go to the hospital.

227
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,900
I just have a few days like this every month.

228
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,500
Then you go back to bed.

229
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,400
I'll cook ginger soup for you.

230
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,200
That's the bathroom.

231
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,500
T-The kitchen is over there.

232
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,700
You have a fever caused by…

233
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,400
by your period.

234
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,300
Open your mouth.

235
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,800
Let me do it myself.

236
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,200
Hurry up and go, or you'll be late.

237
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,900
I'm not going.

238
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,100
You can't do that.

239
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,000
Mr. Zhang has specifically asked you to

240
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,200
sit next to him at his birthday party.

241
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,300
How can you be absent?

242
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,400
What can they do to me?

243
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,200
If you are not going, I won't drink this.

244
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,600
You…

245
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,200
Eat the ginger soup, and I'll go.

246
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,700
I'll show my face and be right back.

247
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,900
Lie down.

248
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,000
Wait for me.

249
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,600
Why isn't he here yet?

250
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,200
My dear, this is the hairstyle you've prepared for five hours?

251
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,100
Don't speak. Hurry up.

252
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,500
What's the plan today? I have to go soon.

253
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,900
Where are you going?

254
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,300
I'm in love.

255
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,900
You Xi, you're getting funny.

256
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,400
The plan for tonight is simple.

257
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,600
After Mr. Zhang makes a birthday wish, you'll congratulate him.

258
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,400
I wrote a speech for you.

259
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,300
Wait for me.

260
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,700
Thankfully, our company is really thriving this year.

261
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:03,000
The ratings for "Accidently Fallen In Love With You" have broken records.

262
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,700
In my opinion, there is no question that it will become the best of the year.

263
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,000
Good!

264
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,900
At present, "The Realm of the Three Kingdoms" will start shooting,

265
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:15,599
which has a huge investment and is a big-budget production.

266
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,900
And with the best actor and actress from our company,

267
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,400
as well as the popular celebrities,

268
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,800
it will be a hit.

269
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,200
Wonderful!

270
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,400
Thanks to the company's patronage for so many years,

271
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,800
we will continue to work hard in the future.

272
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
- Thanks.
- Great!

273
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:39,100
Today, in order to wish "The Realm of the Three Kingdoms" a smooth shooting and a great rating,

274
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,400
I've specially asked people to arrange the banquet here.

275
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,500
Look!

276
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,800
It's quaint, with a small bridge and flowing water.

277
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,200
It's very fitting.

278
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,800
- Third Uncle, when can I eat?
- when I'm in it… I want to recite a song

279
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,400
It'll be over soon.

280
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,400
As the ancient said,

281
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,200
enjoy yourself when you can,

282
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,000
and never waste the chance to drink under the moon.

283
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,500
Great!

284
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,200
Come on, Mr. Zhang. Blow out the candles.

285
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,800
Yes, yes, blow out the candles.

286
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,000
♪ Mr. Zhang, happy birthday to you! ♪

287
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:29,600
♪ Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! ♪

288
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,600
Thanks, everyone!

289
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,300
Blow out the candles.

290
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,000
I hope…

291
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,900
Mr. Zhang, happy birthday!

292
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,799
Good! I hope we'll…

293
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:49,359
We'll… work hard together in the future.

294
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:51,959
Come on, Mr. Zhang. Here is a toast to you.

295
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:54,400
I wish you to be blessed and live a prosperous life.

296
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,640
Enjoy your dinner, guys!

297
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,140
Thanks.

298
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,519
Please, have a seat.

299
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,039
Help yourselves, guys.

300
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,640
You Xi, you are trying to leave so soon?

301
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,480
Mr. Zhang, You Xi has something to do.

302
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:30,680
If you want to go, give a toast to everyone here today first, and I'll let you go.

303
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:52,359
That's right.

304
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:55,060
Come on, eat, eat. Drink!

305
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:01,339
Come on, come on, eat. Drink! Come on.

306
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,239
Third Uncle, wait for me.

307
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:14,879
Walk slowly.

308
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,941
Hold on.

309
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,279
It's your turn, isn't it? Come on.

310
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:25,500
I-I-I can't drink.

311
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,980
Third Uncle. Sorry. He's drunk.

312
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,832
You may go. Go! Go! Sorry.

313
00:23:31,832 --> 00:23:33,532
Third Uncle.

314
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,259
You Xi is counting on you for his publicity expenses this year.

315
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:50,000
Okay. Okay.

316
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,032
Second Uncle. Second…

317
00:23:52,032 --> 00:23:55,439
Come on. Give a toast to Mr. Zhang.

318
00:24:00,979 --> 00:24:02,760
Third Uncle. Third Uncle!

319
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,030
Little Wood.

320
00:24:05,699 --> 00:24:07,780
Little Wood.

321
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:11,179
Little Wood.

322
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,490
[Pan Duo]

323
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,160
Hi, Duo Duo.

324
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,720
Yaoyao, come quickly! Third Uncle got drunk.

325
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,279
I can't move him by myself.

326
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:32,839
Mr. You got drunk?

327
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,859
I'll be on my way.

328
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,480
Third Uncle, you have to hide well.

329
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,419
Don't let me find you.

330
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:04,739
Duo Duo.

331
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:07,480
Why are you here?

332
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,480
Yaoyao, you are finally here!

333
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,020
If you didn't show up, Third Uncle would have killed me.

334
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,200
Where's Mr. You then?

335
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,920
Mr. You.

336
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,800
Maybe you didn't know. When Third Uncle gets drunk,

337
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,400
he behaves badly.

338
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,839
He kept chasing me and wanted to play the game of an eagle catching chicks with me.

339
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:46,300
I was afraid others might see, so I persuaded him to play hide-and-seek.

340
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,780
Mr. You, let's get up first. Come on.

341
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:59,519
What do you want?

342
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:01,079
She wants to take you home.

343
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:05,200
I'm not going home. I'm going to wait for Little Wood.

344
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,079
You are going to wait for Little Wood? Why?

345
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:10,100
I… I…

346
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,039
What do you want?

347
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,580
I'm going to ask Little Wood to be my girlfriend.

348
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:25,720
You'll ask Little Wood to be your girlfriend?

349
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,659
What if Little Wood refuses?

350
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,680
Duo Duo, stop kidding.

351
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:40,919
If L-Little Wood refuses, I won't…

352
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,473
I won't go home. I'll…

353
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,880
- Mr. You!
- Third Uncle, don't go.

354
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,240
Look! Little Wood is here.

355
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:57,959
Look! She's here.

356
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:01,038
- Little Wood.
- Here. Here.

357
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,000
It's really Little Wood.

358
00:27:16,709 --> 00:27:19,813
Mr. You, let's go home, shall we?

359
00:27:19,813 --> 00:27:24,653
Little Wood, will you be my girlfriend?

360
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,680
She's not saying anything.

361
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,939
She's not Little Wood.

362
00:27:37,939 --> 00:27:40,699
Little Wood likes me.

363
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,839
I'll go to find my Little Wood.

364
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:46,475
Yaoyao, just say yes. Just say yes first.

365
00:27:46,475 --> 00:27:49,575
He won't remember anything tomorrow morning when he wakes up anyway.

366
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,039
I'll be your girlfriend then.

367
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,920
Drink up! I can still drink.

368
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,960

Isn't it my youth?

Isn't that You Xi?

371
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,039
You Xi, which You Xi?

372
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,619
Why does it sound so familiar?

373
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:49,039
Mr. Zhang, you're wrong. You Xi has long gone home.

374
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,940
Well, can't let them see you two here.

375
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,879
Quick! Quick! Hurry up and leave!

376
00:28:55,539 --> 00:28:57,380
Stop! Don't run!

377
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:01,519
Second Uncle! I'm very… very dizzy. I'm drunk.

378
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:04,319
- Who's that girl?
- I-I-I don't know. I'm drunk.

379
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:06,019
I didn't see her clearly.

380
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,500
You Xi, are you all right? You Xi?

381

You Xi, what did she do to you? You Xi.

382
00:29:28,611 --> 00:29:33,139
Duo Duo, you really didn't see the face of the pervert who kissed You Xi?

No.

Second Uncle, wait for me.

385
00:29:56,273 --> 00:29:59,340
Third Uncle, do you remember that you asked a waiter for a toast when you got drunk last night?

386
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,406
No.

387
00:30:00,406 --> 00:30:02,519
Do you remember you dragged me to play the game of an eagle catching chicks?

388
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:03,579
No.

389
00:30:03,579 --> 00:30:06,039
What about hide-and-seek? You remember hide-and-seek, do you?

390
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:09,319
I said I don't remember. I don't remember. I don't remember!

You're so annoying…

That's a great relief. Bye-bye!

393

She's so annoying.

394

Little Wood, will you be my girlfriend?

395
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,340
I'll be your girlfriend then.

Last night?

Didn't you say you didn't remember anything?

408
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:33,259
Yaoyao agreed to be my girlfriend.

409
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,160
I have an errand.

410
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,800
I'll get going.

411
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:54,540
Yaoyao!

412
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:00,040
Third Uncle got so drunk last night

413
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,680
and asked me to play hide-and-seek with him for an hour, and my bones almost fall apart,

414
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,179
but he only remembers that Yaoyao said yes to him.

he's bound to hit a few bumps.

Then, what about a girl who just fell in love for the first time?

418

Stop pretending that you are all right.

419
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,319
Say something or I'll head back.

420
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:04,060
Brother Chao,

421
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,920
I'm disappointed in love.

422
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,360
You haven't even been together.

423
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,240
Already disappointed?

424
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:15,259
She said that she had casually said yes

425
00:34:15,259 --> 00:34:16,920
only because I was drunk.

426
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,280
Then what?

427
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,139
Then… I left.

428
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,679
I don't think Yaoyao finished what she had to say.

429
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,639
What do you mean?

430
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,559
Yaoyao is slow sometimes.

431
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:31,499
