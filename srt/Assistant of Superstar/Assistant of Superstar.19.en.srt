It's good.

36
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:31,878
It's very tasty.

37

The dish is coming!

40
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:45,973
Help yourselves. There's more coming.

41
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,165
You Xi, I want another dish of shredded potatoes.

42
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:51,973
Okay!

43
00:01:51,973 --> 00:01:54,920
This is the You Xi I've painstakingly taken care of for years.

44
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,120
He's precious and delicate,

45
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,592
but he actually lives such a life here.

46
00:02:01,592 --> 00:02:03,913
You actually see him as a cook.

Brother Dazhuang, do you want another bowl of rice?

48
00:02:14,752 --> 00:02:17,752
No need. I'll get it myself.

49
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:28,100
I can make you the leading man of Zhongfu,

50
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,680
but there's one condition.

51
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,020
What is it?

52
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,879
Be the spokesman for the Huateng Hotel.

53

It's a piece of cake.

54
00:02:38,426 --> 00:02:40,153
It's free.

55
00:02:41,686 --> 00:02:44,719
Do you know how much my endorsement fee is?

56
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,500
I know you're switching your career.

57
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,811

58

Okay.

59

61
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,800
I'm going back to Jiangzhou soon.

62
00:03:47,813 --> 00:03:50,113
I'll keep you company then.

63
00:03:50,113 --> 00:03:52,264
Why do you want to keep me company?

64
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:54,180
I don't have the energy to look after you.

65
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,399
- But I—
- Don't worry about me.

66
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:58,180
Public opinion just works that way.

67
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,200
It'll soon pass.

68
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,760
When the wind blows over, you'll return.

69
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,999
You Xi, when you return to the company,

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,064
you must apologize to Director Zhang.

71
00:04:19,065 --> 00:04:20,779
You must be sincere.

72
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:22,800
I've written the speech for you.

73
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,733
Then you find time to visit the advertisers one by one,

74
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,616
trying both the logical and emotional approach.

75
00:04:28,617 --> 00:04:30,699
- Then you—
- Dazhuang.

76
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:32,359
Professor, I'm Morry.

77
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,039
Meow, meow.

78
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:36,440
There's something I'd like to talk about with you.

79
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:39,500
Meow, right?

80
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,878
- Morry.
- Meowry.

81
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:45,159
No wonder you like braised fish.

82
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:48,020
- Sweet and sour fish.
- Sweet and sour fish. Sweet and sour fish.

83
00:04:56,906 --> 00:05:00,448
Then I'll… go back.

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,439
You Xi, have a safe trip.

85
00:06:04,152 --> 00:06:07,092
I don't want to come back to this damn place again.

86

"No matter how difficult the road ahead is,

87
00:06:11,645 --> 00:06:15,106
we'll overcome one step at a time going forward!"

88
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:32,699
Hold on. There's a strange smell.

89
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,285
There's a stranger in our company.

90
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:35,720
You can even smell that?

91
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,740

00:06:41,606 --> 00:06:44,346
Brother You Xi, I hope we can learn from each other.

95
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,120
Director Zhang, don't worry. I'll definitely finish the task.

96
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,228
Director Zhang.

97
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,783
This is Lucy, a new artist agent in the company.

98
00:06:59,783 --> 00:07:01,994
You should get to know each other.

99
00:07:01,994 --> 00:07:04,746
I've already left her in charge of the company.

100
00:07:04,746 --> 00:07:06,418
If you have any question, just ask her.

101
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:08,039
Director Zhang.

102
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:12,800
I hope we can learn from each other.

103
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,099
Brother Morry, that is Miss Lucy's office now.

104
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:23,843
Your new office is over there.

105
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:27,221
Why? I'm You Xi's agent.

106
00:07:27,221 --> 00:07:29,800
You Xi is a has-been.

107
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,283
The company has paid a high price to recruit a new star from other companies.

108
00:07:36,284 --> 00:07:38,932
He's a promising young star.

109
00:07:38,932 --> 00:07:41,375
He's as good as You Xi in every aspect.

110
00:07:41,376 --> 00:07:43,124
He has great potential.

111
00:07:43,124 --> 00:07:46,480
I believe you've met each other.

112
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,019
I have something to do, so I'll get going now.

113
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,095
Where are my things?

114
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:01,030
I'll help you move them here later.

115
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,403
What the hell happened?

116
00:08:02,403 --> 00:08:06,269
Mr. Morry, during your absence, Lucy took advantage of the situation

117
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,026
and controlled most of the affairs regarding the management of the artists.

118
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:12,120
She also took your office for herself.

119
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,369
Even Xiao Yi and Xiao Wu defected and became her assistants.

120
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,518
She persuaded Director Zhang to poach Wen Moxuan

121
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,739
from Donghuang Entertainment at a high price

122
00:08:20,739 --> 00:08:24,423
to replace You Xi and have him become the company's new top-billing star.

123
00:08:24,424 --> 00:08:27,743
All the company's resources have already been given to him.

124
00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:30,198
The situation is not looking too good.

125
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,807
Lucy!

126
00:08:31,807 --> 00:08:33,599
Wen Moxuan.

127
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,280
- I'll wring your neck!
- I'll wring your neck!

128
00:08:45,622 --> 00:08:49,000
Do they think that they can change You Xi's

129
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,930
and my position in the company easily?

130
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:56,100
Xiao Qi, come with me and let's visit all the advertisers.

131
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,865
As long as we still have You Xi, our ace in the hole,

132
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:01,476
and my clever tongue,

133
00:09:01,476 --> 00:09:05,332
they'll change their minds sooner or later.

134
00:09:05,332 --> 00:09:07,692
I'll lecture them...

135

[You Xi]

162
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,700
Douban Goddess!

163
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,000
Douban Goddess! We meet again.

164
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,500
Why do you always call me Douban Goddess?

165
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,300
You're a celebrity of Douban now.

166
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,800
You've been popular for one week.

167
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,600
You don't know that?

168
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,400
Hold on.

169
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
Look!

170
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,800
You wrote these poems, didn't you?

171
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,400
They are very encouraging and inspiring.

172
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,600
They have ancient rhymes and show the awakening of modern consciousness in women.

173
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,300
I really admire you.

174
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,900
I did write the poems,

175
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,000
but I never posted them on the Internet.

176
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,200
What?

177
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,000
Then there must be someone who did it for you.

178
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,800
Look! They are well-written and convincing.

179
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,900
If not, wouldn't a talented woman like you never see the light of day?

180
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,700
Rest assured. The netizens are on your side now.

181
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,600
You're getting hotter and hotter.

182
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
Mr. You.

183
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,600
Let me have a look.

184
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,300
What are you doing? Why are you flirting with another girl?

185
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,300
- I'm not.
- Come over here.

186
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,600
Please hear me out!

187

[Be well, You Xi!]

188
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,400
Dad, are you feeling unwell?

189
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,000
Do you want me to get you some medicine?

190
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,500
Medicine is useless.

191
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,200
How do you know that if you don't try?

192
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,200
If I say it doesn't work, it doesn't work.

193
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,400
My illness…

194
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,800
As long as I eat You Xi's diced chicken with chilis, I'll recover.

195
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,400
Rice wine.

196
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,000
Vinegar.

197
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,700
It tastes good.

198
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,600
What delicious food did you make?

199
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,000
Diced chicken with chilis. Try some.

200
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,400
- Diced chicken with chilis?
- My daughter made it.

201
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,600
Putting vinegar in diced chicken with chilis?

202
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,200
What are you thinking about?

203
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Don't ruin my kitchen. I'm throwing it away.

204
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,000
Don't. Don't do that.

205
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Sir, it's my daughter who cooked it. I love it.

206
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,700
Get me a bowl of rice. Rice. Rice.

207
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,400
No, it's not cooked like that.

208
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,400

Good things do not come easy.

Ask You Xi to get ready to go back to work.

222
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,800
Okay.

223
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,400
What do the advertisers say?

224
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,600
Brother Morry, rest assured.

225
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,400
After the last negotiation, they said they wouldn't sue us for breach of contract,

226
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,900
but they needed to rewrite the contract.

227
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,600
I'll send you the new contracts later.

228

Lucy has been making great strides for now.

229

I'll give her a surprise attack.

230
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,100
Let's go.

231
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,000
How do you deal with the advertisers?

232
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,500
Director Zhang, rest assured.

233
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,800
We're handling it.

234
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,400
There will be results soon.

235
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,700
Diretor Zhang, I've handled it.

236
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,300
After I negotiated with the advertisers,

237
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,400
they've agreed not to sue our company for breach of contract

238
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
due to the exposure of You Xi's love affair.

239
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,100
The contracts need to be rewritten

240
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,300
and the spokesperson must be replaced by Wen Moxuan.

241
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,200
You!

242
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,600

244
00:17:27,386 --> 00:17:29,799
This is Wen Moxuan's schedule for the following week.

245
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,600
Please check it.

246
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,100
I'll get back to work now.

247
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,600
By the way, I heard that the script of "The Realm of the Three Kingdom" has been modified.

248
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,300
The male lead has been changed to Zhao Zilong

249
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,700
and You Xi's part has been completed.

250

What?

251
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,000
You Xi, I'm also very disappointed.

252
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I didn't expect Lucy to be so sinister.

253
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,800
She actually plotted against me in front of Director Zhang.

254
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,000
Listen.

255
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,600
You don't have to worry.

256
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,000
Just give me a little time.

257
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,900
I'll definitely teach Lucy a lesson.

258

You keep eating and eating.

259
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,900
Do you know how much you spend on snacks every month?

260
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,900
Look. Why don't you look at how much you've spent?

261
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,400
Second Uncle, you spend more money on skincare products than I do on snacks every month.

262
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,200
I'm telling you! These are extraordinary times right now.

263
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,300
Your Third Uncle's affair has cost my bonus for the year.

264
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,300
The company has hired a new artist agent and cut my salary in half.

265
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,000
Our rent is due soon.

266
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,100
What should we do then?

267
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
There's only one way out.

268
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,400
Let's sell our property.

269
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,900
Sell our property?

270
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,800
What property do we have?

271
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,200
Didn't we rent this place?

272
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,400
Your Second Uncle has worked for so many years.

273
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,900
I've got these luxury handbags, shoes, red wine,

274
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,300
and my precious golf clubs.

275
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,200
I believe if I sell them all,

276
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,700
there will be enough money to help us live for a few months.

277
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,000
Second Uncle, rest assured.

278
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,600

- I'm sorry about "The Realm of the Three Kingdoms."

Because of You Xi's problem,

281
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,500
we can only stop him from taking part in the shooting temporarily

282
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,700
in order to reduce the risk of the project and ensure the funding.

283
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,000
Xiao Wang, I've bothered you enough about it.

284

It's true. Believe me. He's super busy.

I don't want you to see me like this.

323
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,600
I don't want you to think I'm useless.

324
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,600
I don't want you to go through trouble because of me.

00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,800
I don't want you to—

I missed you.

What are you looking at? Eat.

338
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,000
Mr. You, I remember earlier you told me

339
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,200
vinegar was the soul of the diced chicken,

340
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,800
but I saw that you didn't use vinegar just now.

341
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,200
I was afraid that you wouldn't like

342
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,100
to eat my chicken if you learned to cook it.

343
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,600
What are you looking at? Eat.

344
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,500
Eat more. You lost weight.

345
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,000
This is a new dish I learned to make today.

346
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,400
This.

[Xiao Qi]

348
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Hello?

349
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Brother Morry is fighting Sister Lucy.

350
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,700
What?

351
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
That bitch.

352
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
I'll kick her out sooner or later.

353
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,700
Brother DaZhuang, what on earth happened for you to personally fight with her?

354
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,800
You Xi, you don't know this.

355
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,500
I swallowed my pride to get you the opportunity to attend a variety show,

356
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,400
but Lucy took it away and recommended Wen Moxuan.

357
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,600
It's absolutely unacceptable.

358
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,300
So I grabbed her.

359
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,600
Then she slapped me

360
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,200
and then both of us fought with each other.

361
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,300
I'm a little dizzy.

362
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,400
Sorry. I forgot my place.

363
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,600
Brother Dazhuang, it's just a variety show.

364
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,900
You Xi, don't consider it to be just a variety show.

365
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,600
It's a starting point.

366
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,000
In one word,

367
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,200
Lucy is trying to build Wen Moxuan up to completely crush you.

368
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,200
Besides, Wen Moxuan

369
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,100
has many more resources and exposure than you did in your heyday.

370
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,800
Wen Moxuan will overtake your follower count.

371
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,300
If this continues,

372
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:58,500
I'm afraid there'll be no place for you in this company.

373
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,700
- Sister Yaoyao.
- Brother You Xi.

374
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,200
You may leave first. Thank you for your hard work.

375
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,300
Sister Yaoyao, long time no see.

376
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,600
Long time no see, Moxuan.

377
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,400
Sister Yaoyao, you…

378
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,200
Have you seen my press conference?

379
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,800
I did.

380
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,900
Do you think...

381
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,800
we're made for each other and a perfect match?

382
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,500
He doesn't get many likes or comments, either.

383
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,800
His numbers can't even be compared with my original numbers.

384
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,800
The accounts are from fake fans.

385
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,500
If they're not fake, I'll write my name upside down.

386
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,000
Look at this.

387
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,800
This. This.

388
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,700
He even posts a love scene on Weibo.

389
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,600
He's exaggerating.

390
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,900
What… are you doing?

391
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,500
Mr. You.

392
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,700
You put your love life on display so suddenly

393
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,400
that your fans must be very confused.

394
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,000
But I believe they'll be very happy

395

when you officially return with your work.

396
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,800
Yes.

397

When I officially return,

398
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,000
I'll have him on the run.

399

[SG Ent]

401
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,100
It's been a month since You Xi put his love affair on display.

402
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,700
Netizens have gradually stopped discussing his affair.

403
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,300
It has failed to become one of the top 100 trending topics in the past two weeks.

404
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,300
His previously established fan base is crumbling.

405
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,000
In addition, the advertisers are strongly against

406
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,600
You Xi's disclosure of his romance.

407
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,900
They think working with an artist who doesn't adhere to the contract

408
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,600
is like having a ticking time bomb. No one dares take the risk.

409
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,500
Director Zhang, I see that Wen Moxuan's popularity has soared recently.

410
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
He's a dark horse in the show business.

411
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,600
If we concentrate on promoting him,

412
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,400
I'm sure he'll make a breakthrough in a short time.

413
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,900
So, I think all the manpower and resources of our company

414
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,600
should be given to him right now.

415
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,600
Director Zhang, based on You Xi's current situation,

416
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,300
it may not be a good thing

417
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,000
if he continues to show up in public.

418
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,600
I think we should wait until public opinion cools down.

419

Hold on. What do you mean by that?

420
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,200
Are you trying to kick You Xi out of showbiz?

421
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,700
Lucy, you make it sound so nice.

422
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,300
Tell me. What are you up to?

423
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,000
Let You Xi

424
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,100
- take a break from showbiz for a while.
- Director Zhang.

425
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,000
It's a breach of contract for an artist to secretly announce his love life.

426
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,200
Director Zhang was kind enough to let him off the hook.

427
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,800
Besides, for the sake of You Xi's long-term development,

428
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,400
letting him take from showbiz temporarily isn't a bad thing.

429
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,200
Isn't he trying to switch his image?

430
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,200
This is a way.

431
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,800
Changing an image and switching careers are two different things.

432
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,900
Don't twist things around.

433
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,100
Director Zhang, just give You Xi a little time.

434
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,200
I've given you a lot of time.

435
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,600
Unfortunately, it looks like You Xi's career transition has failed.

436
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,800
Director Zhang!

437
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
- How was it?
- You Xi,

438
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,400
the company had a meeting.

They decided to put your career on hold

for a period of time

441
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,600
after careful deliberation.

442
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,600
It's temporary.

443
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,400
You still have a chance to make a comeback.

444
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,000
It just requires time.

445
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,400
Don't think too much.

446
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,900
Hello? You Xi?

447
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,200
A-Are you still listening?

448
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,200
I'm fine with it.

449
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,900
I can rest now.

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,200
You Xi's company has temporarily suspended him.

Any comeback is not in sight.

Mr. You.

453
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,300
Are you going out?

454
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,800
Brother Chao has some difficulties at work and asked me to keep him company.

455
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,400
I'll get going.

456
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,000
Brother Chao, don't stop.

457
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,300
Didn't you drink enough?

458
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,500
Hurry and go home.

459
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,200
I'm a man.

460
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,800
I don't want Little Wood to see me like this.

461
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,500
It's too embarrassing.

462
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,400
Aren't you supposed to be comforting me?

463
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,900
There's a saying that goes like this.

464
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,800
Good times don't last long.

465
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
It's better to retire when you're in your heyday

466
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,400
than to be forgotten gradually.

467
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,200
Isn't that great?

468
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,000
Is that comforting?

469
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,900
I'm done comforting.

470
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,200
Now I want to say something serious.

471
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,700
Do you want to hear it?

472
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,000
No.

473
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,300
I made my debut when I was fifteen years old,

474
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,600
and I was in the film industry for ten years.

475
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,500
Then, I became a singer.

476
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,000
I know better than you that

477
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,200
there's no shortage of new talent in the entertainment industry.

478
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,800
It's very easy to become an overnight sensation,

479
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,000
but it's even easier to be forgotten by viewers.

480
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,800
No matter how lively the acting is,

481
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:54,800
when it's over, the last person is never the most popular

482
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,200
but...

483
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,400
the most capable.

484
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,400
Are you praising yourself?

485
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,900
Yes.

486
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,900
Do you understand what I'm saying?

487
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,900
No.

488
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,600
I can still drink.

489
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,800
Have him sober up. I'm going home.

490
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,100
Thank you, Mr. Qi Chao.

491
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,860
By the way, how is Pan Duo doing?

492
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,300
Mr. Qi Chao, if you really care about Duo Duo,

493
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,700
why don't you ask her in person?

494
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,400
Forget it. It's nothing.

495
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,000
Pandora, bye!

496
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,200
What's going on?

497
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,800
What's going on? Can't you see?

498
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,700
Second Uncle, your idea of selling your property…

499
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,500
isn't it a little too much?

500
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,600
Do you think that I wanted to do that?

501
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,200
I don't have a bonus and my salary has been reduced.

502
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,400
Just put up with it and live here.

503
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,700
Why do you use this glass to drink red wine?

504
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,000
You used to be so particular.

505
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,600
The only dignity your uncle has is this glass.

506
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,200
Second Uncle, don't worry.

507
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,800
During difficult times, we must weather the storm together and share sorrows.

508
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,900
I'll keep you company.

509
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,800
You deserve my concern.

510
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,200
Tomorrow, I'll move into my idol's place so that I can save money for us.

511
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,600
Good girl.

512
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,000
Go. Go!

513
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,400
Go and don't come back any more!

514
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,200
Why don't you go now? I said go.

515
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,600
Pan Duo, you brat.

516
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,900
Mr. You.

517
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,200
Mr. You.

518
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,200
Are you all right?

519
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,600
I'm okay not being part of showbiz.

520
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,000
I can eat what I want

521
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,700
and wear what I want from now on.

522
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,200
None of you can control me.

523
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,500
Come over here. I'll help you up.

524
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,000
Let's go to bed.

525
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,000
- Slow down.
- Where are you taking me?

526
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,200
I'll take you to your room so that you can sleep.

527
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,200
I can still drink.

528
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,200
Go to sleep.

529
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,600
Mr. You, I'll get hot water for you to wash your face.

530
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,000
Are you my fan?

531
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,400
Mr. You.

532
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,600
Are you?

533
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,000
I am.

534
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,400
I've been fond of you for a long time.

535
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,600
And I'm head of your fan base.

536
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,900
Then, what do you like about me?

537
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,700
I like you...

538
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,400
because you keep me company when I'm sad.

539
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,000
I like how you stood in front of me

540
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
when I was in danger.

541
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,700
I like… the diced chicken with chili you cooked for me.

542
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,000
I like the soup you cooked.

543
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,800
I like how you gave me medicine when I was sick.

544
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,500
♫  I have already given you my heart for safekeeping  ♫

545
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:10,200
♫  But I can't guess the sad future  ♫

546
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:16,900
♫  I'm not willing to let go of this love  ♫

547
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:21,200
♫  Just like a fish without water, it cannot exist  ♫

548
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,900
♫  can only prove that you deserve it  ♫

549
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,900
Mr. You, good morning.

550
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,300
Breakfast will be ready soon.

551
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,200
Go and wash up.

552
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,000
Regarding being shelved,

553
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I didn't intentionally hide it from you.

554
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,800
I just wanted to tell you when I calmed down.

555
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,400
I know.

556
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,300
You didn't want me to feel sorry for you.

557
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,000
Mr. You, when the two people are together,

558
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,100
whether it's happiness or sorrow,

559
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,400
we have to share and bear the burden together.

560
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,400
I'd rather you didn't tell me something happy and secretly feel happy by yourself.

561
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,100
I just don't want you to feel sad by yourself.

562
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,000
I won't do that again.

563
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,700
Let's have breakfast.

564
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,000
I'll go.

565
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,800
Mr. You, Xiao Qi sent you fan letters.

566
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,200
Really?

567
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,000
These aren't necessarily fan letters.

568
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,300
They may be hate mail.

569
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,500
I'll read the letter for you.

570
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,400
Let's have breakfast first.

571
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,600
The first letter.

572
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,700
What happened?

573
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,700
Is there a word you don't know?

574
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,600
Dear You Xi,

575
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,200
I can't get enough of all the TV shows

576
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,200
[To You Xi: You loser, you're in so many bad films.]
you've ever been on.

577
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,500
You're a natural actor.

578
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:53,800
[Acting is not for you, please get out of the industry?]
I hope you'll become a better actor

579
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,800
and you can bring us more good works.

580
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,100
I've liked you since you made your debut.

581
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,600
Now I realize how stupid…

582
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,400
[To You Xi: I've liked you since your debut. I now realized how stupid I was.]

583
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,400
[Because I liked a good-for-nothing loser like you.]

584
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,400
I was stupid,

585
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,100
because I was so blinded by your handsome face

586
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:36,100
that I didn't see your beautiful heart.

587
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,900
Mr. You, I think the letters are all the same.

588
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,400
I'll take them home, sort them out, and give them to you.

589
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,000
Hold on.

590
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,500
They are written by my fans.

591
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,600
I will take them back to my room to be

592
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,600
a memento.

593
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,600
I'm full.

594
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,200
Mr. You.

595
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,000
Mr. You.

596
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:16,600
I've kept the letters and gifts from my fans since my debut.

597
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,100
I'll take them out and look at them when I'm unhappy.

598
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,700
As long as I have fans,

599
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,400
even if it's just one fan,

600
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,600
I'll keep going.

601
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,600
Come on. Let's go have noodles.

603
