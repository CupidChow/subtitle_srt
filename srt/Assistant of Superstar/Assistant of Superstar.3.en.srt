162
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,140
T-T-This is a misunderstanding.

163
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,729
This one is good. Look!

164
00:09:57,729 --> 00:09:59,040
Perfume Body Spray.

165
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,110
No. Show me other endorsements.

166
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,869
You Xi, this matter is more serious than I thought.

167
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,885
This morning, five companies contacted me hoping to terminate their endorsements.

168
00:10:08,895 --> 00:10:11,999
There are also seven companies in negotiation. This shows that there is no intention to cooperate.

169
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:14,709
And the rest of the endorsements, such as this perfume body spray,

170
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:16,509
is quite outstanding.

171
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,700
Do you think it fits our image?

172
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,270
Of course!

173
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,669
And it doesn't conflict with other endorsements.

174
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,245
Did you see the filming location?

175
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:26,509
I did.

176
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,629
Dabaoshan Wetland Park.

177
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,961
That must be a place no one wants to go to.

178
00:10:29,961 --> 00:10:32,599
- You should go yourself.
- No, no, no.

179
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,864
This is a great place with 4 A's rating and picturesque scenery.

180
00:10:35,865 --> 00:10:37,960
Just treat it like you're traveling.

181
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,502
I need to concentrate on preparing for "Zhongfu" for director Wei Ran.

182
00:10:40,503 --> 00:10:43,830
- There's no time.
- Mr. You, I will arrange your study plan.

183
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,741
You can spend a day shooting advertisements. It's doable.

184
00:10:46,741 --> 00:10:48,961
I just don't want to go.

185
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,957
Mr. You, Goujian, the Emperor of Yue, always remembered his humiliation, and

186
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,300
Han Xin also endured the humiliation of crawling through between someone's legs.

187
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,378
This is an extraordinary time, so changes must be made.

188
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:06,599
If you are old-fashioned, you will get eliminated.

189
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,930
This is exactly what Song Qiege wants.

190
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,840
President Sun, please understand that it took me

191
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,199
a lot of effort to persuade You Xi

192
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,199
and the company regarding this endorsement.

193
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,525
So about the later advertising and publicity…

194
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:26,744
please be generous.

195
00:11:26,745 --> 00:11:27,884
Of course.

196
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:29,779
The fact that we can invite You Xi to do the endorsement,

197
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,714
I'm sure I won't waste such a good time.

198
00:11:31,715 --> 00:11:33,905
- Let's have a good collaboration.
- Let's have a good collaboration.

199
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,690
So this is called a 4A attraction.
(T/N: Tourist Attraction Rating 1A to 5A, 5A being highest level.)

200
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,770
There is no one in sight.

201
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:56,170
Dabaoshan Wetland Park. What about the mountains?

202
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:00,851
Mr. You, there must be a reason why people call it a 4A attraction.

203
00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:02,490
We're just shooting commercials for one day.

204
00:12:02,491 --> 00:12:04,652
Don't be overly nervous about it.

205
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,250
4A tourist attraction.

206
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,994
Mr. You, let's go in and have a look.

207
00:12:14,994 --> 00:12:17,150
Maybe there is another village inside.

208
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,930
See for yourself.

209
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,830
The A's in your 4A are all lowercase.

210
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,870
[National Tourist Attraction]
[aaaa]

211
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,670
Where do you get so many mosquitoes in this hellhole?

212
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,480
Why didn't you give me a fan?

213
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,600
Please be careful, Mr. You.

214
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,270
What's so strange about a rotten fan?

215
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,290
Insist…

216
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,190
Insist…

217
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,913
Insist that Qingshan does not relax.

218
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:04,150
The root was originally in the broken rock.

219
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,410
I can understand.

220
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,530
You're good at writing.

221
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,839
Mr. You, I didn't write this.

222
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,893
This is a poem by Zheng Banqiao.
(T/N: one of the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou during the Qing Dynasty)

223
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:17,426
"Orchids, Bamboo, and Rocks."

224
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,080
What I mean is, your calligraphy is good.

225
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,845
I didn't write the words either.

226
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:26,719
My calligraphy isn't elegant.

227
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,327
How boring.

228
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:43,355
How much is this fan?

229
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:44,910
I'll compensate you.

230
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,727
This is an original by Zheng Banqiao.

231
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:49,717
There's only one.

232
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,880
Shot One, Take Two.

233
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:01,750
Cool Summer Perfume Body Spray gives you a whole summer of refreshment.

234
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,448
Cut, Mr. You. Let's do it again.

235
00:14:04,448 --> 00:14:07,909
Smile a little brighter this time. Okay?

236
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:09,510
Action!

237
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,301
- Cool Summer Perfume Body Spray gives you a whole summer of refreshment.
- Cut.

238
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:17,870
Mr. You, cut. The perfume body spray bottle. Raise it a little higher.

239
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,491
Let's do it again.

240
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,641
And… action!

241
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,770
Cool Summer Perfume Body Spray gives you a whole summer of refreshment.

242
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,791
Cut. Pass.

243
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,934
Thank you, Mr. You.

244
00:14:30,935 --> 00:14:32,675
Thank you for your hard work.

245
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,330
Hey!

246
00:14:43,937 --> 00:14:45,848
[I'm an actor. My assistant is angry with me. What should I do?]

247
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,987
There are a lot of artists.

248
00:14:58,987 --> 00:15:01,487
Are you a singer or an actor?

249
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,264
Do you wash your underwear by yourself?

250
00:15:05,265 --> 00:15:07,634
Be an artist's assistant. Do you have all the insurances covered?

251
00:15:07,634 --> 00:15:09,389
It turns out that artists also come to visit the bar.

252
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,530
Let's go after a big story.

253
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,669
The little assistant is angry and you're this anxious?.

254
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:20,820
Do you like your assistant?

255
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,210
That's impossible. No way.

256
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,399
You Xi. You Xi!

257
00:15:39,173 --> 00:15:40,790
We'll start shooting.

258
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,610
Give us a big smile.

259
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,439
Spread your personal charm.

260
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,439
We want people to feel that spraying this perfume body spray

261
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,100
is the same as spraying the perfume of a god.

262
00:15:51,101 --> 00:15:52,639
Okay?

263
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,198
Okay. I understand.

264
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:57,409
All right. Turn it on.

265
00:15:58,596 --> 00:16:01,818
Ready. Action!

266
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,999
Who is sleeping there?

267
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,223
Director, that's Mr. You Xi's assistant.

268
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,150
It's too tiring to shoot in this place.

269
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,980
She wanted to take a nap. Is that a problem?

270
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,665
Move that way.

271
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,642
Action!

272
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,249
Cut. That's it.

273
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:57,392
Let's take a rest first.

274
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:01,537
Director, is it my fault?

275
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:03,720
No, no, no. It's not your fault.

276
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,350
It's… the fault of the photographer.

277
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,750
The focus is not right.

278
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,859
You can't even focus on him. Get closer.

279
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,670
No, no, no.

280
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,820
Men and women should not touch each other when giving or receiving something.

281
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,000
She may wake up later, thinking I am a pervert.

282
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,789
Are you kidding me?

283
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,640
I am so handsome.

284
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,400
I don't need to worry.

285
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,550
Who will believe it when you say it.

286
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,970
No way. No way.

287
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,010
Do as you please

288
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,720
It's really none of my business.

289
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,930
Forget it. Forget it.

290
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,450
Apply and then leave. No one would know.

291
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,140
It's settled then.

292
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,099
Don't move. You'll attract the mosquitoes.

293
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:33,920
This place is full of mosquitoes.

294
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,820
There are mosquitoes there. There are mosquitoes there, too.

295
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,760
Your face!

296
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,087
There is a big mosquito.

297
00:18:54,087 --> 00:18:55,322
Where?

298
00:18:55,323 --> 00:18:56,856
Don't move.

299
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,069
What happened to his face?

300
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,750
I tried my best to cover it up, Director.

301
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,880
The right side looks good. Film the right side.

302
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,920
Cool Summer Perfume Body Spray gives you a whole summer of refreshment.

303
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,470
Mr. You, look!

304
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,599
What? Is it an airplane?

305
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:47,610
The sunset.

306
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,829
There's rain on the Phoenix Mountain Chu Qing.

307
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,140
The water is clear and the sunset is bright.

308
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:01,060
Isn't it very artistic?

309
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,000
What's so strange about this?

310
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,070
Have you ever been to Turkey?

311
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,440
Have you ever seen the sunset from a hot air balloon?

312
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,270
No.

313
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,040
Next time, I'll have to take you there.

314
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,606
Sure.

315
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,850
Would this be a team activity?

316
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,040
People don't have to do anything if they hire a full-time assistant.

317
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,540
And me?

318
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,999
I have to shoot an advertisement all day long, and I have to drive my own car.

319
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:49,240
There is no artist in a worse spot than me.

320
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,509
The little assistant is angry and you're this anxious?

321
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,790
Do you like your assistant?

322
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,550
Are we there yet, Mr. You?

323
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,591
No.

324
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,667
What are you looking at?

325
00:21:35,668 --> 00:21:39,008
It's a green light, Mr. You.

326
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,960
Take it.

327
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,520
Don't give me a cold.

328
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,827
What happened?

329
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,610
I don't know either. I feel so sleepy.

330
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,136
I just need to go home and get some sleep.

331
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:29,570
What do you mean? Go to the hospital.

332
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,930
Perfume body spray allergy?

333
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:41,079
Don't use the body spray again. I'll give you some medicine.

334
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,509
You were allergic to body spray and didn't tell me about it?

335
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:46,310
I'm not allergic to body spray.

336
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,280
I've been using it ever since I was a kid.

337
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,440
All right. Go and pick up your medicine.

338
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:55,009
Be sure to avoid eating seafood, beef, and mutton.

339
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:57,620
You can't eat leeks and peppers anymore.

340
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,610
Then, what can she eat?

341
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,497
I'll get the medicine.

342
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,700
Hello? You Xi?

343
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,679
How was the shoot? Did it go well?

344
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:14,580
Send the perfume body spray to the testing center.

345
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,909
What do you mean? Is there something wrong with the body spray?

346
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:18,109
I'm not sure yet.

347
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,530
I'll arrange it right away.

348
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,069
And tell the crew that I won't be there for two days.

349
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,000
Why do you ask for leave?

350
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,000
To take care of my assistant.

351
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,429
How do you do, sir? The custom Mediterranean Dream Princess series.

352
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:31,488
The superior single bed has been delivered to you.

353
00:23:31,488 --> 00:23:34,159
If you are satisfied with our service, please give us five stars in your review.

354
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,890
- Okay.
- Thank you. See you later.

355
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:53,290
Mr. You, why did you buy a pink bed?

356
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,540
You… Don't you like pink?

357
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,540
Who told you I like pink?

358
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,790
You had a little pink donkey you carried around every day.

359
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,270
My dad bought it for me.

360
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,829
I picked out the bed for you.

361
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:16,170
You have to sleep on it.

362
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,780
Who is Zheng Banqiao?

363
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,730
Are there people I don't know?

364
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,319
Hey. Do you know who Zheng Banqiao is?

365
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:51,000
Yes.

366
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,329
Where is he? Take me to him.

367
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:56,302
Why?

368
00:24:56,302 --> 00:24:58,900
I'm looking for him. I need him to draw me something.

369
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,998
I can't do that.

370
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,710
Money is not a problem.

371
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,450
It's not about money.

372
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,349
Then what? Do you want me to beg?

373
00:25:08,349 --> 00:25:10,069
I have never begged anyone in my entire life.

374
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,140
It's no use kneeling down.

375
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:17,300
How funny. The person who can make me kneel has not yet been born.

376
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,070
It's no use calling your ancestors either.

377
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,950
I can't believe there are people who take themselves seriously more than I do.

378
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,920
Look him up.

379
00:25:34,544 --> 00:25:36,689
Who is he?

380
00:25:36,689 --> 00:25:41,203
Zheng Banqiao, Kangxi scholar, Ten Years of Yongzheng Juren,

381
00:25:41,203 --> 00:25:44,163
calligrapher and writer from the Qing Dynasty.

382
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,110
Hello, Mr. Lu.

383
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,750
The thing I asked you. Do you have the results?

384
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,199
You can rest assured. I have contacted the right people.

385
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:16,549
That's right. You can get it in a few days.

386
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:20,409
Good. All right. Thank you for your hard work.

387
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,240
What are you laughing at?

388
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,839
Mr. You, do you like pink yourself but can't admit it?

389
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,540
This-This…

390
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,450
This one was left by the cleaning lady.

391
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:47,547
It's not mine.

392
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,880
Sit down first.

393
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,907
Try it.

394
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,098
How is it?

395
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,601
Is your boss a good cook or what?

396
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,481
Try this.

397
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,145
I'll get the door.

398
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:30,230
Third Uncle! Let's see what we can do to help.

399
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,528
Wait.

400
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,580
It's okay. It's okay.

401
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,248
Come on in!

402
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,810
You Xi, this is the test result regarding the perfume body spray. Look.

403
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,620
Brother Dazhuang…

404
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,890
Yaoyao, why are you here?

405
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,650
You Xi, wh-what's going on here?

406
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,429
There is still soup stewing in the pot. Keep an eye on the fire for me.

407
00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:05,850
You Xi, wait!

408
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,109
When did you move in?

409
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,799
My third uncle let you live here? For how long?

410
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,779
There was a fire at my house. It's being renovated now.

411
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:22,170
Mr. You let me stay here.

412
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:27,539
But my second uncle told me that he takes cleanliness very seriously.

413
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,690
He explodes immediately if someone touches his things.

414
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:34,939
But he let you stay here, and he cooked for you.

415
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,079
Soup?

416
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:47,640
Yaoyao, are you ill and still not feeling well?

417
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,669
Why don't you go and get some rest? Let me watch the fire for you.

418
00:28:50,669 --> 00:28:53,050
You Xi, why are you living with Yuchi Yaoyao?

419
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:55,829
- How did she—
- I let her stay here temporarily.

420
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,784
How can you let a stranger live in your house?

421
00:28:57,785 --> 00:28:59,545
Are you okay?

422
00:28:59,545 --> 00:29:01,300
It's temporary.

423
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,179
[Inspection Report]
Oh, right. The inspection report is done.

424
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,909
After investigation, this product was deemed to be unqualified.

425
00:29:10,909 --> 00:29:13,509
All the qualifications presented by their company before,

426
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,999
it's all fake.

427
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,260
This perfume body spray contains serious toxic substances.

428
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,109
So that's why Little Wood had an allergic reaction?

429
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,639
Such a serious quality problem.

430
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,349
I'll contact the other party to cancel the contract.

431
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,069
How did this endorsement come to you?

432
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:30,153
A few days ago, I was worried about your endorsement.

433
00:29:30,153 --> 00:29:33,199
Then, someone called and talked about collaborating with us.

434
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,140
You Xi, I'm sorry.

435
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,109
It was really my negligence this time.

436
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,479
But I really didn't expect a company with such a high endorsement fee

437
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,030
to be running a scam.

438
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,250
Now is not the time to blame others.

439
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,499
Terminate the contract. Immediately.

440
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:50,941
Rest assured. I'm going to cancel the contract with them.

441
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:59,580
You Xi, you put books on your bookshelf?

442
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,040
What do you mean?

443
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,100
I now... love reading.

444
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,380
What are you looking at?

445
00:30:11,514 --> 00:30:12,999
Go and help me cancel my contract.

446
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,470
Okay. This…

447
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,480
What are you looking at?

448
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,729
Pandora. Your second uncle is leaving.

449
00:30:27,729 --> 00:30:29,640
You can leave with him.

450
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,678
Bye, Yaoyao. Bye, Third Uncle.

451
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,370
Why are you here?

452
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,063
I thought I asked you to watch the fire for me.

453
00:30:37,064 --> 00:30:40,114
Duo Duo said she would help with that.

454
00:30:40,114 --> 00:30:42,060
It's over. Over!

455
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,476
My soup.

456
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,280
Pandora!

457
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:52,057
What's going on, Mr. You?

458
00:30:52,057 --> 00:30:54,490
Pandora ate all my soup.

459
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,518
Doesn't this mean your cooking skills are extraordinary?

460
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:58,060
You should be happy.

461
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,660
This is the soup I cooked for you.

462
00:31:00,661 --> 00:31:02,439
Then you can think that I ate it.

463
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,280
How is that the same?!

464
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,830
What's the difference?

465
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,720
[Fashion Style]

466
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,829
Tell them this.

467
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,349
If they are the number one fashion magazine in China,

468
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,876
and aesthetics are limited to this,

469
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,787
then I won't consider collaborating with them in the future.

470
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,240
You're very demanding.

471
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,266
My consistent style.

472
00:31:27,266 --> 00:31:31,216
Boss, President Sun is outside saying he wants to see you.

473
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,174
- Let him in.
- Yes.

474
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,945
Boss.

475
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,379
Didn't I tell you not to show up here?

476
00:31:51,379 --> 00:31:53,690
Boss, something big has happened.

477
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:56,504
You Xi sent a letter of termination.

478
00:31:56,505 --> 00:31:59,789
Termination? Why?

479
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,749
At this juncture, cancel the contract.

480
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,700
Apparently, he noticed that something was wrong.

481
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,999
So what now?

482
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:07,879
We put down such a big investment,

483
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,474
and he gets away easily.

484
00:32:09,474 --> 00:32:12,660
That's right. Now that it has happened,

485
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:15,590
you can go on the offense.

486
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,439
Cool Summer Perfume Body Spray gives you a whole summer of refreshment.

You must remove this advertisement immediately.

488
00:32:24,139 --> 00:32:25,710
Did you hear me?

489
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,509
Cool Summer is a company that makes leather bags.

490
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,919
President Sun has not been picking up.

491
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,539
The owner of the company all vanished immediately.

492
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,160
Pandora, open the door.

493
00:32:41,454 --> 00:32:43,534
You're close to it.

494
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:05,680
Pan Duo, will you marry me?

495
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,810
I will.

496
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,135
Why didn't you inform me when something happened?

497
00:33:19,135 --> 00:33:21,069
What's the situation now? You don't seem to care.

498
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:23,399
That's right, Third Uncle. You are so disappointing.

499
00:33:23,406 --> 00:33:24,797
I'm ashamed of you.

500
00:33:24,797 --> 00:33:27,090
[Mister Lu]

501
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,210
I'm sorry.

502
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,915
It's a matter of urgency.

503
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:37,200
What's the emergency?

504
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,139
Really?

505
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,089
I'm free. I'll be right there.

506
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,270
Go check it out.

507
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,352
Who did Song Qiege see recently?

508
00:33:48,353 --> 00:33:50,288
Little Wood, let's go.

509
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:54,919
Don't! You guys!

510
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,050
Where are you going? You guys.

511
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,150
I brought you something. Please take a look.

512
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,294
Look carefully.

513
00:34:29,265 --> 00:34:32,075
It's the authentic work of Zheng Banqiao.

514
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,830
Sure enough, it's good.

515
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:04,290
It's authentic. Truly authentic.

516
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:11,209
Then I'll take my leave first.

517
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:18,875
Good. This... This is my compensation.

518
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:21,602
Mr. You, that painting…

519
00:35:21,602 --> 00:35:25,710
Is it a copy of Tang Bohu's original work?

520
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,670
You are quite knowledgeable.

521
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:38,220
You don't have to be so emotional.

522
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:43,790
It was heartache for me, Mr. You.

523
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,470
Do you want it?

524
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,201
- I'll throw it away.
- Don't throw it.

525
00:35:49,201 --> 00:35:51,152
I want it.

526
00:35:51,152 --> 00:35:53,984
Remember. The fan is with you.

527
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,864
You die with the fan.

528
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:38,450
♫  The world is so big,
yet a word of love from you makes me melt ♫

529
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:42,030

530
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:47,080
♫  the overflowing happiness can barely be contained  ♫

531
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,110
♫  The noise of spring and autumn, the temperature difference between winter and summer  ♫

532
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:52,450
♫  they've all become picturesque  ♫

533
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:55,900
♫  Even if worries accompany sunsets,  ♫

534
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:00,840
♫  are there any reasons not to cherish the moment?  ♫

535
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,480
♫  I'll be with you when you cry  ♫

536
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,160
♫  I'll pamper you so that you won't ruin your makeup  ♫
