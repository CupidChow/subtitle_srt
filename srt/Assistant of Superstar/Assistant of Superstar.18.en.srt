Yuchi Yaoyao and I only started dating six months ago,

34
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,400
but I had a crush on her long before that.

35
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,300
When did it begin exactly?

36
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:47,200
I think it started when she

37
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,500
threw herself in front of me to protect me.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,400
Perhaps, every time she helped me

the feeling that I had for her.

43
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,200
I've never felt that way even though I've played in many dramas.

Yes. That's right.

It's me who pursued her.

46
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,700
People on the internet say she had an ulterior motive in approaching me

47

and that she's ruining my career.

166
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,100
Let's go.

167
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,800
Once upon a time,

168
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,900
a monster would show up in town.

169
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,400
It had only one eye, but three tails.

170
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,300
It looked like a cat.

171
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,800
At night, this monster came out to deceive people.

172
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,800
As soon as humans saw its eye,

173
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,200
they would freeze and be eaten.

174
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
I'm telling you...

175
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,800
The monster was defeated by my ancestor at last.

176
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,300
This is the monster's tooth.

177
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,000
Grandma, that won't scare anybody.

178
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,700
The Classic of West Highlands and the Classic of Mountains and Seas

179
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,600
say that it looked like a leopard cat. It had one eye and three tails.

180
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Legend calls it Huan and it didn't eat humans.

181
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,600
Grandma, this looks like a dog's tooth.

182
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,800
You kids have read too many books.

183
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,800
On which page is it in the Classic of Mountains and Seas?

184
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
I don't remember it. Let's look it up.

185
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,000
Professor Yuchi. Go. I'll show you something else.

186
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,600
Let's go.

187
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,600
What happened?

188
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
I think my necklace broke.

189
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,800
The necklace is so old. You should get a new one.

190
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,800
I should have it repaired sometime.

191
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,200
Let me help you.

192
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,200
All done.

193
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,000
Mr. You.

194
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,200
It hurts! It hurts!

195
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Doctor, did the bee sting him badly?

196
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,600
How shall I put it?

197
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,700
This would have healed soon, anyway.

198
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,000
I really feel pain.

199
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,300
How about I give you some more medicine?

200
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,200
Take it.

201
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,100
You Xi, you know what? The situation in Jiangzhou is a mess.

202
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,700
- If you don't come back…
- Wrong number.

203
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,100
Hey.

204
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,000
Does Brother Dazhuang want you back?

205
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,500
How is that possible?

206
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,400
We've long addressed the issue of the company.

207
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Zhu Dazhuang is in Mauritius, watching penguins,

208
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,800
so he gave me a long vacation.

209
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,900
Now, he's likely enjoying himself.

210
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,800
Tonight, I'll cook you diced chicken with chilis.

211
00:15:43,711 --> 00:15:45,988
The number of his fans is about to drop to zero.

212
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Why isn't he worried?

213
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,000
- Say it.
- Brother Morry,

214
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,200
Mr. Zhang wants you in his office.

215
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,200
The number of You Xi's fans has plummeted

216
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,600
since he went public with his love affair.

217
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,000
Advertisers want to sue him for breach of contract.

218
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,800
Shengguo Entertainment is already in chaos.

219
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,600
Besides, You Xi himself is missing.

220
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,300
You Xi!

221
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,400
I wonder how you will turn around this time.

222
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,800
Director Tong, long time no see.

223
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,000
It doesn't matter.

224
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,900
You'll beg me when you come back.

225
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,700
Mr. Idol, I really can't go any further.

226
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,200
Who asked you to come with me?

227
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:03,200
Well, Yaoyao and Third Uncle are in trouble, that's why.

228
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,800
Mr. Idol, why don't we ask Third Uncle to pick us up?

229
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,400
Are we almost there?

230
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,400
Don't you want to surprise them?

231
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,300
I didn't expect I would have to walk so long after getting off the bus.

232
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,200
If I continue walking, my legs will be broken.

233
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,100
Mr. Idol, can you give me a piggyback ride?

234
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,200
Here we are.

235
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,200
I didn't expect I'd have to pluck a chicken myself.

236
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,800
Third Uncle. Yaoyao.

237
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Duo Duo.

238
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,600
- Mr. Chao.
- Third Uncle.

239
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,800
Brother Chao, what brings you here?

240
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,000
Don't get so excited.

241
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,600
I just came to see how miserable you were.

242
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,600
I'm pretty great, right?

243
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,000
Great?

244
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,600
Don't move.

245
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,200
Come on! Stay put!

246
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,600
Cute, right?

247
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,600
What are you going to do next?

248
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,400
Are you here to persuade me to go back?

249
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,800
Even if I tried, will you listen?

250
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,500
One more.

251
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
There's a bonfire party tonight. You go to play together.

252
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,800
No. No.

253
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,400
Okay. Okay. We'll go.

254
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,200
Welcome.

255
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,400

I'll try my best to protect her, and I won't let harm come her way.

Duo Duo and Mr. Qi Chao. It's so late now.

309
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:46,081
Are you sure you don't want to stay here for the night?

310
00:23:46,081 --> 00:23:47,530
Yeah. Mr. Idol.

311
00:23:47,531 --> 00:23:49,886
It's very late, and it's dangerous to walk at night.

312
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:54,180
How about we get a room and stay for one night?

313
00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:00,681
There's a song I have to work on. I must leave.

314
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:03,278
Brother Chao is right. If you have nothing to do, hurry up and leave.

315
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,992
Third Uncle, how can you do this when we helped you? You…

316
00:24:06,992 --> 00:24:08,604
Are you leaving or not?

320
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,318
Bye!

321
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:20,897
Mr. Idol, let's go.

322
00:24:20,898 --> 00:24:22,778
The road is too dangerous.

323
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:24,239
I'm so scared.

324
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,241
You have to hold me tight.

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,518
You had a good time.

328
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:58,319
Do you take a fancy to the girl?

329
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:01,414
- You're back?
- Yes. We're back.

330
00:25:01,414 --> 00:25:02,809
Yaoyao,

331
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,016
the guy sharing the room with me is an epic snorer.

332
00:25:08,017 --> 00:25:10,490
I can't sleep well.

333
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:14,078
Mr. You, it's the countryside, so you have to put up with it.

334
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,892
How... How can I put up with it?

335
00:25:16,893 --> 00:25:20,920
I can't sleep well, and I'll suffer a nervous breakdown.

336
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,920
Besides, I'll have to cook for you.

337
00:25:26,101 --> 00:25:28,320
I'll ask the boss to get you another room.

338
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,940
Boss, get me a room.

339
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:34,560
All the rooms are full. There are no rooms available.

340
00:25:39,613 --> 00:25:42,540
What should we do now?

341
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,799
I want all the remaining rooms.

342
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,592
I'll ride a bike and take you to a hotel in town and get you a room.

343
00:25:58,592 --> 00:26:01,221
Is it necessary to go through all this trouble?

344
00:26:01,221 --> 00:26:03,117
Aren't you alone in your room?

345
00:26:03,117 --> 00:26:05,799
I can sleep on the floor.

346
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:11,320
It's not good for a man and a woman to stay in the same room, is it?

347
00:26:14,315 --> 00:26:15,402
What happened?

348
00:26:15,403 --> 00:26:17,894
Nothing. Nothing.

349
00:26:17,894 --> 00:26:21,008
Dad, Mr. You doesn't want to hear Brother Chen snore during his sleep.

350
00:26:21,008 --> 00:26:22,714
He wants a different room,

351
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,399
but the hotel is filled up.

352
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,132
There are no rooms available?

353
00:26:26,132 --> 00:26:29,419
In this case, just squeeze up and share the same bed.

354
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:31,679
You Xi is already your boyfriend.

355
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,989
Don't be shy.

356
00:26:33,989 --> 00:26:36,005
Dad.

357
00:26:36,005 --> 00:26:37,839
You Xi.

358
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:40,118
You wouldn't mind, would you?

359
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:42,340
Squeeze up?

360
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,039
No. No.

361
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,399
Good. Good.

362
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,730
Tonight you may squeeze up with me.

363
00:26:51,487 --> 00:26:52,442
No need. No need.

364
00:26:52,443 --> 00:26:54,682
Don't worry. I won't snore.

365
00:26:54,683 --> 00:26:57,140
- No need.
- Let's go.

366
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:10,083
You Xi! Do you know how bad the situation is?

367
00:27:10,084 --> 00:27:12,959
As soon your love affair is exposed, your popularity will plummet.

369
00:27:15,831 --> 00:27:17,095
Two variety shows and three movies want to have you replaced, not to mention endorsements.

370

- And The Realm of the Three Kingdoms…
- Enough. I know.

371
00:27:42,924 --> 00:27:46,120
I have fought many battles in the desert with my worn-out armor,

372
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,439
but I will never return until I completely defeat the enemy.

I lost my mom's necklace.

No.

What happened to your ankle?

00:30:42,296 --> 00:30:43,980
Let me help you up.

379
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:52,120
It's bruised.

380
00:30:53,388 --> 00:30:56,409
Wait here. I'll find it.

381
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,335
Mr. You.

382
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,040
I think it's over there.

383
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,003
I can't find it.

384
00:31:55,003 --> 00:31:57,200
I'll buy you a new one tomorrow.

385
00:32:22,284 --> 00:32:26,549
- Your face.
- I know I'm very handsome. I don't need you to tell me.

386
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:28,140
Let's go.

387
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:34,561
If you don't get on my back, the ghost will come.

388
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:52,120
Mr. You, how did you know I was here?

389
00:32:52,124 --> 00:32:53,907
What do you think?

390
00:32:53,907 --> 00:32:58,380
Your dad doesn't snore but he keeps on sleep talking,

391
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,314
and I just couldn't sleep.

392
00:33:00,315 --> 00:33:01,994
So I came out to look for you.

393
00:33:01,995 --> 00:33:04,194
I searched the whole village…

394
00:33:04,195 --> 00:33:06,306
Thankfully, I found you.

395
00:33:06,306 --> 00:33:08,826
Sorry, Mr. You.

396
00:33:10,612 --> 00:33:14,331
Is the necklace that important to you?

397
00:33:18,927 --> 00:33:22,787
It was my mother's.

398
00:33:23,612 --> 00:33:26,508
If you encounter this situation again,

399
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:29,299
you must ask me for help.

400
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:31,800
I don't mean when you lose your necklace.

401
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,911
I mean it's dangerous if you are alone.

402
00:33:35,912 --> 00:33:38,499
At least I can keep you company.

403
00:33:41,692 --> 00:33:45,511
Little Wood, have you been eating more these days?

404
00:33:45,511 --> 00:33:46,610
Am I heavy?

405
00:33:46,611 --> 00:33:50,720
Put me down then. I can walk by myself.

406
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,884
No. If we do run into a ghost,

407
00:33:52,885 --> 00:33:55,498
I'll drop you and run.

408
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:00,592
But since you are that afraid,

409
00:34:00,592 --> 00:34:02,685
I'll carry you on my back.

410
00:35:01,002 --> 00:35:02,432
It's okay now.

411
00:35:07,894 --> 00:35:11,880
Then I'm leaving.

412
00:35:27,004 --> 00:35:28,944
Mr. You.

413
00:35:33,123 --> 00:35:34,812
What's up?

414
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:40,040
If my dad snores during his sleep,

415
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:44,320
how about you...

416
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,224
What?

417
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:54,340
Just sleep here.

418
00:35:55,501 --> 00:36:00,023
Sleeping here is also okay.

419
00:36:24,175 --> 00:36:27,477
- Your face.
- I know I'm handsome.

420
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:29,889
It's over. I'm doomed.

421
00:36:29,889 --> 00:36:32,501
She just saw me like this?

422
00:36:32,502 --> 00:36:35,604
I'm too embarrassed to see her again.

423
00:36:35,604 --> 00:36:41,360
How about you just sleep here.

424
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,432
Little Wood really loves me for who I am.

425
00:36:47,484 --> 00:36:50,729
Mr. You, I've made the bed.

426
00:36:50,729 --> 00:36:52,600
You go ahead and sleep.

427
00:36:53,897 --> 00:36:55,431
Coming.

428
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:07,001
Do you like to sleep inside or outside?

429
00:37:25,897 --> 00:37:27,540
Mr. You.

430
00:37:35,979 --> 00:37:37,172
Thank you.

431
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:38,992
Okay. Okay.

432
00:37:38,992 --> 00:37:43,781
Don't you have something to tell me?

433
00:37:43,781 --> 00:37:45,640
Mr. You.

434
00:37:46,507 --> 00:37:48,095
Good night.

435
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:54,080
Just good night?

436
00:37:55,289 --> 00:37:57,399
When we finally get to sleep together,

437
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,134
don't you have any heartfelt words to tell me?

438
00:38:01,776 --> 00:38:03,340
Yaoyao.

439
00:38:04,327 --> 00:38:05,731
Yaoyao!

440
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,221
Yaoyao!

Yaoyao!

00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,699
You Xi, where are you?

443
00:38:42,699 --> 00:38:44,803
I'm in California. If you're tough enough, come and catch me.

444
00:38:44,804 --> 00:38:47,663
My dear, where are you?

445
00:38:49,613 --> 00:38:51,603
Why are you here?

446
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,160
W-What are you doing?

447
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,117
My bag.

448
00:39:02,784 --> 00:39:05,017
Who knows you're here?

00:39:05,018 --> 00:39:06,119
Duo Duo.

450
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,496
Did anyone suspicious follow you when you first came in?

451
00:39:09,496 --> 00:39:12,284
Don't worry. I was in disguise.

452
00:39:13,299 --> 00:39:16,472
Go ahead. Who told you I was here?

453
00:39:17,414 --> 00:39:20,173
You Xi, I already knew you and Duo Duo

454
00:39:20,173 --> 00:39:23,174
were playing little tricks behind my back.

455
00:39:23,174 --> 00:39:24,324
Go.

456
00:39:24,325 --> 00:39:26,562
Hurry up and leave when the expedition team is still out.

457
00:39:26,563 --> 00:39:27,843
Go where?

458
00:39:27,844 --> 00:39:29,298
Go back to Jiangzhou.

459
00:39:29,299 --> 00:39:30,705
I'm not going anywhere.

460
00:39:30,706 --> 00:39:32,743
I'm having a good time here.

461
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:50,240
You Xi, do you know what I've had to go through to find you?

462
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:55,117
This happened to my hair

463
00:39:55,117 --> 00:39:56,888
when I sat on the tractor.

464
00:39:56,888 --> 00:39:59,559
Yes. The clothes.

465
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:03,223
See? My shirt got pecked by chicks.

466
00:40:03,223 --> 00:40:05,829
Besides, I lost my shoes

467
00:40:05,829 --> 00:40:09,239
when I crossed the cornfield.

468
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,560
Do you think it was easy for me?

469
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,660
It's not me who asked you to come here.

470

You Xi,

471
00:40:21,815 --> 00:40:23,720
I know you don't want to see me.

472
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:27,900
You're eager to stay here and be with Yuchi Yaoyao your entire life.

473
00:40:28,799 --> 00:40:30,919
But You Xi, it's very urgent.

474
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,291
You're headstrong. I understand your choice to go public.

475
00:40:33,292 --> 00:40:36,009
But the company is in chaos.

476
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:38,158
Everyone is having a tough time.

477
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:39,839
It's a complete mess.

478
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,117
If we don't handle this well, not only you and I,

479
00:40:42,117 --> 00:40:45,759
but also all other people will lose jobs.

480
00:40:45,759 --> 00:40:47,996
Even if you don't have pity for me,

481
00:40:47,996 --> 00:40:50,119
you must have pity for my Duo Duo

482
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,720
and my Xiao Qi.
