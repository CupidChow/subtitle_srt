adults would always talk about since I was young.

You Xi is at a critical moment of his career.

Yesterday, he had a press conference

- She's not the one you've been talking about, right?

125
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:38,589
Exactly. She took my backpack and almost cost me the leading role.

126
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:41,820
You took my backpack and got me a complaint and a bad review.

127
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,400
A bad view? Big whoops!

128
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,060
My precious character analysis was magically turned into "My Father"!

129
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,419
Could "My Father" replace "Zhongfu"?

130
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:52,069
Let me tell you that if Director Wei Ran had read my character analysis,

131
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:53,749
I would already have that role!

132
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:56,090
I wouldn't need you at all.

133
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,920
You mean the "Character Analysis" in the backpack?

134
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,524
Of course!

135
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,525

Please cancel the reservation and find another tutor.

138
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,140
- What's she saying?
- Nothing.

139
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,530
Exactly what she said.

140
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,119
I should be firing you! Not the other way around.

141
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,712
Because, for me, your "Character Analysis"

142
00:07:29,712 --> 00:07:32,806
is about the same level as "My Father".

324
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:21,631
Isn't that You Xi?

325
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:24,029
"Accidently Fall In Love With You,"

326
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,010
scene 18, shot 1, take 1!

327
00:17:26,516 --> 00:17:28,236
Action!

328
00:17:29,286 --> 00:17:31,756
I know there's nothing I can do now.

329
00:17:32,493 --> 00:17:35,086
I only have one wish.

330
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:37,666
Give me one last kiss.

331
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,554
Cut!

332
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:47,629
All right!

333
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,477
Quite sincere.

334
00:17:49,478 --> 00:17:50,612
Next shot!

335
00:17:50,613 --> 00:17:52,281
So bad!

336
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,359
Are you all right, Mr. You?

337
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,904
No. She kissed me!

338
00:17:58,904 --> 00:18:00,950
The director meant for us to fake the kiss.

339
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,242
Zheng Jia kissed me for real!

340
00:18:07,126 --> 00:18:09,426
Scene 31, shot 1, take 1!
[Accidently Fall In Love With You]

341
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,210
Okay, cut!

342
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,940
Thank you all.

343
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,440
He can't come?

344
00:18:41,183 --> 00:18:45,557
Director, are there any other options?

345
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,747
How can we do it without the body double?

346
00:18:47,748 --> 00:18:49,289
Forget about it.

347
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:51,780
- Do we cancel this scene?
- Yes.

348
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,988
Okay, I'll make a call.

349
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,070
There is another option.

350
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,590
You Xi.

351
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:02,984
Director, I'll do it myself.

352
00:19:02,984 --> 00:19:04,999
What? No. No way!

353
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,671
That's too dangerous.

354
00:19:06,672 --> 00:19:07,996
I've worn wires before.

355
00:19:07,997 --> 00:19:09,387
I have some experience.

356
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:23,280
Mr. You, are you sure about this?

357
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,639
Maybe give it another thought?

358
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,850
He said we can skip this scene.

359
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,393
Don't worry.

360
00:19:30,393 --> 00:19:32,982
When I wasn't famous, I did the action scenes myself.

361
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:34,610
No body double.

362
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,570
I can do this.

363
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,210
- Mr. You! Mr. You!
- What happened?

364
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,829
- You Xi!
- Mr. You!

365
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:15,558
- Wake up, You Xi!
- Mr. You!

366
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:16,479
Call the ambulance!

367
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,309
Now, hurry!

368
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,979
- Mr. You!
- Call an ambulance!

369
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:21,588
Mr. You! Mr. You!

370
00:20:21,614 --> 00:20:23,999
Are you all right, Mr. You! Mr. You!

371
00:20:25,286 --> 00:20:27,036
How do you feel?

372
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,100
Well, well! To what do I owe the pleasure?

373
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,377
The shooting is done.

374
00:20:37,378 --> 00:20:40,038
So I came to visit the star of Times Entertainment.

375
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,979
I heard that you are competing with You Xi over "Zhongfu" directed by Wei Ran?

376
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,829
That's fast. Considering you've just gotten back.

377
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,603
How's it going?

378
00:20:49,603 --> 00:20:54,023
Here. He asked me to learn the history.

379
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,479
Oh, right. I heard that You Xi had an accident

380
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,170
and has been hospitalized.

381
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,590
I guess so.

382
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,900
- What happened?
- Morry...

383
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,900
What happened to You Xi?

384
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,400
Brother Dazhuang…

385
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,500
Morry, calm down first.

386
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,700
How can I be calm?

387
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,800
You're not his agent, that's why you are not worried!

388
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,400
Do you have any idea how many TV shows

389
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,900
and endorsements might be stopped?

390
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,000
Can you imagine how much loss Shengguo Entertainment will suffer?

391
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,600
Let me tell you! If anything happens to You Xi,

392
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,200
I'll bury your entire crew.

393
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,300
And you! You are a tutor,

394
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,000
what were you doing on the set?

395
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,600
Nothing has ever happened to You Xi before.

396
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,600
You went there just this once and look what happened!

397
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,300
What's with the yelling? This is a hospital!

398
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,500
My You Xi… Hand! Your hand!

399
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,200
Doctor, is his hand all right?

400
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,200
It's nothing serious. Just a slight fracture on his right arm. It's been treated.

401
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,600
He'll be fine in a couple of days.

402
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,500
Doctor, please spare me a minute.

403
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,400
Take care of You Xi!

404
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,000
Mr. You, are you all right?

405
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,800
My face was not scratched, right?

406
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,200
What are you saying?

407
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,800
My face was not scratched, right?

408
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,600
You Xi, just rest for now.

409
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,100
I'll ask Xiao Qi to come here and take care of you.

410
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,000
That's okay. I've got her.

411
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,200
- You mean me?
- You mean her?

412
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,600
She's my assistant now.

413
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,600
Assistant?

414
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm not his assistant. I'm not!

415
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,300
What should I put in the complaint…

416
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,000
complaint against you?

417
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,300
I am Mr. You's assistant.

418
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,500
That's right.

419
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,800
Assistant. All right, come with me.

420
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,000
Let's talk for a minute.

421
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,400
Come.

422
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,600
You mean this was not an accident?

423
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,600
Action Instructor! I have a question.

424
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Look. Who's that guy over there?

425
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,600
He's a new member in our martial arts team.

426
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,900
Mr. You is doing the action himself today,

427
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,400
so I'd like to ask a favor for you to inspect the device again later.

428
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,200
Don't worry, we've been doing this for over a decade.

429
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,400
But the accident happened after the inspection.

430
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,300
That's really suspicious.

431
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,200
Another thing, the body double happened to be absent today.

432
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,300
Obviously, someone wanted You Xi to do it himself.

433
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,900
Brother Dazhuang, you need someone to investigate this.

434
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,800
I've asked the director to leave everything where they were.

435
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,300
Okay, got it.

436
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,800
Yuchi Mumu, where are you?

437
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
Come back!

438
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,800
- Brother Dazhuang…
- Go. Go on.

439
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,300
Go ahead.

440
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,000
Be careful.

441
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,600
Mr. You! What are you doing?

442
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,200
Close the door.

443
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,500
Zhu Dazhuang left?

444
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,000
Yeah.

445
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,200
I'm hungry. Get me something to eat.

446
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,400
What do you want?

447
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,300
Braised chicken.

448
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,600
It's just braised chicken.

449
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,500
Isn't that too dramatic?

450
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,400
You don't understand.

451
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
I haven't had this in five years.

452
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,500
Five years?

453
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,400
The company's policy is we keep a healthy diet

454
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,000
and keep our bodies in shape.

455
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,500
Foods like braised chicken, spicy hotpot, mutton hotpot, etc.

456
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,000
are all forbidden.

457
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,900
I couldn't even smell them, let alone have them.

458
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,300
Dazhuang's inspection! Put it away.

459
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,100
Take the call for me.

460
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,000
You Xi, have you had your meal?

461
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,800
- Having it right now.
- Not bad!

462
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,200
With all your hard work,

463
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,500
you truly deserve to be a top-notch star.

464
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,700
Wait!

465
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,800
How come there are chicken bones on the table?

466
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,600
C-Chicken bones?

467
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,400
Yuchi Mumu,

468
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,000
how dare you eat braised chicken in my room?

469
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,900
Me?

470
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,000
Don't eat junk food in my room again!

471
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Or you'll get a complaint.

472
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,800
I won't next time.

473
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,500
I'll dump that right away.

474
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,400
Every bit of it!

475
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,200
Leaving not a single bone.

476
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,900
What? Your girlfriend isn't here and that upsets you?

477
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,800
No.

478
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,600
I just feel bad to have you wait.

479
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,200
Oh, right!

480
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,700
This is for you. Happy birthday!

481
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,500
This is such an expensive gift.

482
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,800
As long as you like it.

483
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,200
Come here, I'll help you to put it on.

484
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,000
Sorry that I'm late.

485
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,700
Yaoyao, what took you so long?

486
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,200
We've been waiting for you.

487
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,100
I'm sorry.

488
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,100
Yin Jiu, happy birthday.

489
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,600
Thank you.

490
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,000
Let me help you with the bracelet.

491
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,700
No, that's okay.

492
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,000
I'm hungry. Let's eat first.

493
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,800
Actually, I'm hungry, too.

494
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,000
Let's eat.

495
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Here. Let's raise a toast.

496
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,500
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

497
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,600
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

498
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,300
- What is it?
- Mr. You, it's time for class.

499
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,300
Are you kidding me?

500
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,000
My arm is hurt and I need to study?

501
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,100
An arm injury is no excuse to skip class.

502
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,000
I have a headache.

503
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,800
What are you doing?

504
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,800
Waiting for your headache to pass.

505
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,600
Guan Zhong helped the Emperor of Qi take the world,
(T/N: Chinese philosopher and politician served as Chancellor to the Qi State )

506
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,000
sparing the people of the pain of war.

507
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
That's why people call him

508
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,100
Zhongfu.
(T/N: Father Zhong)

509
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,200
I got you.

510
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,000
All right, that's all for today.

511
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,600
See you, Tutor.

512
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,900
Coming up, time for a quiz!

513
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,500
Are you serious?

514
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,200
My arm is injured! I can't write.

515
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,400
You don't have to.

516
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,300
This is a multiple-choice quiz.

517
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,700
You just mark the answers.

518
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,300
The examination ends in 30 minutes.

519
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,800
998,

520
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,300
999…

521
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,300
So many tasks!

522
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,200
Fetch the quilt from home.

523
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,700
You have a quilt here!

524
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,600
I don't like quilts without my smell!

525
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,200
Just roll on it and it will have your smell!

526
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,600
You…

527
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,200
You have thirty minutes.

528
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,600
The countdown starts now.

529
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,000
If you are late,

530
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I'll send a complaint.

531
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,400
Mr. You Xi,

532
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,000
this room has been arranged as you have requested.

533
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,100
I've also ordered clay pot rice for you.

534
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,400
And these are 999 melon seeds, all peeled.

535
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,600
How do you know the number is 999,

536
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,600
not 998 or 1,000?

537
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,000
Mr. You, will you count them yourself?

538
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,400
If you have no other requests, I'll get going.

539
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,200
Yes, Brother Dazhuang.

540
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,100
How's it going? How is You Xi?

541
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,600
Mr. You is quite well.

542
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,700
I'm getting off work now.

543
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,600
Getting off work?

544
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,400
You Xi's injury is not healed yet,

545
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,800
you think you should be getting off work as his assistant?

546
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,500
You know what? Before You Xi heals,

547
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,400
don't think of stepping one step outside of the hospital!

548
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,000
Or I'll send a complaint.

549
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,600
Bye.

550
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,400
Don't jump.

551
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,000
Yuchi Mumu?

552
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,700
Yuchi Mumu! Yuchi Mumu!

553
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,400
Don't jump, Mr. You!

554
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,290
The wires are dangerous!

555
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:34,100
The wires are not secure!

556
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,600
Got it.

557
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,200
I won't jump.

558
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,400
It was you…

559
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,300
You slept on my hand the whole night,

560
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:20,300
talking in your sleep, keeping me awake.

561
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,400
So, Mr. You, what did I say?

562
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,400
I forgot.

563
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,550
Excuse me. Where is Mr. You Xi staying?

564
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:58,060
You Xi is in Room 605.

565
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,779
Brother Chao! What took you so long?

566
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:05,993
My leg is broken!

567
00:32:05,993 --> 00:32:07,186
Stop being dramatic.

568
00:32:07,187 --> 00:32:08,794
I know all about your conditions.

569
00:32:08,795 --> 00:32:09,906
Boring.

570
00:32:09,907 --> 00:32:12,097
Mr. Qi Chao!

571
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,200
Are you really Mr. Qi Chao?

572
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,800
She's my new assistant.

573
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,754
We have something important to discuss.

574
00:32:19,754 --> 00:32:21,645
Leave us for a minute.

575
00:32:29,505 --> 00:32:31,821
I'm telling you... She's a total dimwit!

576
00:32:31,821 --> 00:32:33,771
And yet you hired her!

577
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,960
That's because there was an accident.

578
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,479
Forget about it. Let's not talk about it.

579
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,540
Let's take a picture!

580
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,279
This is my bad side. You take the camera!

581
00:32:44,281 --> 00:32:46,522
Just use your right hand!

582
00:32:55,003 --> 00:32:57,283
Mr. You, the doctor said that…

583
00:33:00,296 --> 00:33:01,814
Get out!

584
00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:13,029
Smile! One Smile.

585
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:21,899
Hey, Yin Jiu!

586
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:24,869
Yaoyao… I've been thinking about things,

587
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:28,124
and there's something that I have to tell you.

588
00:33:28,124 --> 00:33:29,181
What is it?

589
00:33:29,182 --> 00:33:31,382
Yaoyao, actually…

590
00:33:33,183 --> 00:33:35,273
I'll talk to you later.

591
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,720
Yin Jiu…

592
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,870
[Emergency]

593
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,415
Mr. Qi Chao, you are leaving already?

594
00:33:48,415 --> 00:33:50,589
Mr. You asked me to get you all these snacks.

595
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,960
No need. You two can have them.

596
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:57,573
I'll walk with you, Mr. Qi Chao!

597
00:33:57,573 --> 00:34:00,207
I wonder who her boss is!

598
00:34:01,286 --> 00:34:03,436
So, you are You Xi's assistant.

599
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,370
Actually…

600
00:34:09,689 --> 00:34:10,999
Kind of, yeah.

601
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:13,310
Don't follow every word of his.

602
00:34:13,893 --> 00:34:16,963
And don't dismiss him at all.

603
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,220
Where's my bag and shoes?

604
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,180
I can't stand being here anymore. I want out!

605
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,799
Dazhuang expected that you would want to leave.

606
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,960
So he took all your shoes and bag.

607
00:34:41,589 --> 00:34:43,129
Zhu Dazhuang!

608
00:34:43,129 --> 00:34:45,805
He thinks he can stop me just like that!

609
00:34:45,806 --> 00:34:47,356
No way!

610
00:34:50,148 --> 00:34:52,980
If I do this, can you still recognize me?

611
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:56,020
Maybe not.

612
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,190
Let's go.

613
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,119
Uncle! There will be a fan meeting for our superstar.

614
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:11,509
Please have a look.

615
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,210
Who are you calling "Uncle"?

616
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,248
Come on, have a look.

617
00:35:15,248 --> 00:35:18,169
- If I take off my mask—
- Mr. You…

618
00:35:21,628 --> 00:35:23,115
Fan meeting…

619
00:35:23,116 --> 00:35:24,606
For whom?

620
00:35:25,536 --> 00:35:27,506
Song Qiege?

621
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:30,423
He has fans?

622
00:35:45,799 --> 00:35:47,306
What are you waiting for?

623
00:35:47,306 --> 00:35:48,936
Go pay!

624
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,910
[¥3,710]

625
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,989
- I don't have enough money.
- Forget it.

626
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,910
Just watch me, your boss,

627
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,540
do his magic.

628
00:36:05,485 --> 00:36:08,746
Hello. Credit card or cash?

629
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,113
Miss, I don't have any money on me.

630
00:36:13,113 --> 00:36:16,515
Instead, I can show you my face.

631
00:36:16,515 --> 00:36:19,308
So you are saying that I should put your face

632
00:36:19,308 --> 00:36:21,575
in the machine and scan it?

633
00:36:21,575 --> 00:36:24,031
I'm sorry, Sir. Your face won't fit.

634
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:27,160
I don't think this is possible.

635
00:36:27,879 --> 00:36:30,267
I am a model for this brand.

636
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:34,475
I'll take this pair as a sample and send you the money later.

637
00:36:34,475 --> 00:36:39,533
Sir, your eyes do resemble You Xi's a little.

638
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:42,299
But that's no reason for you not to pay.

639
00:36:42,299 --> 00:36:45,529
Would you please take the shoes off?

640
00:36:46,299 --> 00:36:48,080
Take a closer look!

641
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,800
Security!

642
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,355
Why would you buy me such ugly shoes?

643
00:36:56,355 --> 00:36:59,139
Mr. You, these are all I can afford.

644
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:01,206
Just make do with them for now.

645
00:37:04,197 --> 00:37:05,389
Let's go home!

646
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,754
No more shopping?

647
00:37:06,755 --> 00:37:09,505
I'll get back home and buy the company.

648
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:19,209
Yuchi Mumu!

649
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,810
Yin Jiu!

650
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,593
Tong Jin!

651
00:37:42,213 --> 00:37:44,987
Yaoyao, actually, we've been together for a while.

652
00:37:44,987 --> 00:37:47,819
We never told you because we didn't want to hurt you.

653
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:49,734
Since you've agreed to break up with him,

654
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:51,549
does that mean we have your blessing?

655
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,080
Break up?

656
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:57,741
Yin Jiu, when did that ever happen?

657
00:37:58,545 --> 00:38:00,520
We sent the message today.

658
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,380
You agreed to break up.

659
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,089
This is all my fault.

660
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:06,570
But it's over between us.

661
00:38:18,786 --> 00:38:21,256
Then we'll break up.

662
00:38:21,256 --> 00:38:24,673
It's important to take the first strike for things like this.

663
00:38:24,673 --> 00:38:26,813
I won't let you do that.

664
00:38:27,488 --> 00:38:31,521
[I was going to break up with you anyway. I don't think you're the right guy.]

665
00:38:34,193 --> 00:38:37,077
Yaoyao, actually, Yin Jiu has never been happy

666
00:38:37,077 --> 00:38:39,064
in the years he spent with you.

667
00:38:39,065 --> 00:38:41,109
He never said anything about breaking up

668
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,332
because your father was his tutor.

669
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:45,704
And you…

670
00:38:45,705 --> 00:38:48,255
You know nothing but show him these shabby poets.

671
00:38:48,255 --> 00:38:49,883
You think we are in ancient times?

672
00:38:49,883 --> 00:38:53,315
I never knew what love was until I met Tong Jin.

673
00:38:53,315 --> 00:38:57,510
Sir, have you graduated from college yet?

674
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,920
My boyfriend has a Ph.D.

675
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,899
And that's why you are breaking up with her.

676
00:39:01,899 --> 00:39:03,411
Since you've graduated,

677
00:39:03,412 --> 00:39:06,036
she and her father are no longer needed. Am I right?

678
00:39:06,036 --> 00:39:07,476
You…

679
00:39:11,713 --> 00:39:15,973
Sir, the watch you are wearing is a limited edition.

680
00:39:15,973 --> 00:39:19,989
My guess is… you probably can't afford it yourself.

681
00:39:21,399 --> 00:39:23,829
You and Yaoyao are finished indeed.

682
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:27,180
I sent the message to break up with you.

683
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:33,789
Although I can't tell what Miss Tong Jin has that Yaoyao doesn't.

684
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,853
I'll level with you.

685
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:39,623
We've been together for a while.

686
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,120
Right?

687
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,490
Yuchi Yaoyao.

688
00:39:48,916 --> 00:39:51,156
Is that true?

689
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:40,410
♫  The world is so big,  ♫

690
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:44,480
♫  yet a word of love from you makes me melt  ♫

691
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,160
♫  Watching you decorate this little home,  ♫

692
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:53,150
♫  the overflowing happiness can barely be contained  ♫

693
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:56,070
♫  The noise of spring and autumn, the temperature difference between winter and summer  ♫

694
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,540
♫  they've all become picturesque  ♫

695
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:02,110
♫  Even if worries accompany sunsets,  ♫

696
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:07,000
♫  is there any reasons not to cherish the moment?  ♫

697
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,550
♫  I'll be with you when you cry  ♫

698
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:14,060
♫  I'll pamper you so that you won't ruin your makeup  ♫

699
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:19,800
♫  I will take you wherever you want to go  ♫

700
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,850
♫  You are my girl  ♫

701
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:26,350
♫  I want you to be my goddess for the rest of my life  ♫

702
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,890
♫  I'll gently light the lamp in the quiet of the night  ♫

703
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:33,930
♫  I'll hold you in my arms and let you sleep soundly  ♫

704
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:37,050
♫  I'm your man  ♫

705
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:40,430
♫  I will take care of you with my all  ♫

706
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:44,370
♫  I'll silently follow the perfect script in your heart  ♫

707
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:51,780
♫  It's you who makes everything
become possible and love to be flawless  ♫
