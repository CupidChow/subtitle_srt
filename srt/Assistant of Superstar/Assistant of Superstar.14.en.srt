No. Of course, I trust you.

332

I heard that the theme song was given to "The Realm of the Three Kingdoms."

I hate You Xi more than you do.

336
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,914
So it's none of your business.

337
00:24:49,914 --> 00:24:52,433
I know what to do.

338
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:55,678
How's it going?

339
00:24:55,678 --> 00:24:59,018
Everything is ready. We just need to do it.

340
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:05,140
You have a plan?

341

You'll know it soon.

What are you doing?

343
00:25:25,146 --> 00:25:28,698
Mr. You, I'm observing the astrological aspects.

344
00:25:28,698 --> 00:25:30,985
The astrological aspect?

345
00:25:30,999 --> 00:25:33,160
What did you find?

346
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,118
Look, Mr. You.

347
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,718
You're on the right track now, both with your acting and the public's opinion of you.

348
00:25:38,718 --> 00:25:40,953
You are thriving.

349
00:25:40,953 --> 00:25:43,213
But the calmer it gets,

350
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:45,059
the more likely there is a turbulent undercurrent.

351
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:47,200
We can't take this lightly.

352
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,571
I'm not scared of it.

353
00:26:19,484 --> 00:26:21,944

A man living in the world must make a difference

- Are you kidding?
- Director, it's true.

358
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,404
The producer has informed us.

Director, did I do something wrong?

361
00:27:08,398 --> 00:27:10,499
You Xi, you did a good job.

362
00:27:10,499 --> 00:27:12,212
But…

363
00:27:25,264 --> 00:27:30,058
Everyone, I was just informed by the producer.

364
00:27:30,058 --> 00:27:34,999
Due to some factors, we will have to stop filming.

365
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:36,278
What?

366
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,707
- We have to stop?
- Are you serious?

367
00:27:37,707 --> 00:27:39,459
- I just got the message, too.
- What do we do next?

368
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:41,614
I have no idea.

Ask You Xi to check his Weibo.

371
00:27:54,712 --> 00:27:58,004
Mr. You, early this morning, someone posted on the forum

372
00:27:58,004 --> 00:28:02,596
and leaked almost the entire script of "The Realm of the Three Kingdoms,"

373
00:28:02,596 --> 00:28:05,598
and pointed out that the script has the potential to falsify history.

374
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:07,816
As a result, it went viral online.

375
00:28:07,816 --> 00:28:09,322
Netizens are furious.

376
00:28:09,323 --> 00:28:11,060
The official account is being bombarded with messages.

Get to the point.

378
00:28:12,013 --> 00:28:14,904
Stop filming and find out the truth.

379
00:28:19,413 --> 00:28:22,926
You Xi. A historical show falsifying history.

380
00:28:22,926 --> 00:28:25,420
You're really careless when accepting roles.

381
00:28:28,093 --> 00:28:30,500
I wanted to play fair with you.

382
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,919
Now it seems that I have no choice.

383
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,412
Song Qiege, you can come to me for revenge.

384
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:42,920
But what kind of person are you to bring down an entire project just to ruin me?

385
00:28:44,896 --> 00:28:48,532
You Xi, you really take yourself so seriously.

386
00:28:48,532 --> 00:28:50,805
Falsifying history is a fact.

387
00:28:50,805 --> 00:28:53,517
It's none of my business.

388

I'd love to see a drowning dog bark for mercy.

I am not a pushover.

What did he say?

405
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:57,880
It happened so suddenly. How did the script get leaked?

406
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,380
And how is it possible that it falsified history?

407
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,614
The production team is looking into it.

408
00:30:01,614 --> 00:30:03,979
We can only wait for the result.

409
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,125
I'm really confused.

410
00:30:06,126 --> 00:30:08,499
You, a top student in the history department,

411
00:30:08,499 --> 00:30:11,260
can't tell that there was something fishy going on with the script?

412
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,391
Brother Dazhuang, I read the script.

413
00:30:14,391 --> 00:30:18,106
It is historically accurate, and it did not falsify history at all.

414
00:30:18,106 --> 00:30:20,416
You must have missed something.

415

How can you say that?

If Little Wood said it's okay, then it's okay.

It's not the news about you.

in order to promote "The Realm of the Three Kingdoms."

Any progress?

491
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:27,692
Idol, I'm leaving.

492
00:36:27,692 --> 00:36:29,893
Look into it.

493
00:36:32,693 --> 00:36:34,638
Okay.

494
00:36:34,638 --> 00:36:36,670
I'm really leaving.

495
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,799
I wouldn't have come if he was going to be like that.

496
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,120
I was given the cold shoulder.

497
00:36:44,799 --> 00:36:47,219
Mr. Qi Chao is worried about you, too.

498
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:49,939
You still have your own issue on your plate after all.

499
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:54,952
Song Qiege, I don't care that you set me up.

500
00:36:54,952 --> 00:36:57,118
How dare you to set my bro up?

501
00:36:57,118 --> 00:36:59,172
I will hunt him down.

502
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:02,725
Pandora, I want you to witness it.

503
00:37:02,725 --> 00:37:06,198
This time, I'm going to teach someone a lesson.

504
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:12,707
Where is Duo Duo?

505
00:37:15,406 --> 00:37:16,984
Where did she go?

506
00:37:58,617 --> 00:38:00,040
How's it going?

507
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,819
Mr. You, they're smart.

508
00:38:02,819 --> 00:38:07,909
The questions they picked are all ambiguous and tricky.

509
00:38:07,909 --> 00:38:10,599
I need some time to sort out the materials.

510
00:38:12,419 --> 00:38:17,318
Song Qiege. So well-prepared.

511
00:38:18,419 --> 00:38:20,299
I'll see it through.

512
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,812
What do you mean out of touch?

513
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:16,699
Anyway, contact this singer.

514
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,230
Right.

515
00:40:13,715 --> 00:40:16,811
Good. Tell him to bring the manuscript.

516
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,327
I have to go.

517
00:40:52,299 --> 00:40:54,825
Hi, my idol.

518
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,220
♫  The world is so big,  ♫

519
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:31,120
♫  yet a word of love from you makes me melt  ♫

520
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:34,893
♫  Watching you decorate this little home,  ♫

521
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:39,639
♫  the overflowing happiness can barely be contained  ♫

522
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,812
♫  The noise of spring and autumn, the temperature difference between winter and summer  ♫

523
00:41:42,813 --> 00:41:45,220
♫  they've all become picturesque  ♫

524
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:48,571
♫  Even if worries accompany sunsets,  ♫

525
00:41:48,571 --> 00:41:53,721
♫  is there any reasons not to cherish the moment?  ♫

526
00:41:53,722 --> 00:41:57,373
♫  I'll be with you when you cry  ♫

527
00:41:57,373 --> 00:42:00,919
♫  I'll pamper you so that you won't ruin your makeup  ♫

528
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:06,527
♫  I will take you wherever you want to go  ♫

529
00:42:06,527 --> 00:42:09,598
♫  You are my girl  ♫

530
00:42:09,598 --> 00:42:13,038
♫  I want you to be my goddess for the rest of my life  ♫

531
00:42:13,038 --> 00:42:16,619
♫  I'll gently light the lamp in the quiet of the night  ♫

532
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:20,919
♫  I'll hold you in my arms and let you sleep soundly  ♫

533
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,669
♫  I'm your man  ♫

534
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:27,146
♫  I will take care of you with my all  ♫

535
00:42:27,146 --> 00:42:31,129
♫  I'll silently follow the perfect script in your heart  ♫

536
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:38,861
♫  It's you who makes everything
become possible and love to be flawless  ♫
