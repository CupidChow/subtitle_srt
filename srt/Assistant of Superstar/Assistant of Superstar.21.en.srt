We're not even here.

164
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,560
- Not here.
- Not here.

165
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,629
- To check up on me?
- Yes.

166
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,170
Nothing else?

167
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,220
Actually…

168
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,199
Actually, we're here for one more thing.

169
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Just one thing.

170
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,370
Go ahead. What is it?

171
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,740
Yaoyao, why don't you invite us

172
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,522
to meet with your father?

173
00:11:12,523 --> 00:11:14,686
That's not going to be a problem, right?

174
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,570
I want to meet my son's girlfriend's dad.

175
00:11:22,571 --> 00:11:24,170
What's wrong with that?

176
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,789
Mom, stop making it hard for Yaoyao.

177
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,669
What's hard about that?

178
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:33,390
I heard that Professor Yuchi is a great professor.

179
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,870
I have some academic questions

180
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,270
that I'd like to discuss with him.

181
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,867
You?

182
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,330
Yaoyao, it won't be a problem. Right?

183
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,167
- No problem.
- See? No problem.

184
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:00,960
Then, that's settled!

185
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,677
Check this out.

186
00:12:13,677 --> 00:12:18,029
I heard that collecting antiques has always been your passion.

187
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,413
That's why I asked someone to get me this.

188
00:12:20,413 --> 00:12:22,950
Can you please take a look at it for me?

189
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,600
The green color is vivid and thick.

190
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,650
The bottom of the vase is not glazed, and there are some red traces.

191
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,107
The painting has multiple layers, which are well-organized.

192
00:12:34,107 --> 00:12:37,270
This is truly a top-notch piece of work.

193
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,916
Professor Yuchi, you are truly a cognoscente.

194
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,169
This piece is a gift to you.

195
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:45,739
Mr. You, this is too much.

196
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:47,884
I cannot accept this.

197
00:12:47,884 --> 00:12:49,619
This is nothing.

198
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:52,870
It can't be more precious than your daughter, Yaoyao.

199
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,669
You've already given your precious daughter to my son.

200
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:56,810
This is really nothing.

201
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,340
Dad!

202
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,634
Please don't mind him.

203
00:13:00,634 --> 00:13:05,239
What he meant to say is that this humble gift shows our sincerity.

204
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:10,810
We came back this time mainly to settle their marriage.

205
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,339
Yaoyao, you are doing great at your school.

206
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:19,970
Our son won a lot of awards in his life, too.

207
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,420
- Let me show you.
- What awards?

208
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,559
This one is from the Children's Day Dancing Competition.

209
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:29,339
He received this when he was in the first grade.

210
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:31,526
This one is from his second year in middle school.

211
00:13:31,526 --> 00:13:33,428
He won a track and field competition.

212
00:13:33,428 --> 00:13:36,240
Best Civilization Award.

213
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,869
This one is impressive.

214
00:13:37,869 --> 00:13:44,161
He won the Best Posture award in a speech contest in high school.

215
00:13:44,161 --> 00:13:47,377
See? Our son is not so bad, right?

216
00:13:47,377 --> 00:13:49,240
You two are a good match.

217
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,099
Mom! Yaoyao, aren't you hungry?

218
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:58,070
- Okay, let's eat.
- Let's eat.

219
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,269
Brother Yuchi, we really should have met earlier.

220
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:05,706
I brought a bottle of good white wine.

221
00:14:05,706 --> 00:14:08,510
We should enjoy ourselves.

222
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,764
I can't believe you found this.

223
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,999
Looks like we are kindred spirits.

224
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:16,785
We shall drink until we are thoroughly drunk tonight!

225
00:14:16,785 --> 00:14:17,979
As you wish!

226
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:19,972
Here!

227
00:14:19,972 --> 00:14:21,304
Brother, I'm younger than you are.

228
00:14:21,304 --> 00:14:22,669
I'll make a toast with three cups first.

229
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:23,839
No, no, no!

230
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,129
With such great wine, there's no need to keep the formality.

231
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:28,079
Let's toast together.

232
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,630
Okay!

233
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,269
This is good wine.

234
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,599
- This is so good!
- Come on!

235
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,800
You should have some, too.

236
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,446
- We don't have to be so formal.
- Here, my wife.

237
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:44,160
I'll pour you a cup, too.

238
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,570
Your dad…

239
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,990
Drink up!

240
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,810
My dad!

241
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,902
He drinks like this?

242
00:15:00,902 --> 00:15:04,079
"Without worries, the moment is full of happiness."

243
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,999
"I got drunk unnoticed, and awoke all of a sudden."

244
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:09,247
"I stayed focused and listened, but there was no sound of thunder."

245
00:15:09,247 --> 00:15:11,699
"I looked closely yet could not see the silhouette of Mount Tai."

246
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:18,020
"I feel no heat nor cold nor the emotion generated from lust."

247
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,469
Let's eat.

248
00:15:21,469 --> 00:15:23,270
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

249
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,034
The wine tastes great!

250
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,710
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

251
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,239
Uncle You, I'd like to toast to you.

252
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:52,120
Here. Cheers!

253
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,639
I will make you my daughter-in-law no matter what!

254
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,190
Fantastic!

255
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,380
You've had enough.

256
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,509
Back off! I'm fine.

257
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:12,033
Since we are all in a good mood, I propose that we go to the karaoke together.

258
00:16:12,033 --> 00:16:14,920
Karaoke? Maybe not?

259
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:24,029
♪ Seeing off my friend who's going to the war ♪

260
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:28,105
♪ My tears fall down without a sound ♪

261
00:16:28,105 --> 00:16:30,926
This is the nice place that your dad talked about?

262
00:16:30,926 --> 00:16:32,119
Your dad is quite peculiar.

263
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,369
♪ I hear the sound of the bells on the camel's neck ♪

264
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:35,373
What did you say?

265
00:16:35,373 --> 00:16:40,800
- Nothing.
- ♫ Mountain after mountain ♫

266
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,339
It's your turn. Keep singing, come on!

267
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,479
Yaoyao!

268
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:11,850
Okay!

269
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:16,030
Yaoyao, this song is for you.

270
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,030
♫  The world is so big,  ♫

271
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:37,060
♫  yet a word of love from you makes me melt  ♫

272
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,801
♫  Watching you decorate this little home,  ♫

273
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:45,670
♫  the overflowing happiness can barely be contained  ♫

274
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:48,686
♫  The noise of spring and autumn, the temperature
difference between winter and summer  ♫

275
00:17:48,686 --> 00:17:51,155
♫  they've all become picturesque  ♫

276
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:54,659
♫  Even if worries accompany sunsets,  ♫

277
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:59,699
♫  is there any reasons not to cherish the moment?  ♫

278
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,917
♫  I'll be with you when you cry  ♫

279
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,000
Why did you drink so much when you clearly can't?

280
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,832
I have to clean up after you every time.

281
00:18:36,832 --> 00:18:39,820
Mr. You.

282
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,200
What?

283
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,850
Mr. You,

284
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:48,800
you think… if we…

285
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,347
If we really do get married,

286
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,790
then should I change my name...

287
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,484
to You Yuchi?

288
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,982
That sounds so weird!

289
00:19:11,982 --> 00:19:13,639
What do you mean?

290
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:17,210
Little Wood sounds so much better.

291
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,210
I don't care what the others call you.

292
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:25,730
Only I can call you by that name.

293
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,650
If you hear others call you that, don't answer.

294
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,200
You hear me?

295
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,440
Are you kidding me?

296
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,379
I want to throw up!

297
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:10,200
Don't!

298
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,819
Mr. You, you woke up early.

299
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:32,479
I didn't sleep at all.

300
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:35,480
The three of you have been throwing up all night and kept me busy.

301
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,774
It's already hard enough to look after you alone. Now I've got three of you.

302
00:20:38,774 --> 00:20:40,930
What did I do wrong?

303
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,010
My back hurts so much.

304
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,855
After all that alcohol, your stomach must be suffering.

305
00:21:00,855 --> 00:21:02,780
There's some porridge in the kitchen.

306
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:16,099
Take the shot! How nice!

307
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:18,238
Come on, keep shooting.

308
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,999
- The signal is weak!
- Don't mind us.

309
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:22,959
- You guys just keep talking.
- We're getting no bars here.

310
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:24,399
How come I can't get any signals?

311
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:26,440
Don't mind us.

312
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,760
Look at them.

313
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,154
The meat tastes great.

314
00:21:50,154 --> 00:21:51,609
Here, have some more.

315
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:53,496
Okay!

316
00:21:53,496 --> 00:21:56,420
When are you planning to go back?

317
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,369
What? Go where?

318
00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:00,210
Back to Australia.

319
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,439
We are not planning to go back just yet.

320
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:06,639
I'm planning to develop my business here in China.

321
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:08,126
Your mom is tired of the lifestyle there.

322
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,579
She also wants to stay here for a while.

323
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:12,150
So we are going to live here temporarily.

324
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:15,749
But don't worry, your dad and I won't be living here for too long.

325
00:22:15,749 --> 00:22:18,640
Two or three years at most.

326
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,922
What? We are not welcomed here?

327
00:22:32,132 --> 00:22:33,309
Just kidding.

328
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,000
You scared the hell out of me!

329
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,483
Your dad and I are smart enough to not stay in your way.

330
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:40,379
Right?

331
00:22:40,379 --> 00:22:44,309
Your mom and I came back to settle your marriage.

332
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,140
We will not disturb you two.

333
00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:48,481
Not even for one minute.

334
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,614
The cab is here.

335
00:22:53,614 --> 00:22:57,540
We're heading to the airport.

336
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,480
So soon?

337
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,726
Easy!

338
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,616
Uncle and Auntie, are you really leaving now?

339
00:23:11,617 --> 00:23:13,184
Don't you want to stay for a few more days?

340
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:18,140
No need. We just came here to meet our son's girlfriend.

341
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,930
We wanted to give him some advice.

342
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,951
After all, this is You Xi's first time being in a relationship.

343
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:24,750
He lacks experience.

344
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,820
First love?

345
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,358
Y-Y-You talk too much! All right. Just leave.

346
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:30,679
That's right! Let's leave.

347
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,269
We shouldn't disturb the two of them any longer.

348
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,650
We are bothering them.

349
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,841
Yaoyao, come visit us in Australia.

350
00:23:38,842 --> 00:23:42,400
We'll go see the kangaroos.

351
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,679
Let's go.

352
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,731
Time to leave. See you!

353
00:23:45,732 --> 00:23:47,456
Take care.

354
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,840
Why are you staring at me?

355
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,273
Mr. You, so you've never been in a relationship before?

356
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,510
So what?

357
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,691
What's the point of having experience on that front?

358
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,480
Stop right there.

359
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,250
Do you think that I should be ashamed because of that?

360
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,829
Just because you have, do you think that makes you better?

361
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:23,250
I'm telling you! I am a natural learner, and a quite talented one.

362
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,622
I…

363
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,050
From the first time I delivered food to you,

364
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,010
I fell in love with you.

365
00:24:33,137 --> 00:24:35,210
The highlight of my day

366
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,510
is when I receive your order...

367
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:41,440
and deliver the food to you.

368
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,040
Because that's when I feel like we're close.

369
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,970
That's right!

370
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:49,600
I don't have much to give.

371
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,240
But I will work hard and make us happy.

372
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,370
Will you be my girlfriend?

373
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,016
I don't want to!

374
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,529
Handsome Bro, have you ever observed the way the delivery guys speak?

375
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,323
What do you mean?

376
00:25:06,324 --> 00:25:07,901
Do they talk like that?

377
00:25:07,902 --> 00:25:10,018
I was pretty good!

378
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:12,952
Go experience the life of a delivery man after class.

379
00:25:12,953 --> 00:25:14,653
Delivery man?

380
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,815
Hey, Brother. Calm down.

381
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:27,370
The delivery is a moment away.

382
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,879
Hello? Are you You Xi?

383
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,870
Did I call the wrong number?

384
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,990
Brother Morry, do you have something important or not?

385
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,530
I'll get fined if I exceed the regulated time.

386
00:25:35,531 --> 00:25:38,909
My prince. It's true that we are having a hard time.

387
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:41,199
But you don't need to give up on your life!

388
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,913
Do you have something to say or not?

389
00:25:42,914 --> 00:25:44,490
Yes. Yes, I do.

390
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:47,309
There's a new movie that is holding auditions.

391
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,877
Why are you telling me that?

392
00:25:49,877 --> 00:25:53,299
Go away. I'm working.

393
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:54,639
Are you not interested?

394
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,829
Let me check the name of the director.

395
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,100
It's Wei Ran.

396
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:05,715
You came back early today, Mr. You.

397
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,701
I have good news and bad news.

398
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:11,880
Which one do you want to hear first?

399
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,131
Bitter before sweet.

400
00:26:13,132 --> 00:26:14,440
Tell me the bad news first.

401
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,509
I was fined when I was making a delivery.

402
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,890
I haven't earned a dime today.

403
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,349
That's all right, Mr. You.

404
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,410
Don't you have good news?

405
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,100
The good news is...

406
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,069
Director Wei Ran asked me to do an audition.

407
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,880
Really?

408
00:26:49,431 --> 00:26:53,310
Mr. You, where are your lines?

409
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,250
I can't find them.

410
00:26:56,912 --> 00:26:58,678
It's right here.

411
00:26:58,678 --> 00:27:00,699
I highlighted it.

412
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,400
Just one line?

413
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,679
That's not the point.

414
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,109
If I could just think about this line and feel the emotion that it conveys,

415
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,440
even this one line can become a classic.

416
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,349
I've analyzed the line.

417
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:24,029
The character that I'm going to play was a comrade of Guan Zhong in the army.

418
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,164
Guan Zhong and I are not exactly hitting it off.

419
00:27:26,165 --> 00:27:28,578
I laugh at his cowardly strategy,

420
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:30,593
because he does not want to advance.

421
00:27:30,593 --> 00:27:34,000
But at the night when Qi and its neighbor are engaged in battle,

422
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,680
a message comes from his hometown

423
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,890
informing us that Guan Zhong's mother passed away.

424
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,860
When we were switching at the watchtower,

425
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,450
I have to deliver this message to Guan Zhong.

426
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,650
Just one sentence.

427
00:27:54,243 --> 00:27:58,790
"Your mother has passed away."

428
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,800
What do you think?

429
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:08,250
I think your performance is not right.

430
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,960
What do you mean?

431
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,790
I think as comrades who left our hometown and came to the battlefield together,

432
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,940
we have families to think about.

433
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:21,180
There should be empathy when receiving a tragic message.

434
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,640
I agree with you on that.

435
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,555
But I think that

436
00:28:25,555 --> 00:28:30,781
everyone would be affected by the age they are in one way or another.

437
00:28:30,781 --> 00:28:32,764
In an age of war like that,

438
00:28:32,765 --> 00:28:36,358
you cannot let your personal emotion affect your devotion to your country.

439
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:39,069
The whole land is in chaos and the war is about to begin.

440
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:43,160
How could a man who is so enthusiastic be so sentimental?

441
00:28:53,161 --> 00:28:57,560
Mr. You, people understand the script differently.

442
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,295
It's just different opinions.

443
00:28:59,296 --> 00:29:01,069
And that's my opinion on the script.

444
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,000
I might be wrong.

445
00:29:03,724 --> 00:29:05,270
I get it now.

446
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,690
I know how to live like the character.

447
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,439
I'll cook today.

448
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,640
Thank you for your guidance, Miss Yao.

449
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:24,000
Look, my bangs are so long.

450
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,480
My skin is not so good,

451
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,514
and I have dark circles under my eyes!

452
00:29:27,514 --> 00:29:29,562
Do you think that would affect my performance?

453
00:29:29,562 --> 00:29:31,719
Don't worry, Mr. You.

454
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,391
You've got this.

455
00:29:33,392 --> 00:29:34,672
But there's no guarantee.

456
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:36,220
It'll be fine.

457
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,510
Excuse me. Could you please point me to the audition room?

458
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,467
You Xi? Aren't you, You Xi?

459
00:29:43,467 --> 00:29:46,100
That's me. Where is the audition for "Zhongfu"?

460
00:29:46,101 --> 00:29:48,186
Which part are you trying for today?

461
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:52,060
- Soldier A.
- Soldier A?

462
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,370
Yes. Soldier A.

463
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:58,341
The actor for Soldier A should line up there.

464
00:29:58,341 --> 00:30:01,042
[Zhongfu Group Audition]

465
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,640
Let's go!

466
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,240
Thank you.

467
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,440
Soldier A?

468
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,210
Seriously?

469
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:25,959
Mr. You, why don't you take a rest over there,

470
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:27,137
I'll stand in the line for you.

471
00:30:27,138 --> 00:30:28,399
That's okay.

472
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,200
My mentor is right.

473
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,810
I have to experience hardships and enjoy setbacks.

474
00:30:32,811 --> 00:30:36,254
They are all part of my life.

475
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,449
You Xi! You Xi!

476
00:30:39,449 --> 00:30:40,479
Look! It's You Xi!

477
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,919
He's auditioning, too!

478
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,439
It's really You Xi!

479
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,959
It's really him!

480
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,999
Excuse me. Is this the line for the audition?

481
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,160
What role are you going for?

482
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,510
The leading role.

483
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,790
Song Qiege is here, too!

484
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:57,000
It's really Song Qiege.

485
00:30:58,131 --> 00:31:01,860
You Xi, I feel happy

486
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,685
seeing you working so hard.

487
00:31:03,686 --> 00:31:08,688
Don't think you can become the leading actor again

488
00:31:08,688 --> 00:31:11,680
by starting out as an extra.

489
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,891
Even if you keep struggling till you are thirty or forty, when you are no longer pretty,

490
00:31:18,891 --> 00:31:24,113

Because Guan Zhong is a good son.

555

The soldiers always laugh at him for being timid

So, what have you written?

584
00:38:51,176 --> 00:38:55,407
A lot of things. Like my experiences when fighting in the entertainment industry,

How could that not fit?

591
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:12,000
Shouldn't a memoir be something about one's own experience?

Mr. You,

595
00:39:21,812 --> 00:39:26,291
what I'm saying is that we could think twice when it comes to the wording,

596
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:30,020
so that the readers can empathize

597

with the things that are happening.

- Yes.

00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,405
Take this part for example.

600
00:39:41,406 --> 00:39:44,475
For this part, we can use "sticking to each other,"

601
00:39:44,476 --> 00:39:48,364
"can't keep away from each other," or "intimate," or "illusive."

00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,390
In order to produce interest,

656
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:19,920
they invited the leading roles of two historical shows that will be on TV at the same time.

657
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,780
This episode will become a brutal battlefield.

658
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:29,519
If you won't go, Song Qiege will definitely say you are afraid.

659
00:43:30,323 --> 00:43:32,550
Me? Afraid of them?

660
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,839
I have to go!

661
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,480
I'm going!

662
00:44:14,904 --> 00:44:16,550
♫  The world is so big,  ♫

663
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:20,480
♫  yet a word of love from you makes me melt  ♫

664
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,148
♫  Watching you decorate this little home,  ♫

665
00:44:24,148 --> 00:44:29,094
♫  the overflowing happiness can barely be contained  ♫

666
00:44:29,094 --> 00:44:32,167
♫  The noise of spring and autumn, the temperature difference between winter and summer  ♫

667
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:34,674
♫  they've all become picturesque  ♫

668
00:44:34,675 --> 00:44:38,026
♫  Even if worries accompany sunsets,  ♫

669
00:44:38,026 --> 00:44:43,076
♫  is there any reasons not to cherish the moment?  ♫

670
00:44:43,076 --> 00:44:46,627
♫  I'll be with you when you cry  ♫

671
00:44:46,627 --> 00:44:50,173
♫  I'll pamper you so that you won't ruin your makeup  ♫

672
00:44:50,173 --> 00:44:55,806
♫  I will take you wherever you want to go  ♫

673
00:44:55,806 --> 00:44:58,853
♫  You are my girl  ♫

674
00:44:58,853 --> 00:45:02,393
♫  I want you to be my goddess for the rest of my life  ♫

675
00:45:02,393 --> 00:45:06,174
♫  I'll gently light the lamp in the quiet of the night  ♫

676
00:45:06,174 --> 00:45:10,074
♫  I'll hold you in my arms and let you sleep soundly  ♫

677
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:12,923
♫  I'm your man  ♫

678
00:45:12,923 --> 00:45:16,501
♫  I will take care of you with my all  ♫

679
00:45:16,501 --> 00:45:20,384
♫  I'll silently follow the perfect script in your heart  ♫

680
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:27,815
♫  It's you who makes everything become
possible and love to be flawless  ♫
