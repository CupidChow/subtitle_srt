Mr. You.

35
00:01:37,645 --> 00:01:39,752
You don't look like you slept well.

36
00:01:39,753 --> 00:01:42,230
Did you stay up late to prepare for the exam?

37
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:45,223
No, I didn't.

38
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,274
Sister Yaoyao.

39
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,655
Brother You Xi, how's your preparation for the exam going?

40
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,542
With the help of Teaching Assistant Yuchi,

41
00:01:58,542 --> 00:02:00,581
my preparation is going pretty well.

42
00:02:00,581 --> 00:02:01,970
And you?

43
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,970
It's not going so well for me.

44
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,770
Don't be upset.

45
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,669
It's all about participation.

46
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,168
By the way, thanks, Sister Yaoyao.

47
00:02:12,168 --> 00:02:14,137
She was on the phone with me for three hours straight last night.

48
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:16,311
Thanks for being so caring and encouraging.

49
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:18,257
I'd better head out.

50
00:02:22,253 --> 00:02:24,066
Three hours?

51
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:26,852
You were on the phone with him for three hours?

52
00:02:26,852 --> 00:02:28,470
You can't talk to him on the phone.

53
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,351
Why can't I?

54
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,410
Because you're my…

55
00:02:33,857 --> 00:02:35,753
My full-time assistant.

56
00:02:35,753 --> 00:02:39,078
What if I, your boss, have an emergency that you have to deal with?

57
00:02:39,078 --> 00:02:41,070
So do you have an emergency now?

58
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,438
I mean, in case there's an emergency.

59
00:02:43,438 --> 00:02:45,460
Yaoyao.

60

It's almost time for the exam.

62
00:02:49,243 --> 00:02:52,790
You're the supervisor. How come you're still outside?

63
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,806
We're all set.

64
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,287
Great.

65
00:02:56,062 --> 00:02:57,770
Who is this?

66
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,764
This is…

67
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:05,962
Master, this is You Xi.

68
00:03:05,962 --> 00:03:09,310
Yaoyao is currently his tutor.

69
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,024
I mean…

00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,010

71
00:03:18,058 --> 00:03:19,750
So you are You Xi?

72
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,361
Yes, Professor. I'm You Xi.

73
00:03:34,352 --> 00:03:38,631
Pretty sharp-looking though. No wonder you're a popular star.

79

81
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,150
Yes.

82
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:34,690
Excellent job.

83
00:05:35,452 --> 00:05:40,370
You've got all fill-in-the-blank questions of the Three Kingdoms correct.

84
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,349
As for the ancient poem's dictation part, you made a brilliant choice.

85
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:45,750
Good job.

86
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:50,399
"Not going so well," my ass.

88
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,570
Yes.

89
00:05:56,574 --> 00:06:00,744
You need to do better on the fill-in-the-blank section.

90
00:06:00,744 --> 00:06:03,507
As for ancient poems, you chose "Quiet Night Thought."

91
00:06:03,507 --> 00:06:06,590
This poem is a good one as well.

92
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:12,010
But your handwriting needs some improvement.

93
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,282

Student You Xi.

97
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:29,130
You didn't answer most of the fill-in-the-blank questions.

98
00:06:31,363 --> 00:06:34,743
As for those analytical questions, you didn't answer in the designated areas.

99
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,889
However, you made a great choice for the ancient poems.

100
00:06:42,658 --> 00:06:44,850
"Autumn is in the Air."

101
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:47,935
"Autumn is in the Air."

102
00:06:47,936 --> 00:06:51,210
"Autumn is in the hearts of the departed."

103
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,741
"A glass of wine evokes many emotions."

104
00:06:54,741 --> 00:07:00,774
"People tend to depart in the season of falling leaves."

105
00:07:00,774 --> 00:07:03,550
How emotional, right?

106
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:07,961
But next time, don't use music lyrics.

107
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:11,287
However, I do appreciate Jacky Cheung's songs myself.

108
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,727
Sit.

109
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:23,741
Next. We'll first learn a poem by Cao Cao,

110
00:07:23,741 --> 00:07:26,120
"The Longevity of the Tortoise,"

111
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,389
to help us truly appreciate the ambition of the people

112
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,740
during those troubled times.

113
00:07:34,595 --> 00:07:38,490
Student You Xi, why don't you come up and recite it?

114
00:07:40,574 --> 00:07:41,750
Me?

115
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,530
Yes.

116
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:49,066
Student You Xi, why are you still sitting there?

117
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:50,930
Hurry up.

118
00:07:53,698 --> 00:07:55,550
What poem?

119
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,896
Come on up.

120
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:31,949
What on earth is going on?

121
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:36,223
Is he trying to make a fool out of me together with his daughter?

122
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,270
"Although long lives the wise tortoise,

123
00:08:51,342 --> 00:08:54,330
in the end, he cannot but die."

124
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,956
Not bad.

125
00:08:55,957 --> 00:08:58,690
"Rise…

126
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,730
the serpent in the mist."

127
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,907
Pretty good. Not bad.

128
00:09:13,907 --> 00:09:18,010
You Xi, you did really well.

129
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,376
A true actor.

130
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:26,080
By the way, Cao Cao's poem, "The Sea," is one of my favorite poems.

131
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,340
You may recite it some other time.

132
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,070
I'd love to.

133
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,693
Professor Yuchi, after your class,

134
00:09:32,693 --> 00:09:35,389
I now have a brand new understanding of this poem.

135
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:38,869
Perhaps, that's the so-called charm of literature.

136
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:42,226
For every time I read it, I feel something new.

137
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:46,873
It's good to feel something. Keep up the good work.

138
00:09:58,445 --> 00:10:01,090
Watch and learn. Your dad is much more generous than you.

139
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,254
Mr. You, are you free tonight?

140
00:10:05,254 --> 00:10:06,250
Why?

141
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,655
I want to ask you to go to the roof with me.

142
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:14,387
The roof?

143
00:10:14,387 --> 00:10:16,910
Why the roof?

144
00:10:18,362 --> 00:10:22,356
We'll have a very important moment tonight,

145
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:25,530
and I want to spend it with you, Mr. You.

146
00:10:30,217 --> 00:10:33,741
Oh, you little dummy. You do remember my birthday just as I expected.

147
00:10:36,158 --> 00:10:37,770
Is that okay?

148
00:10:39,593 --> 00:10:42,660
Since you invited me so sincerely,

149
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:44,150
I'll…

150
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:47,050
Brother You Xi. Sister Yaoyao.

151
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,650
There's a meteor shower tonight. Let's go watch it together.

152
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,710
You heard about it, too?

153
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,730
Then let's watch it together, Mr. You.

154
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,870
So the important moment you mentioned is this meteor shower?

155
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:02,523
Yeah. The meteor shower in the constellation Lyra.

156
00:11:02,523 --> 00:11:04,530
It's quite rare.

157
00:11:05,786 --> 00:11:08,268
Yeah, Brother You Xi. Come on.

158
00:11:08,854 --> 00:11:10,424
How boring.

159
00:11:10,424 --> 00:11:12,570
Just go yourselves.

160
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:42,237
When is it going to happen?

161
00:11:42,237 --> 00:11:44,645
I know. I've never seen it before.

162
00:11:50,804 --> 00:11:52,950
Meteor shower.

163
00:12:06,608 --> 00:12:09,172
There's no such meteor shower.

164
00:12:09,172 --> 00:12:10,861
Liars.

165
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,553
What lies.

166
00:12:14,553 --> 00:12:16,553
They must have nothing else to do.

167
00:12:16,553 --> 00:12:19,022
Why is You Xi here?

168
00:12:22,265 --> 00:12:24,463
I'll definitely make her pay for this.

169
00:12:30,051 --> 00:12:32,301
There's no meteor shower.

170
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:40,952
There's nothing but mosquitoes. Forget it.

171
00:12:40,952 --> 00:12:42,430
I'm heading back.

172
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:48,901
How dare you trick me?

173
00:12:56,347 --> 00:12:59,235
Is anyone there? Open the door.

174
00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:11,530
The heck?

175
00:13:19,254 --> 00:13:21,063
Uncle Zou.

176
00:13:24,065 --> 00:13:26,749
Now that I've found my book, you can lock the door.

177
00:13:26,749 --> 00:13:28,805
Okay.

178
00:13:29,546 --> 00:13:31,130
Take a look.

179
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,741
Take a look at this guy.

180
00:13:32,742 --> 00:13:36,649
What did the girl ever do to you? Such an ingrate.

181
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,510
In return, he had an affair with her best friend.

182
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,517
He's a bad guy. Don't you agree?

183
00:13:43,746 --> 00:13:45,514
Can't agree more.

184
00:13:45,514 --> 00:13:47,223
Jerk!

185
00:13:48,178 --> 00:13:49,750
Uncle Zou, I'm leaving now.

186
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,467
Right.

187
00:13:53,938 --> 00:13:57,650
Now that the exam's already finished, why is the signal blocker still on?

188
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:01,583
No wonder I didn't snatch even one red envelope.

189
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,566
There's signal!

190
00:14:07,186 --> 00:14:10,002
Not now, Pandora.

191
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,829
- Hello?
- Third Uncle, where are you?

192
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:17,420
Listen, Pandora.

193
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:21,370
If this wasn't an emergency, I would have thrown you into the lake.

194
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,774
Isn't it your birthday today? Do you have any plans?

195
00:14:23,774 --> 00:14:25,419
Is my Prince Charming coming over?

196
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:27,869
Nope. Leave me alone.

197
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:32,848
Again? Always hanging up on me.

198
00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:36,032
Uncle Zou. Well…

199
00:14:36,032 --> 00:14:39,989
The director just told us. This signal blocker

200
00:14:41,843 --> 00:14:44,434
needs to be on. It can't be turned off.

201
00:14:44,434 --> 00:14:46,350
Okay, I'll leave it on then.

202
00:14:46,975 --> 00:14:48,447
Right, I'm leaving now.

203
00:14:48,447 --> 00:14:50,236
Yeah.

204
00:14:55,766 --> 00:14:57,881
No signal again?

205
00:14:59,244 --> 00:15:01,939
Pandora, this isn't over.

206
00:15:09,251 --> 00:15:11,350
May I ask for an autograph?

207
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:15,165
Are you a fan of mine?

208
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:17,690
So I've got fans now. Is there a name for my fan club?

209
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,775
Can you get me in the club?

210
00:15:19,776 --> 00:15:21,322
Of course, you have fans.

211
00:15:21,323 --> 00:15:22,856
I've admired you for quite some time now.

212
00:15:22,857 --> 00:15:24,451
Jia'er.

213
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:26,839
Well, you're mistaken.

214
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:29,176
Wait, don't go.

215
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:31,973
Right after I saw you just now, I'd decided to unfollow Zheng Jia'er.

216
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:35,181
From now on, you're my new muse. My dream girl.

217
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:36,192
You're quite casual, huh?

218
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:38,770
Beautiful, take a picture with me.

219
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:42,859
Since you're now a fan of mine…

220
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,787
Sure.

221
00:15:44,787 --> 00:15:46,283
Here.

222
00:15:54,362 --> 00:15:55,369
Who are you?

223
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,690
My idol.

224
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,050
What are you doing?

225
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,845
What am I doing? Why do you care?

226
00:15:59,846 --> 00:16:01,061
Where did you put your hand?

227
00:16:01,062 --> 00:16:02,829
Where did I put my hand?

228
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:06,076
Goddess, he's done me a great wrong.

229
00:16:07,062 --> 00:16:08,261
No, he hasn't.

230
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:10,182
He is my Prince Charming. He's always right.

231
00:16:10,182 --> 00:16:12,540
Thank you for coming, my idol.

232
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,650
He's bullying me.

233
00:16:20,456 --> 00:16:22,338
I still stan Zheng Jia'er.

234
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:25,037
You have bad insight!

235
00:16:25,037 --> 00:16:30,141
My idol. Thank you for coming here just in time and getting rid of the bad guy.

236
00:16:30,141 --> 00:16:32,269
Can you use your brain?

237
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:33,710
A girl needs to learn to protect herself.

238
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,289
Even primary school students understand that.

239
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:37,290
Why can't you?

240
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:41,053
My idol.

241
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:45,949
You really do care about me, don't you? You've been stalking me.

242
00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:48,420
You want to be my escort.

243
00:16:49,411 --> 00:16:50,832
You're hopeless.

244
00:16:50,832 --> 00:16:53,830
Prince Charming. In a few hours, Second Uncle and I will be celebrating Third Uncle's birthday.

245
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,315
- Why don't you come along?
- No.

246
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:58,555
Third Uncle would be pleased to have a huge gathering there.

247
00:16:58,555 --> 00:17:00,158
Take a look.

248
00:17:03,146 --> 00:17:04,714
Is that it?

249
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:07,967
Just keep an eye on it.

250
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,616
I'm so looking forward to seeing it.

251
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,866
Watching the meteor shower together is quite meaningful.

252
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:16,750
Oh right. It's Mr. You's birthday.

253
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:19,509
So, the important moment you mentioned was this meteor shower?

254
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:23,204
Yeah. The meteor shower in the constellation Lyra is quite rare.

255
00:17:23,204 --> 00:17:24,825
How boring.

256
00:17:24,825 --> 00:17:26,810
Just go yourselves.

257
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:34,552
Hello. The number you dialed is busy now.

258
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,422
Please wait…

259
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,608
How come there is still no signal?

260
00:17:56,998 --> 00:17:59,357
I'm not going to spend the whole night here, right?

261
00:17:59,357 --> 00:18:01,133
Sister Yaoyao.

262
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:10,850
This is for you.

263
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,570
For me?

264
00:18:16,264 --> 00:18:21,036
Sister Yaoyao, when I first saw this hairpin, I immediately thought it'd suit you.

265
00:18:21,036 --> 00:18:24,686
So, I'm giving this to you as a souvenir of our first time watching the meteor shower together.

266
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:29,202
I hope that I can watch all the meteor showers with you in the future.

267
00:18:32,871 --> 00:18:37,508
Wen Moxuan, what kind of gifts do you guys like?

268
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:43,110
Perhaps,

269
00:18:44,255 --> 00:18:48,017
the gifts that you can't get even when you've made every attempt.

270
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,341
Miss, I don't have money with me today.

271
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:58,549
As for the payment, I guess my handsome face will do?

272
00:18:59,522 --> 00:19:01,203
I see.

273
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,870
Thanks, Moxuan.

274
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,172
I've got things to do. See you.

275
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,690
No?

276
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,824
Those shoes were launched a few months ago.

277
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,550
They are sold out. I'm so sorry.

278
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:25,401
Well, could you please check again?

279
00:19:25,401 --> 00:19:27,670
Sorry, we really don't have them.

280
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,270
God, You Xi is so charming.

281
00:19:36,214 --> 00:19:39,751
These shoes are a gift for You Xi. They're his favorite.

282
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:42,490
For You Xi?

283
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,125
You mean this You Xi?

284
00:19:44,126 --> 00:19:45,165
Yes.

285
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,640
Go check the Chun Hua Road branch.

286
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,080
They're in a slump, so they must have some in stock.

287
00:19:49,081 --> 00:19:50,548
Hurry up, before it's too late.

288
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:51,650
On it.

289
00:19:51,651 --> 00:19:53,410
Wait!

290
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,573
I'll give you a ride.

291
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,447
What's wrong with him?

292
00:20:05,448 --> 00:20:07,930
He's not in the dorm. And he's not answering the phone.

293
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,090
Why don't you try calling Yaoyao?

294
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,810
You're right.

295
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:19,954
Even Yuchi Yaoyao is busy.

296
00:20:19,954 --> 00:20:22,330
They've disappeared together.

297
00:20:27,323 --> 00:20:31,013
Second Uncle, could they be…

298
00:20:31,013 --> 00:20:34,328
Pan Duo, stop! You're scaring me.

299
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,373
You Xi. You Xi.

300
00:20:39,373 --> 00:20:41,054
You Xi, where are you?

301
00:20:41,054 --> 00:20:42,930
You Xi.

302
00:20:43,481 --> 00:20:45,491
You Xi.

303
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,160
My idol, wait up.

304
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,222
Stay at a distance.

305
00:20:51,222 --> 00:20:54,866
My idol. Something just flew over there.

306
00:20:54,866 --> 00:20:56,264
I'm serious. I'm scared.

307
00:20:56,265 --> 00:20:57,842
I think I saw something over there, too.

308
00:20:57,842 --> 00:21:00,720
My idol, I'm scared.

309
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:07,043
So the rumors are true.

310
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,683
What rumors?

311
00:21:09,683 --> 00:21:12,963
They said a girl returned to her dorm after school.

312
00:21:12,963 --> 00:21:14,685
She walked through this corridor.

313
00:21:14,685 --> 00:21:16,041
And then…

314
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,349
Suddenly!

315
00:21:23,346 --> 00:21:25,642
My idol...

316
00:21:25,642 --> 00:21:28,317
I need to go to the bathroom.

317
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,200
My idol… I'm going to the bathroom.

318
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,100
Can you wait for me outside?

319
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,300
Okay, I'm going.

320
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,000
Please don't leave.

321
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,300
Please wait for me.

322
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,200
You have to wait outside.

323
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,500
Prince Charming,

324
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,400
are you still there?

325
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,800
If you are, can you say something?

326
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,900
Do you not want to talk?

327
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,800
If so, just clapping your hands will do.

328
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,200
Or just meow.

329
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,400
My idol.

330
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,700
I'm scared and alone right now.

331
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,100
Meow.

332
00:22:38,704 --> 00:22:42,524
[Don't use this emergency route]

333
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,600
Thanks.

334
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,400
Don't forget to give the stuff to You Xi for me.

335
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,000
Sure.

336
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,000
Twenty missed calls?

337
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,500
- Hello?
- Brother Dazhuang.

338
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
Where have you been? Where's You Xi?

339
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,800
Mr. You?

340
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,400
- Isn't he in the dorm?
- He's not.

341
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,200
It's quite late now.

342
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
Where could he be?

343
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,600
How dare you ask me?

344
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,500
My poor You Xi.

345
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,000
He used to have grand birthday parties,

346
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,800
and he was always the life of the parties.

347
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,500
If it wasn't for you and the risk of you being fired,

348
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,000
he wouldn't have had to do this show.

349
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,400
He wouldn't have been this desperate.

350
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,600
And have a lonely birthday.

351
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,200
Listen! If anything ever happens to You Xi,

352
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,700
I won't forgive you.

353
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,200
I can't believe I'm the reason why Mr. You is training for this show.

354
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,200
Am I getting fired from the job?

355
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,300
You can't be fired unless I say so.

356
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,500
Then what is that?

357
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,200
A contract.

358
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,600
Since the truth regarding the perfume body spray came out,

359
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,200
there's been an increase in the number of endorsements and campaigns.

360
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,400
I went through them, and this was the one I chose.

361
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,200
If I write the word "answer,"

362
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,800
will you give me one point?

363
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,600
Fine.

364
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,000
Okay.

365
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,100
But the time is up.

366
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:27,200
You can't write anymore, Student.
- You!

367
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,600
Mr. You.

368
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,900
Mr. You.

369
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,800
Mr. You.

370
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Mr. You, where are you?

371
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,800
- Are you free tonight?
- Why?

372
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,000
I want to ask you to go to the roof with me.

373
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,900
The roof?

374
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,200
Why the roof?

375
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,700
Mr. You.

376
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,990
Any recommendation for the best position to jump?

377
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,300
Don't.

378
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,600
Well, you only live once.

379
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,700
Don't even think about it.

380
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,600
So… like this?

381
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,400
Mr. You.

382
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,700
You are too handsome.

383
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,800
If you jump, your face will get damaged.

384
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,700
So, I'm handsome?

385
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,300
Yes, of course.

386
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,600
Then I'll jump like this.

387
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,500
Mr. You.

388
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,300
No matter what difficulties you're having,

389
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,400
I'll always be by your side.

390
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,300
Please, you mustn't.

391
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,800
Right.

392
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,500
Then, why were you on the phone with Moxuan for three hours?

393
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,600
He was having a hard time, so he asked me for help with his studies.

394
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,500
But you watched the meteor shower with him,

395
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,200
- leaving me alone here to—
- Mr. You.

396
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Happy birthday.

397
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,200
This is for you.

398
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,600
For me?

399
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,200
Happy birthday.

400
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,000
[Happy Birthday to the most handsome man.]

401
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,000
And this… Did you write this?

402
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
No.

403
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,400
One of your fans wrote it.

404
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,400
She asked me to give it to you.

405
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,600
Thanks to her, I was able to get these shoes today.

406
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,500
That one's mine.

407
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,000
[May you have boundless happiness and a long life.]

408
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,200
What… do you mean?

409
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,000
May you have boundless happiness and a long life.

410
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
This is my birthday.

411
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,800
And this greeting is way too common.

412
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
It's worse than the fan's.

413
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,900
Mr. You,

414
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,900
I'm afraid you wouldn't understand if I wrote something too deep.

415
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,600
I've spent quite some time coming up with this.

416
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,600
I thought you'd understand.

417
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,800
Of course, I understand.

418
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,800
I do.

419
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,300
I just… Your handwriting is illegible.

420
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,300
Such ugly shoes. Why would you buy these?

421
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,200
Don't you remember?

422
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,700
Last time we went shopping together,

423
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,000
you were kicked out of the shop by the shop assistant.

424
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,300
And these were what you picked.

425
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,800
I thought you liked them.

426
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,900
They launched a few months ago.

427
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,000
They're long out of season now.

428
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,200
Sorry, Mr. You.

429
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,800
I don't go shopping that much.

430
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,800
No worries.

431
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,200
Who am I? A fashionista?

432
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,400
Even if it's out of season,

433
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,000
I can still wear them and make them popular.

434
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
It's comfortable.

435
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,800
They look good.

436
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,200
So… did you pay for it with your own money?

437
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,600
Yeah.

438
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,000
You didn't use the reserve fund?

439
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,700
What reserve fund?

440
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,100
Didn't Zhu Dazhuang give you the reserve fund?

441
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,400
No.

442
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,900
What do you mean?

443
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,200
So I've been spending your money for the past few days?

444
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,000
Mr. You, I've earned enough for you to spend my money.

445
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,400
No, I'm your boss.

446
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,200
I'm You Xi.

447
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,600
How can I spend your money?

448
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,600
In a couple of days, I'll give you my company card.

449
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,800
Look, a meteor.

450
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,700
I thought you said a meteor shower?

451
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,200
How come there's only one?

452
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,300
Mr. You, let's make a wish together.

453
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,600
They say wishes will come true when made under a shooting star.

454
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,300
How childish.

455
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:09,200
I hope next time we can still make a wish together.

456
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,100
Yuchi Mumu.

457
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,400
Look carefully.

458
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,300
You call that a shooting star?

459
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,700
Oh, it's a plane.

460
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,000
What a waste of emotions.

461
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
What's wrong with you?

462
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,400
Mr. You.

463
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,100
Wait up!

464
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,000
So she got him a present, and they watched the meteor shower together.

465
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,400
She's clearly coming on to my friend, right?

466
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,600
So you have a friend who shares the same birthday?

467
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,200
Well, that's not the point.

468
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,600
The point is, my friend…

469
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,400
All the things that he said thoughtlessly,

470
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,200
she took them to heart.

471
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,700
She even bought a birthday present in secret.

472
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,900
A pretty expensive one.

473
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,900
You're only overly polite to the people who you don't know well.

474
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,400
And with the people you're really close to,

475
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,300
you'll be more attentive with care.

476
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,800
Attentive is what she is.

477
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,000
She even wrote the card herself.

478
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,700
What did she write?

479
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,600
[May you have boundless happiness and a long life.]

480
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,600
I'm only asking you to resolve my doubts.

481
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,600
Now you're throwing cold water on me.

482
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,000
As far as I'm concerned,

483
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
you envy people who are in love with each other.

484
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,100
Going to stop talking to you.

485
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,000
I'm leaving.

486
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,600
Mr. You.

487
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,000
Here's the company card.

488
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Well… I really don't need it.

489
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
What are you doing?

490
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,800
I'm writing a poem.

491
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,200
Do you want me to read it?

492
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,700
Just give me some advice.

493
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,200
But I know nothing about poetry.

494
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,800
It's fine.

495
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,600
You just have to tell me how you feel.

496
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,100
Okay.

497
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,700
"The light of the mountain county is hard to extinguish.

498
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,900
The wind is in my eyes.

499
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,200
The pleasant soil on the hillside.

500
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
The willow is smoky."

501
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,900
So, what do you think?

502
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,000
Mr. You.

503
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,800
I think it's great.

504
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,900
Good.

505
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:47,100
You are the first one to hear me reading my poem.

506
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,800
Where are you going?

507
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,600
The library.

508
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,700
You Xi.

509
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,700
Are you sure you've come to the right place?

510
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
This is the library.

511
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,000
Mr. You.

512
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,800
The next exam is in two days.

513
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,700
I can't believe you're still here playing with your phone.

514
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,400
Who says I'm playing?

515
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,600
I'm studying.

516
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,000
Liu Bei said.

517
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,600
Animated cartoons?

518
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,300
Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

519
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,300
What are you watching this for?

520
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,000
Those books of yours… I dozed off the second I read them.

521
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,500
I'd rather watch cartoons.

522
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,500
Here. Take this.

523
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,900
What's this?

524
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,400
It's an overview of the characters in the The Realm of the Three Kingdoms that I wrote.

525
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,000
I don't need this.

526
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,600
The life of Lü Bu.

527
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,400
Tailored for You Xi.

528
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,900
The one and only edition.

529
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,200
Three Heroes Combating Lü Bu.
(T/N: Three Heroes are Zhang Fei, Guan Yu, and Liu Bei)

530
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,600
"Zhang Fei stroked his beard and shouted."

531
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,900
"Lü Bu! You coward."

532
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,500
"You better not run away!"

533
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,100
"Zhang Fei was in high spirits.

534
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,600
He got in a fierce battle with Lü Bu.

535
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,700
They fought for more than 50 rounds

536
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,600
and ended in deadlock.

537
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,100
When Yun Chang saw this,
(T/N: Guan Yu also known as Guan Yun Chang)

538
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,600
he whipped his flying horse.

539
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,100
He waved his Green Dragon Crescent Blade, which weighed 90 pounds,

540
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,800
and attacked Lü Bu from the other side."

541
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,100
From the easy steps to the difficult ones, they turned complexity into simplicity.

542
00:36:55,592 --> 00:36:57,579
[Relationship of Characters]

543
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,100
Lü Bu's adoptive father is Dong Zhuo.
(T/N: Eastern Han Dynasty Warlord)

544
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,800
Liu Xie is Dong Zhuo's master.
(T/N: Liu Xie is the last Emperor of the Eastern Han Dynasty)

545
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,600
Liu Bian is Liu Xie's brother.
(T/N: Liu Bian is the 13th Emperor of Eastern Han Dynasty)

546
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,400
Thinking outside the box gives you a memory trail.

547
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,200
Too easy, not on the quiz.

548
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,000
Too common, not on the quiz.

549
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Too difficult, not on the quiz.

550
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,800
I don't know the answer. Hope you're not on the quiz.

551
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,200
So, not a single key point

552
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,600
for sixty years of the Three Kingdoms.

553
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,400
Identify the key points and clarify the misconceptions.

554
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,200
So uninspiring.

555
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,500
Now I'll be distributing the quiz papers.

556
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,600
Hey you. Now that you want to play Lü Bu,

557
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,900
can you tell me the meaning of "the slave of three masters"?

558
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,700
When Lü Bu was nine, his grandfather slaughtered a sheep.

559
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,400
Do you know the name of the sheep?

560
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,600
You Xi. What a wonderful counterstrike.

561
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,800
Students.

562
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,100
For the latest quiz,

563
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,000
the overall performance of the class

564
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
has improved compared to last time.

565
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,800
Among all, Student Wen Moxuan stands out.

566
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,800
Once again, he did pretty well.

567
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,400
In addition to his accuracy,

568
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,200
he even wrote down the answers in the Liu style

569
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,000
with a writing brush.

570
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,400
His calligraphy is vigorous,

571
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,300
having a style of his own.

572
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,200
That sounds exagerated.

573
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,700
In addition,

574
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,300
I've seen some of you make some huge progress.

575
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,200
You've made commendable efforts.

576
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,400
And by you I mean,

577
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,200
Student Pan Duo.

578
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,000
Student Pan Duo.

579
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
It's quite amazing how she herself

580
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,800
wrote a new poem on her previous work

581
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,300
on "Quiet Night Thought."

582
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,200
Elegant and refined.

583
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,600
It's a poem that I can relate to it.

584
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,400
I credit my bumpy relationship with this one.

585
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,900
What?

586
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,300
I'm humbled.

[Quiz Paper]

588
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,200
Mr. You.

589
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,600
What? Don't peep.

590
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,700
My score is confidential.

591
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,000
Well, I graded the quizzes.

592
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,700
Laugh all you want.

593
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,200
Your score was twenty times higher than the last one.

594
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,600
That's a huge improvement.

595
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,800
That's quite amazing.

596
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,800
You know what?

597
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,800
You're really bad at comforting people.

598
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,800
I do mean it. You've made huge progress.

599
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,100
As long as you keep working hard,

600
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,700
you'll definitely make greater progress next time.

601
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,400
Right.

602
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,000
This is what I call, a nice compliment.

603
