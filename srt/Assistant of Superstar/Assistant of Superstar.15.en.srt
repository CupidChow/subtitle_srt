[Episode 15]

34
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,530
My idol, can you not kick me out?

35
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,163
My second uncle has been very upset lately because of You Xi.

36
00:01:41,164 --> 00:01:44,133
He has been drinking every single day. And when he drinks, he'd beat me.

37
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:46,560
I'm so scared.

38
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,919
You can sleep in the guest room. Just leave me alone.

39
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:57,619
Yes, sir, my idol. Don't worry.

40
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:00,720
I'll leave tomorrow. I won't bother you much longer.

41
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,415
He's here.

42
00:02:05,415 --> 00:02:06,900
You Xi!

43
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,359
I absolutely adore you, You Xi.

44
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:11,352
- I'm your biggest fan!
- You can do it, You Xi!

45
00:02:11,352 --> 00:02:13,929
You Xi! The launch of the new fragrance was a massive success.

46
00:02:13,929 --> 00:02:18,149
You've endorsed Final's entire domestic product line for three years straight.

47
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,774
Is there anything you'd like to say about that?

48
00:02:19,774 --> 00:02:23,052
First of all, I'd like to thank Final for their recognition

49
00:02:23,052 --> 00:02:25,319
and my fans for their support.

50
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,584
So, You Xi, the TV series that you're a part of, "The Realm of the Three Kingdoms,"

51
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,192
has now been suspended for alleged falsification of history.

52
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,579
Do you have anything to say to the public in regards to that?

53
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,636
Regarding this, I hope that the public can spare me and my crew some time

54
00:02:41,636 --> 00:02:43,239
to look for the truth.

55
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,039
Today is for the new product release of Final.

56
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,619
I'd rather answer more questions about Final. Thank you.

57
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:52,419
May I ask for your honest opinion on this perfume, You Xi?

58
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:56,779
For me, it reminds me of the forest after it rains.

59
00:02:56,779 --> 00:02:59,840
There is the scent of vanilla with some petrichor
(T/N: A pleasant, distinctive smell frequently accompanying the first rain after a long period of warm, dry weather in certain regions)

60
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,991
and a slightly mysterious scent.

61
00:03:01,992 --> 00:03:04,941
Would you purchase this perfume yourself? And why would you?

62
00:03:04,941 --> 00:03:07,068
All right, everyone. That's it for today's press conference.

63
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:08,802
The Q&A session has come to an end.

64
00:03:08,803 --> 00:03:11,632
Thank you all for supporting Final and You Xi.

65
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:14,317
We'll be leaving now. Thank you, everyone.

66
00:03:14,317 --> 00:03:19,380
Come on, You Xi. Please say a few more things.

67
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,040
How about this?

68
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,040
Spray a bit more.

69
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,440
Here.

70
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,139
- What are you doing?
- Why do you care?

71
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:50,000
That's right.

72
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,570
I asked you first, so you should answer my question first.

73
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,517
Even kids understand this.

74
00:03:57,517 --> 00:04:00,500
Ugly people always cause more trouble.

75
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,180
Ugly?

76
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,439
- So you're saying Mr. You is ugly?
- That's right.

77
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,040
You heard me. What are you going to do about it?

78
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,698
What's wrong with Yuchi Yaoyao?

79
00:04:15,698 --> 00:04:18,292
Take a good look.

80
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:20,225
An aquiline nose shows the dignity of the man.

81
00:04:20,225 --> 00:04:21,837
Plus, he has bright eyes and thick eyebrows.

82
00:04:21,838 --> 00:04:23,533
So you must seriously be joking

83
00:04:23,534 --> 00:04:26,060
if you're telling me that Mr. You is ugly.

84
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:32,270
Mr. You not only has a beautiful face but also has a pure soul.

85
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,444
He cares about his fans and shows kindness to his staff.

86
00:04:35,444 --> 00:04:38,775
He's also loyal to his friends and dedicated to his career.

87
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:43,089
So you tell me, with a perfect idol like him,

88
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:45,144
how can you smear him?

89
00:04:45,144 --> 00:04:48,582
- He's ugly.
- He's just so ugly.

91
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,780
You Xi's there.

92
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,262
You Xi, let's get out of here.

93
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,300
Yaoyao got this.

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,767
Well done, Sister.

95
00:05:12,768 --> 00:05:13,953
You're one of his fans, right?

96
00:05:13,953 --> 00:05:17,111
Come on. Join our fan group.

97
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:20,398
- What?
- You Xi's fan group.

98
00:05:20,398 --> 00:05:22,240
Scan it.

99
00:05:25,842 --> 00:05:26,716
Quickly.

100
00:05:26,717 --> 00:05:28,738
Okay, you just joined. Let's keep in touch.

101
00:05:28,738 --> 00:05:30,700
- Let's go.
- Let's get out of here.

102
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,892
An aquiline nose shows the dignity of the man.

103
00:05:39,893 --> 00:05:41,697
Plus, he has bright eyes and thick eyebrows.

if you're telling me that Mr. You is ugly.

106

Mr. You not only has a beautiful face but also has a pure soul.

He cares about his fans and shows kindness to his staff.

He's also loyal to his friends and dedicated to his career.

109
00:05:56,353 --> 00:06:00,851
So you tell me, with a perfect idol like him,

110
00:06:00,851 --> 00:06:03,770
how can you smear him?

111
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,613
Because I like you better instead of him.

112
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:16,981
For you, I'll do my best.

113

Zhang Liao, with more than 800 soldiers, defeated an army of Wu troops,

00:22:42,338 --> 00:22:44,919
They are bullies.

321
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:46,358
That plagiarist.

322
00:22:46,358 --> 00:22:49,179
Shame on him, he turned to Weibo to pout.

323
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:51,754
He's trying to get sympathy, let's not mind him.

324
00:22:51,754 --> 00:22:53,452
- But…
- It wasn't a wild goose chase.

325
00:22:53,453 --> 00:22:55,118
If he doesn't admit it, we'll find out ourselves.

326
00:22:55,118 --> 00:22:58,946
If we find out who leaked the demo, he won't be able to deny it.

327
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:07,446
Let's post something.

328
00:23:07,446 --> 00:23:09,500
- Team Brother Chao!
- No.

329
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,435
You're also a hot mess right now.

330
00:23:11,435 --> 00:23:14,060
We should keep a low profile.

331
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:20,300
Little Wood, what do you think?

332
00:23:27,418 --> 00:23:31,220
I think given the pressure on this case,

333
00:23:32,485 --> 00:23:35,840
we should probably keep our heads down.

334
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,500
It's better for us anyway.

335
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,865
However, considering the fact that Mr. You and Mr. Qi Chao are buddies,

336
00:23:45,865 --> 00:23:49,477
he should definitely stand up for him. That's what a real gentleman would do.

337
00:23:49,477 --> 00:23:53,420
If you choose to stay out of trouble to save yourself,

338
00:23:55,193 --> 00:23:57,310
what kind of man are you?

339
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,980
[I know he works hard. Someday, all the bad reviews will disappear.]

340
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:11,995
Mr. You, I finished writing what you should post.

341
00:24:11,995 --> 00:24:14,371
That's my girl.

342
00:24:15,517 --> 00:24:16,952
Press send.

343
00:24:26,292 --> 00:24:28,299
Brother Chao, I really can't.

344
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:31,856
I can't manage that. It's too difficult.

345
00:24:31,856 --> 00:24:35,114
Three days, and that's it.

346
00:24:35,114 --> 00:24:38,203
I don't see what's so difficult about this.

347
00:24:38,203 --> 00:24:40,180
I don't want to hear it!

348
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:45,283
If you can't do this,

349
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:47,740
I think I need to get a new agent.

350
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,520
My idol, the delivery's here. I've ordered…

351
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:28,139
Come on, it's almost there.

352
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:33,927
Second Uncle!

353
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:38,040
You want to scare me to death?

354
00:25:39,232 --> 00:25:43,918
Student Pan Duo, so you know you have a home to come back to?

355
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:46,698
Second Uncle, I missed you.

356
00:25:46,698 --> 00:25:49,943
Second Uncle, are you hungry? Are you tired? Have you been busy lately?

357
00:25:49,943 --> 00:25:52,872
Do you need some special services?

358
00:25:52,872 --> 00:25:55,398
You can stop now, it's just not right.

359
00:25:55,398 --> 00:25:58,380
Just spit it out. What do you want?

360
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:04,140
Second Uncle, is your niece just that kind of person to you?

361
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,740
You bet.

362
00:26:14,736 --> 00:26:16,020
Not bad.

363
00:26:32,161 --> 00:26:33,920
It's good.

364
00:26:35,614 --> 00:26:38,614
Second Uncle, do you like it?

365
00:26:38,614 --> 00:26:39,992
It's good.

366
00:26:39,992 --> 00:26:42,120
Not bad at all.

367
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,500
Turns out my efforts on you were not in vain.

368
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,097
Second Uncle, since I've been so well-behaved today,

369
00:26:48,097 --> 00:26:51,548
maybe you should reward me.

370
00:26:53,358 --> 00:26:55,440
What handbag?

371
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,060
I'll pay.

372
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,938
Am I that superficial to you?

373
00:26:58,938 --> 00:27:00,912
Second Uncle, you've worked so hard for all that money.

374
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:04,010
I can't spend that.

375
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,988
- Actually, I just—
- Hold on.

376
00:27:06,988 --> 00:27:10,363
Listen, I'm not a matchmaker nor Cupid.

377
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:12,072
I can't make your idol fall in love with you.

378
00:27:12,073 --> 00:27:14,120
I just can't.

379
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,502
I'm not asking for that.

380
00:27:15,503 --> 00:27:18,514
What I'm asking you to do is actually quite simple.

381
00:27:18,514 --> 00:27:21,493
With the ties you have, you can easily do it.

382
00:27:21,493 --> 00:27:25,816
It's just… I want you to find out for me, who exactly

383
00:27:25,816 --> 00:27:28,480
leaked the demo of my idol's song.

384
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,706
What? I saw this coming.

385
00:27:31,706 --> 00:27:34,399
I'm done here! And these?

386
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,139
Just take them all away.

387
00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:39,499
Listen, I'm already exhausted handling You Xi.

388
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:42,920
I don't have the time to check this for you so don't get me involved in this.

389
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,696
Second Uncle, if you treat me like this, I'll call my mom.

390
00:27:45,696 --> 00:27:47,741
I'll tell her you took a bath in the tub I filled,

391
00:27:47,741 --> 00:27:52,416
had the pastry I made, enjoyed the massage I gave, and then went back on your words.

392
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:56,837
Duo Duo, as your second uncle, I do hope you can find a good match.

393
00:27:56,837 --> 00:27:58,966
But the truth is,

394
00:27:58,966 --> 00:28:01,168
you and Qi Chao are just not meant to be.

395
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:03,316
At first, I thought you were just being a child.

396
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:06,041
I thought you'd let go after a while, but I didn't see this coming.

397
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:08,071
Stop! What do you mean? Why would you say that?

398
00:28:08,071 --> 00:28:09,482
How are we not meant to be?

399
00:28:09,482 --> 00:28:11,280
Am I that bad?

400
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,176
Second Uncle, you're my beloved uncle.

401
00:28:13,176 --> 00:28:15,874
But is this any way to treat your niece? I'm going to tell Mom.

402
00:28:15,874 --> 00:28:19,215
Stop nagging, I'll be right on it.

403
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:26,339
Second Uncle, why did you say that about me and my idol?

404
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,760
[What does he think he's doing?]
[He's in on it with Qi Chao.]

405
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:44,660
Mr. You.

406
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,757
After you stood up for Qi Chao, your fans are all saying that—

407
00:28:47,757 --> 00:28:51,480
I know that I'm loyal.

408
00:28:54,341 --> 00:28:55,952
That you're in cahoots with him.

409
00:28:55,952 --> 00:28:59,260
That you're a partner in crime. That you're encouraging plagiarism.

410
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,948
What?

411
00:29:02,536 --> 00:29:04,920
They can say what they like.

412
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,177
Anyway, when this is cleared up,

413
00:29:07,177 --> 00:29:09,671
I'll make them apologize one by one.

414
00:29:18,686 --> 00:29:20,440
- Third Uncle!
- Hi, Duo Duo.

415
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,000
Hi, how are you?

416
00:29:30,881 --> 00:29:32,902
That's so cheesy.

417
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:37,638
Should've posed like this.

418
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,279
Second Uncle.

419
00:29:53,713 --> 00:29:56,651
It's been a long day, it's time for tea.

420
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:03,320
Enough already.

421
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,683
Stop being so solicitous.

422
00:30:04,683 --> 00:30:07,971
This is the report on your idol's case.

423
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,609
The problem is with your idol's agent.

424
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:17,731
Half a month ago, someone transferred a large sum of money to his account.

425
00:30:17,731 --> 00:30:20,790
That must be Shen Yiling and Song Qiege. These two bastards.

426
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:23,348
Always up to no good.

427
00:30:24,655 --> 00:30:26,399
Shen Dazhi? Who is she?

428
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,934
[China Bank Transactions]
Such a corny name.

429
00:30:27,934 --> 00:30:29,960
That's Shen Yiling's real name.

430
00:30:33,093 --> 00:30:36,344
Shen Yiling… I knew it was her.

431
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,140
Shen Dazhi, come out.

432
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:51,614
You are a disgrace. Did you bribe an agent and set my idol up?

433
00:30:51,614 --> 00:30:54,579
What are you talking about? I don't understand.

434
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:56,248
Still making excuses?

435
00:30:56,249 --> 00:30:58,803
You, get out.

436
00:31:04,091 --> 00:31:05,432
So what if I did that?

437
00:31:05,433 --> 00:31:07,264
Can you prove it?

438
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:11,124
- I checked the remittance—
- Remittance records?

439
00:31:11,124 --> 00:31:14,052
Oh, sweetie. Grow up.

440
00:31:14,052 --> 00:31:17,336
I can say that I bought the song from the agent.

441
00:31:17,336 --> 00:31:20,599
And the money is for his royalties.

442
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:23,022
- You—
- You want to pick a fight?

443
00:31:23,022 --> 00:31:24,979
You're still wet behind the ears.

444
00:31:27,642 --> 00:31:30,566
Bet you didn't know this but…

445
00:31:30,566 --> 00:31:33,483
I recorded what you just said.

446
00:31:33,484 --> 00:31:35,780
I learned it on TV.

447
00:31:37,914 --> 00:31:39,952
Did they tell you that

448
00:31:39,953 --> 00:31:43,480
you should always press start before recording?

449
00:31:48,935 --> 00:31:51,570
It's okay. You can record it now.

450
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:54,239
Pan Duo, it wasn't me.

451
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:57,060
Why are you accusing me?

452
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:09,583
What are you doing?

453
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:11,329
I'll expose them to your fans when I get back.

454
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,896
I'll send these pictures.

455
00:32:12,896 --> 00:32:16,253
Guards! Guards!

456
00:32:16,253 --> 00:32:17,999
Hey, can we talk?

457
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,289
I'm just a cute little girl.

458
00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:21,287
Please don't throw me out.

459
00:32:21,288 --> 00:32:23,391
You're hurting me.

460
00:32:26,943 --> 00:32:28,529
Shame on you, Shen Yiling.

461
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,917
I'll post all your embarrassing pictures.

462
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:37,760
Thank god no one was watching.

463
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:48,360
Hi, my idol.

464
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:01,311
My idol, was I embarrassing?

465
00:33:01,311 --> 00:33:02,860
Yes.

466
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,803
Actually, that was an accident. I'm not always like this.

467
00:33:07,803 --> 00:33:10,223
You've come here alone. Weren't you afraid…

468
00:33:10,223 --> 00:33:12,614
Afraid?

469
00:33:12,614 --> 00:33:14,840
Are you worried about me—

470
00:33:14,841 --> 00:33:17,340
That you would have alerted the enemy?

471
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,120
Shame on her. Now you hate me.

472
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,307
I'll definitely post her pictures.

473
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:27,517
My idol, look at this.

474
00:33:30,465 --> 00:33:34,493
This video can prove that the theme song for "The Realm of the Three Kingdoms" is your original work.

475

♪ Waking up and looking up at the sky ♪

476
00:33:52,619 --> 00:33:54,573

478
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,509
Duo Duo, when did you film this?

479
00:34:14,509 --> 00:34:19,200
Last time when Third Uncle brought me here to play Mahjong.

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,873
I wanted to leave.

481
00:34:21,874 --> 00:34:23,920
And you were so unwilling to.

482
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,678
I didn't see this coming.

483
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,665
So you stayed to film?

484
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,880
You're a peeping Tom. Don't tell others that you know me.

485
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,681
Third Uncle, that's not true.

486
00:34:32,682 --> 00:34:36,040
I really needed to use the bathroom.

487
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,419
Besides, if I hadn't filmed this,

488
00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:44,340
we wouldn't have been able to prove that my idol made this song before that Dynasty Man did.

489
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,119
I'm a girl of honor now.

490
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:49,799
You shouldn't treat me like this. Right?

491
00:34:49,799 --> 00:34:53,247
I was accused of encouraging plagiarism.

492
00:34:53,247 --> 00:34:55,615
They also said that Brother Chao and I…

493
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:58,039
We're…

494
00:35:02,489 --> 00:35:04,090
We're…

495
00:35:06,124 --> 00:35:08,180
I'm in cahoots with him.

496
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,797
Whatever.

497
00:35:10,797 --> 00:35:13,796
Please help me. Has anyone apologized yet?

498
00:35:16,503 --> 00:35:18,689
If not, you can go persuade them.

499
00:35:18,689 --> 00:35:20,386
Just try harder.

500
00:35:24,011 --> 00:35:27,075
Mr. You, your fans are praising you.

501
00:35:27,075 --> 00:35:30,018
They said you're a man of love and loyalty. A true man of courage.

502
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:31,448
You're the right person to get behind.

503
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:33,461
The most righteous man in the entertainment business.

504
00:35:33,462 --> 00:35:35,799
The perfect idol, the only one and…

505
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:37,620
And what?

506
00:35:39,943 --> 00:35:44,280
You and Qi Chao are true lovers.

507
00:35:49,744 --> 00:35:53,960
No wonder Mr. Qi Chao has been single after all these years.

508
00:36:01,565 --> 00:36:03,640
- No way.
- No way.

509
00:36:06,794 --> 00:36:09,880
My idol, why didn't you deny it?

510
00:36:13,467 --> 00:36:15,470
Are you really interested in my third uncle?

511
00:36:15,471 --> 00:36:16,580
Enough.

512
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,800
It's getting late. You guys should leave.

513
00:36:21,686 --> 00:36:23,105
Right. It's getting late.

514
00:36:23,106 --> 00:36:25,460
Go home. Feel free to come back and visit.

515
00:36:31,275 --> 00:36:34,040
Take your niece with you.

516
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,320
Tell her second uncle to keep an eye on her.

517
00:36:37,259 --> 00:36:39,919
You can't do this to me.

518
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,060
[Visiting Shen Dazhi behind-the-scenes: Beautiful, Natural beauty just like an angel.]

519
00:36:51,588 --> 00:36:54,498
Pan Duo. I'll make her pay.

520
00:36:56,475 --> 00:36:59,426
Being played by this little girl?

521
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:01,197
That's not your style.

522
00:37:01,197 --> 00:37:02,592
Now that the video has been posted,

523
00:37:02,593 --> 00:37:05,158
Qi Chao's suspicion of plagiarism has been cleared.

524
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:11,175
Let's face it, we're the ones being played.

525
00:37:11,175 --> 00:37:13,820
I never targeted Qi Chao.

526
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,460
I've always aimed for You Xi.

527
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:20,920
Then you'd better pray that there will be no more mistakes.

528
00:37:35,221 --> 00:37:39,421
Mr. You, why did you tell Duo Duo that she couldn't come with us?

529
00:37:39,421 --> 00:37:42,124
She could get in the back seat.

530
00:37:42,124 --> 00:37:43,849
Now it's just you and me.

531
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:46,582
I can't let her spoil it.

532
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:51,588
Besides, I'm only leaving her space with Brother Chao,

533
00:37:51,588 --> 00:37:53,980
so she'd be more grateful.

534
00:38:12,006 --> 00:38:15,114
You're home. That's enough.

535
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,992
My idol, I'm leaving then.

536
00:38:31,725 --> 00:38:35,921
This… This seat belt seems to be broken.

537
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:37,660
I can't unlock it.

538
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:53,246
My idol, next time when you write a song,

539
00:38:53,246 --> 00:38:54,705
you can ask me to record it for you.

540
00:38:54,706 --> 00:38:57,160
I mean, just in case.

541
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:02,723
I'm getting off now.

542
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:14,950
Okay.

543
00:39:17,363 --> 00:39:20,399
Really? It's a deal.

544
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:23,386
You'll see. I may bring my photography collection.

545
00:39:23,386 --> 00:39:27,693
Also, my… pajamas, toothpaste,

546
00:39:27,693 --> 00:39:31,640
toothbrush, and stuffed bunny.

547
00:39:33,386 --> 00:39:35,494
See you later.
