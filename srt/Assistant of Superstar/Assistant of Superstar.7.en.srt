How would I know that?

48
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,912
Maybe the teaching assistant was there before or maybe he was just a temporary hire.

49
00:02:47,912 --> 00:02:49,953
Or maybe the crew's assistant was the temporary hire.

165
00:11:19,927 --> 00:11:22,760
Because I wanted to see you for a bit longer.

166
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,547
Third Uncle, sorry, but I'm leaving first.

167
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:46,923
It's time to hand in your paper.

168
00:11:49,896 --> 00:11:53,248
Mr. You, why haven't you filled in your paper?

169
00:11:53,248 --> 00:11:57,038
If I write the word "answer," will you give me one point?

170
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,240
Fine.

171
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,696
Okay.

172
00:12:03,012 --> 00:12:04,448
But the time is up.

173
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:07,340
You can't write anymore, Student.

174
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,805
You!

175
00:12:12,475 --> 00:12:13,848
You!

176
00:12:58,252 --> 00:13:02,480
Uncle, is this Room 602?

177
00:13:03,906 --> 00:13:06,824
Uncle holding a chair leg,

178
00:13:06,825 --> 00:13:09,317
is this Room 602?

179
00:13:10,902 --> 00:13:13,360
What did you call me?

180
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,514
- Brother You Xi, it's you.
- Don't move!

181
00:13:16,514 --> 00:13:19,612
Who asked you to come in? Get out!

182
00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:23,484
Brother You Xi, I'm your roommate.

183
00:13:23,484 --> 00:13:25,349
Roommate?

184
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:27,580
You?

185
00:13:36,122 --> 00:13:42,207
Mr. You, later, you can go to the cafeteria and try the famous braised pork dish.

186
00:13:42,207 --> 00:13:43,638
Also, today is Tuesday,

187
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,188
so there is also a limited supply of wontons.

188
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:47,033
Do you want to try?

189
00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:52,716
There's also stir-fried chicken with chili, which is your favorite.

190
00:13:56,158 --> 00:13:58,000
Are you doing that on purpose?

191
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,450
What do you mean?

192
00:13:59,451 --> 00:14:02,800
Are you playing dumb?

193
00:14:02,803 --> 00:14:05,507
Did you want me to help you cheat?

194
00:14:08,517 --> 00:14:11,635
Why on earth are you angry?

195
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:16,072
Did you know that Yin Jiu would be coming as a teaching assistant?

196
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:18,093
I didn't know that.

197
00:14:19,994 --> 00:14:20,977
You didn't know?

198
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:23,160
I didn't know.

199
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:28,897
I want to eat wontons.

200
00:14:37,255 --> 00:14:39,906
Mr. You, here are the wontons.

201
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,695
I'm not hungry now. I'll eat later.

202
00:14:43,695 --> 00:14:45,674
The wontons are very delicious.

203
00:14:45,675 --> 00:14:47,616
They won't taste good when they get cold later.

204
00:14:47,616 --> 00:14:48,832
Eat them quickly.

205
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,395
I said I would eat them later.

206
00:14:50,395 --> 00:14:52,399
I can't eat them now.

207
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,455
Sister Yaoyao, we meet again.

208
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,134
I heard Jiangzhou University's meat wontons are very good.

209
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:05,399
Sister Yaoyao, can I…

210
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:09,149
T-This is for me.

211
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:11,120
Go buy it for yourself.

212
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,020
I bought the wontons over there.

213
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:34,884
As a result, Lü Bu hit the target and avoided a battle.

214
00:15:34,884 --> 00:15:39,001
This is the story of Lü Bu's halberd stunt at the military gate.

215
00:15:39,816 --> 00:15:41,281
That's all?

216
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,799
Why didn't Lü Bu just fight?

217
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:46,920
If he was so awesome, he would definitely defeat them all.

218
00:15:48,189 --> 00:15:52,139
Mr. You, Lü Bu was brave and strategically gifted,

219
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:53,678
but he was also resourceful.

220
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:55,970
He was not a simple warrior.

221
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:58,461
He knew that if the two sides went to war,

222
00:15:58,462 --> 00:16:00,408
there would be heavy casualties.

223
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:04,380
Why should he have to get into a fight when he could handle things peacefully?

224
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,899
He does seem different from the Lü Bu I knew before.

225
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:15,702
Damn. I have to go to the airport to pick up someone.

226
00:16:15,702 --> 00:16:16,923
I'm leaving, Mr. You.

227
00:16:16,924 --> 00:16:20,039
Pick up someone? Who is it?

228
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,480
Hey!

229
00:16:32,038 --> 00:16:33,695
Pick up someone?

230
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,980
Who is it?

231
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,634
The ancient capital where I went to explore this time

232
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:45,800
is really beautiful and has a long history.

233
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,002
Cultural relics from the Spring and Autumn Period

234
00:16:48,003 --> 00:16:50,840
to the Ming and Qing Dynasties are everywhere.

235
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,020
The most important thing is that gourd-shaped chickens

236
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,120
are the most delicious.

237
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,783
- Dad.
- It's true. Really.

238
00:16:58,784 --> 00:16:59,908
I'm not lying.

239
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:02,374
I'll take you to try the chicken next time.

240
00:17:02,374 --> 00:17:04,130
Okay.

241
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:07,526
Yaoyao.

242
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,600
How is your relationship with Yin Jiu now?

243
00:17:12,283 --> 00:17:13,948
Great.

244
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,358
That's good.

245
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,520
Yin Jiu is a good kid.

246
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,292
- When you graduate—
- I get it.

247
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:22,857
Dad.

248
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:25,218
Okay, okay.

249
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:27,478
Sweetheart, when we get home,

250
00:17:27,478 --> 00:17:31,158
I will make your favorite noodles with tomatoes and eggs.

251
00:17:31,158 --> 00:17:32,680
That sounds good.

252
00:17:34,955 --> 00:17:36,270
But, Dad,

253
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:41,240
could you stay at the hotel on campus first?

254
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,860
Why?

255
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,277
Because our house caught fire.

256
00:17:45,278 --> 00:17:46,796
Fire? You…

257
00:17:46,797 --> 00:17:49,337
Don't worry. I'm fine.

258
00:17:49,337 --> 00:17:54,510
It's just that the floors are soggy, and the walls are damaged.

259
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:57,018
Our house needs to be renovated.

260
00:17:57,712 --> 00:17:59,700
I'm glad that you're okay.

261
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,060
Where are you living now?

262
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:10,010
I'm living in my friend's house.

263
00:18:58,754 --> 00:19:01,320
Brother You Xi, you lose again.

264
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,704
One more.

265
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:07,880
Again.

266
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,424
You don't react as most people would.

267
00:19:11,425 --> 00:19:13,081
My assistant.

268
00:19:14,594 --> 00:19:17,211
Wen Moxuan, are you asleep?

269
00:19:17,211 --> 00:19:19,601
The mask is in the third compartment of your suitcase.

270
00:19:19,602 --> 00:19:21,706
Apply a face mask before you go to bed at night.

271
00:19:21,706 --> 00:19:24,386
Besides, you must have breakfast after you wake up in the morning.

272
00:19:24,387 --> 00:19:25,724
Do you understand?

273
00:19:25,725 --> 00:19:27,934
Be good. Good night!

274
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,400
My… assistant sends me a WeChat audio.

275
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,517
Let me hear it first.

276
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:52,084
Mr. You, even if you live outside, you must keep studying.

277
00:19:52,084 --> 00:19:56,215
Your studies last week went far better than expected, which is commendable.

278
00:19:56,216 --> 00:19:58,340
But you still have a lot of typos.

279
00:19:58,341 --> 00:20:00,240
You must pay attention.

280
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,352
By the way, Mr. You, I also found…

281
00:20:28,946 --> 00:20:32,695
Mr. You, are you unhappy again?

282
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:34,140
You don't care about me.

283
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,938
I care about you.

284
00:20:35,938 --> 00:20:39,600
Other assistants are gentle and caring when they show their concerns.

285
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,788
But you just ask me to study.

286
00:20:44,596 --> 00:20:48,587
Then I… will be more concerned about you.

287
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,500
I want to eat steamed stuffed buns.

288
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,100
Okay, Mr. You. I'll go buy them for you.

289
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,191
I want buns with fresh meat instead of braised meat.

290
00:21:04,191 --> 00:21:06,060
I got it.

291
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,160
Brother You Xi. Sister Yaoyao.

292
00:21:09,953 --> 00:21:11,620
You can't sit here.

293
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,858
Sister Yaoyao, have you had breakfast?

294
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:17,275
I bought you meat pies.

295
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:20,339
Our school has a limited supply of meat pies.

296
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:23,500
I saw you give a thumbs-up to our school's meat pies in the WeChat Moments.

297
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,804
So I thought you should have them.

298
00:21:25,804 --> 00:21:30,948
Thanks. Our school's meat pies are very delicious.

299
00:21:30,948 --> 00:21:34,440
You eat meat pies in the morning without thinking it's greasy?

300
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,525
Mr. You, help yourself to one meat pie.

301
00:21:39,525 --> 00:21:42,339
Our school's meat pies are really delicious.

302
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:44,269
I don't want it.

303
00:21:48,127 --> 00:21:51,064
Yaoyao, I remember you loved to eat our school's meat pies.

304
00:21:51,064 --> 00:21:52,900
Eat them while they're warm.

305
00:22:05,896 --> 00:22:07,754
She doesn't eat meat pies any more.

306
00:22:07,754 --> 00:22:09,386
She loves to eat noodles.

307
00:22:17,653 --> 00:22:19,403
Why are you looking at me?

308
00:22:40,394 --> 00:22:44,259
I think you could remove the whole sentence.

309
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:47,526
Otherwise, the expression would not be very clear.

310
00:22:47,526 --> 00:22:49,544
Third Uncle, how is your revision going?

311
00:22:49,544 --> 00:22:52,380
Can't you eat less as an actress?

312
00:22:53,935 --> 00:22:56,535
I don't eat your food.

313
00:22:58,459 --> 00:23:00,856
Sister Yaoyao, help yourself to some chips.

314
00:23:00,856 --> 00:23:03,029
- Thanks.
- I went the wrong way again.

Here are the meat pies. Hurry up and eat them.

317
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:54,325
Mr. You, I had an upset stomach last night,

318
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:57,400
so I really can't eat such greasy things.

319
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,056
Forget it then.

321
00:24:09,095 --> 00:24:14,612
Tell me. What's the matter with my friend's secretary's ex-boyfriend?

322
00:24:14,612 --> 00:24:16,733
He is against my friend in every way.

323
00:24:18,404 --> 00:24:20,670
You got me out of bed in the middle of the night to just talk about

324
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,760
the love history of your friend's secretary?

325
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,128
I'm just worried about my friend.

326
00:24:27,128 --> 00:24:30,120
Say, could her ex-boyfriend

327

I... I'm just worried about my friend.

333
00:24:46,711 --> 00:24:49,314
Besides, a department manager...

334
00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:56,160
has been chasing after her recently.

335
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,120
Her previous relationship hasn't been settled yet,

336
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,022
and comes another one.

337
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:04,599
Is she that popular?

How can a girl my friend like not be popular?

Brother Chao, what should he do?

340

- What do you mean?
- Will she choose my friend?

341
00:25:17,886 --> 00:25:23,098
Although my friend is tall, handsome,

342
00:25:23,098 --> 00:25:28,091
sensible, and likable indeed…
