[Episode 17]

33
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,674
Stir fry the chicken.

34
00:01:28,675 --> 00:01:30,723
Add dried chili pepper.

35
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,804
Stir it quickly.

36
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,078
You Xi isn't sensible,

37
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,018
and you aren't, either.

38
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:47,622
At such a critical time,

39
00:01:47,623 --> 00:01:51,106
you used company resources personally without notifying me

40
00:01:51,106 --> 00:01:55,315
only to help a mere assistant.

41
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,390
Zhu Dazhuang, what were you thinking?

42
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,280
- Mr. Zhang I—
- I made him do it.

43
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,320
It's not his fault.

44
00:02:08,609 --> 00:02:11,707
You Xi, you were stubborn before.

45
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:13,878
I could turn a blind eye.

46
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:17,485
But this time I can't. Even if it's you.

47
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:20,378
We will notify all PR employees to do whatever it takes to—

48
00:02:20,378 --> 00:02:24,618
What we have to do is to help Yuchi Yaoyao solve the crisis.

49
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:29,700
You Xi, don't cross the line.

50
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:33,605
I will not tolerate this.

51
00:02:33,605 --> 00:02:36,999
This is my bottom line. There's no room for negotiation.

52
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:41,186
All right.

53
00:02:41,186 --> 00:02:46,681
So, you make a statement, break up with her, and she'll be gone.

54
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:48,802
I can't do that.

55
00:02:51,691 --> 00:02:53,960
Then there's no room for negotiation.

56
00:02:54,706 --> 00:02:58,836
This contract does not have to continue, then.

57
00:02:58,836 --> 00:03:00,680
You Xi!

58
00:03:01,508 --> 00:03:04,009
What's wrong with You Xi?

59
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,293
Doesn't he know that a romance scandal for a celebrity

60
00:03:07,293 --> 00:03:09,198
is like the death of their career?

61
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,418
In any case, his popularity will plummet

62
00:03:11,418 --> 00:03:13,575
and advertisers will also sue him for breach of contract.

63
00:03:13,575 --> 00:03:15,393
I do admire him, though.

64
00:03:15,394 --> 00:03:17,302
He's not the smartest person

65
00:03:17,303 --> 00:03:19,899
but stepped up and is acting like a hero at the most critical time.

66
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,683
He risked his own success to help Yaoyao.

67
00:03:22,683 --> 00:03:26,403
This is the power of love. I'm sure you don't understand it.

68
00:03:26,404 --> 00:03:28,930
Love. What's the use of love?

69
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,138
Think about this. Director Zhang knows now.

70
00:03:31,138 --> 00:03:35,140
I think this time You Xi might suffer some blows.

71
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,658
Can a star in the entertainment industry

72
00:03:37,658 --> 00:03:40,195
just come crashing down like this?

73
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,510
Big news! Big news!

74
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,519
You Xi might get kicked out!

75
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,113
What?

76
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,050
Yaoyao.

77
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,409
Yaoyao.

78
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,239
Yaoyao, what brings you here?

79
00:04:02,998 --> 00:04:07,084
Xiao Qi, I'm here to deliver meals to Mr. You.

80
00:04:07,732 --> 00:04:10,563
You Xi should be busy now. I'll give it to him.

81
00:04:10,563 --> 00:04:12,590
That won't work.

82
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,480
It spilled already.

83
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,199
Don't tell You Xi that I came to see him.

84
00:04:33,414 --> 00:04:37,028
Does the scandal affect you a lot?

85
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:40,060
It's a minor problem. Don't worry.

86
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:42,856
Our relationship has gone public.

87
00:04:42,857 --> 00:04:45,960
Some companies want us to endorse wedding photos.

88
00:04:48,884 --> 00:04:50,540
Just kidding.

89
00:04:52,995 --> 00:04:54,984
Do you know your place?

90
00:04:54,985 --> 00:04:57,659
If you wanted to do something good for him,

91
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:59,009
just leave him.

92
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:02,058
You don't deserve to be with him.

93
00:05:02,058 --> 00:05:03,840
It's a call selling insurance?

94
00:05:05,422 --> 00:05:07,226
It's the delivery guy.

95
00:05:08,331 --> 00:05:10,560
You Xi doesn't know what's wrong.

96
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,899
Doesn't he know that a romance scandal for a celebrity

97
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:15,619
is like the death of their career?

98
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:17,479
You Xi might get kicked out.

99
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,240
What?

100
00:05:50,714 --> 00:05:53,309
You didn't go home? Did you wait for me?

101
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:07,899
I was waiting for you. To see you before I go.

102
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:23,432
Mr. You.

103
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,699
I've been thinking a lot today.

104
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:31,398
♫  Watching the leaves fall in the yard and listening as the seasons pass silently  ♫

105
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,183
When we first met,

106
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:36,340
♫  Watching the sun set behind the hillside in the distance  ♫

107
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:41,299
♫  It's natural for flowers to bloom and wither,  ♫

108
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,318
the very first time we met,

109
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,360
I took your bag by mistake.

110
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,291
and ruined your meeting with Director Wei Ran.

111
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:53,005
♫  But the love song for you is like the windmill from afar  ♫

112
00:06:53,006 --> 00:06:57,926
And then I accidentally became your tutor...

113
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:02,931
and assistant.

114
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:07,511
♫  My love, please forget me  ♫

115
00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:09,318
On the first day of work,

116
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:12,878
♫  because this way it's not worth it  ♫

117
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,979
I gave you a ride on my scooter.

118
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,915
Yuchi Yaoyao,

119
00:07:18,915 --> 00:07:20,852
do you really think this will work?

120
00:07:20,853 --> 00:07:23,155
My hair's all messed up.

121
00:07:23,155 --> 00:07:25,617
♫  My love, please forgive me as I can only accompany you till now  ♫

122
00:07:25,618 --> 00:07:27,578
And then...

123
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,580
at the press conference,

124
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,480
I ran away.

125
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:41,409
And you personally came to rescue me.

126
00:07:42,216 --> 00:07:44,317
Come to think of it,

127
00:07:45,808 --> 00:07:47,748
my appearance in your life...

128
00:07:49,782 --> 00:07:52,806
brings you lots of issues.

129
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:56,440
Well, if you say it that way, then yes it seems like it.

130

132
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:20,300

133
00:08:20,387 --> 00:08:21,529

♫  My needing freedom is just an excuse  ♫

135
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:27,170

00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,010
You have a career...

139

140

They can't be ruined because of me.

142
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,814
I used to wonder...

143
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,499
if it would have been different,

144
00:09:16,588 --> 00:09:18,529
if it hadn't been for me.

Hello.

153
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,292
You Xi, you finally got the right idea.

154
00:10:29,293 --> 00:10:32,263
Now, we'll hold a press conference to clarify.

155
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:34,292
The problem will be solved.

156
00:10:34,293 --> 00:10:35,896
And you'll continue to be a superstar.

157
00:10:35,897 --> 00:10:38,674
And she'll go back to her school and take her classes.

It's best for both of you.

What are you talking about?

160
00:10:42,187 --> 00:10:44,003
It's a statement from your Weibo.

161
00:10:44,004 --> 00:10:45,315
Right. Here it is.

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,294
even when she faced accusations for no reason,

322
00:25:17,294 --> 00:25:20,124
she always chose to suffer alone in silence.

323
00:25:20,124 --> 00:25:21,959
She's not only brilliant but also modest.

324
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,719
Her tireless teaching is like a beacon in the night,

325
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:31,540
guiding the lost lambs like You Xi and Pan Duo back on the right path."

326
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:35,160
Third Uncle, I didn't expect you to be so brilliant.

327
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,128
Enough. Enough. Hurry up and leave. Don't disturb my writing.

328
00:25:39,128 --> 00:25:41,842
Third Uncle, your statement is really moving.

329
00:25:41,842 --> 00:25:43,859
Whoever reads it will shed tears.

330
00:25:43,859 --> 00:25:46,500
Can you not post it?

331
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,670
Why?

332
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:51,304
Because I don't want to be a lost lamb. Delete my name.

333
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,381
Are you nuts?

334
00:26:00,381 --> 00:26:03,574
How can you say we're psychos?

335
00:26:03,575 --> 00:26:06,180
Do you think…

336
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:11,218
I asked you to defend Yaoyao, not to bash others.

337
00:26:11,218 --> 00:26:13,080
They might think we have no manners.

338
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,639
I'm just used to this.

339
00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:18,140
Brother Chao, your turn.

340
00:26:30,512 --> 00:26:32,189
Great.

341
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,850
[Yuchi Yaoyao is a very nice person, how can you say that about her?]

342
00:26:36,467 --> 00:26:42,120
Brother Chao, can you make it a little more inspiring?

343
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,420
It's so boring.

344
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,511
How will it attract viewers?

345
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,180
[Everything is nothing.]

346
00:27:01,185 --> 00:27:05,320
Your words are too out of fashion. What is this?

347
00:27:08,499 --> 00:27:10,598
My idol, it's out of fashion.

348
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,980
But I still think it's great.

349
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,388
Hello.

350
00:27:16,388 --> 00:27:22,658
You Xi, there are numerous florists who want to sponsor flowers for the press conference.

351
00:27:22,658 --> 00:27:25,078
How would you like the series "Farewell to the Past"?

352
00:27:25,078 --> 00:27:27,180
That fits our theme, doesn't it?

353
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,159
And, and… right.

354
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,658
Anyway, the "Farewell Tears" will be great, I think.

355
00:27:30,658 --> 00:27:32,259
- What do you say?
- Enough. Enough.

356
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:34,434
- You decide.
- You're letting me decide?

357
00:27:34,435 --> 00:27:37,150
Really? Hey! Hey!

358
00:27:37,758 --> 00:27:39,592
"Farewell to the Past."

359
00:27:41,332 --> 00:27:43,881
This will be it, then.

360
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:50,377
Third Uncle, what press conference?

361
00:27:51,205 --> 00:27:52,878
It's nothing.

362
00:27:52,878 --> 00:27:55,520
Does it have to do with Yaoyao?

363
00:27:57,811 --> 00:28:00,940
Is it about the love scandal?

364
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,720
Will you talk about your relationship with her?

365
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,760
I have my own responsibilities.

366
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,374
Third Uncle, I was so wrong about you.

367
00:28:09,374 --> 00:28:12,598
My idol, let's go. We won't help him with that.

368
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,800
No wonder she left you.

369
00:28:19,355 --> 00:28:20,888
Go.

370
00:29:03,396 --> 00:29:05,979
You are taking Yuchi Yaoyao's side by finding excuses for her.

371
00:29:05,979 --> 00:29:08,073
This must be one of her alternate accounts.

372
00:29:08,074 --> 00:29:09,979
Attention! Attention! It's the paid internet trolls.

373
00:29:09,979 --> 00:29:11,275
Everyone, attention!

374
00:29:11,275 --> 00:29:14,119
You said Yuchi Yaoyao didn't steal her friend's boyfriend.

375
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:17,478
You said she didn't use her dad's connections to get into Jiangzhou University.

376
00:29:17,478 --> 00:29:18,739
But do you have any evidence?

377
00:29:18,739 --> 00:29:21,199
If she isn't guilty, why did she resign and leave

378
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:23,560
instead of coming forward and explaining?

379
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,410
I'm not mad.

380
00:29:30,219 --> 00:29:32,320
Solve the problem.

381
00:29:41,397 --> 00:29:44,065
Did Yuchi Yaoyao steal her friend's boyfriend,

382
00:29:44,066 --> 00:29:47,380
or did her friend steal her disloyal boyfriend and cheat on her?

383
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,140
You can investigate and ask any insider at Jiangzhou University.

384
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,859
Then you'll know the truth.

385
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:55,159
Don't listen to the Internet trolls. It's pointless.

386
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:59,900
As for the rumor that she used her dad's connections to get into Jiangzhou University,

387
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,279
it's highly unlikely that she used connections.

388
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,218
She's so brilliant and smart. She's more than good enough.

389
00:30:06,218 --> 00:30:10,400
I'll post her poems so that you'll see how smart she is.

390
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,806
Lastly, as for the fact that she left without a word,

391
00:30:12,806 --> 00:30:14,312
she has done nothing wrong.

392
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,013
She just didn't want to hurt others,

393
00:30:16,013 --> 00:30:19,060
and she will come back some day.

394
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,716
Am I wrong?

395
00:30:20,717 --> 00:30:23,878
Were these poems really written by Yuchi Yaoyao herself?

396
00:30:23,879 --> 00:30:27,020
This is beyond university level.

397
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:31,219
Although I don't understand the poem, it looks very impressive.

398
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:33,059
I became her fan now.

399
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:34,340

My friend studies history at Jiangzhou University.

402
00:30:37,785 --> 00:30:40,999
She told me everyone in her department knew Tong Jin conspired with Yin Jiu

403
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,358
to cheat on Yuchi Yaoyao.

404
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,719

Yaoyao, look. It's very sunny outside today.

When you see a beauty, you chat her up. Do you want me to beat you?

428

She's really the Douban Goddess.

D-Do you have any complaints?

Dragon Fruit Entertainment exposed the scandal,

but it's one of the top news outlets in the industry.

00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:30,379
After the press conference tomorrow, I'll release all these photos.

I'll have to use face masks to recover.

No. I must contact a shop and make an appointment for a spa.

00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,307
I believe you've all seen this photo,

483
00:37:42,307 --> 00:37:44,784
but you probably have little knowledge of the inside story.

484
00:37:44,784 --> 00:37:48,360
Then I'll explain to you today.

485
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,899
The girl in the photo, Yuchi Yaoyao, is my assistant.

486
00:37:55,899 --> 00:38:00,199
She began to work for me four months ago and resigned three days ago.

487
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:02,793
She was very conscientious about her work.

488
00:38:02,793 --> 00:38:07,199
She was a professional and a responsible assistant.

489
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:12,049
I believe this photo was taken two months ago at a dinner party.

490
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:18,900
I did that to help her out of a predicament on the spur of the moment.

491
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:23,461
All the guests present can prove what happened that night.

492
00:38:23,461 --> 00:38:27,211
So, this photo from an unknown source is not enough

493
00:38:27,211 --> 00:38:30,750
to prove that she and I are together.

494
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:36,760
You're in trouble, but you still deny the fact.

495
00:38:37,514 --> 00:38:38,759
Send the photos.

496
00:38:38,759 --> 00:38:40,620
Good.

497
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,799
You Xi denied it.

498
00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:46,380
A romance that touched millions of fans actually ended like that.

499
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,260
The evidence...

500
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,360
should be at least like this.

501
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,279
There's actually a shocking twist on the scene.

502
00:39:19,279 --> 00:39:20,999
You Xi actually put his romance on display.

503
00:39:20,999 --> 00:39:24,618
The top celebrity You Xi made a romantic confession at the press conference.

504
00:39:24,618 --> 00:39:27,200
I can't believe this is happening!

505
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,261
What's going on?

506
00:39:31,261 --> 00:39:33,880
You Xi is courting disaster.

507
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,430
♫  The world is so big,  ♫

508
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:17,430
♫  yet a word of love from you makes me melt  ♫

509
00:40:17,431 --> 00:40:21,202
♫  Watching you decorate this little home,  ♫

510
00:40:21,202 --> 00:40:26,017
♫  the overflowing happiness can barely be contained  ♫

511
00:40:26,017 --> 00:40:29,092
♫  The noise of spring and autumn, the temperature difference between winter and summer  ♫

512
00:40:29,092 --> 00:40:31,417
♫  they've all become picturesque  ♫

513
00:40:31,418 --> 00:40:34,986
♫  Even if worries accompany sunsets,  ♫

514
00:40:34,987 --> 00:40:39,880
♫  is there any reasons not to cherish the moment?  ♫

515
00:40:39,881 --> 00:40:43,518
♫  I'll be with you when you cry  ♫

516
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:47,135
♫  I'll pamper you so that you won't ruin your makeup  ♫

517
00:40:47,136 --> 00:40:52,938
♫  I will take you wherever you want to go  ♫

518
00:40:52,938 --> 00:40:55,797
♫  You are my girl  ♫

519
00:40:55,798 --> 00:40:59,303
♫  I want you to be my goddess for the rest of my life  ♫

520
00:40:59,304 --> 00:41:03,097
♫  I'll gently light the lamp in the quiet of the night  ♫

521
00:41:03,098 --> 00:41:07,040
♫  I'll hold you in my arms and let you sleep soundly  ♫

522
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:09,901
♫  I'm your man  ♫

523
00:41:09,902 --> 00:41:13,440
♫  I will take care of you with my all  ♫

524
00:41:13,441 --> 00:41:17,414
♫  I'll silently follow the perfect script in your heart  ♫

525
00:41:17,415 --> 00:41:24,690
♫  It's you who makes everything become possible and love to be flawless  ♫
