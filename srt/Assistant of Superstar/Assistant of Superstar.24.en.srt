323
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:28,000
Let go of me!

324
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,150
Song Qiege, you ordered the security guards to hurt people.

325
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,410
It's all on camera!

326
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,247
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

327
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,282
Yaoyao!

328
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,780
She's going to be humiliated.

329
00:30:57,618 --> 00:30:59,248
Where's the evidence?

330
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,310
What evidence?

331
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:06,666
Where did you get that?

332
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,050
You Xi brought you here, didn't he?

333
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,047
Talk.

334
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,440
A worm will always remain a worm.

335
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,249
I can just lift my foot

336
00:31:19,249 --> 00:31:22,060
and let it down lightly

337
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,490
to squash you at any time.

338
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,480
Again! Again!

339
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,520
Hand me the microphone

340
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,350
since you have nothing to say.

341
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,966
Mr. Song Qiege, before I show the evidence,

342
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,724
I have just one question for you.

343
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:11,680
Did you really get the leading role through your skills alone?

344
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,700
You Xi and Shen Yiling dating at night.

345
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:27,910
I believe that everyone has seen the video online.

346
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:33,110
But why were they never seen together in the video?

347
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:37,800
That's because it was made using two completely unrelated videos.

348
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,604
The person Shen Yiling was seeing at the hotel that night was not You Xi.

349
00:32:41,604 --> 00:32:45,305
It was you. Song Qiege!

350
00:32:46,349 --> 00:32:49,466
I have evidence for everything I just said.

351
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,300
Are you finished?

352
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:16,420
You know what? I've been wanting to do this for a long time.

353
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:32,260
Also, I hate people interrupting my girlfriend when she's talking.

354
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,070
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

355
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:48,140
Why was the CCTV video at Huateng Hotel lost at the most critical moment?

356
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:51,962
That's because Director Tong made an agreement with Song Qiege in private.

357
00:33:51,962 --> 00:33:54,295
Director Tong was going to help Song Qiege remove You Xi

358
00:33:54,296 --> 00:33:57,239
and help him get the leading role in Director Wei Ran's movie.

359
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,270
In return, Song Qiege was going to bring Director Tong maximum commercial benefit.

360
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:04,880
But it's a pity that the director didn't trust Song Qiege

361
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,927
and secretly kept the CCTV video,

362
00:34:07,927 --> 00:34:11,110
intending to control Song Qiege one day.

363
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:27,219
Song Qiege! Song Qiege!

364
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:36,800
I… I just let her glance at it.

365
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,050
I deleted the video!

366
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,729
Song Qiege did all those for one purpose.

367
00:35:02,729 --> 00:35:06,129
To frame You Xi and stop him from making a comeback.

368
00:35:06,129 --> 00:35:09,666
And to replace him in the leading role.

369
00:35:09,666 --> 00:35:11,010
Who said that the leading role was his?

370
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:13,180
I did!

371
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,050
I had no idea that Song Qiege was going to be the leading actor.

372
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,630
In my mind,

373
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:29,060
You Xi has always been the leading actor.

374
00:35:50,698 --> 00:35:52,508
Not me?

375
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,840
Why not?

376
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,600
Stop being so quiet, Director Tong!

377
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:04,010
You have been lying to me for so long.

378
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:06,980
I believe in Director Wei Ran this time.

379
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,435
You…

380
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,110
Why do you think he's better than me?

381
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:37,020
Why do you think he's better than me?

382
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,900
Why You Xi and not me?

383
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,230
Why not me?

384
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:02,122
Mr. You is kind, brave, and responsible.

385
00:37:02,122 --> 00:37:04,660
He stands up for his friends.

386
00:37:05,727 --> 00:37:11,012
He even covered his rival's brother's medical expenses.

387
00:37:12,322 --> 00:37:14,590
Can you do better than that?

388

And you…

389
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,634
You did so many things for your own benefit

390
00:37:19,635 --> 00:37:22,235
and denied them all like you did nothing.

391
00:37:22,235 --> 00:37:27,368
You framed Mr. You with a fake video and even threw Shen Yiling under the bus.

392
00:37:27,368 --> 00:37:31,110
You're not even remotely close to being like Mr. You.

Congratulations. You won.

Do you regret it?

396
00:38:46,895 --> 00:38:50,600
You Xi, we've known each other for so long

397
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,275
and fought each other for so long.

398
00:38:53,275 --> 00:38:56,620
I never thought that you were better than me in any way.

I don't think Cai Ji is the right role for me.

407
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,720

408

How about…

409
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,260
How about you talk with Pan Duo

410
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,050
and ask her to give me the role of Tian Jing?

411

My princess, that's not my decision to make.

412
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:53,930
Then how about you talk with Director Wei Ran,

413
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:56,879
ask him to change the script and make Cai Ji the leading role?

414
00:39:56,879 --> 00:40:01,215
You Xi went from an extra with one line and then becoming the leading actor.

415

I don't suppose changing the script would be so hard.

Let the director decide. I think the B position is better.

I think A position is more romantic.

486
00:45:39,068 --> 00:45:42,836
♫  Watching you decorate this little home,  ♫

487
00:45:42,836 --> 00:45:47,782
♫  the overflowing happiness can barely be contained  ♫

488
00:45:47,782 --> 00:45:50,855

♫  Even if worries accompany sunsets,  ♫

491
00:45:56,614 --> 00:46:01,764
♫  is there any reasons not to cherish the moment?  ♫

497
00:46:21,081 --> 00:46:24,562
