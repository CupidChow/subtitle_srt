1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,228
(All characters, organizations,)

2
00:00:01,228 --> 00:00:02,596
(and events in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:02,596 --> 00:00:03,997
(Broadcasting guidelines were followed
during the shooting of animals.)

4
00:00:15,576 --> 00:00:16,944
The monthly expense...

5
00:00:20,948 --> 00:00:24,651
We're getting more subscribers, but why...

6
00:00:28,856 --> 00:00:29,890
I don't get it.

7
00:00:40,334 --> 00:00:42,269
Why are you like this?

8
00:00:45,973 --> 00:00:47,708
You're concerned about something,
aren't you?

9
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:51,512
I'm a CEO, so I'm always concerned.

10
00:00:52,646 --> 00:00:53,747
Let me excuse myself now.

11
00:00:57,117 --> 00:00:58,986
What is it?

12
00:00:59,419 --> 00:01:01,221
- Why do you keep...
- Silence.

13
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:05,459
Okay.

14
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,128
There's this saying.

15
00:01:09,596 --> 00:01:11,732
If you want to go fast, go alone.

16
00:01:12,266 --> 00:01:15,335
If you want to go far, go together.

17
00:01:16,803 --> 00:01:17,971
FAFT?

18
00:01:19,339 --> 00:01:21,708
What do you mean?

19
00:01:22,476 --> 00:01:24,144
What do you mean what do I mean?

20
00:01:25,279 --> 00:01:28,248
You should discuss it with CEO Ji.

21
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:30,951
Okay?

22
00:01:45,365 --> 00:01:48,202
CEO Cho, we made it.

23
00:01:48,202 --> 00:01:51,205
We'll reach
three million subscribers soon!

24
00:01:54,908 --> 00:01:56,810
CEO Cho, why the long face?

25
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,145
What's wrong?

26
00:01:58,145 --> 00:01:59,179
Nothing.

27
00:01:59,746 --> 00:02:00,681
What is it?

28
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:05,252
We don't have enough money.

29
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:08,088
What? We don't?

30
00:02:08,088 --> 00:02:11,124
But "TTC," "LUIC,"
and "JLMI" are all doing great.

31
00:02:11,124 --> 00:02:14,094
"JLMI" is "Actor Ji's 'Let's Make It.'"

32
00:02:14,094 --> 00:02:17,231
The monthly rent, monthly salary,

33
00:02:17,231 --> 00:02:20,634
rental fee of different equipment,
and manufacturing expenses.

34
00:02:20,634 --> 00:02:25,339
There's actually more input
than output on YouTube.

35
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:30,344
We don't have enough
to pay our employees this month.

36
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:34,114
What should we do, then?

37
00:02:34,481 --> 00:02:37,818
That's why I wanted to ask
if you have some money.

38
00:02:44,358 --> 00:02:45,192
And you?

39
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,028
All the loans I took out

40
00:02:48,028 --> 00:02:51,198
were spent on the housing lottery I won,

41
00:02:51,198 --> 00:02:53,200
so I'm penniless.

42
00:02:56,803 --> 00:02:57,971
I...

43
00:02:58,672 --> 00:03:00,807
As you know, I got swindled.

44
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:02,242
So I'm in the same situation as you.

45
00:03:02,242 --> 00:03:04,244
But a diamond on a dunghill is
still a diamond.

46
00:03:04,244 --> 00:03:07,948
You used to be the national actor
Ji Jin Hee. Don't you have anything?

47
00:03:10,117 --> 00:03:11,318
That didn't pay much.

48
00:03:12,152 --> 00:03:13,987
Do we have to get a private loan now?

49
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,858
I...

50
00:03:17,858 --> 00:03:18,792
I'll...

51
00:03:19,793 --> 00:03:22,496
sell my car and golf clubs.

52
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,032
Then how are you going to get to work
or play golf?

53
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:27,601
I'll take public transportation,

54
00:03:28,502 --> 00:03:30,604
and golf...

55
00:03:32,773 --> 00:03:35,542
I won't play golf anymore.

56
00:03:35,542 --> 00:03:37,711
That's not important anymore, is it?

57
00:03:37,711 --> 00:03:39,713
Paying our employees comes first now.

58
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:41,715
Jin Hee.

59
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,685
- Darn it.
- Darn it.

60
00:03:45,752 --> 00:03:47,588
Don't you have anything to sell?

61
00:03:47,588 --> 00:03:48,689
I...

62
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:50,757
have none.

63
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,527
You bum.

64
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:56,230
I didn't do anything
for the past ten years.

65
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:01,168
(Director Bong)

66
00:04:03,003 --> 00:04:03,871
Hello?

67
00:04:03,871 --> 00:04:06,406
Long time, Actor Ji. It's Director Bong.

68
00:04:06,406 --> 00:04:08,075
Hello, Director Bong. How have you been?

69
00:04:08,075 --> 00:04:09,476
Good.

70
00:04:09,476 --> 00:04:13,247
I heard news that your production company
is on a roll.

71
00:04:13,247 --> 00:04:15,415
It's doing okay.

72
00:04:15,415 --> 00:04:17,251
I called to ask you...

73
00:04:17,251 --> 00:04:20,254
if you could appear as a cameo
in my drama.

74
00:04:21,455 --> 00:04:23,790
A cameo?

75
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,791
Yes.

76
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,761
I know you don't do cameos, Actor Ji.

77
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:29,663
But I really want it to be you.

78
00:04:31,498 --> 00:04:33,367
How much will he pay you? Ask him.

79
00:04:36,937 --> 00:04:39,039
Director Bong,
I'm sorry, but I have to ask.

80
00:04:39,806 --> 00:04:41,842
How much do I get as a cameo?

81
00:04:41,842 --> 00:04:45,746
It's awkward saying this,
but 5,000 dollars is on my mind.

82
00:04:45,746 --> 00:04:46,947
Please consider it.

83
00:04:46,947 --> 00:04:49,116
If you appear ten times,
it'll be 50,000. Say yes.

84
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:50,817
Say yes.

85
00:04:50,817 --> 00:04:52,386
Seriously? Just say yes.

86
00:04:52,386 --> 00:04:53,554
Hello?

87
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:55,956
Actor Ji?

88
00:04:55,956 --> 00:04:57,357
Yes.

89
00:04:57,357 --> 00:05:00,294
Yes, I'll do it. Thank you, Director Bong.

90
00:05:00,294 --> 00:05:02,462
- Thank you for everything.
- Thank you so much.

91
00:05:03,363 --> 00:05:06,567
Thank you for leading me, helping me,
and paying me.

92
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:09,903
Thank you for calling me, too. Thank you.

93
00:05:09,903 --> 00:05:11,538
- Thank you.
- I'll work hard.

94
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:13,640
Okay. Thank you.

95
00:05:15,075 --> 00:05:19,012
(Episode 10-1
Famous Ji-des)

96
00:05:21,315 --> 00:05:23,550
(Episode 10)

97
00:05:24,651 --> 00:05:27,321
Do you have any idea
for the concept of "TTC" Episode 5?

98
00:05:28,622 --> 00:05:30,390
Well,

99
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,227
how about "Camping in Love?"

100
00:05:33,694 --> 00:05:35,863
We'll find three male
and female campers each,

101
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:37,731
and they'll find their partner
while camping together.

102
00:05:37,731 --> 00:05:39,366
Actor Ji will naturally be the MC.

103
00:05:40,267 --> 00:05:43,036
That sounds nice.
Should we also join the cast?

104
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,875
Scriptwriter Wang.

105
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:49,743
Yes?

106
00:05:51,411 --> 00:05:53,046
Are you still angry at me?

107
00:05:56,884 --> 00:05:59,186
No. Why would I be?

108
00:06:00,154 --> 00:06:01,421
But you seem so.

109
00:06:04,825 --> 00:06:05,792
I'm not.

110
00:06:06,527 --> 00:06:08,562
I'm actually really thankful.

111
00:06:10,297 --> 00:06:12,633
You sincerely helped me
when I was looking for Kick.

112
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:15,602
You even gave me your shoes.

113
00:06:17,237 --> 00:06:19,973
I was quite awesome, wasn't I?

114
00:06:19,973 --> 00:06:20,941
I know.

115
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:22,976
Whatever.

116
00:06:24,178 --> 00:06:27,548
If you could be on a dating show,
which one would you choose?

117
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:29,283
I'd be on "Rebound Relationship."

118
00:06:31,485 --> 00:06:32,586
Why?

119
00:06:32,586 --> 00:06:33,453
Look.

120
00:06:34,454 --> 00:06:37,858
It'd be a feast
of an explosion of dopamine.

121
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:39,259
Think about it.

122
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:42,029
Your Friend At Night flirting...

123
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:44,398
with other girls under the same roof.

124
00:06:45,566 --> 00:06:46,667
Darn it.

125
00:06:48,802 --> 00:06:49,937
Don't be ridiculous.

126
00:06:49,937 --> 00:06:53,073
I'll try and make a composition plan
in that concept.

127
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,675
I'm leaving now.

128
00:07:04,184 --> 00:07:06,220
She's so easy to read.

129
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:08,989
But strangely, she's tricky.

130
00:07:16,797 --> 00:07:20,067
It'd be a feast
of an explosion of dopamine.

131
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:21,568
Think about it.

132
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:24,238
Your Friend At Night flirting...

133
00:07:24,238 --> 00:07:25,806
with other girls under the same roof.

134
00:07:28,075 --> 00:07:29,576
Shit.

135
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:37,551
A banquet to celebrate
the Northern Duke's victory was held...

136
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:39,486
in the royal palace.

137
00:07:39,486 --> 00:07:41,955
Wang Yeo Joo had parted with him,

138
00:07:41,955 --> 00:07:45,225
but she had no choice
but to go to the banquet.

139
00:07:45,926 --> 00:07:47,828
Wang Yeo Joo stared
at the Northern Duke...

140
00:07:47,828 --> 00:07:50,597
everyone was cheering for.

141
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:51,798
Just then,

142
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:54,902
a lady with a dress
as fancy as a peacock came up...

143
00:07:54,902 --> 00:07:57,371
to the Northern Duke and talked to him,

144
00:07:57,371 --> 00:08:00,507
touching his sturdy chest.

145
00:08:00,507 --> 00:08:03,777
Yeo Joo could not hold back at the sight.

146
00:08:03,777 --> 00:08:06,280
Her entire body was eaten away
by jealousy.

147
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,648
That night,

148
00:08:07,648 --> 00:08:10,450
Wang Yeo Joo secretly entered
the lady's bedchamber...

149
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,453
and pulled out all her pink hair...

150
00:08:17,357 --> 00:08:18,659
Am I jealous?

151
00:08:22,095 --> 00:08:23,030
But jealousy is...

152
00:08:24,765 --> 00:08:26,767
what you feel
when you have feelings for someone.

153
00:08:33,607 --> 00:08:36,176
No.

154
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:43,650
There.

155
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,486
- Director Bong.
- Hello.

156
00:08:46,186 --> 00:08:47,988
- Long time no see.
- Actor Ji.

157
00:08:47,988 --> 00:08:50,824
I'm so thankful
you accepted this cameo part.

158
00:08:50,824 --> 00:08:51,959
Don't mention it.

159
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:53,427
I read the script.

160
00:08:53,427 --> 00:08:55,429
What exactly is it
that I have to do today?

161
00:08:55,429 --> 00:08:56,430
It's simple.

162
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,699
You're a popular actor,

163
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:01,368
and your vampire girlfriend approached you
knowing that.

164
00:09:01,368 --> 00:09:03,604
But even when she tries
to bite your throat,

165
00:09:03,604 --> 00:09:05,305
you're like, "I could die for you."

166
00:09:05,305 --> 00:09:06,974
You're a man with unwavering love.

167
00:09:06,974 --> 00:09:08,542
You're a great actor with romantic eyes,

168
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:11,144
so I thought of you
when I read about this part.

169
00:09:11,144 --> 00:09:12,379
Of course.

170
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:14,248
- These eyes?
- Yes.

171
00:09:14,248 --> 00:09:15,649
The best, as expected.

172
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:17,584
- Let's start now.
- Okay.

173
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:18,986
Ready.

174
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:20,854
Action.

175
00:09:20,854 --> 00:09:21,855
Bella.

176
00:09:23,023 --> 00:09:24,224
I'm ready.

177
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:25,893
Edward.

178
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,361
Bella.

179
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:35,469
Cut.

180
00:09:36,036 --> 00:09:38,672
Actor Ji, why did you laugh?

181
00:09:38,672 --> 00:09:40,974
Sorry. I'm really ticklish on the neck.

182
00:09:40,974 --> 00:09:42,409
Sorry. Let's go again.

183
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:45,179
Bite him until he bleeds.
I think he should bleed some.

184
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:47,447
- Sorry.
- Let's go again.

185
00:09:47,447 --> 00:09:49,783
- Let's try that again.
- Okay.

186
00:09:49,783 --> 00:09:51,718
Bite hard, so it hurts.

187
00:09:51,718 --> 00:09:52,920
- Okay.
- It tickles.

188
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,655
Ready.

189
00:09:54,655 --> 00:09:55,756
Bite hard.

190
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:57,157
Action.

191
00:09:57,157 --> 00:09:58,091
Bella.

192
00:09:59,626 --> 00:10:01,161
I'm ready.

193
00:10:01,161 --> 00:10:02,062
Edward.

194
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:11,038
It tickles.

195
00:10:12,472 --> 00:10:14,308
Why did you blow on my neck?

196
00:10:14,308 --> 00:10:16,944
Actor Ji, you shouldn't laugh
in this scene.

197
00:10:16,944 --> 00:10:18,579
I'm sorry.

198
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:19,947
But the time...

199
00:10:19,947 --> 00:10:21,582
Are you out of your mind or what?

200
00:10:21,582 --> 00:10:22,883
Sorry.

201
00:10:24,284 --> 00:10:25,886
Let's try that again.

202
00:10:25,886 --> 00:10:27,621
Wait a minute.

203
00:10:27,621 --> 00:10:29,756
How about making it extreme?

204
00:10:29,756 --> 00:10:32,192
You feel too ticklish
and laugh until you die.

205
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,695
- What?
- Since you're good at that.

206
00:10:34,695 --> 00:10:35,796
Okay. Good.

207
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:37,064
When he dies, bite him.

208
00:10:37,064 --> 00:10:38,532
That's when you bite him.

209
00:10:38,532 --> 00:10:41,235
Let's go again.

210
00:10:41,235 --> 00:10:43,570
- He laughs and dies?
- Yes, he does.

211
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,605
Ready.

212
00:10:45,072 --> 00:10:45,973
Action.

213
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:48,876
Bella.

214
00:10:57,351 --> 00:10:58,352
It tickles.

215
00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:06,860
Edward?

216
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,328
Cut. Okay.

217
00:11:08,328 --> 00:11:10,430
That was crazy.

218
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,999
That was perfect.

219
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:14,902
Was that okay? Are you sure?

220
00:11:14,902 --> 00:11:16,403
It was amazing.

221
00:11:16,403 --> 00:11:18,372
- Good job.
- Seriously.

222
00:11:21,308 --> 00:11:25,646
We need more drinks and firewood.

223
00:11:27,714 --> 00:11:28,549
Wait.

224
00:11:32,219 --> 00:11:33,153
What's this?

225
00:11:35,155 --> 00:11:36,657
Is this Scriptwriter Wang's?

226
00:11:43,997 --> 00:11:47,835
Why are you so terrified, PD Kang?

227
00:11:48,368 --> 00:11:50,270
What brought you here?

228
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:55,042
I lost something here.

229
00:11:57,578 --> 00:11:59,613
Goodness. That's it.

230
00:11:59,613 --> 00:12:02,049
Was this yours, Ji Won?

231
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:03,450
Yes.

232
00:12:04,251 --> 00:12:06,720
It's an earring made
of the small crystal...

233
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,957
found among the cremated remains
of a Buddhist monk I knew.

234
00:12:09,957 --> 00:12:12,326
So it's really important.

235
00:12:12,326 --> 00:12:13,260
I see.

236
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,762
Thank you so much for finding it for me.

237
00:12:15,762 --> 00:12:18,465
I just saw it on the floor.

238
00:12:23,504 --> 00:12:26,139
Let me buy a meal in return.

239
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:26,974
I'd love that.

240
00:12:26,974 --> 00:12:28,809
- Really? Let's go, then.
- Okay.

241
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:29,910
Can I eat something expensive?

242
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,712
Of course you can.

243
00:12:31,712 --> 00:12:33,847
I have to confirm
this melancholy feeling.

244
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:36,550
Yes!

245
00:12:37,484 --> 00:12:38,719
What?

246
00:12:38,719 --> 00:12:39,887
Let's go.

247
00:12:39,887 --> 00:12:41,188
Great.

248
00:12:41,188 --> 00:12:44,958
What's your favorite dish, PD Kang?

249
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,094
I like everything free.

250
00:12:47,094 --> 00:12:48,262
Same.

251
00:12:48,262 --> 00:12:50,497
- Today...
- Today?

252
00:12:50,497 --> 00:12:53,133
there's this Italian place I found.
How about going there?

253
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:55,836
I'd love that. Pasta.

254
00:12:55,836 --> 00:12:57,104
Let's go.

255
00:12:57,104 --> 00:12:59,606
They're eating pasta together?

256
00:13:00,674 --> 00:13:02,309
At a place he found himself?

257
00:13:03,377 --> 00:13:04,444
So...

258
00:13:05,212 --> 00:13:06,713
Kang Tae Ho, that jerk,

259
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:09,149
in that camper van,

260
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,419
found a new Friend At Night
and a Friend Sharing Meals?

261
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:18,859
No. This may be a misunderstanding.

262
00:13:20,093 --> 00:13:21,428
I should find out.

263
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:35,976
This is so good.

264
00:13:35,976 --> 00:13:37,878
Why aren't you eating, Jasmine?

265
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:41,215
I'm a small eater.

266
00:13:41,215 --> 00:13:44,885
So seeing you eat makes me full,
PD Tae Ho.

267
00:13:45,385 --> 00:13:46,987
Of course. I eat with relish.

268
00:13:46,987 --> 00:13:48,989
Seriously? Seeing him eat makes her full?

269
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:50,757
Is she his mom or what?

270
00:13:52,726 --> 00:13:54,928
- Try this, too.
- Thank you.

271
00:13:54,928 --> 00:13:56,063
Would you like to order?

272
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,033
I'd like the signature dish here.

273
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:01,902
And a glass of beer.

274
00:14:01,902 --> 00:14:03,270
Okay. I'll take the menu.

275
00:14:05,172 --> 00:14:06,440
Please, no.

276
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,909
I'm sorry,
but we don't have enough of this.

277
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:09,843
No.

278
00:14:09,843 --> 00:14:11,245
Why are you like this?

279
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:18,852
Where's the bathroom?

280
00:14:18,852 --> 00:14:21,221
- It's outside.
- Outside?

281
00:14:24,258 --> 00:14:25,392
This is so good.

282
00:14:28,295 --> 00:14:29,329
You should eat more.

283
00:14:30,464 --> 00:14:32,099
- Jin Hee, we got another offer.
- For what?

284
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:33,901
- We got another cameo role.
- What's the role?

285
00:14:33,901 --> 00:14:34,968
It's noir again.

286
00:14:34,968 --> 00:14:36,904
- Do I die again?
- Yes, you do.

287
00:14:36,904 --> 00:14:38,572
But this time, I'm on it, too.

288
00:14:38,572 --> 00:14:40,774
They said they'd pay a few thousand more
if I appear with you.

289
00:14:40,774 --> 00:14:42,409
A few thousand more? What's the role?

290
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:45,445
This time, we get shot looking cool
like we're in "A Better Tomorrow" and die.

291
00:14:45,445 --> 00:14:46,446
- We get shot looking cool.
- Yes.

292
00:14:48,382 --> 00:14:49,583
With a match in our mouths.

293
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:50,951
Like this.

294
00:14:50,951 --> 00:14:52,920
We're shooting
a Hong Kong movie this time.

295
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,754
Bang.

296
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:57,157
And dead. Like this?

297
00:14:57,157 --> 00:14:58,959
- You're shot through your coat.
- Like this.

298
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:02,029
Bang.

299
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,598
Bang.

300
00:15:04,598 --> 00:15:06,366
- Like this.
- Get up.

301
00:15:23,317 --> 00:15:25,319
That punk.

302
00:15:50,511 --> 00:15:51,345
Jin Hee.

303
00:15:52,913 --> 00:15:53,814
Young Sik?

304
00:15:58,285 --> 00:15:59,553
Give up now.

305
00:16:01,989 --> 00:16:02,823
Young Sik.

306
00:16:03,924 --> 00:16:05,259
If you move, I'll shoot.

307
00:16:09,163 --> 00:16:12,332
- I'm sorry, Young Sik.
- Jin Hee.

308
00:16:13,367 --> 00:16:14,234
Jin Hee.

309
00:16:18,572 --> 00:16:19,406
My goodness.

310
00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:23,377
What?

311
00:16:29,283 --> 00:16:30,717
Goodness, poor him.

312
00:16:38,392 --> 00:16:39,226
What?

313
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,428
Is he dead?

314
00:16:43,697 --> 00:16:45,833
(Actor Ji died
because of Pikachu's electric shock?)

315
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,968
(Hades, the god of the dead?
No, it's Ji-des now.)

316
00:16:47,968 --> 00:16:49,102
- My goodness.
- Sorry.

317
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:52,339
- My goodness.
- Sorry.

318
00:16:53,974 --> 00:16:55,008
Goodness, poor him.

319
00:17:00,747 --> 00:17:01,748
CEO Ji.

320
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:03,951
CEO Ji.

321
00:17:03,951 --> 00:17:05,319
You're out already. Good.

322
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,453
Let's go. Come here.

323
00:17:06,453 --> 00:17:07,955
What brought you here
in the morning, CEO Cho?

324
00:17:07,955 --> 00:17:09,823
Get in the car. I'll tell you on our way.

325
00:17:09,823 --> 00:17:12,226
Why? I haven't even sold my car yet.

326
00:17:12,226 --> 00:17:13,660
We're on a roll.

327
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,162
What do you mean?

328
00:17:15,162 --> 00:17:18,131
Your acting in the dying scene
made the viewer ratings soar.

329
00:17:18,131 --> 00:17:20,167
- So you got a bigger cameo role.
- Really?

330
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:21,068
Yes, so let's go.

331
00:17:21,068 --> 00:17:23,303
- Then let's ask for more money.
- Yes. We should do that.

332
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:25,272
Okay. But where are we going now?

333
00:17:25,272 --> 00:17:26,373
Busan.

334
00:17:26,373 --> 00:17:27,741
Busan? All they way to Busan?

335
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:30,043
Yes. You're beaten to death this time.

336
00:17:30,043 --> 00:17:31,578
You'll be beaten to death.
You can do that, right?

337
00:17:31,578 --> 00:17:33,213
Then, ask for a higher appearance fee.

338
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:34,748
Sleep on the way there. I'll drive.

339
00:17:34,748 --> 00:17:36,416
- Okay.
- Let's go.

340
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,930
That punk. You brat.

341
00:17:50,831 --> 00:17:53,600
Lee Hyun Hak.

342
00:17:54,101 --> 00:17:56,170
I knew this day would come, you punk.

343
00:17:56,603 --> 00:17:58,071
Look at his natural acting.

344
00:17:59,339 --> 00:18:02,609
It's the best day to die, isn't it?

345
00:18:03,744 --> 00:18:06,446
Just stay still, okay? Here we go.

346
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,655
- You should die now.
- You prick.

347
00:18:16,023 --> 00:18:18,258
Stop it, you prick. You've had enough.

348
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,196
- The boss is dead.
- Dead.

349
00:18:22,196 --> 00:18:24,464
He died looking cool.

350
00:18:28,101 --> 00:18:31,238
Actor Ji, you're dead now. Don't move.

351
00:18:31,238 --> 00:18:32,506
Don't move.

352
00:18:33,073 --> 00:18:36,743
Actor Ji, you're clasping and unclasping
your hands. It shows on the screen.

353
00:18:36,743 --> 00:18:39,947
Why clasp and unclasp your hands?
Are you a baby or what?

354
00:18:41,982 --> 00:18:44,184
- Seriously? Cut.
- Cut.

355
00:18:44,184 --> 00:18:46,220
- Actor Ji.
- Actor Ji, what's wrong with you?

356
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,588
This is frustrating.

357
00:18:47,588 --> 00:18:49,823
You can stay here. I'll go talk to him.

358
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,960
What are you doing? This is embarrassing.
You're supposed to be dead.

359
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,695
Seriously.

360
00:18:54,695 --> 00:18:56,663
Drink this first.

361
00:18:57,664 --> 00:18:59,733
You should do it properly.

362
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:02,302
But they keep stepping on me.
They stepped on my hand.

363
00:19:02,302 --> 00:19:04,338
They stepped on my side, too.

364
00:19:04,338 --> 00:19:07,307
- They're going to really kill him.
- It hurts so much.

365
00:19:07,307 --> 00:19:08,542
Just hang in there.

366
00:19:12,045 --> 00:19:14,481
Don't you see all the staff
having a hard time?

367
00:19:14,481 --> 00:19:17,951
There's a camera there and there, too.

368
00:19:17,951 --> 00:19:19,753
Look at the camera.

369
00:19:19,753 --> 00:19:22,556
This is for KICKKICKKICKKICK.

370
00:19:22,556 --> 00:19:23,624
Okay.

371
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:40,707
- What?
- That was unexpected.

372
00:19:40,707 --> 00:19:41,909
A blind date?

373
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:45,779
He's a doctor
and he's ten years younger than me?

374
00:19:46,313 --> 00:19:48,215
Then, he should be a university student.

375
00:19:48,215 --> 00:19:49,483
Don't you have a conscience?

376
00:19:50,784 --> 00:19:52,452
I see.

377
00:19:52,452 --> 00:19:54,521
It wasn't ten years, but one year.

378
00:19:54,988 --> 00:19:56,790
You said it wrong.

379
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,959
What? He looks like Cha Eun Woo?

380
00:20:00,093 --> 00:20:01,562
He looks like Cha Eun Woo.

381
00:20:01,562 --> 00:20:03,030
Cha Eun Woo.

382
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,264
Marriage?

383
00:20:04,264 --> 00:20:06,300
A one-year honeymoon?

384
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,902
Of course, I can quit my job right away.

385
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,505
He must love me so much.

386
00:20:11,505 --> 00:20:12,539
Hold on.

387
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:14,408
Yes?

388
00:20:14,408 --> 00:20:16,009
- Hello?
- Hello?

389
00:20:27,087 --> 00:20:30,557
I thought about it,
but I would like to keep working.

390
00:20:30,557 --> 00:20:32,125
I'm calling off the blind date.

391
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:35,629
I can't even.

392
00:20:37,631 --> 00:20:38,465
We got it.

393
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:40,934
This is today's payment.

394
00:20:47,608 --> 00:20:48,876
I'll take a shower first.

395
00:20:48,876 --> 00:20:50,777
You're eating
black bean paste noodles, right?

396
00:20:50,777 --> 00:20:52,212
Yes, make mine a double portion.

397
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:57,184
Yes, ma'am.

398
00:20:57,584 --> 00:21:00,521
Please order two bowls of
black bean paste noodles for us.

399
00:21:00,521 --> 00:21:02,055
Make one a double portion.

400
00:21:02,055 --> 00:21:03,957
Do we get fried dumplings for free?

401
00:21:03,957 --> 00:21:07,294
Okay. Please make it quick.

402
00:21:11,365 --> 00:21:13,433
One, two, three, four, five,

403
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:15,269
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

404
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:16,770
Young Sik, there's no water.

405
00:21:17,337 --> 00:21:19,039
What? I can't hear you.

406
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,641
There's no water.

407
00:21:21,108 --> 00:21:23,310
Darn it. I'm counting bills.

408
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,245
I lost count.

409
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:26,880
Hold on.

410
00:21:27,381 --> 00:21:28,682
Hurry.

411
00:21:28,682 --> 00:21:31,552
Why? What is it?

412
00:21:31,552 --> 00:21:33,687
What's this?

413
00:21:34,521 --> 00:21:36,523
What's going on?

414
00:21:36,523 --> 00:21:37,791
There's no water.

415
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:40,961
You look like you have whipped cream
all over your body.

416
00:21:42,396 --> 00:21:43,730
Wait a minute.

417
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:50,938
There's no water.

418
00:21:50,938 --> 00:21:53,974
Take these and sort it out.

419
00:21:55,142 --> 00:21:56,877
It's too slippery.

420
00:21:56,877 --> 00:21:57,778
Goodness.

421
00:21:58,612 --> 00:22:00,747
Good luck.

422
00:22:00,747 --> 00:22:01,782
Okay.

423
00:22:01,782 --> 00:22:04,218
What's this?

424
00:22:04,952 --> 00:22:07,788
I can't even. Look at you.

425
00:22:08,455 --> 00:22:10,424
- It's too slippery.
- Poor you.

426
00:22:15,963 --> 00:22:16,897
This is good.

427
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:21,969
This is so good.

428
00:22:21,969 --> 00:22:23,370
- Young Sik.
- Yes?

429
00:22:24,304 --> 00:22:25,472
Eat some more.

430
00:22:26,573 --> 00:22:28,542
You should eat more.

431
00:23:15,255 --> 00:23:17,090
- Yes?
- I knew it.

432
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,392
Canada.

433
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:22,863
I heard that country is a paradise
for dogs.

434
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:24,731
PD Kang.

435
00:23:25,899 --> 00:23:26,667
I'm emigrating.

436
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:27,534
(Canada emigration consultant)

437
00:23:27,534 --> 00:23:29,069
Emigration.

438
00:23:30,571 --> 00:23:32,239
Yes, Korea is nice.

439
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:35,576
But there's too much fine dust.

440
00:23:35,576 --> 00:23:39,313
I'll write the drama script
that I've always wanted to.

441
00:23:39,746 --> 00:23:43,684
Yes. I'll quit my work here and go.

442
00:23:43,684 --> 00:23:45,719
I'll tell my colleagues.

443
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:47,354
(Scriptwriter Wang)

444
00:23:48,686 --> 00:23:50,791
Why is your phone on, Mark?

445
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:52,226
Scriptwriter Wang told me
to leave the phone on...

446
00:23:52,226 --> 00:23:54,094
and not say anything when she calls.

447
00:23:54,094 --> 00:23:56,029
I see.

448
00:23:56,029 --> 00:23:59,466
Yes. I'll call you
when I have the documents.

449
00:23:59,466 --> 00:24:01,034
Thank you.

450
00:24:02,236 --> 00:24:03,237
Are you emigrating?

451
00:24:04,338 --> 00:24:05,239
Yes.

452
00:24:05,239 --> 00:24:06,540
I'm jealous.

453
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,542
I've always wanted to go to Canada, too.

454
00:24:08,842 --> 00:24:11,545
- I can visit you there, right?
- What?

455
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:13,213
I'm so jealous.

456
00:24:14,281 --> 00:24:17,417
I'm jealous you're going to Canada.

457
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:23,023
What?
Does he have no feelings for me at all?

458
00:24:23,557 --> 00:24:25,292
He's not jealous or sad?

459
00:24:34,768 --> 00:24:37,771
(Editing room)

460
00:24:45,379 --> 00:24:47,648
Scriptwriter Wang,
meet me in the camper van.

461
00:24:57,925 --> 00:24:58,826
You're here.

462
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:07,968
Why did you call me?

463
00:25:08,202 --> 00:25:10,337
I wanted to throw a farewell party.

464
00:25:14,975 --> 00:25:15,976
What?

465
00:25:16,276 --> 00:25:18,045
You said you were emigrating.

466
00:25:18,378 --> 00:25:21,982
I thought it'd be better to do it
in this place with our memories together.

467
00:25:27,955 --> 00:25:29,890
PD Tae Ho.

468
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:32,893
You're so mean.

469
00:25:35,095 --> 00:25:36,396
I'm sorry, Scriptwriter Wang.

470
00:25:37,498 --> 00:25:39,333
What's this? Let go.

471
00:25:42,269 --> 00:25:44,671
Are you crying, Scriptwriter Wang?

472
00:25:46,139 --> 00:25:48,175
I'm not crying.

473
00:25:48,175 --> 00:25:49,710
Something got in my eye.

474
00:25:57,918 --> 00:26:00,587
You're dishonest, clumsy,

475
00:26:00,587 --> 00:26:02,856
easily worked up, and a crybaby.

476
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,758
You even like another guy.

477
00:26:07,327 --> 00:26:08,495
Another guy?

478
00:26:10,531 --> 00:26:11,698
Actor Ji.

479
00:26:12,866 --> 00:26:14,034
Everything is a mess.

480
00:26:18,338 --> 00:26:19,273
But...

481
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:22,075
strangely, I keep caring about you.

482
00:26:23,844 --> 00:26:25,212
You look pretty at times.

483
00:26:27,347 --> 00:26:29,049
Then it's over, right?

484
00:26:31,185 --> 00:26:32,085
What?

485
00:26:33,754 --> 00:26:35,722
This is why I called you.

486
00:26:39,927 --> 00:26:41,328
I lost, Scriptwriter Wang.

487
00:26:42,963 --> 00:26:44,097
Don't go on a blind date.

488
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:47,134
Don't emigrate.

489
00:26:49,469 --> 00:26:51,071
Let's just start today.

490
00:26:52,372 --> 00:26:53,373
Our relationship.

491
00:26:55,676 --> 00:26:57,044
Our relationship?

492
00:27:00,447 --> 00:27:04,084
Do you mean become Friends At Night again?

493
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:05,319
No.

494
00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:08,088
Quit being Friends At Night.

495
00:27:11,758 --> 00:27:12,960
Let's date.

496
00:27:14,928 --> 00:27:15,929
It's an office romance.

497
00:27:19,066 --> 00:27:19,933
What?

498
00:27:43,357 --> 00:27:44,825
I'm so sleepy. I'm so tired.

499
00:27:44,825 --> 00:27:47,694
- You did great today.
- You, too.

500
00:27:47,694 --> 00:27:51,365
We can pay our employees now, right?

501
00:27:52,132 --> 00:27:53,267
Yes, we can.

502
00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:56,003
Young Sik, you went through trouble.

503
00:27:56,003 --> 00:27:58,939
- You should take a rest.
- I'll get some sleep now.

504
00:27:58,939 --> 00:28:01,241
It's cold now.

505
00:28:03,911 --> 00:28:04,845
This feels good.

506
00:28:05,546 --> 00:28:06,880
I'll put my jacket over you.

507
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,348
Thanks, Young Sik.

508
00:28:08,348 --> 00:28:09,950
Let me organize everything first.

509
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:10,951
You should just go to bed.

510
00:28:10,951 --> 00:28:12,986
I have to check this before I do.

511
00:28:22,496 --> 00:28:25,098
One, two, three,

512
00:28:25,098 --> 00:28:27,334
- five, seven...
- You skipped four.

513
00:28:27,334 --> 00:28:28,802
Good morning.

514
00:28:29,136 --> 00:28:30,137
What?

515
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:50,289
Attorney Ma.

516
00:28:51,557 --> 00:28:54,026
- CEO Don Man Hui.
- Good morning.

517
00:28:54,026 --> 00:28:55,728
- Good morning.
- Yes.

518
00:28:55,728 --> 00:28:57,596
It seems you were counting money.

519
00:28:57,596 --> 00:29:01,066
But what brought you here
at this hour without notice?

520
00:29:01,066 --> 00:29:03,669
I'm an impatient man.

521
00:29:04,103 --> 00:29:06,071
I thought it was about time now.

522
00:29:06,071 --> 00:29:09,308
So I checked the financial statements
of KICKKICKKICKKICK.

523
00:29:10,576 --> 00:29:13,279
But it was a total mess.

524
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:16,916
A total mess.

525
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,757
CEO Don, our state
isn't completely a total mess.

526
00:29:24,757 --> 00:29:26,859
And we still have a lot of time left...

527
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:28,093
until the end of the promised six months
of making a profit.

528
00:29:28,093 --> 00:29:31,864
There's nobody in this country
to exceed my sense of the flow of money.

529
00:29:31,864 --> 00:29:34,233
- That is true.
- Jin Hee.

530
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:37,069
Currently, the first investment
on KICKKICKKICKKICK...

531
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:38,971
has completely run out.

532
00:29:38,971 --> 00:29:41,106
I can guarantee...

533
00:29:41,106 --> 00:29:43,275
that if you two do not get
the second investment from me,

534
00:29:43,275 --> 00:29:45,444
KICKKICKKICKKICK cannot make a profit...

535
00:29:45,444 --> 00:29:47,546
in six months.

536
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,049
I get it.

537
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:53,119
You're saying you intend
to invest again on...

538
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:55,454
- But there's one condition.
- Condition?

539
00:29:55,454 --> 00:29:57,690
I will increase my share
as much as my investment.

540
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,291
But that's...

541
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:01,393
And for the time being,
I will put Attorney Ma here...

542
00:30:01,393 --> 00:30:03,963
as the CFO of KICKKICKKICKKICK.

543
00:30:03,963 --> 00:30:05,498
- The CFO?
- And if necessary,

544
00:30:05,498 --> 00:30:09,201
I will use my authority of human resources
and go through with restructuring.

545
00:30:09,201 --> 00:30:13,772
I saw there were
some useless employees here.

546
00:30:14,406 --> 00:30:15,574
But...

547
00:30:16,342 --> 00:30:18,677
CEO Don, did you say "useless employees?"

548
00:30:18,677 --> 00:30:20,146
You're going too far with your words.

549
00:30:20,146 --> 00:30:22,815
Yes. We can get a second investment
from elsewhere.

550
00:30:22,815 --> 00:30:24,583
That's another way, CEO Don.

551
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:28,354
The film market has completely collapsed.

552
00:30:28,354 --> 00:30:31,957
The production cost of dramas
and variety shows is decreasing.

553
00:30:31,957 --> 00:30:35,628
Apart from me, Don Man Hui,

554
00:30:35,628 --> 00:30:37,730
who has already invested a lot
on KICKKICKKICKKICK,

555
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,366
do you really think
you'll be able to find another investor?

556
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:46,939
If we search everywhere...

557
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,975
I don't think it'll be easy.

558
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:52,144
Even if we search everywhere?

559
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:55,214
Think about it.

560
00:30:55,214 --> 00:30:56,982
Just like you two,

561
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:59,985
I also hope for the success
of KICKKICKKICKKICK.

562
00:31:01,754 --> 00:31:02,621
End of story.

563
00:31:04,857 --> 00:31:07,126
Take care. Thank you.

564
00:31:07,126 --> 00:31:08,561
For what?

565
00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:10,429
Then are we getting an attorney
in the company?

566
00:31:10,429 --> 00:31:12,765
- Wait a minute.
- What's going on?

567
00:31:12,765 --> 00:31:14,733
What kind of nonsense is this?
Wait a minute.

568
00:31:14,733 --> 00:31:18,304
CEO Cho, that's the contract, right?

569
00:31:18,304 --> 00:31:22,308
How dare he try
to take over KICKKICKKICKKICK!

570
00:31:22,308 --> 00:31:24,410
- Here.
- Here it is.

571
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,445
Ji Jin Hee 30 percent,
Cho Young Sik 30 percent.

572
00:31:26,445 --> 00:31:28,581
- Yes.
- And the investor has 40 percent.

573
00:31:28,581 --> 00:31:30,549
Exactly. So we both have...

574
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:32,017
- 60 percent in total.
- That's right.

575
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:34,353
If we add our shares,
it's over 50 percent.

576
00:31:34,353 --> 00:31:36,922
So even if he's the investor,
he cannot have things his own way...

577
00:31:36,922 --> 00:31:39,191
with KICKKICKKICKKICK until the deadline.

578
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:40,426
Who does he think he is?

579
00:31:40,426 --> 00:31:43,162
- Don't hold me back.
- Don't be like that.

580
00:31:43,162 --> 00:31:44,763
- Darn it.
- Hold on.

581
00:31:44,763 --> 00:31:46,966
He should know I've become patient.

582
00:31:46,966 --> 00:31:49,268
But just to make sure,
I'll call Attorney Cheon.

583
00:31:49,268 --> 00:31:50,669
Call him. Calm down.

584
00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:52,404
- Seriously.
- You're too worked up.

585
00:31:52,404 --> 00:31:54,306
He suddenly made me furious.

586
00:31:55,975 --> 00:31:59,578
(Hanbang Building)

587
00:32:11,557 --> 00:32:14,627
- Why?
- What's wrong, Scriptwriter Wang?

588
00:32:14,627 --> 00:32:16,796
There's a bug.

589
00:32:16,796 --> 00:32:17,763
Goodness.

590
00:32:18,464 --> 00:32:19,632
A bug.

591
00:32:20,733 --> 00:32:22,935
I killed it just now.

592
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:26,672
- Don't come close to me.
- She's powerful.

593
00:32:26,672 --> 00:32:28,274
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

594
00:32:28,274 --> 00:32:29,642
Don't do that.

595
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,546
She catches bugs so easily.

596
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,183
I'm sorry. That was completely unexpected.

597
00:32:38,551 --> 00:32:40,586
Is it okay if I warn you first, then?

598
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:41,921
What?

599
00:32:47,893 --> 00:32:49,662
Did you do it?

600
00:32:49,662 --> 00:32:50,596
Do what?

601
00:32:51,397 --> 00:32:52,498
Do what?

602
00:32:53,165 --> 00:32:54,233
The recording?

603
00:32:56,569 --> 00:32:59,405
I have to tell you something
before we start the meeting.

604
00:32:59,405 --> 00:33:01,574
To reach three million subscribers,

605
00:33:01,574 --> 00:33:04,743
we only have about 40,000 left.

606
00:33:04,743 --> 00:33:07,046
Unbelievable.

607
00:33:07,046 --> 00:33:10,249
The blind date I planned myself...

608
00:33:10,249 --> 00:33:13,119
for CEOs Ji and Cho played a big role.

609
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:14,386
Did it really?

610
00:33:14,386 --> 00:33:16,989
That being said,

611
00:33:16,989 --> 00:33:19,792
for today's 15 Minute Class,
I'd like to try a more provocative...

612
00:33:19,792 --> 00:33:22,194
Who are you?
Solicitors are not allowed here.

613
00:33:22,194 --> 00:33:23,929
Calm down.

614
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:26,799
He is the investor of KICKKICKKICKKICK,

615
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,034
CEO Don Man Hui of One Punch Capital.

616
00:33:29,034 --> 00:33:32,037
<i>No matter what they say,
Man Hui is the man</i>

617
00:33:32,037 --> 00:33:32,838
Skrr.

618
00:33:32,838 --> 00:33:35,107
Is your name Don Man Hui
because you're loaded like a don?

619
00:33:35,574 --> 00:33:37,643
Good afternoon, CEO Don Man Hui.

620
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:39,278
What brings you here at this time?

621
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:42,081
It seems you haven't heard
from CEOs Ji and Cho.

622
00:33:42,081 --> 00:33:45,417
KICKKICKKICKKICK is currently messed up.

623
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:49,488
So Attorney Ma and I will put the company
under special management for now.

624
00:33:49,488 --> 00:33:50,689
What? You're wrong.

625
00:33:50,689 --> 00:33:52,925
We'll soon reach
three million subscribers.

626
00:33:52,925 --> 00:33:54,326
This means we're booming.

627
00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:57,096
But you have no money.

628
00:33:57,096 --> 00:33:59,765
- What?
- Do we have no money?

629
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,201
In the current financial state,

630
00:34:02,201 --> 00:34:04,270
without my help,

631
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,272
you cannot make a profit
until the promised date.

632
00:34:06,272 --> 00:34:09,742
So we should strike while the iron is hot.

633
00:34:09,742 --> 00:34:14,613
From now on,
the restructuring in KICKKICKKICKKICK...

634
00:34:14,613 --> 00:34:16,582
will proceed.

635
00:34:19,218 --> 00:34:23,122
(Episode 10-2
Crisis in KICKKICKKICKKICK)

636
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:26,692
Thank you for coming
all the way to my office.

637
00:34:26,692 --> 00:34:27,860
Don't mention it.

638
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,862
I had too many trials today.

639
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:31,330
You must be really busy.

640
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:34,366
We're not, so we came. But...

641
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:35,301
hold on.

642
00:34:35,301 --> 00:34:37,636
Attorney Cheon, I'm sorry,
but can you please charge my phone?

643
00:34:37,636 --> 00:34:39,772
I didn't go home yesterday and today,
so my phone is dead.

644
00:34:39,772 --> 00:34:42,174
- Can you charge mine, too?
- Sure. Give them to me.

645
00:34:42,174 --> 00:34:42,975
Thank you.

646
00:34:43,576 --> 00:34:44,710
- I need a C-type charger.
- Okay.

647
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,711
Thank you.

648
00:34:52,151 --> 00:34:54,653
This is our investment contract.

649
00:34:54,653 --> 00:34:55,554
Okay.

650
00:34:56,055 --> 00:34:58,057
- Please carefully read through it.
- Okay.

651
00:34:59,492 --> 00:35:00,526
I hope everything's fine.

652
00:35:02,895 --> 00:35:04,497
- Scriptwriter Ga.
- Yes?

653
00:35:04,763 --> 00:35:06,832
You're no longer with us.

654
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:08,701
Why not?

655
00:35:09,502 --> 00:35:11,237
I'm good at work.

656
00:35:12,004 --> 00:35:15,908
We decided to only keep
Jasmine's 15 Minute Class.

657
00:35:15,908 --> 00:35:18,110
Without you, Baek Ji Won.

658
00:35:19,278 --> 00:35:20,679
- No In Seong.
- Yes?

659
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:21,881
You're fired.

660
00:35:23,048 --> 00:35:25,851
What? But I'm No In Seong.

661
00:35:26,685 --> 00:35:28,587
(Scriptwriter Wang Jo Yeon)

662
00:35:28,587 --> 00:35:30,055
(PD Kang Tae Ho)

663
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:34,393
It's okay. Everything's going to be fine.

664
00:35:34,393 --> 00:35:36,629
Why isn't he picking up?

665
00:35:36,629 --> 00:35:38,297
Pick up.

666
00:35:38,297 --> 00:35:39,632
Can you reach CEO Ji?

667
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:42,835
CEO Ji won't pick up.

668
00:35:42,835 --> 00:35:44,570
CEO Cho, either.

669
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:47,339
Our CEOs are not picking up on purpose.

670
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:50,476
They abandoned us.

671
00:35:51,076 --> 00:35:52,244
Everything will be fine.

672
00:35:54,713 --> 00:35:55,614
Okay!

673
00:35:56,348 --> 00:35:59,885
If they don't need me,
I don't need them, either.

674
00:36:00,753 --> 00:36:03,556
- In Seong.
- Don't stop me. I'm leaving.

675
00:36:05,691 --> 00:36:06,659
Nobody's stopping you.

676
00:36:09,795 --> 00:36:11,063
I'm leaving.

677
00:36:12,164 --> 00:36:13,165
In Seong!

678
00:36:28,547 --> 00:36:29,682
It's cold outside.

679
00:36:30,716 --> 00:36:32,284
- Is it?
- Yes.

680
00:36:32,284 --> 00:36:33,786
Darn it.

681
00:36:33,786 --> 00:36:34,887
In Seong.

682
00:36:36,422 --> 00:36:38,390
Is everyone letting him leave like that?

683
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,859
Call the CEOs again.

684
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:40,860
I, too,

685
00:36:44,029 --> 00:36:49,535
must think again
about this disagreeable issue.

686
00:36:50,569 --> 00:36:52,438
But...

687
00:36:52,438 --> 00:36:54,874
Jasmine.

688
00:36:54,874 --> 00:36:55,808
Darn it.

689
00:36:55,808 --> 00:36:57,276
This is driving me crazy.

690
00:36:57,276 --> 00:36:58,911
What are they doing?

691
00:36:58,911 --> 00:37:00,646
- Are they still not picking up?
- No.

692
00:37:07,987 --> 00:37:10,823
Probably because
this is a production company,

693
00:37:10,823 --> 00:37:13,793
the interior design is so hip,
and I really love the setting.

694
00:37:13,793 --> 00:37:15,895
Attorney Ma,
I want to make this company mine.

695
00:37:15,895 --> 00:37:16,896
Is that possible?

696
00:37:16,896 --> 00:37:17,830
Of course.

697
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:21,100
In the current situation,

698
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,769
you cannot ignore the investor's words.

699
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:26,172
The investor
holds 40 percent of the shares,

700
00:37:26,172 --> 00:37:29,008
and if you check the end of the contract,
there's a special clause.

701
00:37:29,008 --> 00:37:31,710
When the company faces
financial difficulties,

702
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,647
the investor can exercise his influence
to the company management.

703
00:37:35,314 --> 00:37:38,284
We've been completely tricked.

704
00:37:40,286 --> 00:37:41,720
I'm here to apply for a part-time job.

705
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,857
What's this tiny "someday" written here?

706
00:37:44,857 --> 00:37:48,060
You're right. It says "someday."

707
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,964
This shows my resolution
to get this certificate someday.

708
00:37:56,268 --> 00:37:58,003
Are you here...

709
00:37:58,003 --> 00:38:00,706
to tell me what you think
about my previous offer?

710
00:38:00,706 --> 00:38:02,441
May I present one condition?

711
00:38:04,543 --> 00:38:08,013
I would like to work
with this scriptwriter, no matter what.

712
00:38:08,948 --> 00:38:12,184
(Ga Joo Ha)

713
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:17,389
What if CEO Don Man Hui
really carries out restructuring?

714
00:38:17,389 --> 00:38:19,725
You know what to do. They're our people,
so we must protect them.

715
00:38:19,725 --> 00:38:20,693
We must.

716
00:38:20,693 --> 00:38:22,962
But that weird No In Seong...

717
00:38:22,962 --> 00:38:25,464
But he worked with us from the beginning.

718
00:38:25,464 --> 00:38:27,867
I cannot let a single employee go.

719
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,136
Okay. Then there's only one way.

720
00:38:30,136 --> 00:38:33,506
Let's go.
Let's go to him and ask for more time.

721
00:38:33,506 --> 00:38:36,075
Okay. Like what Ga Joo Ha always says,

722
00:38:36,075 --> 00:38:37,009
- let's go.
- Let's go.

723
00:38:38,611 --> 00:38:41,013

Drink lots of water and grow fast.

725
00:38:58,731 --> 00:39:00,666
They really do grow fast.

726
00:39:03,135 --> 00:39:04,069
I know, right?

727
00:39:05,004 --> 00:39:05,971
Shiba.

728
00:39:06,438 --> 00:39:08,140
When I'm not here,

729
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,143
please water my Cilantree.

730
00:39:11,677 --> 00:39:12,878
Sure.

731
00:39:13,746 --> 00:39:14,947
But why won't you be here?

732
00:39:15,915 --> 00:39:17,016
What do you mean?

733
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,085
I got laid off, that's why.

734
00:39:22,488 --> 00:39:25,291
You didn't hear that
from CEO Ji and CEO Cho yet.

735
00:39:30,362 --> 00:39:32,064
Also, I can't stand
owing anybody anything.

736
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,234
Owing?

737
00:39:35,234 --> 00:39:36,635
Yes. Last time,

738
00:39:37,236 --> 00:39:39,572
you acted silly in front of my ex
and made her leave.

739
00:39:42,174 --> 00:39:43,309
In return,

740
00:39:45,978 --> 00:39:47,046
(Hot pot 100 dollar gift card)

741
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,315
I'll buy hot pot.

742
00:39:53,385 --> 00:39:55,621
The view from this glass wall...

743
00:39:56,755 --> 00:39:59,492
If only I hadn't gotten swindled...

744
00:40:01,861 --> 00:40:03,662
CEO Don won't pick up.

745
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:06,132
But he said there was nothing
on his schedule today.

746
00:40:06,899 --> 00:40:08,868
Then may we wait for him here?

747
00:40:08,868 --> 00:40:10,302
We have to tell him something.

748
00:40:10,302 --> 00:40:13,272
Then please wait for him on the sofa.

749
00:40:13,272 --> 00:40:14,140
Okay.

750
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,674
That must be the sofa.

751
00:40:15,674 --> 00:40:17,109
- That way, right?
- No, this way.

752
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,311
Excuse me?

753
00:40:20,246 --> 00:40:22,615
- That's too small.
- Let's go.

754
00:40:22,615 --> 00:40:24,517
- But I'm Ji Jin Hee.
- I know you are.

755
00:40:24,517 --> 00:40:26,218
- We're sorry.
- Darn it.

756
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:30,189
Add the vegetables to each side,

757
00:40:30,189 --> 00:40:32,424
and it tastes super good.

758
00:40:39,365 --> 00:40:41,667
Fine. I'll add all of this.

759
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:42,501
What?

760
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,405
- Really?
- I added everything.

761
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:50,276
But you're a cilantro hater, Shiba.
Are you sure about this?

762
00:40:50,743 --> 00:40:54,413
I'll give it a try today.

763
00:40:54,413 --> 00:40:55,915
I think I can manage.

764
00:40:55,915 --> 00:40:57,583
Let's try cilantro!

765
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:00,152
But it'll be too strong.

766
00:41:00,152 --> 00:41:03,456
Did you forget
I'm a former member of the special...

767
00:41:03,456 --> 00:41:05,958
This will not shake me at all.

768
00:41:05,958 --> 00:41:06,859
Try it.

769
00:41:17,169 --> 00:41:18,270
How do you even eat this?

770
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,343
You furrowed your brows a lot.

771
00:41:29,548 --> 00:41:30,883
Thank you, Shiba.

772
00:41:31,684 --> 00:41:32,918
Thanks to you, I'm laughing.

773
00:41:33,686 --> 00:41:35,721
I'll eat the rest of the cilantro.

774
00:41:35,721 --> 00:41:37,022
Cilantro smells so good.

775
00:41:39,892 --> 00:41:42,795
Aren't they giving us a squid
for free today?

776
00:41:42,795 --> 00:41:45,898
I want the ink to splatter
all of your face...

777
00:41:45,898 --> 00:41:47,633
so we get a free tanghulu coupon.

778
00:41:48,234 --> 00:41:50,436
Then your golden tooth will fall out
while eating tanghulu,

779
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,472
and we'll get to take pictures
in a photo studio for free.

780
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,478
I'm representative No In Seong.

781
00:41:59,478 --> 00:42:02,281
Yes, sir.
You have a problem with the refund?

782
00:42:02,281 --> 00:42:04,817
Then I'll connect you
to the person in charge,

783
00:42:04,817 --> 00:42:06,085
so please wait and...

784
00:42:06,085 --> 00:42:07,453
Why do you keep asking me to wait?

785
00:42:07,453 --> 00:42:09,321
I've called you so many times,

786
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:10,689
and you always tell me the same thing.

787
00:42:10,689 --> 00:42:13,859
Yes, sir. But it's my first time
getting your call today, sir.

788
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:15,161
Why do you keep saying "Yes?"

789
00:42:15,161 --> 00:42:17,963
Yes, sir. When I called
the customer service center,

790
00:42:17,963 --> 00:42:20,065
they always answered with "Yes" first.

791
00:42:20,065 --> 00:42:22,735
Hey, are you playing jokes with me?

792
00:42:22,735 --> 00:42:24,970
Yes, sir. I haven't even started my joke.

793
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:27,273
What are you even saying?

794
00:42:27,273 --> 00:42:29,475
Young people these days have
no character at all.

795
00:42:29,475 --> 00:42:31,977
Yes, sir. My name is No In Seong.

796
00:42:31,977 --> 00:42:33,512
What?

797
00:42:33,512 --> 00:42:35,614
You little...

798
00:42:35,614 --> 00:42:37,616
Yes, sir. Right back at you, sir.

799
00:42:37,616 --> 00:42:40,386
You...

800
00:42:44,056 --> 00:42:45,357
Hello?

801
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:46,692
- No In Seong.
- Yes?

802
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,961
What was that?

803
00:42:48,961 --> 00:42:52,965
I was educating a power tripper
who's not easily seen these days.

804
00:42:52,965 --> 00:42:54,033
You're fired.

805
00:42:54,033 --> 00:42:54,967
What?

806
00:42:54,967 --> 00:42:56,001
I said you're fired.

807
00:42:56,001 --> 00:42:57,169
Get out of here.

808
00:42:58,771 --> 00:43:00,473
I'm sorry.

809
00:43:00,473 --> 00:43:03,776
A mentally ill person recently entered
our customer service center.

810
00:43:04,543 --> 00:43:05,444
Yes.

811
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:08,280
Shiba.

812
00:43:11,117 --> 00:43:13,452
Do I look better in this or...

813
00:43:16,489 --> 00:43:18,724
Croak. Or this one?

814
00:43:18,724 --> 00:43:19,558
This one.

815
00:43:19,558 --> 00:43:20,826
- Do I look better in this?
- Yes.

816
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,664
Do I look okay?

817
00:43:25,664 --> 00:43:26,565
Yes.

818
00:43:33,272 --> 00:43:35,641
Shiba, are you ready?
I'll press the button.

819
00:43:35,641 --> 00:43:36,675
Wait a minute.

820
00:43:39,078 --> 00:43:41,380
When are you going
to stop calling me Shiba?

821
00:43:44,517 --> 00:43:46,619
I call you Shiba because you're Shiba.
What should I call you, then?

822
00:43:47,286 --> 00:43:50,122
Shiba doesn't sound smooth.

823
00:43:50,122 --> 00:43:51,257
There are other names.

824
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,895
Mr. Min Jae?

825
00:43:56,796 --> 00:43:58,931
That's too formal.

826
00:43:58,931 --> 00:44:01,200
Producer Min Jae?

827
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,067
Yes.

828
00:44:02,067 --> 00:44:03,969
But that makes it hard for me
to drop honorifics.

829
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,641
Min Jae?

830
00:44:13,779 --> 00:44:14,713
What?

831
00:44:16,715 --> 00:44:17,783
Min Jae?

832
00:44:19,151 --> 00:44:20,019
No.

833
00:44:20,019 --> 00:44:21,921
This.

834
00:44:21,921 --> 00:44:24,824
This must be a new item.

835
00:44:24,824 --> 00:44:26,525
I should wear this.

836
00:44:27,393 --> 00:44:28,994
Do I look okay?

837
00:44:28,994 --> 00:44:30,763
Yes, you look fine, Min Jae.

838
00:44:32,364 --> 00:44:36,235
Look at that. I'm good at this now.

839
00:44:36,235 --> 00:44:38,637
- Are you?
- So just follow me.

840
00:44:38,637 --> 00:44:39,705
Min Jae, you take the lead, then.

841
00:44:39,972 --> 00:44:41,640
(The camera will start rolling.
Please prepare.)

842
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,608
Pose first.

843
00:44:42,608 --> 00:44:43,576
Okay.

844
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:48,914
(KICKKICK Studio)

845
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:11,737
My savior, Actor Ji.

846
00:45:12,738 --> 00:45:14,406
You were here.

847
00:45:49,642 --> 00:45:52,444
I stretched after a long time,

848
00:45:52,444 --> 00:45:54,113
so I feel way better.

849
00:45:56,515 --> 00:45:57,817
Me, too.

850
00:45:59,718 --> 00:46:03,022
I feel better.

851
00:46:09,895 --> 00:46:11,897
It's cold.

852
00:46:35,788 --> 00:46:38,290
In Seong, you're so cool.

853
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:40,292
Don't hurt yourself. Be careful.

854
00:46:40,292 --> 00:46:42,595
In Seong, don't hurt yourself.

855
00:46:42,595 --> 00:46:44,930
- You can do it.
- You can do it.

856
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:46,365
In Seong, our treasure.

857
00:46:46,365 --> 00:46:48,534
We need you, In Seong.

858
00:46:48,534 --> 00:46:50,035
We all root for In Seong.

859
00:46:50,035 --> 00:46:51,437
We do.

00:46:51,437 --> 00:46:56,675
- In Seong.
- No In Seong.

870
00:48:08,614 --> 00:48:11,450
Joo Ha, wait.

871
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:14,286
- You have poor athletic sense.
- Poor?

872
00:48:14,286 --> 00:48:16,489
I told you I'm a former member
of the special forces.

873
00:48:20,459 --> 00:48:21,894
Joo Ha, are you okay?

874
00:48:21,894 --> 00:48:23,195
Hey.

00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:34,607
Min Jae.

876
00:48:36,775 --> 00:48:40,446
I like KICKKICKKICKKICK so much.

877
00:48:43,716 --> 00:48:46,118
I don't want to leave like this.

878
00:48:59,298 --> 00:49:00,766
I do, too.

879
00:49:03,169 --> 00:49:04,436
I really like KICKKICKKICKKICK.

880
00:49:05,604 --> 00:49:06,605
My team.

881
00:49:09,408 --> 00:49:11,811
I don't want to be abandoned like this.

882
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:16,415
Like the growing cilantro,

883
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:22,087
I want to grow with KICKKICKKICKKICK.

884
00:49:23,956 --> 00:49:26,592
That's what I want.

885
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:34,200
I don't want to leave.

886
00:49:50,449 --> 00:49:51,484
Let's do that.

887
00:49:55,521 --> 00:49:56,922
Let's grow together.

00:50:01,327 --> 00:50:02,261
We...

889
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:06,098
can do it.

890
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,468
Smile.

891
00:50:11,437 --> 00:50:12,438
What's that?

892
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:15,875
Smile.

893
00:50:16,775 --> 00:50:18,644
Smile. Don't cry.

894
00:50:22,148 --> 00:50:23,449
This is nice.

895
00:50:23,449 --> 00:50:24,817
Joo Ha, why won't you...

896
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,121
- Why won't you pick up?
- Me?

897
00:50:31,791 --> 00:50:36,028
Sorry. I was jumping on the trampoline.

898
00:50:36,028 --> 00:50:37,730
I didn't know my phone was ringing. Sorry.

899
00:50:39,131 --> 00:50:41,000
Did you cry? Your eyes are red.

900
00:50:43,469 --> 00:50:45,404
No. Actually,

901
00:50:45,404 --> 00:50:48,274
I rubbed my eyes too hard
so they turned red.

902
00:50:48,274 --> 00:50:49,375
Are they that red?

903
00:50:49,975 --> 00:50:51,377
They're quite red.

904
00:50:52,144 --> 00:50:53,078
Actually,

905
00:50:57,216 --> 00:50:58,050

906
00:50:59,118 --> 00:50:59,952
Yes?

907
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:02,888
Let's move to another company.

908
00:51:03,255 --> 00:51:04,023
What?

909
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:06,492
I've already sorted things out.

910
00:51:06,492 --> 00:51:08,427
The conditions there are
way better than here.

911
00:51:08,427 --> 00:51:09,695
And to be honest,

912
00:51:10,229 --> 00:51:13,032
KICKKICKKICKKICK doesn't care
about your anymore, so we...

913
00:51:13,032 --> 00:51:13,866
Joo Ha said...

914
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,303
she wanted to grow with everyone else
in KICKKICKKICKKICK.

915
00:51:19,004 --> 00:51:19,872
What?

916
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,409
Mark, I'll explain.

917
00:51:23,409 --> 00:51:25,010
- Min Jae said he had a good idea and...
- What?

918
00:51:25,511 --> 00:51:27,513
Since when did you call him Min Jae?

919
00:51:28,547 --> 00:51:29,715
Well...

920
00:51:32,451 --> 00:51:34,820
Jasmine, you're still here.

921
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:35,921
Yes.

922
00:51:35,921 --> 00:51:37,690
To twist the internal organs...

923
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:40,025
of Don Man Hui who's trying
to eat up KICKKICKKICKKICK,

924
00:51:40,025 --> 00:51:42,962
I was making a magical oil.

925
00:51:42,962 --> 00:51:44,563
But it's not working well.

926
00:51:44,563 --> 00:51:45,998
I need more ingredients.

927
00:51:46,465 --> 00:51:48,200
- May I use this?
- Sure.

928
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,368
Okay. Thanks.

929
00:51:49,768 --> 00:51:51,303
Nice.

930
00:51:52,138 --> 00:51:54,206
No matter how much I think about it,

931
00:51:55,207 --> 00:51:58,110
I do not want to let Don Man Hui,
who is too transparent, get his way,

932
00:51:58,110 --> 00:51:59,879
take my content,

933
00:51:59,879 --> 00:52:03,516
and then have to just leave
this great company.

934
00:52:03,516 --> 00:52:05,251
I do not want that.

935
00:52:06,852 --> 00:52:08,621
- We don't, either.
- Yes.

936
00:52:08,621 --> 00:52:10,523
That's why I have to tell you something.

937
00:52:11,791 --> 00:52:14,393
But I should say this
when everyone's present.

938
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:16,862
Really? What is it?

939
00:52:24,003 --> 00:52:25,137
Darn it.

940
00:52:26,105 --> 00:52:27,373
- What was that?
- What was that?

941
00:52:27,373 --> 00:52:28,707
What? It's night already.

942
00:52:31,377 --> 00:52:33,078
What's going on?

943
00:52:33,813 --> 00:52:36,282
Don Man Hui isn't even here.

944
00:52:36,282 --> 00:52:38,350
Did everyone leave
not knowing we were still here?

945
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:39,718
Seriously?

946
00:52:39,718 --> 00:52:41,787
How could they not see us here?

947
00:52:42,488 --> 00:52:43,789
The door is locked.

948
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:45,691
What?

949
00:52:46,091 --> 00:52:48,194
My phone is gone. Jin Hee, call my number.

950
00:52:49,728 --> 00:52:50,729
Is it here?

951
00:52:50,729 --> 00:52:51,730
Did it slip?

952
00:52:55,701 --> 00:52:57,403
- Right.
- What?

953
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:01,740
We asked Attorney Cheon
to charge our phones.

954
00:53:03,943 --> 00:53:04,777
What should we do?

955
00:53:04,777 --> 00:53:06,612
Hold on. There's a phone here.

956
00:53:06,612 --> 00:53:08,447
Try calling our numbers.

957
00:53:10,616 --> 00:53:14,320
Darn it. I think it's locked.

958
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,723
That petty prick. He locked the phone.

959
00:53:17,723 --> 00:53:19,592
Then are we stuck here?

960
00:53:19,592 --> 00:53:20,693
Really?

961
00:53:21,427 --> 00:53:22,828
This is ridiculous.

962
00:53:24,697 --> 00:53:25,764
But...

963
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,669
Young Sik, we haven't eaten
anything today, have we?

964
00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:32,905
No. Don Man Hui barged into our company
early in the morning,

965
00:53:32,905 --> 00:53:34,373
so we couldn't eat anything.

966
00:53:35,774 --> 00:53:38,911
Darn it.
They only left the crusts of the pizza.

967
00:53:49,121 --> 00:53:50,923
Hey.

968
00:53:51,757 --> 00:53:53,392
What are you doing? Drop it.

969
00:53:54,226 --> 00:53:56,295
No matter how hungry you are,
this is wrong.

970
00:53:56,762 --> 00:53:59,932
What are you saying?
Did you think I was going to eat these?

971
00:53:59,932 --> 00:54:02,168
- Weren't you about to eat them?
- No way.

972
00:54:02,168 --> 00:54:05,171
I have profound knowledge of pizza.

973
00:54:05,171 --> 00:54:08,841
So I wanted to check what they used
to make the dough and the sauce.

974
00:54:08,841 --> 00:54:10,676
That's all I wanted to check.

975
00:54:10,676 --> 00:54:12,211
Let's just sleep some more.

976
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:14,146
If we sleep some more,
it'll be the morning.

977
00:54:14,146 --> 00:54:16,315
So people will come to work
and the door will open.

978
00:54:16,315 --> 00:54:18,951
How could you think of me as such a poor?

979
00:54:18,951 --> 00:54:19,852
This upsets me.

980
00:54:19,852 --> 00:54:21,787
No matter how hungry you are,
this is too much.

981
00:54:57,089 --> 00:54:58,157
What are you doing, Jin Hee?

982
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:02,194
What are you doing?

983
00:55:03,696 --> 00:55:05,264
You're Ji Jin Hee.

984
00:55:05,264 --> 00:55:06,832
You're an actor
with a ten-million-viewer movie.

985
00:55:07,566 --> 00:55:11,437
How could the Officer do
something like this?

986
00:55:11,437 --> 00:55:15,141
(Don Man Hui)

987
00:55:24,984 --> 00:55:26,652
PD Cho and Actor Ji.

988
00:55:28,554 --> 00:55:30,289
PD Cho and Actor Ji.

989
00:55:33,726 --> 00:55:34,960
Is CEO Don Man Hui here?

990
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,762
- I called him this morning.
- I see.

991
00:55:36,762 --> 00:55:39,932
He said he'll be working
in KICKKICKKICKKICK for a while.

992
00:55:39,932 --> 00:55:40,900
What?

993
00:55:43,702 --> 00:55:45,504
- But...
- Why?

994
00:55:48,307 --> 00:55:50,142
I'm exhausted.

995
00:55:50,676 --> 00:55:52,178
- CEOs Ji and Cho.
- CEOs Ji and Cho.

996
00:55:52,178 --> 00:55:53,779
- Goodness.
- What?

997
00:55:53,779 --> 00:55:56,048
Why haven't you been responding
to our calls?

998
00:55:56,048 --> 00:55:57,650
I'm sorry.

999
00:55:57,650 --> 00:55:59,685
Due to unavoidable circumstances,
our phones...

1000
00:55:59,685 --> 00:56:02,488
Yes. But why are you all here
early in the morning?

1001
00:56:02,488 --> 00:56:05,024
Investor Don Man Hui
carried out restructuring and fired...

1002
00:56:05,024 --> 00:56:09,528
Jasmine, No In Seong, and me.

1003
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:11,997
- What?
- What?

1004
00:56:11,997 --> 00:56:14,333
Don Man Hui, that prick,
eventually did what he wanted.

1005
00:56:14,333 --> 00:56:15,534
We can't let this pass.

1006
00:56:15,534 --> 00:56:16,435
CEOs Ji and Cho.

1007
00:56:17,136 --> 00:56:18,704
That's why I have to tell you something.

1008
00:56:18,704 --> 00:56:20,005
What is it?

1009
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:21,273
Tell us.

1010
00:56:21,974 --> 00:56:24,143
(KICKKICKKICKKICK Content Commerce Item
Project Proposal)

1011
00:56:24,143 --> 00:56:28,214
First, if KICKKICKKICKKICK yields revenue
and the company finances improve...

1012
00:56:28,214 --> 00:56:29,615
and we quickly make a profit,

1013
00:56:29,615 --> 00:56:31,650
we can ignore Don Man Hui's interference.

1014
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:33,018
- Yes.
- Yes.

1015
00:56:33,018 --> 00:56:35,654
So from now on, we will announce...

1016
00:56:35,654 --> 00:56:37,756
the KICKKICKKICKKICK content
and commerce project proposal.

1017
00:56:38,891 --> 00:56:40,392
Commerce?

1018
00:56:40,392 --> 00:56:43,162
We're going to graft products
into our content and sell items.

1019
00:56:43,162 --> 00:56:45,131
Sell items?

1020
00:56:45,131 --> 00:56:48,300
I've never even imagined
selling items in my name.

1021
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,970
You don't have to worry
about that, CEO Ji.

1022
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:53,906
Just because their favorite celebrity uses
a certain item...

1023
00:56:53,906 --> 00:56:55,941
or sells a certain item,

1024
00:56:55,941 --> 00:56:58,010
consumers these days
do not blindly buy them.

1025
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:00,412
Consumers these days are very wise.

1026
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,115
- Yes.
- Then I'm relieved.

1027
00:57:03,115 --> 00:57:06,519
For the KICKKICKKICKKICK commerce
to succeed,

1028
00:57:06,519 --> 00:57:09,922
we must approach customers with a story
that makes sense and persuade them.

1029
00:57:09,922 --> 00:57:10,756
Makes sense?

1030
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:22,368
And the celebrity and the subscribers,

1031
00:57:22,368 --> 00:57:24,103
in the process
of producing the item together,

1032
00:57:24,103 --> 00:57:27,106
they'll naturally get closer.

1033
00:57:27,106 --> 00:57:30,309
And create an item as truly one.

1034
00:57:30,309 --> 00:57:32,011
This is a win-win strategy.

1035
00:57:32,545 --> 00:57:35,848
We may be able to earn more
than we can imagine.

1036
00:57:36,816 --> 00:57:38,451
Even more than the investment?

1037
00:57:38,451 --> 00:57:40,419
Nothing is impossible.

1038
00:57:41,086 --> 00:57:41,921
Right.

1039
00:57:41,921 --> 00:57:44,457
Then we can say "Get lost" to Don Man Hui.

1040
00:57:45,891 --> 00:57:46,959
Great.

1041
00:57:46,959 --> 00:57:49,228
While we're at it, let's do it properly.

1042
00:57:49,228 --> 00:57:50,095
Yes.

1043
00:57:50,095 --> 00:57:51,363
- Properly.
- Great.

1044
00:57:51,363 --> 00:57:52,498
We can do it.

1045
00:57:52,498 --> 00:57:53,365
Ready.

1046
00:57:55,801 --> 00:57:58,771
KICKKICKKICKKICK, let's go!

1047
00:58:00,139 --> 00:58:01,707
Everyone.

1048
00:58:03,909 --> 00:58:05,911
- No In Seong, what happened?
- What's this?

1049
00:58:05,911 --> 00:58:08,547
I will devote my life to KICKKICKKICKKICK.

1050
00:58:08,547 --> 00:58:11,617
In Seong, what happened?
What's with your shirt?

1051
00:58:11,617 --> 00:58:13,052
What happened? Take a seat.

1052
00:58:13,052 --> 00:58:13,986
Sit down.

1053
00:58:13,986 --> 00:58:15,287
Someone give him some water.

1054
00:58:15,287 --> 00:58:17,923
Pour water on his face and wash it.

1055
00:58:17,923 --> 00:58:19,925
Drink some water.

1059
00:58:32,771 --> 00:58:34,573
Hello, CEO Don.

1060
00:58:35,875 --> 00:58:39,178
You're at work early.

1061
00:58:39,178 --> 00:58:42,448
I want to use this office for a while.

1063
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:45,551
Yes?

1064
00:58:45,551 --> 00:58:48,053
We do not need your second investment.

1065
00:58:48,053 --> 00:58:49,855
Also, until the promised date,

1066
00:58:49,855 --> 00:58:53,392
we'll return your investment
and ten percent more.

1067
00:58:53,959 --> 00:58:57,296
So get out of Kickickickick.

1068
00:58:58,063 --> 00:59:00,266
Don't be ridiculous.

1069
00:59:01,066 --> 00:59:02,868
Fine.

1070
00:59:03,335 --> 00:59:05,304
I'll give you one month.

1071
00:59:05,304 --> 00:59:09,208
But if you can't keep that promise
you made just now in one month,

1072
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:12,511
you'll get my second investment
and increase my share. Deal?

1073
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,246
No, not one month...

1074
00:59:14,246 --> 00:59:16,649
Okay. So...

1075
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:19,518
withdraw the restructuring...

1076
00:59:21,754 --> 00:59:25,391
and get out of my office.

1077
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,194

Now!

1081
00:59:39,305 --> 00:59:40,239
Now.

1084
01:00:26,252 --> 01:00:28,454
From now on, our only way
to survive is through commerce.

1085
01:00:28,454 --> 01:00:30,256
I'm Ji Jin Hee of "Let's Make It."

1086
01:00:30,256 --> 01:00:31,457
I'll upload it.

1087
01:00:31,457 --> 01:00:33,526
Should we try more aggressive marketing?

1088
01:00:33,526 --> 01:00:35,528
We have to pour everything
we have into it.

1089
01:00:35,528 --> 01:00:37,229
Why are you all here as a group?

1090
01:00:37,229 --> 01:00:38,764
KICKKICKKICKKICK, assemble.

1091
01:00:40,032 --> 01:00:40,766
Secret Santa.

1092
01:00:40,766 --> 01:00:42,802
You'll become someone's guardian angel.

1093
01:00:42,802 --> 01:00:44,336
Who are you, my Secret Santa?

1094
01:00:44,336 --> 01:00:46,438
I think CEO Ji knows that we're dating.

1095
01:00:46,438 --> 01:00:47,873
If we get caught,
I'm going to quit my job.

1096
01:00:47,873 --> 01:00:49,942
You did a good job
as Scriptwriter Wang's guardian angel.

1097
01:00:49,942 --> 01:00:51,010
Do you like me?

1098
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:52,178
Ga Joo Ha, that girl.

1099
01:00:52,178 --> 01:00:54,013
If you're my Secret Santa,
be honest with me.

1100
01:00:54,013 --> 01:00:55,881
What do my feelings have to do with yours?

1101
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:01,290
