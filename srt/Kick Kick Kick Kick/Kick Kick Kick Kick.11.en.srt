1
00:00:00,035 --> 00:00:01,236
(All characters, organizations,)

2
00:00:01,255 --> 00:00:02,623
(and events in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:02,642 --> 00:00:04,010
(Broadcasting guidelines were followed
during the shooting of animals.)

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,788
Everyone.

5
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:10,757
CEO Cho and I...

6
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:13,594
kicked out CEO Don Man Hui.

7
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:17,331
- A round of applause.
- You're the best.

8
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,300
Yes.

9
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:22,903
KICKKICKKICKKICK now...

10
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,572
stands in front of the Rubicon.

11
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:28,008
To be,

12
00:00:29,643 --> 00:00:30,577
or not to be.

13
00:00:30,777 --> 00:00:32,513
That is the question.

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,249
That's from "Hamlet."

15
00:00:35,249 --> 00:00:36,984
"Cross the Rubicon" is
what Julius Caesar said.

16
00:00:36,984 --> 00:00:39,319
"I came, I saw, I conquered." Okay?

17
00:00:39,686 --> 00:00:41,054
Don't talk about the Rubicon.

18
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:43,624
We're standing in front
of the Jordan River.

19
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:46,927
From now on, our only way
to survive is through commerce.

20
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:49,596
Yes. I, No In Seong, who will bury
my bones in KICKKICKKICKKICK...

21
00:00:49,596 --> 00:00:52,866
By tomorrow night, let's all come up...

22
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:55,802
with an innovative and creative idea...

23
00:00:55,802 --> 00:00:58,272
about an item for commerce.

24
00:00:58,272 --> 00:00:59,039
Okay.

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,775
- Okay?
- Okay.

26
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:03,911
- Okay.
- Okay.

27
00:01:03,911 --> 00:01:06,013
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

28
00:01:06,013 --> 00:01:08,515
On three, lift your hands.

29
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:09,883
One, two, three.

30
00:01:09,883 --> 00:01:11,952
Let's do this!

31
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:25,365
Joo Ha.

32
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,168
Are you thinking about the item
for commerce? Can I join you?

33
00:01:28,168 --> 00:01:30,404
Do you have any good ideas?

34
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,111
(Model Han Ye Jin's successful
commerce story...)

35
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:39,646
(completed through both failure
and sincerity...)

36
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:42,149
Darn it.

37
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,284
Coffee?

38
00:01:44,284 --> 00:01:46,253
No, coffee is too common.

39
00:01:46,253 --> 00:01:47,154
Hot tub?

40
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:49,289
No, not that. Trampoline?

41
00:01:51,158 --> 00:01:52,326
Commerce.

42
00:01:54,394 --> 00:01:56,430
I want to think
of something related to "TTC,"

43
00:01:57,764 --> 00:01:59,299
but...

44
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:01,735
this is as hard as knowing your feelings,
Scriptwriter Wang.

45
00:02:02,703 --> 00:02:05,172
What? I'm not hard to understand at all.

46
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:12,079
I will show the true worth of No In Seong.

47
00:02:13,447 --> 00:02:15,682
A product, and...

48
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,252
how to make this product...

49
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:22,322
into a good one...

50
00:02:26,193 --> 00:02:27,928
Grow, my herb.

51
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:30,731
Grow, my creativity.

52
00:02:31,732 --> 00:02:32,900
Grow up.

53
00:02:43,043 --> 00:02:45,479
- Commerce.
- Commerce.

54
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:47,381
What could we sell?

55
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:48,682
Good morning.

56
00:02:48,682 --> 00:02:50,651
- You're here, In Seong.
- Yes.

57
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:53,620
Did everyone think
about a nice item for commerce?

58
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,455
I couldn't come up with a good one.

59
00:02:55,455 --> 00:02:57,691
I couldn't think
of anything groundbreaking.

60
00:02:57,691 --> 00:03:02,029
Same. Even though
I always have good ideas...

61
00:03:02,029 --> 00:03:03,664
I've done some research.

62
00:03:03,664 --> 00:03:05,666
Do all of you know Han Ye Jin, the model?

63
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:06,767
- Yes.
- Yes.

64
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:09,169
On her YouTube channel,

65
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:11,505
Han Ye Jin sold anti-cellulite cream...

66
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:12,806
and it hit the jackpot.

67
00:03:12,806 --> 00:03:14,842
- Cellulite?
- Really?

68
00:03:14,842 --> 00:03:17,978
But Han Ye Jin is really slim.
Does she even have cellulite?

69
00:03:17,978 --> 00:03:20,447
Yes. That was the start of commerce.

70
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:23,217
"Even I, a model, have cellulite."

71
00:03:23,217 --> 00:03:24,284
I see.

72
00:03:24,284 --> 00:03:27,688
How about doing something like this?

73
00:03:27,688 --> 00:03:28,956
That's right.

74
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:34,127
Everyone, there's this saying.

75
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:38,632
As my dark shadow was shone,

76
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,336
the hidden embers of solution rose.

77
00:03:43,003 --> 00:03:44,872
With the courage to reveal my weakness,

78
00:03:44,872 --> 00:03:47,608
the walls holding me inside crumbled,

79
00:03:47,608 --> 00:03:51,578
and creative thoughts started to flow in.

80
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:54,147
- Weakness.
- Weakness.

81
00:03:54,147 --> 00:03:56,783
So, if I reveal my weakness,

82
00:03:58,252 --> 00:04:00,120
I'll get an idea. Is that right?

83
00:04:01,054 --> 00:04:03,624
She's saying that may be the start.

84
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,627
Let's think outside the box.

85
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:10,364
Okay, then.

86
00:04:10,998 --> 00:04:14,768
Tomorrow night, Jasmine's 15 Minute Class
will be held privately

87
00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:17,871
as the Candle Class.

88
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:22,376
During class, let's all face...

89
00:04:22,376 --> 00:04:26,046
our most honest inner self.

90
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:28,081
Okay?

91
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:29,816
Honest inner self.

92
00:04:32,686 --> 00:04:33,620
Weakness.

93
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:40,060
(Episode 11-1
Commerce that Rose From Weakness)

94
00:04:40,761 --> 00:04:44,932
We will start "Tails of Tales of Camping"
Winter Special,

95
00:04:44,932 --> 00:04:47,834
"Camping in Love."

96
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,937
(Episode 11)

97
00:04:50,304 --> 00:04:55,075
First, you will point your Love Pointer...

98
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:57,411
at the person you want
to spend time with today. Okay?

99
00:04:57,411 --> 00:04:58,178
Okay.

100
00:04:58,178 --> 00:04:59,446
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

101
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:01,348
Point on three.

102
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:04,885
One, two, three.

103
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,988
Really?

104
00:05:08,555 --> 00:05:10,290
I didn't expect this to happen.

105
00:05:10,557 --> 00:05:14,494
All the male campers pointed
at Female Camper One.

106
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:17,998
- Amazing.
- Female Camper One is popular.

107
00:05:21,702 --> 00:05:24,705
Do you also think Female Camper One
is the prettiest, PD Tae Ho?

108
00:05:24,938 --> 00:05:26,306
Yes, obviously.

109
00:05:29,276 --> 00:05:33,046
Men who answer that question like this
do not deserve to have a girlfriend.

110
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,016
Of course,

111
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,452
I think my girlfriend is the prettiest.

112
00:05:45,526 --> 00:05:48,929
We'll move on to the next stage
of the "TTC" Winter Special.

113
00:05:56,403 --> 00:05:57,337
What?

114
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:04,611
We need to develop a good product
for commerce,

115
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:06,847
for everyone to take...

116
00:06:08,015 --> 00:06:08,849
What?

117
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,420
What's that?

118
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:21,895
This...

119
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:27,134
Wait a minute.

120
00:06:34,575 --> 00:06:35,609
This...

121
00:06:39,446 --> 00:06:40,314
This...

122
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:52,292
Wait a minute.

123
00:06:53,994 --> 00:06:55,596
Weakness.

124
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:27,361
I can't show myself with eye boogers...

125
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:29,429
and smelly hair to the people here.

126
00:07:30,397 --> 00:07:31,999
But it's hard to find a place
to even wash my hands.

127
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,302
What was that?

128
00:07:35,802 --> 00:07:37,771
Why not? Nobody's around anyway.

129
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,241
No.

130
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:43,510
Have you fallen out of love already?

131
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:47,247
I haven't brushed my teeth yet
or washed my hair.

132
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:50,584
Who in the world would want
to show herself like this...

133
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:52,252
to her boyfriend she just started dating?

134
00:07:57,057 --> 00:07:58,392
They were dating?

135
00:07:59,426 --> 00:08:00,627
Unbelievable.

136
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:01,962
You must like me so much.

137
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:04,531
- Well...
- Good.

138
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:08,435
They kiss even when they have bad breath.

139
00:08:09,002 --> 00:08:10,938
They're on their happiest days.

140
00:08:17,077 --> 00:08:18,045
Are you okay?

141
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:19,580
Hair smell...

142
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:22,182
Actor Ji.

143
00:08:23,217 --> 00:08:24,451
What are you doing here?

144
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:27,588
You have to get ready to...

145
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:29,690
We're shooting again soon, so get ready.

146
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:32,459
I have to clean and...

147
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:35,128
- I didn't know you two were here.
- We're here.

148
00:08:35,128 --> 00:08:38,298
On my way here, I got a brilliant idea.

149
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:41,935
The name is TTC Universal Clean Spray.

150
00:08:47,274 --> 00:08:51,011
Jasmine's 15 Minute Class...

151
00:08:52,012 --> 00:08:56,750
will proceed secretly
with lit candles today.

152
00:08:57,851 --> 00:09:00,754
With these lit candles,

153
00:09:01,755 --> 00:09:05,425
let's stare into the swaying candlelight
and reveal our weaknesses.

154
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:10,898
I'll go first.

155
00:09:11,198 --> 00:09:12,232
I...

156
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:18,705
like adult romance novels.

157
00:09:19,273 --> 00:09:20,307
A lot.

158
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:24,845
If I don't read at least one page a day,

159
00:09:24,845 --> 00:09:26,647
I can't go to bed.

160
00:09:28,182 --> 00:09:29,416
You like it so much.

161
00:09:30,117 --> 00:09:31,118
I...

162
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:35,822
was a medical student.

163
00:09:36,657 --> 00:09:40,894
But now, I have vasovagal syncope,

164
00:09:42,896 --> 00:09:44,198
so I took time off from school.

165
00:09:45,365 --> 00:09:47,601
Vasovagal syncope?

166
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:49,469
Yes.

167
00:09:52,606 --> 00:09:54,508
I faint when I see blood.

168
00:09:57,511 --> 00:09:59,646
But I really love content.

169
00:10:01,582 --> 00:10:03,617
My parents do not understand this,

170
00:10:04,284 --> 00:10:05,319
so currently,

171
00:10:07,387 --> 00:10:09,056
I've cut myself off from them.

172
00:10:13,894 --> 00:10:14,828
That's all.

173
00:10:22,936 --> 00:10:24,404
- I...
- CEO Cho.

174
00:10:25,072 --> 00:10:28,141
Hair loss is no huge weakness.

175
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:31,345
Hair loss.

176
00:10:32,946 --> 00:10:34,081
You crazy bastard.

177
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:37,084
With PD Cho's hair that fell out,

178
00:10:37,551 --> 00:10:39,887
I made a black snowman keychain yesterday.

179
00:10:39,887 --> 00:10:40,921
Look. Isn't it cute?

180
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:42,322
You did a good job.

181
00:10:42,856 --> 00:10:44,124
This is a present for you.

182
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:47,261
Are you asking me to kill you,
you crazy bastard?

183
00:10:47,261 --> 00:10:49,463
I'll keep your disorder a secret.

184
00:10:50,497 --> 00:10:53,534
Everyone.

185
00:10:53,534 --> 00:10:55,202
I'm out of breath. Everyone.

186
00:10:55,202 --> 00:10:59,139
We came up with a great item for commerce.

187
00:11:00,407 --> 00:11:02,876
Camping is a thing these days, right?

188
00:11:02,876 --> 00:11:04,011
When you wake up the next morning,

189
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:06,079
you feel so uncomfortable
and dirty, right?

190
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,615
Your hair smells
and you smell of sweat, too.

191
00:11:08,615 --> 00:11:11,018
There's also that bad smell
after you answer the call of nature.

192
00:11:11,018 --> 00:11:12,352
That's why we came up with this.

193
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:16,557
A collaboration with "TTC,"
the Universal Clean Spray.

194
00:11:16,557 --> 00:11:18,325
- Spray.
- Spray.

195
00:11:20,694 --> 00:11:22,196
Universal Clean Spray?

196
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,231
But...

197
00:11:25,432 --> 00:11:27,668
what's with the bad mood?

198
00:11:28,402 --> 00:11:29,836
Jasmine is angry.

199
00:11:31,672 --> 00:11:33,407
Light a candle and sit down.

200
00:11:36,777 --> 00:11:39,046
The Magical Deodorant,

201
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:41,715
Universal Clean Spray,
a collaboration with "TTC,"

202
00:11:41,715 --> 00:11:43,250
and Hair Fiber of Light and Dreams.

203
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,552
We'll do commerce with these three items.

204
00:11:45,552 --> 00:11:46,720
Let's keep this going quickly.

205
00:11:47,688 --> 00:11:50,624
Hello, I'm Ji Jin Hee...

206
00:11:51,592 --> 00:11:52,559
of "Actor Ji's 'Let's Make It.'"

207
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:55,829
This is a content
the members of KICKKICKKICKKICK started...

208
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:58,498
to make something for KICKERs.

209
00:11:58,498 --> 00:11:59,566
Everyone.

210
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:02,336
Depending on the smell and ingredients
of the deodorant,

211
00:12:02,336 --> 00:12:04,504
some may show allergic reactions.

212
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:06,740
So I think our Magical Deodorant...

213
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,610
should be made with the herbs...

214
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,311
that Jasmine grew herself...

215
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:13,347
to minimize the drawbacks.

216
00:12:14,281 --> 00:12:15,682
Please keep them safe.

217
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,985
Don't worry, Doctor.

218
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:23,223
Finally.

219
00:12:24,658 --> 00:12:26,693
It's cold.

220
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:32,199
In Seong, let's wait five seconds.

221
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:34,768
Five, four...

222
00:12:34,768 --> 00:12:36,336
In Seong, flap, flap.

223
00:12:36,336 --> 00:12:37,204
Flap, flap.

224
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:41,241
Are you okay?

225
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:01,361
It hurts.

226
00:13:02,796 --> 00:13:04,331
- No In Seong.
- Yes?

227
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:07,301
Hang in there.
My nose hurts from the smell, too.

228
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:09,303
- Open.
- Open.

229
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:12,206
- Gently, please.
- Open.

230
00:13:12,206 --> 00:13:13,841
Gently.

231
00:13:15,576 --> 00:13:16,643
Five seconds.

232
00:13:16,643 --> 00:13:22,015
Five, four, three, two, one.

233
00:13:22,015 --> 00:13:23,050
Okay. Flap, flap.

234
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,017
Flap, flap.

235
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,188
- Wait.
- Why?

236
00:13:28,188 --> 00:13:29,790
In Seong, flap again.

237
00:13:34,027 --> 00:13:34,862
Is it okay?

238
00:13:34,862 --> 00:13:36,797
- Did we make it?
- I think we did.

239
00:13:36,797 --> 00:13:38,432
- We did it.
- We did it.

240
00:13:38,432 --> 00:13:40,467
Should I apply it to your neck, too?

241
00:13:41,668 --> 00:13:42,603
Okay. Good.

242
00:14:00,621 --> 00:14:02,189
He won't pick up.
Should I try one more time?

243
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:03,223
Let's try one more time.

244
00:14:03,223 --> 00:14:05,292
- Why isn't he picking up?
- Why isn't he picking up?

245
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:06,393
CEOs Cho and Ji.

246
00:14:06,393 --> 00:14:07,427
He's here.

247
00:14:07,427 --> 00:14:10,330
All of our items passed the safety test.

248
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,451
I can't believe
these items have actually been made.

249
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:32,786
This is so cool.

250
00:14:33,654 --> 00:14:35,155
You all did a great job.

251
00:14:35,155 --> 00:14:37,558
"Actor Ji's 'Let's Make It'" Episode 5,

252
00:14:37,558 --> 00:14:40,394
"Actor Ji Actually Made It"
KICKKICKKICKKICK Commerce.

253
00:14:40,394 --> 00:14:41,862
PD Min Jae, let's upload it.

254
00:14:41,862 --> 00:14:43,030
Here we go.

255
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,865
- Wait.
- Why?

256
00:14:44,865 --> 00:14:48,569
You indicated it's a paid advertisement
and included the purchase link, right?

257
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:51,405
- Did you?
- Yes, I did all that.

258
00:14:51,405 --> 00:14:53,073
Okay.

259
00:14:53,073 --> 00:14:54,007
I'm nervous.

260
00:14:54,007 --> 00:14:55,809
I'm so nervous.

261
00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:57,778
Will we make it? I hope we do.

262
00:14:57,778 --> 00:14:58,879
- We'll definitely make it.
- How do you know?

263
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,948
We experimented countless times
until my armpits got sore.

264
00:15:00,948 --> 00:15:01,715
There's pus.

265
00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:03,417
You have no idea how long
I had to stay in the bathroom.

266
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:05,152
- Sorry.
- I also smelled bad hair a lot.

267
00:15:05,152 --> 00:15:06,053
Thank you, everyone.

268
00:15:06,053 --> 00:15:07,955
- Everyone, that's enough.
- Enough.

269
00:15:08,422 --> 00:15:10,824
Let's upload the video now.

270
00:15:10,824 --> 00:15:12,960
Okay.

271
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,295
I'll upload it now.

272
00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:16,430
Three.

273
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,331
Two.

274
00:15:18,398 --> 00:15:19,266
One.

275
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:22,636
Please.

276
00:15:22,636 --> 00:15:24,271
It's been uploaded.

277
00:15:24,972 --> 00:15:26,039
(Hair Fiber of Light and Dreams)

278
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,475
Someone bought it.

279
00:15:28,475 --> 00:15:30,244
Someone bought one.

280
00:15:30,244 --> 00:15:33,580
- Someone bought one.
- Someone bought one already?

281
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:35,115
This is so cool.

282
00:15:35,115 --> 00:15:37,251
I...

283
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:38,819
I bought it.

284
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:40,487
Why did you buy it?

285
00:15:40,487 --> 00:15:41,255
To make a start.

286
00:15:41,255 --> 00:15:44,157
Wait, the number of purchases is rising.

287
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:50,130
How can it rise so much like that?

288
00:15:50,597 --> 00:15:52,232
What do the comments say?

289
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:56,303
Good. We're getting positive reactions.

290
00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:58,872
Isn't this a good start?

291
00:15:58,872 --> 00:16:00,374
It's a great start.

292
00:16:00,774 --> 00:16:03,243
We keep getting orders.
If we keep this up...

293
00:16:03,243 --> 00:16:04,311
Wait.

294
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:07,948
Let's not flatter ourselves
or settle for this.

295
00:16:07,948 --> 00:16:09,483
Don't let your guard down.

296
00:16:09,483 --> 00:16:12,986
Let's keep this up
and dominate the commerce market.

297
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,821
Let's go.

298
00:16:15,422 --> 00:16:17,324
- Let's go.
- Let's dominate it.

299
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:19,026
The number is rising.

300
00:16:19,026 --> 00:16:22,062
(Hanbang Building)

301
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,132
Our goal is 3.3 million dollars,

302
00:16:25,132 --> 00:16:27,034
but we've currently got
1.6 million dollars.

303
00:16:27,034 --> 00:16:29,770
To reach the amount we promised
to Don Man Hui,

304
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,104
we need 1.7 million more dollars.

305
00:16:32,506 --> 00:16:35,642
How many days do we have
until the promised date?

306
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:37,044
A week.

307
00:16:37,778 --> 00:16:38,879
A week.

308
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:41,648
Should we try more aggressive marketing?

309
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,817
- Aggressive?
- Yes.

310
00:16:44,484 --> 00:16:47,721
How about doing
a KICKKICKKICKKICK live commerce?

311
00:16:47,721 --> 00:16:49,556
Live commerce?

312
00:16:49,823 --> 00:16:50,757
Live commerce.

313
00:16:50,757 --> 00:16:53,894
Our commerce is
only for KICKERs right now.

314
00:16:53,894 --> 00:16:56,663
Let's expand this
for other customers to see.

315
00:16:56,663 --> 00:16:58,432
Promoting the live commerce...

316
00:16:58,432 --> 00:17:00,500
through YouTube Shorts videos
would be great.

317
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,871
Okay. Let's divide the roles...

318
00:17:03,871 --> 00:17:05,372
and do...

319
00:17:06,874 --> 00:17:08,141
live commerce.

320
00:17:08,141 --> 00:17:09,576
Let's do it.

321
00:17:09,576 --> 00:17:11,478
- Let's go.
- Let's do this.

322
00:17:11,478 --> 00:17:15,315
(Our goal is 3.3 million dollars.)

323
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,218
Hello.

324
00:17:18,852 --> 00:17:22,856
Today's Jasmine's 15 Minute Class...

325
00:17:22,856 --> 00:17:27,361
will be a live commerce
of the Magical Deodorant.

326
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:32,199
How long can it hold out
when you're sweating?

327
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:34,334
We'll show you ourselves.

328
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:43,510
They're dancing hard, aren't they?

329
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:46,947
Everybody, put your hands up.

330
00:17:46,947 --> 00:17:48,682
Put your hands up.

331
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,519
Look at his gray T-shirt.

332
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:55,589
Isn't it so dry and soft here?

333
00:17:55,589 --> 00:17:56,790
Look here, too.

334
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,227
(Sales)

335
00:18:00,227 --> 00:18:01,662
Everyone.

336
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:07,568
I'll put a bunch of garlic
and green onion...

337
00:18:07,568 --> 00:18:08,835
that you like.

338
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,738
- Here.
- Thanks.

339
00:18:14,474 --> 00:18:15,309
Okay.

340
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:17,077
Open your mouth.

341
00:18:17,077 --> 00:18:18,178
Okay.

342
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,351
Look.

343
00:18:24,351 --> 00:18:25,752
(Bad breath figure)

344
00:18:25,752 --> 00:18:28,622
I'll be able to go camping
without any worries from now on.

345
00:18:28,622 --> 00:18:30,524
Thank you, Clean Fairy.

346
00:18:30,524 --> 00:18:31,825
Poof!

347
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:35,662
(Sales)

348
00:18:36,263 --> 00:18:37,231
Okay.

349
00:18:37,865 --> 00:18:39,433
What we need now is...

350
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:41,335
eight hundred thousand dollars.

351
00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:46,139
We need 800,000 dollars
of profit tomorrow.

352
00:18:47,207 --> 00:18:50,310
To sell our final item, the hair fiber,

353
00:18:52,546 --> 00:18:55,816
we have to put in everything we have.
Do you understand?

354
00:18:55,816 --> 00:18:56,850
Yes.

355
00:19:01,188 --> 00:19:02,523
KICKKICKKICKKICK.

356
00:19:02,523 --> 00:19:05,626
Let's go.

357
00:19:09,296 --> 00:19:11,532
Hello, this is Ji Jin Hee.

358
00:19:11,865 --> 00:19:13,934
As I mentioned
in "Actor Ji's 'Let's Make It,'"

359
00:19:13,934 --> 00:19:16,203
one of our members...

360
00:19:16,203 --> 00:19:18,605
is suffering from early stages
of hair loss.

361
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,609
So we made Hair Fiber of Light and Dreams.

362
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:26,013
No pigmentation, flakes, or impotence.

363
00:19:26,013 --> 00:19:27,648
This hair fiber causes none of them.

364
00:19:27,981 --> 00:19:32,152
Only for today, this will be sold
at a 30 percent reduced price.

365
00:19:33,854 --> 00:19:36,957
I just got another news.

366
00:19:36,957 --> 00:19:39,293
For those who buy this hair fiber,

367
00:19:39,293 --> 00:19:43,096
the Magical Deodorant
and Universal Clean Spray will be sold...

368
00:19:43,096 --> 00:19:46,133
at a 20 percent reduced price.

369
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,402
- Why are people leaving?
- This is not good.

370
00:19:48,402 --> 00:19:50,204
- Joo Ha, how is the reaction?
- The number is dropping.

371
00:19:50,204 --> 00:19:51,538
Dropping? What should we do?

372
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:52,573
People are leaving.

373
00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:53,907
The number of viewers is dropping.

374
00:19:53,907 --> 00:19:55,175
(We still need 300,000 more dollars.
Number of viewers dropping)

375
00:19:55,175 --> 00:19:56,476
(If we can't make a profit now, it's over.
We need something more provocative.)

376
00:19:56,476 --> 00:19:57,978
Do something. Anything.

377
00:19:58,412 --> 00:19:59,580
I did everything I could.

378
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,248
They're saying this is too commercial.

379
00:20:02,216 --> 00:20:04,618
Do I pull out my own hair? I can't.

380
00:20:08,755 --> 00:20:09,790
The number is dropping.

381
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,525
But we can't show this.

382
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,161
Do something.

383
00:20:14,828 --> 00:20:15,729
Come on.

384
00:20:15,729 --> 00:20:17,331
It should be more provocative.

385
00:20:17,331 --> 00:20:18,565
Make it provocative.

386
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:20,167
Come on.

387
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:22,202
Come on, CEO Ji.

388
00:20:26,773 --> 00:20:29,743
My savior, Actor Ji.

389
00:20:31,712 --> 00:20:34,448
Members of KICKKICKKICKKICK.

390
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:37,751
I miss you all.

391
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,054
How...

392
00:20:41,054 --> 00:20:42,990
- CEO Ji.
- What should I do?

393
00:20:44,324 --> 00:20:47,194
I'll sacrifice myself.

394
00:20:47,794 --> 00:20:48,695
What?

395
00:20:48,695 --> 00:20:49,830
No In Seong, what...

396
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,064
What? What are you saying?

397
00:20:51,532 --> 00:20:54,201
I said I'll bury my bones
in KICKKICKKICKKICK, didn't I?

398
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:56,303
I always keep my promise.

399
00:21:12,886 --> 00:21:13,954
In Seong.

400
00:21:32,673 --> 00:21:33,607
In Seong.

401
00:21:34,474 --> 00:21:35,409
In Seong.

402
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,512
I'll show you myself.

403
00:21:39,746 --> 00:21:41,615
Do you see this, everyone?

404
00:21:41,615 --> 00:21:42,983
I have hair loss.

405
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:47,054
My goodness.

406
00:21:47,054 --> 00:21:48,255
Give it to me.

407
00:21:54,928 --> 00:21:56,830
It doesn't show at all, does it?

408
00:21:57,097 --> 00:21:58,265
Get a close-up shot!

409
00:22:06,273 --> 00:22:07,341
(He's going that far?)

410
00:22:07,341 --> 00:22:08,342
(This is hilarious.)

411
00:22:08,342 --> 00:22:09,343
(Sacrifice)

412
00:22:09,343 --> 00:22:10,344
(Nice advertising)

413
00:22:10,344 --> 00:22:11,345
(But it really doesn't show.)

414
00:22:11,345 --> 00:22:12,379
(And there are no flakes, too.)

415
00:22:14,081 --> 00:22:16,650
(We reached our goal!)

416
00:22:20,087 --> 00:22:23,323
Thank you, everyone. These are sold out.

417
00:22:23,323 --> 00:22:25,259
- This was Ji Jin Hee.
- And No In Seong.

418
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:26,460
Thank you.

419
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,961
Cut.

420
00:22:48,315 --> 00:22:50,584
Why are you all here as a group?

421
00:22:50,584 --> 00:22:51,685
A group?

422
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:53,820
Yes, we're a group, but we're one.

423
00:22:54,922 --> 00:22:56,089
Give it to him.

424
00:22:56,089 --> 00:22:57,624
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

425
00:23:03,997 --> 00:23:07,067
No matter what, money is best.

426
00:23:09,636 --> 00:23:11,104
That's the money we promised.

427
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:14,041
It's 3.3 million dollars, 3 million
in investment and 300,000 in interest.

428
00:23:15,075 --> 00:23:16,944
We went through everything to earn that.

429
00:23:20,414 --> 00:23:22,950
That's exactly 3.3 million dollars.

430
00:23:28,722 --> 00:23:30,290
You can count all you want. It's true.

431
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,091
Yes.

432
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,702
- But that was so fast.
- We know.

433
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:43,503
So now...

434
00:23:43,503 --> 00:23:45,305
Get lost.

435
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:47,474
Leave KICKKICKKICKKICK.

436
00:23:47,474 --> 00:23:48,742
- Get lost.
- Get out.

437
00:23:48,742 --> 00:23:49,877
Be gone!

438
00:23:49,877 --> 00:23:51,545
What do you want?

439
00:23:51,545 --> 00:23:52,379
If...

440
00:23:52,813 --> 00:23:56,517
you ever try to mess
with Kickickickick again...

441
00:23:56,517 --> 00:23:57,618
We will not...

442
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:00,687
stand idly by.

443
00:24:02,322 --> 00:24:03,290
KICKKICKKICKKICK.

444
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,391
Yes.

445
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:06,293
Assemble.

446
00:24:08,262 --> 00:24:12,466
We came, we saw, we conquered.

447
00:24:12,866 --> 00:24:15,569
We will make you regret it. Get out now.

448
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:16,770
Let's go.

449
00:24:19,306 --> 00:24:24,077
Get out.

450
00:25:00,906 --> 00:25:01,841
Right.

451
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:06,312
I have vasovagal syncope.

452
00:25:06,646 --> 00:25:08,381
I faint when I see blood.

453
00:25:09,215 --> 00:25:10,650
But that time...

454
00:25:11,851 --> 00:25:12,752
Sorry.

455
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,388
It hurts.

456
00:25:17,156 --> 00:25:18,457
This won't do. Let's go to the hospital.

457
00:25:25,331 --> 00:25:26,265
What was that?

458
00:25:45,518 --> 00:25:47,787
Joo Ha, coffee is here.

459
00:25:47,787 --> 00:25:49,055
Hey.

460
00:25:50,022 --> 00:25:51,123
Thanks, Mark.

461
00:25:51,691 --> 00:25:52,792
What were you doing?

462
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:54,560
I was writing a script.

463
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:58,364
- Thanks for the coffee.
- You're welcome.

464
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:10,876
(Hanbang Building)

465
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,414
Looks like I'm the first one here.

466
00:26:16,082 --> 00:26:17,683
I'll have a cup of coffee.

467
00:26:18,884 --> 00:26:21,087
These days, I love coming to work early...

468
00:26:21,087 --> 00:26:24,724
and enjoying a cup of coffee
with you in the morning like this.

469
00:26:24,724 --> 00:26:26,926
It's not morning now. It's the afternoon.

470
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,894
Those two...

471
00:26:28,894 --> 00:26:30,596
Did you hear the news?

472
00:26:30,596 --> 00:26:32,698
PD Han of "Neo Quiz"
and the youngest scriptwriter...

473
00:26:32,698 --> 00:26:34,634
were secretly dating, but they got caught.

474
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,702
So they felt uncomfortable
and became indifferent afterward.

475
00:26:36,702 --> 00:26:38,271
They eventually broke up.

476
00:26:38,738 --> 00:26:41,774
Let's never get caught.

477
00:26:41,774 --> 00:26:42,675
Okay.

478
00:26:42,675 --> 00:26:44,877
Let's keep...

479
00:26:44,877 --> 00:26:46,312
this exciting SR.

480
00:26:47,446 --> 00:26:51,484
They call a "secret relationship"
as "SR." I see.

481
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:52,718
Definitely.

482
00:26:52,718 --> 00:26:55,321
Just imagining getting caught
by Young Sik makes me feel...

483
00:26:56,722 --> 00:26:58,224
If I get caught,
I'm going to quit working here.

484
00:26:59,392 --> 00:27:01,994
We must not get caught by CEO Cho...

485
00:27:02,428 --> 00:27:03,996
- and everyone else as well.
- Exactly.

486
00:27:04,931 --> 00:27:05,965
- Secret.
- Secret.

487
00:27:12,972 --> 00:27:16,275
As you know,
Kickickickick these days...

488
00:27:16,275 --> 00:27:17,877
is on a roll.

489
00:27:18,177 --> 00:27:20,646
We're getting outsourcing requests,

490
00:27:20,646 --> 00:27:23,783
celebrities are asking us
to create their YouTube channel,

491
00:27:23,783 --> 00:27:26,919
and we're even getting offers from
major companies for product placement.

492
00:27:28,287 --> 00:27:30,189
We're getting a bunch of offers.

493
00:27:31,724 --> 00:27:33,893
Congratulations. Good job, everyone.

494
00:27:33,893 --> 00:27:36,762
We're in the prime years of Kickickickick.

495
00:27:36,762 --> 00:27:40,032
But at times like these,
you must not flatter yourselves,

496
00:27:40,032 --> 00:27:42,001
but should focus on your work...

497
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:43,502
Carpe diem.

498
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:44,337
Yes.

499
00:27:44,337 --> 00:27:47,006
Enjoying the current pleasure
as best as you can...

500
00:27:47,006 --> 00:27:49,542
is also a great virtue.

501
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,577
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.

502
00:27:51,577 --> 00:27:52,878
In this sense...

503
00:27:52,878 --> 00:27:55,948
Company dinner. Barbecue.

504
00:27:55,948 --> 00:27:57,016
Let's do that next...

505
00:27:57,016 --> 00:27:59,986
Good. Let's have a company dinner.

506
00:27:59,986 --> 00:28:02,488
That little brat.

507
00:28:02,488 --> 00:28:06,225
We couldn't throw a Christmas party
because of Don Man Hui.

508
00:28:06,225 --> 00:28:08,828
So how about a belated Christmas party?

509
00:28:08,828 --> 00:28:10,696
Good. Let's do that.

510
00:28:11,664 --> 00:28:14,267
Then how about throwing a party
where we enjoyed ourselves last time,

511
00:28:14,267 --> 00:28:15,301
the rooftop?

512
00:28:15,301 --> 00:28:16,736
Rooftop.

513
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:17,970
- No.
- Why not?

514
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,039
At the last company dinner,
we were too noisy.

515
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,575
So we got so many civil complaints.
We can't do it on the rooftop.

516
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:24,944
No way.

517
00:28:24,944 --> 00:28:26,078
Then where?

518
00:28:26,078 --> 00:28:28,080
How about this concept, then?

519
00:28:29,282 --> 00:28:30,750
- Silent.
- Silent?

520
00:28:32,418 --> 00:28:34,820
Silent Headset Christmas Party.

521
00:28:36,656 --> 00:28:38,624
We'll all wear headsets,

522
00:28:38,624 --> 00:28:41,460
listen to the music
playing from the same frequency,

523
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,396
and dance to it.

524
00:28:43,396 --> 00:28:46,565
It's the latest party style
of having fun quietly.

525
00:28:46,565 --> 00:28:49,535
I like that. That's a thing these days.

526
00:28:49,535 --> 00:28:50,603
That's quite groundbreaking.

527
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,772
- It sounds fun.
- I know, right?

528
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:55,875
Let's add one more item.

529
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:57,710
- Item?
- What item?

530
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,211
Secret Santa.

531
00:28:59,211 --> 00:29:02,148
We'll become someone's guardian angel
for a certain period.

532
00:29:02,148 --> 00:29:03,783
- Guardian angel.
- Guardian angel.

533
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:04,684
Nice.

534
00:29:04,684 --> 00:29:06,786
What if we guess our Secret Santa wrong?

535
00:29:07,286 --> 00:29:08,588
Then they have to grant
their Secret Santa's wish.

536
00:29:08,588 --> 00:29:10,156
That's a good idea.

537
00:29:10,156 --> 00:29:12,592
But how do you play that Santa game?

538
00:29:12,592 --> 00:29:14,093
How do you pick whose Secret Santa to be?

539
00:29:14,093 --> 00:29:16,228
I'll send a link in our group chat.

540
00:29:16,228 --> 00:29:17,129
- Okay.
- Our group chat?

541
00:29:17,129 --> 00:29:18,998
Just click that link.

542
00:29:18,998 --> 00:29:20,333
The moment I press the button,

543
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:22,201
we will all randomly become
someone else's Secret Santa.

544
00:29:22,201 --> 00:29:24,070
- Then we should check secretly.
- That's right.

545
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,439
- Hide your screens, everyone.
- I clicked the link.

546
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:27,940
- Did everyone click it?
- Yes.

547
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,075
I'll press the button now.

548
00:29:29,075 --> 00:29:31,611
One, two, three.

549
00:29:33,613 --> 00:29:37,249
Let's start Secret Santa.

550
00:29:39,452 --> 00:29:43,723
(Episode 11-2
What My Heart Tells Me To Do)

551
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,558
Two iced americanos, please.

552
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:47,426
Stop right there.

553
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,129
Michael, add one more iced americano...

554
00:29:50,129 --> 00:29:52,531
and I'll pay for Mark's drink
and mine with this.

555
00:29:52,531 --> 00:29:54,567
Stop!

556
00:29:56,102 --> 00:29:59,538
Add one more large iced americano...

557
00:29:59,538 --> 00:30:00,840
and I'll pay for all of them with this.

558
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,541
- No, this.
- No, my card.

559
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:04,443
No, take my card.

560
00:30:04,443 --> 00:30:06,212
Michael, look me in the eye. Take mine.

561
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,581
I heard from In Seong today...

562
00:30:09,282 --> 00:30:12,084
that you guys are playing Secret Santa.

563
00:30:15,321 --> 00:30:16,389
I can see.

564
00:30:16,923 --> 00:30:19,125
See what?

565
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:22,261
Mark's Secret Santa is Min Jae.

566
00:30:22,261 --> 00:30:23,095
No, I'm not.

567
00:30:23,095 --> 00:30:25,698
And Min Jae's Secret Santa is Joo Ha.

568
00:30:26,165 --> 00:30:27,500
That's not true at all.

569
00:30:28,534 --> 00:30:30,069
- So take my card.
- No, take this.

570
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:32,705
Michael, you have to take my card.

571
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,140
I'll just...

572
00:30:34,974 --> 00:30:37,944
pay for your drinks with your own cards.

573
00:30:38,678 --> 00:30:39,712
I'm too busy.

574
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,013
You're a genius.

575
00:30:44,617 --> 00:30:45,718
Right.

576
00:30:46,118 --> 00:30:47,887
You said you wanted to hear
the Cilantro Song.

577
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,589
So I finished writing it last night.

578
00:30:49,589 --> 00:30:51,357
- Really?
- Yes.

579
00:30:51,357 --> 00:30:55,027
We have to listen to the Cilantro Song
in the cilantro garden.

580
00:30:55,027 --> 00:30:56,329
Right.

581
00:30:56,862 --> 00:30:59,899
Min Jae, you're going to join us, right?

582
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,400
Of course.

583
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,202
I can't wait to listen
to the cilantro song.

584
00:31:03,636 --> 00:31:05,404
Our music genius,

585
00:31:05,404 --> 00:31:08,641
Mark, wrote and composed
the Cilantro Song, so of course.

586
00:31:09,241 --> 00:31:10,876
You look handsome today, Mark.

587
00:31:11,711 --> 00:31:13,879
- Thanks, Min Jae.
- Sure.

588
00:31:14,981 --> 00:31:16,682
- What was that?
- What?

589
00:31:17,316 --> 00:31:19,619
This is the chord.

590
00:31:20,286 --> 00:31:21,487
And the lyrics...

591
00:31:21,487 --> 00:31:23,789
♪ It's like a shampoo ♪

592
00:31:25,057 --> 00:31:26,225
♪ The scent like soap... ♪

593
00:31:27,827 --> 00:31:28,761
What's wrong?

594
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,197
- Are you okay?
- The string snapped.

595
00:31:31,197 --> 00:31:32,198
What?

596
00:31:36,168 --> 00:31:37,136
Hey.

597
00:31:37,737 --> 00:31:40,006
Well...

598
00:31:40,006 --> 00:31:42,808
Min Jae has vasovagal syncope, that's why.

599
00:31:42,808 --> 00:31:45,411
Right. You said you faint
when you see blood. Sorry.

600
00:31:45,411 --> 00:31:46,312
Yes.

601
00:31:46,879 --> 00:31:47,813
Sorry.

602
00:31:48,414 --> 00:31:50,783
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

603
00:31:52,251 --> 00:31:53,586
Mark, I'm sorry,

604
00:31:53,586 --> 00:31:55,855
but can you go downstairs
and apply medicine and put on a bandage?

605
00:31:56,656 --> 00:31:58,524
Okay. Sure.

606
00:31:59,725 --> 00:32:00,726
Are you okay?

607
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,729
Yes, thanks to you.

608
00:32:05,564 --> 00:32:06,799
- Stay here.
- Okay.

609
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,868
Let's go.

610
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,269
Wait, and we'll be back.

611
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:16,609
Does it hurt a lot?

612
00:32:16,609 --> 00:32:18,077
My fingers are torn.

613
00:32:18,477 --> 00:32:20,046
- Torn?
- Yes.

614
00:32:28,754 --> 00:32:30,890
What should I do for my gift recipient?

615
00:32:32,391 --> 00:32:33,659
What could make a nice gift?

616
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:40,833
What was that? You scared me.

617
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,569
Sorry. Did I scare you?

618
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:44,437
Yes.

619
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,841
Just for a minute.

620
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:51,711
I had a hard time editing until now.
Let me recharge my energy.

621
00:32:55,114 --> 00:32:57,049
- Was it tough?
- Yes.

622
00:32:59,685 --> 00:33:01,988
They're so lovey-dovey.

623
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,223
What?

624
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,160
What should I do?

625
00:33:09,629 --> 00:33:10,863
Cuckoo.

626
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:14,834
- Cuckoo?
- What was that?

627
00:33:15,401 --> 00:33:17,270
Did that come from downstairs or upstairs?

628
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,537
Cuckoo.

629
00:33:19,338 --> 00:33:21,107
We should leave.

630
00:33:22,742 --> 00:33:23,709
Where's that coming from?

631
00:33:24,577 --> 00:33:26,145
There's a bird.

632
00:33:26,145 --> 00:33:28,581
A bird. I see.

633
00:33:28,581 --> 00:33:29,882
It must be a cuckoo.

634
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,217
- Cuckoo. Let's go and check.
- What?

635
00:33:33,085 --> 00:33:37,056
Jin Hee, you perfectly played your role
as Scriptwriter Wang's guardian angel.

636
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:41,460
You did a good job, Jin Hee.

637
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:45,765
In that sense, let's take a mirror selfie.

638
00:33:45,765 --> 00:33:46,933
CEO Ji, hello.

639
00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:48,167
Hello.

640
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,536
Okay.

641
00:33:51,304 --> 00:33:53,239
Goodness.

642
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,141
Enough with your selfies.

643
00:33:55,741 --> 00:33:57,209
I'll make sure you don't show.

644
00:33:57,209 --> 00:34:00,513
But I'm in the frame. Are you serious?

645
00:34:02,281 --> 00:34:04,583
Tae Ho, you have muscular arms.

646
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:06,118
You have a nice build.

647
00:34:06,118 --> 00:34:08,821
Didn't you know that already?

648
00:34:12,491 --> 00:34:13,559
Come.

649
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:15,595
- Hey.
- You scared me.

650
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:16,896
Darn it.

651
00:34:16,896 --> 00:34:19,165
Zip up slowly. Don't rush...

652
00:34:19,165 --> 00:34:20,933
so the same accident
as last time does not happen again.

653
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,469
- You...
- That's right. At that rate.

654
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:24,637
For your information,

655
00:34:24,637 --> 00:34:26,973
I am not your Secret Santa, CEO Cho.

656
00:34:26,973 --> 00:34:27,640
Keep that in mind.

657
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,241
What are you saying? You're crazy.

658
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:31,110
Is there a different way?

659
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,012
How do the MZers take selfies these days?

660
00:34:36,749 --> 00:34:38,584
There must be a different way.

661
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,923
Look at that punk.
He didn't even wash his hands.

662
00:34:43,923 --> 00:34:46,826
That dirty brat.

663
00:34:46,826 --> 00:34:49,462
That's enough.
Move so I can wash my hands.

664
00:34:52,531 --> 00:34:53,833
- Take a selfie.
- Okay.

665
00:34:58,938 --> 00:34:59,939
Enough.

666
00:35:03,175 --> 00:35:04,176
Focus.

667
00:35:04,176 --> 00:35:06,045
In KICKKICKKICKKICK,

668
00:35:06,045 --> 00:35:09,081
we finally got our first instant
stick coffee advertisement deal.

669
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:11,751
Instant stick coffee.

670
00:35:13,452 --> 00:35:14,921
- That's a lot.
- This is that coffee.

671
00:35:14,921 --> 00:35:15,888
Yes.

672
00:35:15,888 --> 00:35:18,925
The coffee we're drinking every day
after Actor Ji made it for us.

673
00:35:18,925 --> 00:35:20,660
- I even had a whole cup of it just now.
- Really?

674
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,596
I drink ten cups of this coffee a day,
but my blood sugar doesn't rise at all.

675
00:35:23,596 --> 00:35:26,933
CEO Ji, was this your big picture
all along?

676
00:35:27,366 --> 00:35:29,201
Okay. Be quiet now.

677
00:35:29,201 --> 00:35:30,636
This is what we all enjoy,

678
00:35:30,636 --> 00:35:32,538
so I took the offer right away.

679
00:35:32,538 --> 00:35:33,839
Let's all enjoy a cup of this coffee...

680
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,443
and discuss how we can naturally show
the product in our content.

681
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:42,448
- This is really good.
- Delicious.

682
00:35:42,448 --> 00:35:43,649
This is good.

683
00:35:43,649 --> 00:35:46,852
This is good and also useful.

684
00:35:46,852 --> 00:35:47,954
It's amazing.

685
00:35:47,954 --> 00:35:49,288
I know, right? Isn't it groundbreaking?

686
00:35:49,722 --> 00:35:53,793
PD Tae Ho, you look quite handsome today.

687
00:35:53,793 --> 00:35:54,727
Do I?

688
00:35:54,727 --> 00:35:56,829
But I'm quite handsome every day.

689
00:35:57,663 --> 00:35:59,465
Okay. Drink your coffee.

690
00:35:59,465 --> 00:36:01,567
Drink up and grow your muscles.

691
00:36:01,567 --> 00:36:02,668
Nice.

692
00:36:02,668 --> 00:36:05,204
During the "TTC" shoot,

693
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:08,207
we could share this with the campers
and it'd look natural, don't you think?

694
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,175
You're right.

695
00:36:09,175 --> 00:36:12,445
I think that's a great idea.

696
00:36:12,445 --> 00:36:14,046
Look at you.

697
00:36:15,314 --> 00:36:16,215
What?

698
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,218
What?

699
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,522
- What's going on?
- What was that just now?

700
00:36:25,858 --> 00:36:27,693
Are you a little boy or what, PD Tae Ho?

701
00:36:27,693 --> 00:36:29,495
Look at you. You have food in your mouth.

702
00:36:29,495 --> 00:36:33,332
Why get a sandwich all over your mouth?
How sloppy.

703
00:36:33,332 --> 00:36:37,536
What does PD Tae Ho having food
in his mouth have to do with you, CEO Ji?

704
00:36:38,037 --> 00:36:41,507
The "TTC" people are a team, that's why.

705
00:36:41,507 --> 00:36:43,776
My precious colleague has food
all over his mouth.

706
00:36:43,776 --> 00:36:45,344
I can't just stand by. Isn't that right?

707
00:36:45,344 --> 00:36:47,146
How can you call that a team?

708
00:36:48,281 --> 00:36:50,516
When Scriptwriter Wang got food
on her mouth,

709
00:36:50,516 --> 00:36:52,051
- you wiped it for the same reason, right?
- Yes.

710
00:36:52,051 --> 00:36:54,921
I think that's right.
Isn't that right, PD Tae Ho?

711
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,723
That's right. We're a team,
so I should wipe your mouth.

712
00:36:57,723 --> 00:36:58,758
Exactly.

713
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,764
What the... What was that?

714
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,234
But you don't wash your hands,
No In Seong.

715
00:37:08,234 --> 00:37:09,969
- I don't.
- You didn't wash them today.

716
00:37:09,969 --> 00:37:11,938
- I didn't.
- Then why did you wipe my mouth?

717
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,539
I helped you.

718
00:37:13,539 --> 00:37:14,807
Don't do that to me.

719
00:37:14,807 --> 00:37:16,142
You never know I care for you.

720
00:37:16,842 --> 00:37:17,810
Everyone.

721
00:37:18,678 --> 00:37:20,346
Who was it?

722
00:37:20,346 --> 00:37:23,282
Who left the latest book...

723
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,384
of my favorite author, MelanCholyCallme,

724
00:37:25,384 --> 00:37:27,687
"Northern Duke Felix's Big Size
Has Changed,"

725
00:37:27,687 --> 00:37:32,592
even the first edition
with the author's autograph, on my desk?

726
00:37:32,592 --> 00:37:34,293
Isn't it you, Actor Ji?

727
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:37,029
What did you say the title was?
Northern Duke's what changed?

728
00:37:37,029 --> 00:37:39,131
Felix's Big Size.

729
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,133
What's Felix's Big Size?

730
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:44,537
Your reaction shows
this was not you, PD Tae Ho.

731
00:37:44,537 --> 00:37:46,472
What kind of name is that
for an author?

732
00:37:51,177 --> 00:37:53,980
Ji Won, why did you call me?

733
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:59,418
Your skin seems rough these days,
In Seong.

734
00:37:59,785 --> 00:38:00,786
Is it because of the season?

735
00:38:01,587 --> 00:38:03,756
I wanted to replenish moisture.

736
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:05,491
Thank you.

737
00:38:06,225 --> 00:38:07,193
Thank you.

738
00:38:08,794 --> 00:38:10,696
First, drink this.

739
00:38:13,366 --> 00:38:14,400
Thank you.

740
00:38:25,211 --> 00:38:27,446
Sorry.

741
00:38:27,446 --> 00:38:29,148
Sorry, Ji Won.

742
00:38:29,148 --> 00:38:31,317
The tea was too bitter. Please forgive me.

743
00:38:34,053 --> 00:38:36,455
Okay.

744
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,930
What's good for your body
is always bitter.

745
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:48,534
Drink up.

746
00:38:49,335 --> 00:38:50,436
I'll drink up.

747
00:38:52,238 --> 00:38:53,406
Good.

748
00:38:55,408 --> 00:38:56,575
This is sweet.

749
00:39:00,313 --> 00:39:04,317
I was always scared of your touch,

750
00:39:04,317 --> 00:39:05,618
but it's really soft today.

751
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:09,889
I must've gotten you wrong all along.

752
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:10,890
You were actually...

753
00:39:15,628 --> 00:39:18,564
Would you please shut up
and just get this massage?

754
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:20,833
Okay.

755
00:39:21,934 --> 00:39:22,969
Okay.

756
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,483
It's spicy, isn't it?

757
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,485
I told you to order a mild one.

758
00:39:39,485 --> 00:39:40,953
No, it's not spicy at all.

759
00:39:41,387 --> 00:39:43,456
I'll bring some milk from the pantry.

760
00:39:43,456 --> 00:39:45,791
No, I'll bring it.

761
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:48,961
No. This is not spicy at all for me,

762
00:39:48,961 --> 00:39:50,730
but it seems you guys think I'm suffering.

763
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:51,697
So I'll bring it.

764
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,933
Sit down, both of you.

765
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,501
You losers.

766
00:39:56,502 --> 00:39:57,770
Wait here a minute.

767
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,538
- Thank you.
- You can go.

768
00:39:59,538 --> 00:40:01,274
- Please be quick.
- I will.

769
00:40:03,376 --> 00:40:04,477
This is spicy but tasty.

770
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,187
Min Jae.

771
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,124
Are you my Secret Santa?

772
00:40:19,425 --> 00:40:22,461
Me? No, I'm not.

773
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,663
- No?
- No.

774
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:30,269
I like Joo Ha.

775
00:40:32,405 --> 00:40:33,606
Not as a friend. I have feelings for her.

776
00:40:40,947 --> 00:40:41,914
So?

777
00:40:41,914 --> 00:40:42,949
So...

778
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:47,153
if you're my Secret Santa,
be honest with me.

779
00:40:50,222 --> 00:40:51,624
Do you also have feelings for Joo Ha?

780
00:41:00,299 --> 00:41:02,368
What do my feelings have to do with yours?

781
00:41:04,637 --> 00:41:05,771
You do have feelings.

782
00:41:08,574 --> 00:41:09,609
Are you going...

783
00:41:10,643 --> 00:41:11,611
to confess your feelings to her?

784
00:41:15,281 --> 00:41:18,150
Well, I haven't thought about that yet.

785
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:23,089
But who knows?

786
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:25,791
So...

787
00:41:26,959 --> 00:41:30,363
don't mind how fast I take things,
and just do what you have to do.

788
00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:35,668
This is the best response I can give you
as your Secret Santa.

789
00:41:44,176 --> 00:41:46,445
This is spicy.

790
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:53,519
I've kept thinking about it.

791
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:55,388
I think CEO Ji is my Secret Santa,

792
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:57,290
and I think he knows we're dating.

793
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:57,990
What?

794
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:00,793
When you suddenly hugged me
on the stairs that day,

795
00:42:00,793 --> 00:42:01,894
we heard a cuckoo cry.

796
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,896
But that was definitely CEO Ji's voice.

797
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,598
And when you wiped my mouth,

798
00:42:05,598 --> 00:42:08,467
he suddenly wiped your mouth
to cover for us.

799
00:42:08,467 --> 00:42:09,702
- I see.
- Yes.

800
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:11,804
- That makes sense.
- Right?

801
00:42:11,804 --> 00:42:14,440
But CEO Ji can find out
about our secret relationship.

802
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,574
He's part of the "TTC" family.

803
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:19,011
What? Why do you sound so carefree?

804
00:42:19,011 --> 00:42:21,047
CEO Ji helped us out,

805
00:42:21,047 --> 00:42:23,349
so that means he has no intention...

806
00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:25,217
to reveal our secret relationship.

807
00:42:25,885 --> 00:42:29,655
So are you saying it's okay
for our thing to be caught by Actor Ji?

808
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,760
"Our" Actor Ji?

809
00:42:35,795 --> 00:42:36,729
What?

810
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,065
Our "thing."

811
00:42:39,532 --> 00:42:40,733
Is it...

812
00:42:40,733 --> 00:42:43,669
that CEO Ji knowing
about our secret relationship...

813
00:42:43,669 --> 00:42:46,839
is something you really, really hate?
Is that it?

814
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:48,908
What?

815
00:42:48,908 --> 00:42:52,511
You're a hardcore fan of CEO Ji,
Scriptwriter Wang.

816
00:42:52,511 --> 00:42:54,380
- Yes, I am, but...
- That's why you entered KICKKICKKICKKICK.

817
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,448
I can't even.

818
00:42:55,815 --> 00:42:57,183
This is so upsetting.

819
00:42:57,183 --> 00:42:58,618
No, that's not what...

820
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:00,686
Whatever. I have to go now...

821
00:43:00,686 --> 00:43:02,421
to see "our" Cho Young Sik...

822
00:43:02,421 --> 00:43:04,657
and discuss "Camping in Love."

823
00:43:05,324 --> 00:43:06,259
I'm leaving.

824
00:43:06,259 --> 00:43:09,228
- But this...
- "Our?"

825
00:43:09,228 --> 00:43:10,596
"Our" Actor Ji? I can't even.

826
00:43:14,834 --> 00:43:16,269
Is he jealous?

827
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:20,673
(Hanbang Building)

828
00:43:22,775 --> 00:43:24,277
Good morning, CEO Cho.

829
00:43:24,277 --> 00:43:25,511
You look like you've had
a good night's sleep.

830
00:43:25,511 --> 00:43:27,380
But I stayed up working until late.

831
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,615
I'm the face of KICKKICKKICKKICK,
so I shouldn't toss and turn all night.

832
00:43:29,615 --> 00:43:30,950
Why are you the face of...

833
00:43:32,752 --> 00:43:35,621
You almost stepped on gum,
but I saved you, CEO Cho.

834
00:43:35,621 --> 00:43:36,923
But don't get me wrong.

835
00:43:36,923 --> 00:43:39,859
I'm not your Secret Santa, CEO Cho.

836
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,527
That little...

837
00:43:43,896 --> 00:43:44,830
What?

838
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,465
That brat.

839
00:43:46,465 --> 00:43:48,567
Hey.

840
00:43:50,202 --> 00:43:51,637
He's such an annoying brat.

841
00:43:56,042 --> 00:43:57,710
Are you sulking?

842
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:00,279
I'm not a little kid to get in a sulk
because of something like that.

843
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:17,663
Unbelievable.

844
00:44:23,469 --> 00:44:24,470
A kiss?

845
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:29,542
CEO Ji, did you know?

846
00:44:30,242 --> 00:44:32,578
Is that why you helped us all along?

847
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:35,615
Yes, that's right.

848
00:44:35,848 --> 00:44:38,684
I knew all along
and had been helping you two.

849
00:45:38,911 --> 00:45:39,879
Unbelievable.

850
00:45:44,417 --> 00:45:45,785
What do you think you're doing?

851
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:48,287
Kang Tae Ho, are you out of your mind?

852
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,322
Young Sik!

853
00:45:49,322 --> 00:45:51,557
You work in a production company.

854
00:45:51,557 --> 00:45:55,294
Don't you know this Peck Challenge
popular among office workers lately?

855
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,128
What?

856
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,664
To hope that your colleagues
will cheer up that day, as always,

857
00:45:58,664 --> 00:46:00,166
office workers...

858
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,435
do a peck relay.

859
00:46:02,435 --> 00:46:03,836
Cheer up.

860
00:46:03,836 --> 00:46:06,505
There's a crazy challenge like that?

861
00:46:07,373 --> 00:46:08,641
You didn't know?

862
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,348
What's wrong with him?

863
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,561
A peck.

864
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:32,465
What?

865
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,134
No.

866
00:46:39,372 --> 00:46:40,339
You're Ji Jin Hee.

867
00:46:42,275 --> 00:46:43,209
Don't.

868
00:46:57,990 --> 00:46:59,458
Why look at me, you lunatic?

869
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,794
Yes.

870
00:47:01,794 --> 00:47:03,162
- Yes?
- Yes.

871
00:47:03,562 --> 00:47:04,697
Don't come near me.

872
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:06,632
If you come, I'm going to kill you.

873
00:47:06,632 --> 00:47:09,035
I'm going to kill you and go to prison.
I mean it.

874
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:11,137
Don't come near me. You crazy bastard.

875
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:12,732
Drink water and grow tall and healthy.

876
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:23,242
This was you, right?

877
00:48:23,843 --> 00:48:24,810
What do you mean?

878
00:48:25,511 --> 00:48:27,913
You're the one who left this
on my desk, right?

879
00:48:30,683 --> 00:48:31,684
I don't know.

880
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:38,357
Joo Ha, when I don't know
the source of things, I...

881
00:48:38,357 --> 00:48:41,360
Fine. It was me.

882
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:44,263
I bought it at a second-hand market.

883
00:48:47,233 --> 00:48:50,403
But I didn't buy one side each.

884
00:48:50,403 --> 00:48:53,072
I bought an unopened new product.

885
00:49:00,279 --> 00:49:02,782
- I appreciate the gesture.
- But why not the gift?

886
00:49:02,782 --> 00:49:04,050
Why not?

887
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:06,852
Just take it.

888
00:49:07,353 --> 00:49:09,822
When I saw you using wired earphones,

889
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:13,092
it seemed like it was my fault,
so I felt bad.

890
00:49:13,092 --> 00:49:14,727
So just take it.

891
00:49:21,367 --> 00:49:23,336
Ga Joo Ha, you.

892
00:49:26,105 --> 00:49:27,039
Here.

893
00:49:27,707 --> 00:49:30,443
This is cilantro-scented jelly.

894
00:49:30,743 --> 00:49:32,912
- Where did you find this?
- It was in the convenience store.

895
00:49:32,912 --> 00:49:33,813
- Really?
- Yes.

896
00:49:33,813 --> 00:49:36,048
Thank you so much.

897
00:49:36,549 --> 00:49:38,117
I'll try it.

898
00:49:41,721 --> 00:49:43,489
- Is it good?
- This is crazy good.

899
00:49:44,223 --> 00:49:46,325
I get why this jelly is hard to find.

900
00:49:48,728 --> 00:49:49,862
It tastes the same.

901
00:49:50,663 --> 00:49:53,766
How about...

902
00:49:53,766 --> 00:49:55,668
sharing earphones
and listening to something?

903
00:49:56,068 --> 00:49:58,471
It may have been cheap
because one side was not working.

904
00:49:59,372 --> 00:50:00,339
What do you think?

905
00:50:03,009 --> 00:50:04,210
- Shall we?
- Shall we?

906
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,345
- Because that happens at times.
- Yes.

907
00:50:08,147 --> 00:50:09,148
Ga Joo Ha.

908
00:50:12,618 --> 00:50:13,619
Thank you.

909
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:20,960
- Can you hear it?
- Yes.

910
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,561
I can hear it, too.

911
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,696
Where is she?

912
00:50:26,999 --> 00:50:28,200
This must be that.

913
00:50:30,403 --> 00:50:31,971
- Is it?
- Yes.

914
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:37,009
I've never seen Joo Ha smile like that.

915
00:50:37,009 --> 00:50:38,644
- No.
- Why not?

916
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:40,780
Why not? Did you buy it for me?

917
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:45,451
I'm so happy.

918
00:50:59,398 --> 00:51:00,299
Ji Won.

919
00:51:00,566 --> 00:51:01,567
Yes?

920
00:51:02,535 --> 00:51:03,903
Do you have feelings for me?

921
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:05,304
Excuse me?

922
00:51:06,472 --> 00:51:07,540
That's the only explanation.

923
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,875
You always call me
and give me something good for my health,

924
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:11,410
and also give me a massage.

925
00:51:12,478 --> 00:51:13,613
That's because...

926
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:15,748
No, don't say it yet.

927
00:51:15,748 --> 00:51:17,850
Do not say it yet.

928
00:51:18,351 --> 00:51:20,920
Because I'm not sure how I feel about you.

929
00:51:21,988 --> 00:51:24,690
And I really don't want things
to get awkward...

930
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:25,992
between you and me.

931
00:51:26,726 --> 00:51:29,462
Boohoo. I'm leaving.

932
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:39,338
Is he insane?

933
00:51:46,646 --> 00:51:47,713
PD Tae Ho.

934
00:51:47,713 --> 00:51:48,781
- Actor Ji.
- Yes?

935
00:51:48,781 --> 00:51:49,849
Do you want me to tell you...

936
00:51:49,849 --> 00:51:52,318
how the MZers take mirror selfies
these days?

937
00:51:52,885 --> 00:51:53,986
Yes, please.

938
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:58,090
Okay. They use the front camera...

939
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:59,892
and hold it against the mirror like this,

940
00:52:02,061 --> 00:52:03,562
and take a picture.

941
00:52:03,562 --> 00:52:05,631
That's a new way. Let me give it a try.

942
00:52:05,631 --> 00:52:06,465
Here.

943
00:52:08,434 --> 00:52:09,335
Like this?

944
00:52:11,137 --> 00:52:13,072
This is fun.

945
00:52:13,072 --> 00:52:14,073
You're good.

946
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,709
This is amazing.

947
00:52:16,709 --> 00:52:17,510
What do you think?

948
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,078
Is there something else you can teach me?

949
00:52:19,078 --> 00:52:20,379
You're good at this.

950
00:52:20,379 --> 00:52:23,916
Popping the flash when you take a selfie
is also popular these days.

951
00:52:23,916 --> 00:52:25,718
You pop the flash
when it's already bright?

952
00:52:25,718 --> 00:52:28,621
They say it makes the picture
look dreamlike.

953
00:52:28,621 --> 00:52:29,855
Do you like dreamlike?

954
00:52:30,156 --> 00:52:32,825
Yes. I seek the dreamlike mood these days.

955
00:52:32,825 --> 00:52:34,360
Same. Let's try it.

956
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,094
Okay.

957
00:52:35,094 --> 00:52:36,796
One, two, three.

958
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,198
That was too bright.

959
00:52:41,167 --> 00:52:42,201
My eyes.

960
00:53:15,468 --> 00:53:17,036
Were you taking a bath again
on a moonlit night...

961
00:53:17,036 --> 00:53:18,604
and going underwater
to increase lung capacity?

962
00:53:18,604 --> 00:53:19,538
No.

963
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:23,109
I was deep in thought
because I think someone has a crush on me.

964
00:53:26,145 --> 00:53:27,046
Silence.

965
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:31,817
Even so, do not give me,
No In Seong, any advice.

966
00:53:31,817 --> 00:53:35,187
- I won't.
- I'm going to do what my heart tells me.

967
00:53:43,896 --> 00:53:45,698
What my heart tells me to do.

968
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,105
(Hanbang Building)

969
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:54,407
(Belated Christmas Party)

970
00:53:54,407 --> 00:53:56,309
The long-awaited...

971
00:53:56,309 --> 00:53:57,910
Silent Christmas...

972
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:59,946
The Headset Party has started.

973
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:02,281
Give a round of applause.

974
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:05,351
Before we enjoy the party in full swing,

975
00:54:05,351 --> 00:54:08,154
we'll guess who our Secret Santas are.

976
00:54:08,821 --> 00:54:11,223
Let's start with Scriptwriter Wang
since she's right next to me.

977
00:54:12,091 --> 00:54:14,193
Who is her Secret Santa?

978
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,630
For me, my Secret Santa kept my secret...

979
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:19,966
that I couldn't reveal to anyone.

980
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,134
My Secret Santa is...

981
00:54:23,002 --> 00:54:24,470
Actor Ji.

982
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:29,575
You're right.

983
00:54:29,575 --> 00:54:30,910
I tried really hard.

984
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:32,311
Thank you, Actor Ji.

985
00:54:32,812 --> 00:54:33,946
My Secret Santa is...

986
00:54:36,015 --> 00:54:36,949
Who is it?

987
00:54:36,949 --> 00:54:39,018
PD Tae Ho.

988
00:54:39,018 --> 00:54:39,952
Am I right?

989
00:54:40,253 --> 00:54:41,520
Yes.

990
00:54:42,188 --> 00:54:43,389
- I'm not sure.
- What?

991
00:54:43,389 --> 00:54:45,491
You weren't doing your job.
Who are you, Secret Santa?

992
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:47,727
How could you not know?

993
00:54:47,727 --> 00:54:49,528
I complimented you so many times.

994
00:54:49,528 --> 00:54:51,497
- Who is it?
- My Secret Santa is...

995
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:52,698
Who is it?

996
00:54:52,698 --> 00:54:54,400
I'll reveal it after 60 seconds.

997
00:54:55,368 --> 00:54:56,702
It's commercial time.

998
00:54:56,702 --> 00:54:58,337
- No In Seong.
- No In Seong.

999
00:54:58,337 --> 00:54:59,472
How did you know?

1000
00:54:59,472 --> 00:55:01,040
It was obvious.

1001
00:55:01,807 --> 00:55:04,277
I have no idea who my Secret Santa is.

1002
00:55:04,844 --> 00:55:06,712
Who are you, Secret Santa?

1003
00:55:06,712 --> 00:55:07,713
Who is it?

1004
00:55:07,713 --> 00:55:09,782
- Were all of us too nice all the time?
- Who is it?

1005
00:55:09,782 --> 00:55:10,783
It's me.

1006
00:55:13,619 --> 00:55:15,221
If I weren't your Secret Santa,

1007
00:55:15,221 --> 00:55:19,225
I wouldn't have been that nice to you,
In Seong. Isn't that obvious?

1008
00:55:19,225 --> 00:55:21,661
Don't get me wrong, okay?

1009
00:55:21,661 --> 00:55:23,663
Okay. I get it.

1010
00:55:23,663 --> 00:55:26,132
But I really don't know
who my Secret Santa is. Who is it?

1011
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:27,833
It's me.

1012
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:32,405
I think my Secret Santa is...

1013
00:55:32,405 --> 00:55:33,272
Who?

1014
00:55:36,409 --> 00:55:38,244
- Who is it?
- Tell us.

1015
00:55:39,645 --> 00:55:41,147
Scriptwriter Joo Ha.

1016
00:55:41,147 --> 00:55:42,214
Is he right?

1017
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:43,249
Yes.

1018
00:55:44,684 --> 00:55:45,851
He guessed right.

1019
00:55:45,851 --> 00:55:47,720
Wait. Then we have two people left now.

1020
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,221
Yes, two people left.

1021
00:55:50,022 --> 00:55:52,191
Between the two, who was nicer to you?

1022
00:55:52,191 --> 00:55:54,727
I think my Secret Santa is...

1023
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:56,629
- Is?
- Scriptwriter Joo's Secret Santa.

1024
00:55:56,629 --> 00:55:58,064
- Scriptwriter Joo's Secret Santa is...
- We know already.

1025
00:56:03,336 --> 00:56:05,471
- PD Min Jae.
- PD Min Jae.

1026
00:56:05,471 --> 00:56:07,540
- What's his answer?
- Were they each other's Santa?

1027
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:09,275
- Were they?
- Is she right?

1028
00:56:09,275 --> 00:56:10,476
I'm not her Secret Santa.

1029
00:56:10,476 --> 00:56:11,410
- Really?
- Yes, you are.

1030
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:12,345
No, I'm not.

1031
00:56:13,346 --> 00:56:14,447
It's me.

1032
00:56:14,947 --> 00:56:16,282
I'm your Secret Santa, Joo Ha.

1033
00:56:17,783 --> 00:56:19,785
Mark.

1034
00:56:20,286 --> 00:56:23,155
Mark has always been nice to me,
that's why.

1035
00:56:23,155 --> 00:56:24,190
I didn't know. Sorry.

1036
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,424
That's what Secret Santas have to be like.

1037
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:26,525
Okay, then.

1038
00:56:26,525 --> 00:56:28,427
Those who couldn't guess
their Secret Santa were me,

1039
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:31,430
Jasmine, Scriptwriter Ga Joo Ha,
and No In Seong.

1040
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:34,834
We have to grant one wish
of our Secret Santas.

1041
00:56:34,834 --> 00:56:38,738
Now, let's start the Silent Disco Party.

1042
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,275
(Let's party.)

1043
00:56:42,275 --> 00:56:44,443
Three, two, one.

1044
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:46,912
Let's start.

1045
00:56:53,386 --> 00:56:56,222
<i>A, B, C, D, E, F</i>

1046
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:16,208
Are you on your own?

1047
00:57:16,208 --> 00:57:17,710
Go away.

1048
00:57:19,178 --> 00:57:20,246
Who did you come with tonight?

1049
00:57:20,246 --> 00:57:21,681
Just get lost.

1050
00:57:21,681 --> 00:57:22,615
Who did you come with tonight?

1051
00:57:22,615 --> 00:57:24,083
Where are you from? Get lost.

1052
00:57:24,884 --> 00:57:26,319
We're two.

1053
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:27,553
Then you two can have fun.

1054
00:57:29,055 --> 00:57:31,290
- Do you know him?
- Yes.

1055
00:57:32,224 --> 00:57:33,292
Freestyle.

1056
00:57:34,193 --> 00:57:37,296
- My arm fell off.
- What are you doing?

1057
00:57:39,966 --> 00:57:40,967
Can you hear the music well?

1058
00:57:42,535 --> 00:57:43,436
Can you hear the music?

1059
00:57:43,436 --> 00:57:44,470
Yes, I can.

1060
00:57:44,971 --> 00:57:46,305
There's something on your forehead.

1061
00:57:47,573 --> 00:57:49,308
- It's gone.
- Is it?

1062
00:57:50,643 --> 00:57:51,777
Would you like something to drink?

1063
00:57:51,777 --> 00:57:53,145
- What?
- Would you like a drink?

1064
00:57:53,646 --> 00:57:57,049
Don't mind how fast I take things,
and just do what you have to do.

1065
00:57:57,049 --> 00:58:00,119
I'm going to do what my heart tells me.

1066
00:58:03,256 --> 00:58:04,991
Don't play with him.

1067
00:58:04,991 --> 00:58:06,892
- Party time.
- Have fun with me.

1068
00:58:10,129 --> 00:58:13,432
You always have a smile on your face.

1069
00:58:13,432 --> 00:58:14,734
Are you smiling?

1070
00:58:14,734 --> 00:58:15,835
What's that?

1071
00:58:16,135 --> 00:58:17,069
What?

1072
00:58:20,273 --> 00:58:21,107
What's this?

1073
00:58:26,412 --> 00:58:27,413
Joo Ha.

1074
00:58:27,413 --> 00:58:28,381
Yes?

1075
00:58:32,585 --> 00:58:34,253
What's going on? What's this?

1076
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,490
The music stopped.
Am I the only one who can't hear anything?

1077
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:38,624
I like you.

1078
00:58:38,624 --> 00:58:40,359
- Hey, you...
- This isn't a skit.

1079
00:58:41,427 --> 00:58:42,328
I mean it.

1080
00:58:59,645 --> 00:59:00,746
I love you, Ga Joo Ha.

1081
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:05,651
Joo Ha.

1082
00:59:06,218 --> 00:59:07,053
What?

1083
00:59:07,053 --> 00:59:09,322
Shit. Why can't I hear the music?

1084
00:59:09,322 --> 00:59:10,690
The music stopped, didn't it, everyone?

1085
00:59:12,391 --> 00:59:15,962

00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:19,832
<i>A, B, C, D, E, F, G</i>

1087
00:59:32,612 --> 00:59:33,713
Mark, I...

1088
00:59:33,713 --> 00:59:35,548
It's okay. Just say it.

1089
00:59:37,283 --> 00:59:38,184
Mark.

1090
00:59:40,286 --> 00:59:41,187
I...

1091
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,349
(KICKKICKKICKKICK)

1092
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:45,184
So, nobody was in the office?

1093
01:00:45,184 --> 01:00:46,118
I'm sure it was a ghost.

1094
01:00:46,118 --> 01:00:48,187
Let's start the exorcism.

1095
01:00:48,187 --> 01:00:50,389
When I see you,
my heart strangely pounds hard.

1096
01:00:50,389 --> 01:00:51,223
Didn't you know, Scriptwriter Joo Ha?

1097
01:00:51,223 --> 01:00:52,825
It seemed his flight was today.

1098
01:00:52,825 --> 01:00:54,126
I thought hard about it.

1099
01:00:54,126 --> 01:00:55,127
Bury the memory in your heart,

1100
01:00:55,127 --> 01:00:56,696
and move on
from the plane that already left.

1101
01:00:56,696 --> 01:00:58,397
Of course, I can't wait to see you, too.

1102
01:00:58,397 --> 01:00:59,599
Felix's Big Size?

1103
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:00,566
Hold hands?

1104
01:01:00,566 --> 01:01:02,535
Scriptwriter Wang was MelanCholyCallme?

1105
01:01:02,535 --> 01:01:04,337
- What's your name?
- Kang Tae Ho.

1106
01:01:04,337 --> 01:01:05,471
What do you think you're doing?

1107
01:01:05,471 --> 01:01:07,039
We've reached three million subscribers.

1108
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:08,407
You two have to shoot
a nude photoshoot together.

1109
01:01:08,407 --> 01:01:09,575
Let's work out.

1110
01:01:09,575 --> 01:01:11,544
He was unexpectedly muscular.

1111
01:01:11,544 --> 01:01:12,578
It's not like any of you
have seen my body.

1112
01:01:12,578 --> 01:01:15,448
I'll be the star of the nude photoshoot.

1113
01:01:18,818 --> 01:01:20,818
