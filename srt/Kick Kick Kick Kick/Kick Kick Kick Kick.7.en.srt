(All characters, organizations,)

2
00:00:01,148 --> 00:00:02,583
(and events in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:02,583 --> 00:00:03,984
(Broadcasting guidelines were followed
during the shooting of animals.)

4
00:00:13,527 --> 00:00:14,795
- Bear.
- Bear.

5
00:00:20,768 --> 00:00:22,203
- It's gone.
- It's gone.

6
00:00:24,605 --> 00:00:26,540
I'm alive. We're alive.

7
00:00:42,323 --> 00:00:44,492
(Episode 7)

8
00:00:48,462 --> 00:00:49,363
- Excuse me.
- PD Kang.

9
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:51,832
- Let me...
- Let me say this first.

10
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,536
PD Kang, you don't really believe
that it was my first time, do you?

11
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,371
That wasn't my first time.

12
00:00:57,371 --> 00:00:58,706
It was just me talking
while I was drunk.

13
00:00:58,706 --> 00:01:01,342
There's no way I lack dating experience
when I'm this old.

14
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,480
To be honest,
I've had too much experience.

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,681
I was a delinquent.

16
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:09,683
So don't be old-fashioned
thinking you have to take responsibility.

17
00:01:09,683 --> 00:01:11,919
That would be so uncool.

18
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:14,722
So keep working towards becoming financially
independent and retiring early.

19
00:01:14,722 --> 00:01:16,090
Good luck.

20
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,425
I drank too much, so I'm sleepy.

21
00:01:52,293 --> 00:01:53,527
I haven't felt this for a long time.

22
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:11,612
In the raging blizzard...

23
00:02:14,148 --> 00:02:16,217
In the raging blizzard in the snowy field,

24
00:02:17,284 --> 00:02:19,620
the Northern Duke and Wang Yeo Joo
managed to get in a cabin...

25
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,355
to avoid the pack of beowolves.

26
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,425
They take off their wet clothes
and stoke a furnace,

27
00:02:24,425 --> 00:02:25,526
but it's still cold.

28
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:28,662
The Northern Duke's back full of scars
is exposed,

29
00:02:28,662 --> 00:02:31,699
and Wang Yeo Joo
involuntarily strokes the scars.

30
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:34,068
"It must've hurt a lot."

31
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:36,403
"It doesn't anymore."

32
00:02:37,404 --> 00:02:38,839
The two drink wine.

33
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:40,274
There's heat in the air.

34
00:02:40,274 --> 00:02:42,510
Their eyes meet and they stare intently.

35
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,410
Just then,

36
00:02:44,245 --> 00:02:47,047
the Northern Duke's big eyes
welled up in tears.

37
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:50,818
I cannot die like this.

38
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:54,188
I'm still a virgin.

39
00:02:55,156 --> 00:02:57,658
His tearful confession...

40
00:02:57,658 --> 00:03:00,995
makes Wang Yeo Joo pull him into her arms
and kiss him passionately.

41
00:03:11,705 --> 00:03:12,706
Sexy.

42
00:03:12,706 --> 00:03:16,777
(Episode 7-1
Uncool Chemistry)

43
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:19,613
Have you seen?

44
00:03:19,613 --> 00:03:21,649
"Actor Ji's 'Let's Make Aglio e Olio'"...

45
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:22,950
already hit over 500,000 views.

46
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,852
- What do you think you're doing?
- Don't move.

47
00:03:24,852 --> 00:03:26,620
(The best apron hug of 2024)

48
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,389
(Bromance of the older generation)

49
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:30,157
(I'm shipping them.)

50
00:03:30,157 --> 00:03:31,959
(The rediscovery of Actor Ji)

51
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:33,828
(Middle-aged men are the best.)

52
00:03:33,828 --> 00:03:35,663
(So when's the nude photoshoot?)

53
00:03:35,663 --> 00:03:37,631
(I want to see the JiCho photoshoot.)

54
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:39,633
(I want a music video
like "Please Don't...")

55
00:03:40,935 --> 00:03:42,903
Why did you play this in slow motion?

56
00:03:43,771 --> 00:03:45,272
This is disgusting.

57
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:46,674
I can't even look at it.

58
00:03:46,674 --> 00:03:49,009
You guys know
that was manipulative editing, right?

59
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:50,611
CEO Ji couldn't do anything,

60
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:52,413
so I had to help him out with everything,
and...

61
00:03:52,413 --> 00:03:53,314
Thanks to that,

62
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:56,717
"Actor Ji's 'Let's Make Aglio e Olio'"
got so many views.

63
00:03:56,717 --> 00:03:59,086
And the number of subscribers
of KICKKICKKICKKICK increased by 50,000.

64
00:03:59,086 --> 00:04:01,322
- Fifty thousand.
- Fifty thousand.

65
00:04:01,322 --> 00:04:04,558
I expected 50,000.

66
00:04:04,558 --> 00:04:07,161
That's why I did what I did.

67
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:11,465
Actor Ji, they said your video of making
al dente Aglio e Olio was really helpful.

68
00:04:11,465 --> 00:04:14,535
"Gentle Actor Ji pronouncing it
'Aglio Aglio' is hilarious."

69
00:04:14,535 --> 00:04:15,503
Aglio Aglio.

70
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,240
"The therapeutic content
'Actor Ji's "Let's Make It."'"

71
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,741
"I can't wait for the next video."

72
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:25,112
So I was wondering about the next item
for "Actor Ji's 'Let's Make It'" and...

73
00:04:25,112 --> 00:04:26,747
Hello? Yes.

74
00:04:26,747 --> 00:04:28,782
No In Seong, what are you doing
in the middle of a meeting?

75
00:04:28,782 --> 00:04:30,251
Be quiet. Yes.

76
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:32,119
Of course, we should do it.

77
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:33,187
Do what?

78
00:04:33,187 --> 00:04:36,056
Actor Ji and CEO Cho will also love it.

79
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:37,258
Yes, please contact us.

80
00:04:37,258 --> 00:04:39,693
Who do you think you are
to say we're doing something...

81
00:04:39,693 --> 00:04:40,828
- Exactly.
- Be quiet.

82
00:04:40,828 --> 00:04:43,797
We got an offer from Kissmopolitan...

83
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:46,000
about a couple photoshoot of our CEOs.

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,967
What?

85
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:49,570
A Kissmopolitan couple photoshoot?

86
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,704
Unbelievable.

87
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:54,041
The YouTube shorts
of the hug went viral, indeed.

88
00:04:54,608 --> 00:04:56,811
This is a photoshoot after ten years.

89
00:04:56,811 --> 00:05:00,648
You never got to do a photoshoot
even when you were popular, did you?

90
00:05:00,648 --> 00:05:01,916
No, of course not.

91
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,484
I was inundated with those offers.

92
00:05:03,984 --> 00:05:06,453
But I refused all of them.

93
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:08,856
I refused those kinds of offers
every single day.

94
00:05:08,856 --> 00:05:10,090
That's why he's never done it.

95
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,525
Then are you refusing it again this time?

96
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:13,694
You have no commercial morality at all.

97
00:05:13,694 --> 00:05:16,897
No In Seong said yes already.

98
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:19,567
If I say no now,
what will they think of Kickickickick?

99
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:22,536
Then how about occasionally shooting
a video during the photoshoot...

100
00:05:22,536 --> 00:05:24,271
and uploading it for "LUIC?"

101
00:05:24,271 --> 00:05:25,139
That's a good idea.

102
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,208
Scriptwriter Ga,
how are you so smart?

103
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:30,444
What was that sound?

104
00:05:30,678 --> 00:05:31,612
([Northern Duke Felix's...] New Comment)

105
00:05:31,612 --> 00:05:34,782
That was such a great idea.

106
00:05:34,782 --> 00:05:36,250
You're a genius.

107
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,519
(This is like my heaven of dopamine.)

108
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:41,121
(Excuse me, please open the door!
I'm not here to hurt you!)

109
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:43,624
(The Northern Duke's
first intercourse is precious.)

110
00:05:43,624 --> 00:05:45,693
Then let's arrange that.

111
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:53,367
The recording is finished.
We only have mixing and mastering left.

112
00:05:54,235 --> 00:05:57,204
With our KICKKICKKICKKICK Song,
how about using it in different areas...

113
00:05:57,204 --> 00:05:59,807
not only for the background music?

114
00:05:59,807 --> 00:06:01,075
- Nice.
- Nice.

115
00:06:01,075 --> 00:06:03,010
I've thought about that.

116
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,946
A live clip and a challenge video
which is popular these days.

117
00:06:05,946 --> 00:06:07,815
I think it would be great if we shot them.

118
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:09,283
- A challenge video sounds nice.
- Great.

119
00:06:09,283 --> 00:06:12,486
The three MZers can take responsibility...

120
00:06:12,486 --> 00:06:14,722
to make the Kickickickick Song.

121
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:15,456
Okay.

122
00:06:15,456 --> 00:06:17,725
- Today's meeting is over.
- Over.

123
00:06:17,725 --> 00:06:20,227
Aglio Aglio.

124
00:06:25,366 --> 00:06:27,835
(The Northern Duke and Wang Yeo Joo
left the cabin...)

125
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:29,236
(to the Grand Duke's residence...)

126
00:06:32,173 --> 00:06:33,774
This is not it.

127
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:43,918
Darn it.

128
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:46,687
Goodness.

129
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:50,057
Why did my inspiration disappear so fast?

130
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,561
What's wrong, MelanCholyCallme?

131
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:56,764
I thought you overcame the slump.

132
00:06:56,764 --> 00:07:00,467
The episode you uploaded yesterday
clearly showed you were awakened.

133
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:02,837
Yes, I have awakened..

134
00:07:02,837 --> 00:07:04,738
Because I experienced it.

135
00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:07,775
Goodness. Congratulations. Good for you.

136
00:07:08,242 --> 00:07:10,044
But that experience point.

137
00:07:10,044 --> 00:07:12,112
I used it up in the previous episode.

138
00:07:13,981 --> 00:07:17,451
Then gain more experience points again
and level up.

139
00:07:18,085 --> 00:07:20,821
But I pushed him away already.

140
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,092
Just like Wang Yeo Joo?

141
00:07:25,092 --> 00:07:26,794
Act innocent, sexy, and cute.

142
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:30,097
These three even made
the cold Northern Duke fall in love.

143
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:45,112
(Hanbang Building)

144
00:08:17,645 --> 00:08:21,582
<i>If you like me</i>

145
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,751
Scriptwriter Wang.

146
00:08:24,385 --> 00:08:26,720
Did looking innocent work?

147
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,357
Yes?

148
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,194
Can you give me one of these baguettes?

149
00:08:33,194 --> 00:08:34,562
I haven't eaten brunch yet, that's why.

150
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,035
You surprised me.

151
00:08:44,305 --> 00:08:45,206
What are you doing?

152
00:08:45,906 --> 00:08:46,841
What do you think?

153
00:08:47,475 --> 00:08:48,742
This is a sexy attack.

154
00:08:54,815 --> 00:08:56,050
Guess.

155
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,552
I don't know what you're doing,

156
00:08:58,552 --> 00:08:59,453
but it's scary.

157
00:09:03,724 --> 00:09:04,925
What is?

158
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:06,060
Everything is scary.

159
00:09:13,968 --> 00:09:18,105
I worked hard on making this,
so check it out.

160
00:09:18,105 --> 00:09:18,973
Okay.

161
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:42,630
What do you think?

162
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:47,668
The KICKKICKKICKKICK Challenge...

163
00:09:47,668 --> 00:09:49,603
should be easy to follow and catchy.

164
00:09:49,603 --> 00:09:51,772
But your dance was too hard.

165
00:09:51,772 --> 00:09:52,873
Yes.

166
00:09:52,873 --> 00:09:55,009
- Do you agree?
- A bit.

167
00:09:55,576 --> 00:09:56,343
Fine.

168
00:09:58,345 --> 00:10:01,582
How about an easy arm wave to start?

169
00:10:01,582 --> 00:10:02,616
An arm wave?

170
00:10:03,217 --> 00:10:04,118
An arm wave?

171
00:10:04,118 --> 00:10:06,987
No. An arm wave is also hard
for people like me.

172
00:10:06,987 --> 00:10:09,723
There are places where people shoot
challenge videos a lot these days.

173
00:10:09,723 --> 00:10:11,625
How about making a survey
of those places such as a square?

174
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,294
Good idea.

175
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:15,362
Min Jae, you're coming with us, right?

176
00:10:15,362 --> 00:10:18,499
- No, I have a lot of work.
- Let's go.

177
00:10:19,466 --> 00:10:20,734
This is no joke.

178
00:10:20,734 --> 00:10:22,837
You're being tacky.
Is this your first time?

179
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:25,372
I've gotten many offers.

180
00:10:25,372 --> 00:10:27,441
- It's your first time, isn't it?
- Yes.

181
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:32,012
The shoot today will be
a photoshoot and a brief interview.

182
00:10:32,012 --> 00:10:33,848
It will take about three hours.

183
00:10:33,848 --> 00:10:36,650
Photographer Hong Seok Cheon
will be your photographer.

184
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,553
Who's calling my name?

185
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:42,523
Long time no see.

186
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:45,392
Photographer Hong, how have you been?

187
00:10:45,392 --> 00:10:46,627
Not so great.

188
00:10:46,627 --> 00:10:48,395
Really? Why not?

189
00:10:48,395 --> 00:10:51,198
Because I couldn't see your handsome face.

190
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:54,268
You haven't changed, Photographer Hong.

191
00:10:54,268 --> 00:10:56,504
We should always be consistent.

192
00:10:56,504 --> 00:10:58,372
He must be that man.

193
00:10:58,372 --> 00:10:59,607
Hello.

194
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:03,177
I'm CEO Cho Young Sik,
also known as PD Cho, of Kickickickick.

195
00:11:03,177 --> 00:11:05,412
Nice to meet you.

196
00:11:05,412 --> 00:11:08,516
PD Cho? I see.

197
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,652
Honey, this concept is amazing.

198
00:11:11,652 --> 00:11:13,087
Great. Tell me.

199
00:11:13,087 --> 00:11:16,090
As you know,
it's "bromance between middle-aged men."

200
00:11:17,391 --> 00:11:19,093
- What?
- Bromance?

201
00:11:19,093 --> 00:11:21,362
Yes, bromance between two middle-aged men.

202
00:11:21,362 --> 00:11:24,165
When I saw that video of you two
of the apron hug,

203
00:11:24,165 --> 00:11:26,267
I got this inspiration.

204
00:11:26,267 --> 00:11:28,502
"Tell Me By Your Name."

205
00:11:28,502 --> 00:11:30,404
If we make an homage to this movie
for the photoshoot,

206
00:11:30,404 --> 00:11:32,106
it'll hit the jackpot.

207
00:11:32,106 --> 00:11:36,210
Then when you mentioned the Italian movie,
did you mean this kind of concept?

208
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,245
That face and that way of talking.

209
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:41,549
You look like you have complaints.

210
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:42,683
- This...
- No way.

211
00:11:42,683 --> 00:11:45,252
It's CEO Cho's first time,
so he must be nervous.

212
00:11:45,252 --> 00:11:46,821
This will help KICKKICKKICKKICK.

213
00:11:48,455 --> 00:11:50,224
And you are?

214
00:11:50,224 --> 00:11:53,160
I'm an indispensable employee
of KICKKICKKICKKICK.

215
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,595
I'm No In Seong in charge of trivial work.

216
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:57,865
I'm the manager of these two today
and in charge of shooting.

217
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:01,402
Goodness, how dirty.

218
00:12:01,402 --> 00:12:04,271
Anybody there? Someone get rid of that.

219
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:06,740
He's hindering my artistic sensibility.

220
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,042
Don't take pictures.

221
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:09,276
- What?
- Get out.

222
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:10,778
Why do I have to get out?

223
00:12:11,312 --> 00:12:12,847
They need me.

224
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:14,582
But I raised both of you
and helped you out.

225
00:12:14,582 --> 00:12:16,450
Hong, we're not shooting
in this concept, are we?

226
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,753
Yes, you are.
Don't you know what bromance is?

227
00:12:19,753 --> 00:12:21,422
Do I have to take off my shirt?

228
00:12:21,422 --> 00:12:23,023
You two even have to kiss.

229
00:12:23,023 --> 00:12:24,525
- Kiss?
- Yes.

230
00:12:24,525 --> 00:12:25,593
Kiss?

231
00:12:27,261 --> 00:12:29,263
Yes. Good.

232
00:12:29,263 --> 00:12:31,131
Okay. Paddle now.

233
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,934
That's too wild.

234
00:12:33,934 --> 00:12:35,169
You're getting water on me.

235
00:12:35,169 --> 00:12:36,437
Good.

236
00:12:36,437 --> 00:12:38,572
But you two look so awkward.

237
00:12:38,572 --> 00:12:41,308
Sit closer together. Come on.

238
00:12:41,308 --> 00:12:43,611
Don't look too uncomfortable. Sit closer.

239
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:44,979
Don't get too close.

240
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:47,781
PD Cho, this is business. Wake up.

241
00:12:47,781 --> 00:12:49,550
I know what this is, Mr. Ji Jin Hee.

242
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,552
- We have to get this over with.
- I know that.

243
00:12:51,552 --> 00:12:53,954
This time, Actor Ji,

244
00:12:53,954 --> 00:12:57,291
gaze at PD Cho with a sexy look.

245
00:12:57,291 --> 00:13:00,027
- Excuse me?
- A sexy look. Okay?

246
00:13:00,561 --> 00:13:02,396
You can do it.

247
00:13:02,396 --> 00:13:06,133
Go. Sexy look.

248
00:13:07,368 --> 00:13:09,003
Good.

249
00:13:11,872 --> 00:13:14,408
- Go closer to his neck. Sexy look.
- Don't touch me.

250
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:15,910
Don't be shy, PD Cho.

251
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,778
Breathe out.

252
00:13:17,778 --> 00:13:19,980
- PD Cho.
- Why whisper in my ear?

253
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,615
- Just sit still.
- In my ear...

254
00:13:21,615 --> 00:13:22,650
PD Cho.

255
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:24,618
Okay. Now blow on his ear.

256
00:13:25,186 --> 00:13:27,321
Last shot. Blow one more time.

257
00:13:27,721 --> 00:13:28,556
PD Cho.

258
00:13:28,556 --> 00:13:30,491
Good. There.

259
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:31,992
Wait, let's see.

260
00:13:34,261 --> 00:13:36,764
A shy 18-year-old boy...

261
00:13:36,764 --> 00:13:39,266
shows his smile of first love.

262
00:13:40,568 --> 00:13:41,936
Eighteen-year-old...

263
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:43,971
- Let's go.
- Eighteen?

264
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,109
Say "Dream of me" like Sung Mo.

265
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,047
Good.

266
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:54,849
"Dream of me." Great.

267
00:13:54,849 --> 00:13:55,683
Go away.

268
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,285
What was that?

269
00:13:58,285 --> 00:13:59,487
Don't push me.

270
00:14:10,731 --> 00:14:12,867
- You punk.
- Darn it.

271
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:15,202
You're always causing trouble.

272
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,838
- My goodness.
- I can't even.

273
00:14:17,838 --> 00:14:20,040
Look at those sexy middle-aged men.

274
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,043
Wait a minute. Stand right there.

275
00:14:23,043 --> 00:14:26,347
Slick your hair back like this.
All the way back.

276
00:14:26,347 --> 00:14:29,116
- All the way?
- Yes. Good.

277
00:14:29,116 --> 00:14:31,385
This scent of men. This is it.

278
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,298
- This is cute.
- Yes.

279
00:14:47,535 --> 00:14:49,236
They also look cool.

280
00:14:50,471 --> 00:14:52,239
But isn't this hip-hop?

281
00:14:54,675 --> 00:14:56,343
I think this will be hard
for us to follow.

282
00:14:57,344 --> 00:14:58,379
Wait.

283
00:15:00,781 --> 00:15:02,116
We know that song.

284
00:15:02,116 --> 00:15:03,017
I know this song.

285
00:15:03,017 --> 00:15:04,652
- Let's join them and dance.
- What?

286
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:10,724
Shiba, look. I'm going to dance.

287
00:16:16,123 --> 00:16:17,091
Lee Min Jae.

288
00:16:17,658 --> 00:16:20,327
You're Lee Min Jae, the guy who entered
our university at the top of the class.

289
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:22,263
We've never met since you took time off,
have we?

290
00:16:22,263 --> 00:16:23,097
No.

291
00:16:23,097 --> 00:16:26,066
Aren't you returning this semester?
Gyu Ri returned.

292
00:16:27,902 --> 00:16:29,003
I see.

293
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,138
So it seems you two broke up for good.

294
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:33,941
Do you remember Gyeong Hwan?

295
00:16:33,941 --> 00:16:35,810
Just like you,
he fainted when he saw blood.

296
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,546
He had vasovagal syncope.

297
00:16:38,546 --> 00:16:41,081
He got a treatment and he's taking
the surgical residency examination.

298
00:16:41,081 --> 00:16:43,584
Is that so?

299
00:16:44,251 --> 00:16:45,386
Shiba.

300
00:16:45,786 --> 00:16:47,521
- Min Jae.
- Shiba.

301
00:16:47,521 --> 00:16:49,990
They're calling me. I have to go.

302
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,092
- I'll see you later.
- See you.

303
00:16:53,027 --> 00:16:54,595
- Come here.
- Let's dance together.

304
00:17:00,935 --> 00:17:03,537
We have two men
who are the talk of the town.

305
00:17:03,537 --> 00:17:05,005
Please introduce yourselves.

306
00:17:05,005 --> 00:17:06,073
Okay.

307
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,111
Hello. I'm the CEO of KICKKICKKICKKICK...

308
00:17:11,111 --> 00:17:14,482
and your forever actor, Ji Jin Hee.

309
00:17:17,885 --> 00:17:20,054
Hello.

310
00:17:20,054 --> 00:17:22,389
I'm the other CEO of Kickickickick...

311
00:17:23,324 --> 00:17:26,527
and your popular producer, PD Cho.

312
00:17:29,997 --> 00:17:33,033
Did you know the apron hug
would get this must attention?

313
00:17:35,936 --> 00:17:36,904
Not at all.

314
00:17:36,904 --> 00:17:38,973
I had no idea.

315
00:17:38,973 --> 00:17:40,841
But thanks to that,

316
00:17:41,108 --> 00:17:44,512
I got to do a couple photoshoot
with CEO Cho, so it's great.

317
00:17:44,512 --> 00:17:49,083
Same. When would I get a chance
to do a couple photoshoot...

318
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,719
with the great actor Ji Jin Hee?

319
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:53,954
You two are so considerate of each other.

320
00:17:53,954 --> 00:17:56,257
How sweet.

321
00:17:56,257 --> 00:17:58,859
There's something
Kissmos are curious about.

322
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:01,328
Please pick the questions in the box
one by one.

323
00:18:01,328 --> 00:18:02,930
Who wants to go first?

324
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,398
Of course, me.

325
00:18:05,466 --> 00:18:07,268
I put my hand in first.

326
00:18:07,268 --> 00:18:08,402
Get your hand off.

327
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:13,407
Just take this instead.

328
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,686
(Youngto Ming Arcade)

329
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:28,823
Joo Ha.

330
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:31,158
Our KICKKICKKICKKICK Song
feels like an arcade.

331
00:18:31,158 --> 00:18:33,227
So how about getting inspiration
from an arcade?

332
00:18:34,128 --> 00:18:35,629
- Great.
- Great.

333
00:18:35,629 --> 00:18:36,697
Let's go to an arcade.

334
00:18:36,697 --> 00:18:37,865
Joo Ha, how about playing Bubble Bobble?

335
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,267
Go!

336
00:18:44,738 --> 00:18:46,173
Darn it.

337
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,944
This is a famous picture
that you uploaded ten years ago, Actor Ji.

338
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:53,247
We got the original picture
and spotted something very interesting.

339
00:18:53,247 --> 00:18:55,483
Please zoom in on the bottom right.

340
00:18:55,483 --> 00:18:57,751
Zoom in.

341
00:18:57,751 --> 00:19:00,387
Why was CEO Cho cropped out?

342
00:19:00,955 --> 00:19:01,922
That.

343
00:19:01,922 --> 00:19:04,825
This was before "Three Dishes a Day."

344
00:19:04,825 --> 00:19:07,328
So PD Cho was not a celebrity.

345
00:19:07,328 --> 00:19:08,762
- So you were being considerate.
- Yes.

346
00:19:08,762 --> 00:19:11,632
But what on earth happened that day
with these four people?

347
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:16,070
Well...

348
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:18,472
At the time...

349
00:19:20,074 --> 00:19:23,777
Actor Ji was going fishing in a valley
with his close friends...

350
00:19:23,777 --> 00:19:25,746
and he called me to join him.

351
00:19:25,746 --> 00:19:28,082
But it was pouring that day.

352
00:19:28,082 --> 00:19:31,986
So we slept in a private house, didn't we?

353
00:19:32,786 --> 00:19:37,358
PD Cho was plastered that day
and just lying on the floor.

354
00:19:37,358 --> 00:19:39,693
I was the youngest there.

355
00:19:39,693 --> 00:19:42,997
So the older friends kept pouring me
a drink.

356
00:19:42,997 --> 00:19:43,998
Goodness.

357
00:19:43,998 --> 00:19:45,699
Look at this.

358
00:19:45,699 --> 00:19:47,735
- Do you see that on your face?
- Yes.

359
00:19:47,735 --> 00:19:49,036
Seung Woo did that.

360
00:19:49,336 --> 00:19:50,471
Wasn't it Jung Min?

361
00:19:50,471 --> 00:19:52,173
No, it was Seung Woo. Didn't you know?

362
00:19:52,173 --> 00:19:55,009
I thought it was Jung Min
until seconds ago.

363
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:57,011
Those guys.

364
00:19:57,011 --> 00:19:59,180
This is what they're like.

365
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,282
And the next day,

366
00:20:01,282 --> 00:20:04,285
we threw up and drank again.

367
00:20:04,285 --> 00:20:05,820
And we went fishing again, right?

368
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,788
We went fishing again
when it was still raining.

369
00:20:07,788 --> 00:20:10,524
So we got soaked and took shelter again.

370
00:20:10,524 --> 00:20:13,794
We were isolated again and had to stay
in a private for another night.

371
00:20:13,794 --> 00:20:15,095
And they made me drink again.

372
00:20:17,832 --> 00:20:20,067
We were young then, weren't we?

373
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:22,837
Everything we did
made us energetic and cheerful, right?

374
00:20:22,837 --> 00:20:23,938
Right.

375
00:20:23,938 --> 00:20:26,307
- We were young.
- Yes.

376
00:20:31,912 --> 00:20:35,049
Had it not been for Actor Ji that day,

377
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:38,385
I would have gone down to the shades.

378
00:20:38,385 --> 00:20:40,654
What do you mean?

379
00:20:40,654 --> 00:20:42,323
We were going to go back home...

380
00:20:42,323 --> 00:20:44,492
when it started pouring again.

381
00:20:44,492 --> 00:20:45,960
We were crossing the valley...

382
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,629
but I got swept away in the rapids.

383
00:20:48,629 --> 00:20:50,331
I almost died.

384
00:20:50,331 --> 00:20:54,502
But as you know,
Actor Ji was in the special forces unit.

385
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:57,771
So he got in the water right away
and saved my life.

386
00:20:57,771 --> 00:21:01,008
Things almost got serious.

387
00:21:01,008 --> 00:21:04,712
You crashed into a rock
and badly hurt your back.

388
00:21:04,712 --> 00:21:05,746
Are you okay now?

389
00:21:05,746 --> 00:21:08,649
I'm fine. That was ten years ago.

390
00:21:09,783 --> 00:21:12,052
You're what matters, not my side.

391
00:21:12,052 --> 00:21:13,287
I'm fine.

392
00:21:20,261 --> 00:21:22,096
Nice.

393
00:21:23,964 --> 00:21:26,467
Should I take a bath here every day?

394
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:30,871
The more I see Scriptwriter Wang,
the stranger she...

395
00:21:30,871 --> 00:21:31,872
Zoom.

396
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,974
You're here.

397
00:21:35,042 --> 00:21:37,645
It's the perfect temperature
for a foot bath.

398
00:21:37,645 --> 00:21:38,579
Come.

399
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:40,047
Is it?

400
00:21:41,682 --> 00:21:43,551
All I have left now is acting cute.

401
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:46,020
This is the perfect time.

402
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,954
Come.

403
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:51,959
Nice.

404
00:21:54,161 --> 00:21:56,931
It's hot.

405
00:21:57,865 --> 00:21:58,799
What?

406
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,868
I should try this a bit more.

407
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,307
The water is too hot,

408
00:22:06,307 --> 00:22:09,477
so Scriptwriter Wang's toes are
all curled up. Boohoo.

409
00:22:09,477 --> 00:22:10,478
Curled up?

410
00:22:11,345 --> 00:22:13,747
Scriptwriter Wang,
you're showing regressive behavior.

411
00:22:13,747 --> 00:22:16,150
You hurt your head earlier
when you fell, didn't you?

412
00:22:17,017 --> 00:22:19,186
What? Regressive behavior?

413
00:22:19,787 --> 00:22:21,055
I'm perfectly fine.

414
00:22:22,456 --> 00:22:23,290
Boo you.

415
00:22:25,459 --> 00:22:26,327
Bye.

416
00:22:28,462 --> 00:22:29,563
Seriously?

417
00:22:30,164 --> 00:22:32,233
Didn't she say it was too hot?

418
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,769
What's wrong with her today?

419
00:22:37,438 --> 00:22:38,606
I can't get her off my mind.

420
00:22:40,674 --> 00:22:43,544
It was your first time doing a photoshoot,
but you were not bad.

421
00:22:43,544 --> 00:22:45,713
You were not bad yourself, either.

422
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,317
Let's go fishing someday
when we have free time.

423
00:22:50,317 --> 00:22:51,619
You used to like fishing.

424
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:54,655
Okay. Choose a day that's not rainy.

425
00:22:54,655 --> 00:22:56,891
- Okay.
- Right. Is your side okay?

426
00:22:56,891 --> 00:22:58,993
I'm perfectly fine. What are you doing?

427
00:22:58,993 --> 00:23:00,094
Don't be like that. Let me see.

428
00:23:00,094 --> 00:23:01,762
- I said I'm fine.
- Let me see it.

429
00:23:01,762 --> 00:23:03,130
- I said I'm fine.
- So let me see it.

430
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,865
Let go of me.

431
00:23:04,865 --> 00:23:07,468
You shouldn't have kept moving around.

432
00:23:07,468 --> 00:23:09,170
- My goodness.
- What are you doing?

433
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,971
No. This is not what you think.

434
00:23:10,971 --> 00:23:11,972
My gosh. It's okay.

435
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:14,608
What do you think you're doing?

436
00:23:14,608 --> 00:23:17,511
We were getting changed,
and I wanted to see his scar.

437
00:23:17,511 --> 00:23:19,713
- This scar right here.
- Why are you two looking at us like that?

438
00:23:19,713 --> 00:23:21,849
I was just trying to see his scar.

439
00:23:22,316 --> 00:23:26,420
Thank you for the photoshoot
and the sincere stories.

440
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,689
Thank you.

441
00:23:28,689 --> 00:23:30,224
Your true love relationship.

442
00:23:30,224 --> 00:23:31,192
Excuse me?

443
00:23:31,192 --> 00:23:34,128
I mean, your partnership.
I'll make that widely known.

444
00:23:34,128 --> 00:23:37,398
Can you please face the camera
and show us a heart like this?

445
00:23:38,098 --> 00:23:39,700
- Face the camera?
- This one?

446
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,634
Yes.

447
00:23:40,634 --> 00:23:42,203
One, two, three.

448
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,271
One, two, three.

449
00:23:44,972 --> 00:23:46,807
One, two, three.

450
00:23:46,807 --> 00:23:49,243
- What's wrong with you?
- We are not in sync at all.

451
00:23:49,243 --> 00:23:50,978
You should go from the big heart
to the small heart.

452
00:23:50,978 --> 00:23:52,413
No, you should go
from the small heart to the big heart.

453
00:23:52,413 --> 00:23:53,781
Please just edit those parts so we match.

454
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:55,950
- I think that was enough.
- Please show us one more.

455
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,686
One, two, three.

456
00:23:59,753 --> 00:24:01,889
Great.

457
00:24:08,062 --> 00:24:09,296
Regressive behavior?

458
00:24:18,205 --> 00:24:19,607
(Mellanghanatic)

459
00:24:22,743 --> 00:24:25,412
MelanCholyCallme, did you succeed?

460
00:24:26,413 --> 00:24:28,382
It was a crushing defeat.

461
00:24:28,382 --> 00:24:31,986
Unlike Wang Yeo Joo,
there's no leveling up in my life.

462
00:24:32,753 --> 00:24:34,655
You can't give up already.

463
00:24:34,655 --> 00:24:36,724
There's the last resort.

464
00:24:36,724 --> 00:24:38,259
From the old days,

465
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:42,062
men have been sensitive
of the sound, smell, and view of that day.

466
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:48,435
Watch me now.

467
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:55,776
Why would she tell me to come
to the camper van this late?

468
00:25:00,481 --> 00:25:03,317
Why are you sitting there like that?

469
00:25:04,685 --> 00:25:06,253
I wanted to eat sushi with you.

470
00:25:07,321 --> 00:25:08,289
Sushi?

471
00:25:09,657 --> 00:25:10,524
Nice.

472
00:25:11,492 --> 00:25:12,426
This is...

473
00:25:14,261 --> 00:25:15,229
Wait.

474
00:25:16,096 --> 00:25:17,998
This sushi rings a bell.

475
00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:20,034
This looks appetizing.

476
00:25:20,034 --> 00:25:22,336
- Take this, too.
- Thanks.

477
00:25:25,372 --> 00:25:28,209
I've tasted this drink somewhere.

478
00:25:29,043 --> 00:25:30,144
Really?

479
00:25:30,144 --> 00:25:31,145
Yes.

480
00:25:32,146 --> 00:25:34,181
And I'm familiar with those clothes, too,
Scriptwriter Wang.

481
00:25:35,249 --> 00:25:37,451
- Are you?
- Sushi?

482
00:25:37,451 --> 00:25:38,552
- Then...
- What's this?

483
00:25:41,755 --> 00:25:43,123
Bear.

484
00:25:43,123 --> 00:25:45,159
What's this growl of a bear?

485
00:25:45,893 --> 00:25:47,127
Yes, that was a bear.

486
00:25:47,928 --> 00:25:50,197
Where did you get that?

487
00:25:51,465 --> 00:25:52,666
Wait a minute.

488
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:02,977
This...

489
00:26:05,546 --> 00:26:06,714
camper van.

490
00:26:11,085 --> 00:26:12,119
Do you remember it?

491
00:26:12,586 --> 00:26:14,388
Of course. How can I forget that?

492
00:26:15,556 --> 00:26:17,324
So this was it.

493
00:26:25,466 --> 00:26:26,567
Did you know...

494
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:33,207
that you're a very strange woman?

495
00:27:05,706 --> 00:27:09,109
He said he was editing all night.

496
00:27:09,109 --> 00:27:10,244
He must be tired.

497
00:27:11,345 --> 00:27:14,014
Lean back, PD Cho.

498
00:27:21,655 --> 00:27:23,858
He's going through trouble.

499
00:28:04,363 --> 00:28:06,198
From one to ten,
how would you rate yourself?

500
00:28:06,198 --> 00:28:07,199
Ten? No.

501
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:08,200
One million, yes.

502
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,968
Living with what you look like now
versus getting ten million dollars for...

503
00:28:09,968 --> 00:28:11,303
Ten million?

504
00:28:11,303 --> 00:28:12,237
I wouldn't change my face
even for 100 million.

505
00:28:12,237 --> 00:28:12,971
Why not?

506
00:28:12,971 --> 00:28:14,439
My potential is...

507
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:16,341
way over ten million.

508
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:17,843
What do you do?

509
00:28:17,843 --> 00:28:18,577
I work at a production company.

510
00:28:18,577 --> 00:28:19,945
This is top secret,

511
00:28:19,945 --> 00:28:22,047
but I got scouted in the streets
by a national actor.

512
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:25,584
How old are you?

513
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:27,219
Just know that I'm an MZer.

514
00:28:27,219 --> 00:28:29,988
Lastly, show us your best move
and we'll give you a present.

515
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:32,257
(Cute)

516
00:28:32,257 --> 00:28:33,859
(Adorable)

517
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:35,093
I'll tell you my name.

518
00:28:35,944 --> 00:28:36,995
I'm No In Seong.

519
00:28:36,995 --> 00:28:38,630
Some get confused at times.

520
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,432
But I'm not Zo In Sung.

521
00:28:40,432 --> 00:28:42,367
No In Seong, yes.

522
00:28:43,602 --> 00:28:44,903
Love yourself.

523
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:47,840
Thank you. Bye.

524
00:28:48,941 --> 00:28:50,108
He's weird.

525
00:28:50,108 --> 00:28:51,944
(Is he mad?
But this video is actually addictive.)

526
00:28:57,749 --> 00:29:00,185
(Just 15 minutes a day
Jasmine's 15 Minute Class)

527
00:29:04,957 --> 00:29:06,391
Just 15 minutes a day.

528
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:09,828
Jasmine's 15 Minute Class.
This is the third class.

529
00:29:10,395 --> 00:29:13,632
Exercising the mind. Meditation.

530
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:17,936
Namaste.

531
00:29:22,207 --> 00:29:25,010
Where are the others, namaste?

532
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:28,514
CEO Ji, Scriptwriter Wang,
and PD Kang are doing "TTC," namaste.

533
00:29:28,514 --> 00:29:29,748
CEO Cho is just absent, namaste.

534
00:29:31,617 --> 00:29:32,951
Why is that, namaste?

535
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:34,386
I don't know, namaste.

536
00:29:36,788 --> 00:29:38,423
Okay, namaste.

537
00:29:39,258 --> 00:29:42,628
The mind is a bowl that embraces the body.

538
00:29:42,628 --> 00:29:45,330
Let's meditate for 15 minutes from now...

539
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:48,767
to build our mental strength.

540
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:49,735
(Three milion!)

541
00:29:49,735 --> 00:29:51,036
Namaste.

542
00:29:51,036 --> 00:29:52,738
Yalalu!

543
00:29:55,007 --> 00:29:57,910
The video of my interview in the streets
got three million views, namaste.

544
00:29:58,377 --> 00:30:01,113
I might really become
an influencer, namaste.

545
00:30:01,647 --> 00:30:04,816
Shut up and meditate, namaste.

546
00:30:05,751 --> 00:30:07,719
- Namaste.
- Amen.

547
00:30:15,294 --> 00:30:18,530
(Episode 7-2
The Kind Miss Ji Won)

548
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:21,967
Good job, everybody.

549
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:32,444
What's this, PD Kang?

550
00:30:32,444 --> 00:30:34,580
Don't you know how to keep
your private and public life separate?

551
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,081
I couldn't find the time to talk to you.

552
00:30:36,315 --> 00:30:39,785
And you crossed the line first,
Scriptwriter Wang.

553
00:30:41,486 --> 00:30:43,522
- What?
- That day,

554
00:30:43,522 --> 00:30:46,525
it was you who seduced me first.

555
00:30:46,525 --> 00:30:49,027
Those clothes, and the whiskey!

556
00:30:49,027 --> 00:30:50,362
Well...

557
00:30:50,362 --> 00:30:51,763
Why on earth did you do that?

558
00:30:52,397 --> 00:30:53,899
If it was just once,
I wouldn't mind, either.

559
00:30:53,899 --> 00:30:55,734
The first time was a special occasion.

560
00:30:55,734 --> 00:30:58,904
But it was two times,
so we have to make things clear.

561
00:31:00,172 --> 00:31:02,174
I had my reasons.

562
00:31:03,442 --> 00:31:05,010
Let me listen to those reasons.

563
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,311
Well...

564
00:31:08,313 --> 00:31:09,848
- Why?
- What?

565
00:31:10,482 --> 00:31:12,784
You're not going to date me anyway.

566
00:31:14,152 --> 00:31:16,188
Well, that's...

567
00:31:17,055 --> 00:31:20,626
But didn't you say
you're not going to date anyone at work?

568
00:31:23,195 --> 00:31:24,596
I did.

569
00:31:25,364 --> 00:31:26,498
Exactly.

570
00:31:26,498 --> 00:31:30,969
I just need to make things clear
about what's between us.

571
00:31:31,537 --> 00:31:33,972
We have to see each other every day,
so we can't keep being this awkward.

572
00:31:35,841 --> 00:31:37,509
You have a point.

573
00:31:38,644 --> 00:31:40,913
Then give me some time to think about it.

574
00:31:40,913 --> 00:31:43,382
- How much? Three seconds?
- What?

575
00:31:43,382 --> 00:31:44,583
Three seconds just passed.

576
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:45,684
Five minutes?

577
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:46,752
More than a day?

578
00:31:46,752 --> 00:31:47,853
I can't give you more than that.

579
00:31:49,121 --> 00:31:50,789
Then one day.

580
00:31:51,356 --> 00:31:54,493
Okay. 24 hours. Deal.

581
00:31:55,794 --> 00:31:56,762
Deal.

582
00:32:03,569 --> 00:32:04,837
What do you think, Min Jae?

583
00:32:04,837 --> 00:32:07,172
I created this dance with gestures
inspired by the arcade yesterday.

584
00:32:07,172 --> 00:32:08,740
It looks great.

585
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,875
- I know, right?
- It looks fine.

586
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:12,644
Since when did you two drop honorifics?

587
00:32:12,644 --> 00:32:14,713
When you stayed up all night
at the coin karaoke room yesterday.

588
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:17,115
What about me?

589
00:32:17,115 --> 00:32:19,251
I want to drop honorifics
with you, too, Shiba.

590
00:32:19,251 --> 00:32:21,854
Okay, then.

591
00:32:22,855 --> 00:32:24,022
Okay, Shiba.

592
00:32:24,823 --> 00:32:26,825
The YouTube Agency?

593
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:28,827
You want to scout me?

594
00:32:30,162 --> 00:32:31,563
Right.

595
00:32:31,563 --> 00:32:35,234
If you think about it, it's not easy
to get over three million views.

596
00:32:36,001 --> 00:32:37,669
Yes, but,

597
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:41,340
let me think about it some more
and get back to you.

598
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,908
Okay.

599
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,844
No way.

600
00:32:45,844 --> 00:32:49,781
Did you just get a call
from the YouTube Agency, In Seong?

601
00:32:49,781 --> 00:32:51,216
Yes, that was my third call.

602
00:32:51,216 --> 00:32:53,085
- Third call?
- I'm sick of it.

603
00:32:53,085 --> 00:32:56,755
It seems my YouTube shorts video
was impressive.

604
00:32:58,023 --> 00:33:00,626
In Seong, are you changing your job
to a YouTuber now?

605
00:33:00,626 --> 00:33:02,227
I'll have to think about it some more.

606
00:33:02,227 --> 00:33:04,563
When you become too famous,
it gets tiring, that's why.

607
00:33:04,563 --> 00:33:06,064
You should just switch your career.

608
00:33:06,064 --> 00:33:08,167
Switch careers to a YouTuber?

609
00:33:09,034 --> 00:33:12,037
Anyway, how's it going with the dance
for the challenge video?

610
00:33:12,037 --> 00:33:12,871
It's going well.

611
00:33:12,871 --> 00:33:14,273
Then show me.

612
00:33:16,074 --> 00:33:18,210
One, two, three, four.

613
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:26,418
Stop.

614
00:33:26,418 --> 00:33:29,021
In my eyes, to be honest,
all three of you...

615
00:33:29,021 --> 00:33:31,156
lack scriptwriter potential,
producer potential, and star potential.

616
00:33:31,156 --> 00:33:32,424
Star potential? Me?

617
00:33:32,424 --> 00:33:35,194
Scriptwriter potential?
Nobody has ever said that to me before.

618
00:33:35,194 --> 00:33:37,262
Be quiet. It's a secret.

619
00:33:37,262 --> 00:33:39,531
Did you see that YouTube shorts of me...

620
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:41,266
that hit over three million views
in just 12 hours?

621
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:43,368
- No.
- No? Wait, then.

622
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:45,404
I chose not to.

623
00:33:45,404 --> 00:33:48,473
Wait, what? It's 3.17 million now.
It's over three million.

624
00:33:48,473 --> 00:33:51,210
I'll send you the link.
Check my vibe and learn from it.

625
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,645
Okay? I'll grant you special permission.

626
00:33:54,246 --> 00:33:55,848
Wait, someone's calling me.

627
00:33:55,848 --> 00:33:56,982
Hello?

628
00:33:57,516 --> 00:33:59,985
A public survey?
Is my opinion that important?

629
00:33:59,985 --> 00:34:01,520
I'll tell you, then. What?

630
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,288
If it's right, press "one"
and if it's wrong, press "two?"

631
00:34:03,288 --> 00:34:04,890
How can that be an opinion?

632
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:05,757
Yes.

633
00:34:05,757 --> 00:34:10,128
Did In Seong...

634
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:11,864
lose character at last?

635
00:34:11,864 --> 00:34:13,799
He definitely lost it.

636
00:34:14,299 --> 00:34:15,834
I can't even.

637
00:34:16,635 --> 00:34:17,836
Let's get over five million views.

638
00:34:17,836 --> 00:34:20,305
- What?
- Five million?

639
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:21,473
- Yes.
- Five million?

640
00:34:21,473 --> 00:34:23,408
Let's get over five million views with
the KICKKICKKICKKICK Song challenge video.

641
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:24,977
Should we shoot a live showcase
on the rooftop?

642
00:34:24,977 --> 00:34:26,011
It doesn't cost anything.

643
00:34:26,011 --> 00:34:28,580
He said we lack scriptwriter potential,
star potential, and producer potential.

644
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,949
He's so full of himself now,
so we should take him down a notch.

645
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:34,286
That's right. If we set our mind to it,
we can easily get over five million views.

646
00:34:34,286 --> 00:34:35,687
- That's totally possible.
- Exactly.

647
00:34:35,687 --> 00:34:39,491
Exactly. A video of Mark just singing gets
a bunch of views already.

648
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:41,527
Exactly. Star potential? Seriously?

649
00:34:41,527 --> 00:34:43,061
Gather around.

650
00:34:43,061 --> 00:34:43,896
Joo.

651
00:34:43,896 --> 00:34:44,763
Mark.

652
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:47,032
Min.

653
00:34:47,032 --> 00:34:48,967
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

654
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:51,069
Let's go.

655
00:34:57,075 --> 00:34:59,978
Why aren't you getting my therapy...

656
00:34:59,978 --> 00:35:01,747
or participating in my 15 Minute Classes?

657
00:35:02,981 --> 00:35:04,416
He's making me all stubborn.

658
00:35:06,185 --> 00:35:09,154
There must be a reason.

659
00:35:11,824 --> 00:35:12,658
Okay.

660
00:35:14,092 --> 00:35:15,093
Jasmine.

661
00:35:16,562 --> 00:35:18,163
Think about it.

662
00:35:19,097 --> 00:35:21,133
Think about what CEO Cho is like
every day.

663
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:35,013
(CEO Cho Young Sik)

664
00:35:47,726 --> 00:35:49,194
Symmetric obsessive-compulsive disorder?

665
00:35:49,561 --> 00:35:50,662
No way.

666
00:35:54,933 --> 00:35:55,968
Actually,

667
00:35:57,603 --> 00:35:59,271
I should check it out.

668
00:36:03,175 --> 00:36:05,377
Okay.

669
00:36:10,382 --> 00:36:11,917
What should I eat?

670
00:36:11,917 --> 00:36:13,418
- CEO Cho.
- Yes?

671
00:36:13,418 --> 00:36:14,820
You scared me.

672
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,823
Why are you wearing huge sunglasses
inside the building?

673
00:36:19,258 --> 00:36:23,662
If you were thinking about having
a cup of coffee, I'd like to buy you one.

674
00:36:23,662 --> 00:36:24,563
Buy me a coffee?

675
00:36:24,963 --> 00:36:26,498
Why is that?

676
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,869
I want to discuss something
about KICKKICKKICKKICK.

677
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:33,272
But doing it in here is...

678
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:35,474
kind of uncomfortable.

679
00:36:38,377 --> 00:36:39,211
Okay.

680
00:36:39,778 --> 00:36:40,946
Let's go, then.

681
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,225
She's not normal.

682
00:36:54,092 --> 00:36:55,894
What's wrong with everyone here?

683
00:36:56,995 --> 00:36:57,830
Thank you.

684
00:37:01,834 --> 00:37:03,669
Thank you.

685
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:08,040
What do you want to discuss?

686
00:37:08,507 --> 00:37:11,677
Actually...

687
00:37:15,514 --> 00:37:17,549
I'm sorry. My goodness.

688
00:37:19,451 --> 00:37:20,352
My bad.

689
00:37:22,554 --> 00:37:24,490
This...

690
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:26,492
This...

691
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,563
It splashed on my cheeks,
my hair, and my clothes, too.

692
00:37:31,563 --> 00:37:33,565
But why are you wiping only my eyebrows?

693
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,602
I have a stomachache.

694
00:37:36,602 --> 00:37:38,604
I have to use the restroom.

695
00:37:38,604 --> 00:37:39,972
- God of Asymmetry,
- All of a sudden?

696
00:37:39,972 --> 00:37:42,174
please free me from symmetric
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

697
00:37:42,174 --> 00:37:43,842
What's more important
than a perfect balance is...

698
00:37:43,842 --> 00:37:45,143
peace in my mind.

699
00:37:45,143 --> 00:37:46,945
<i>Yali yali yala seng yalali yala</i>

700
00:37:46,945 --> 00:37:50,249
<i>Yalali yala</i>

701
00:37:50,249 --> 00:37:52,885
I'm sure he has symmetric
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

702
00:37:56,255 --> 00:37:58,790
What's that punk muttering to himself?

703
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,759
If he has a mental illness,
he should stay cooped up in his house.

704
00:38:06,098 --> 00:38:07,166
What are you?

705
00:38:07,866 --> 00:38:09,635
I'm the crazy woman in this area.

706
00:38:09,635 --> 00:38:12,304
Isn't every man and woman crazy
in the 21st century?

707
00:38:12,304 --> 00:38:14,706
Did you just ask me
if I have a mental illness?

708
00:38:14,706 --> 00:38:15,507
No, I was just...

709
00:38:15,507 --> 00:38:18,944
Don't you think those who think they're
perfectly normal are the crazy ones?

710
00:38:18,944 --> 00:38:20,913
- I'm sorry, I...
- What kind of illness do you have?

711
00:38:20,913 --> 00:38:22,848
Why aren't you answering me
but just running away?

712
00:38:25,951 --> 00:38:29,488
How dare he say my boss has
a mental illness.

713
00:38:32,891 --> 00:38:34,026
I'm sorry.

714
00:38:34,026 --> 00:38:36,028
I suddenly had a stomachache.

715
00:38:36,028 --> 00:38:40,666
What was it you wanted to say?

716
00:38:43,602 --> 00:38:45,304
- CEO Cho.
- Yes?

717
00:38:45,971 --> 00:38:49,775
The Native Americans have
a very interesting custom.

718
00:38:49,775 --> 00:38:50,742
Do you know what it is?

719
00:38:51,376 --> 00:38:53,345
- No.
- Okay.

720
00:38:53,345 --> 00:38:56,949
When they ride horses,
they frequently look back.

721
00:38:56,949 --> 00:38:57,950
Like this?

722
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,885
Yes, like that.

723
00:38:59,885 --> 00:39:02,020
They do that to check...

724
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,022
if their souls fell on the ground.

725
00:39:04,022 --> 00:39:06,959
Then I'll keep listening
while checking if my soul did.

726
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:10,429
CEO Cho, I'm talking to you right here.

727
00:39:11,697 --> 00:39:13,465
I know. You can keep going.

728
00:39:13,465 --> 00:39:15,701
The lighting is dazzling, that's why.

729
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:16,768
Fine.

730
00:39:19,071 --> 00:39:21,273
The lighting...

731
00:39:21,273 --> 00:39:23,342
is fine now. You can keep going.

732
00:39:24,009 --> 00:39:26,278
CEO Cho, when our souls are hurt,

733
00:39:26,278 --> 00:39:29,615
the balance between our body
and mind collapses.

734
00:39:29,615 --> 00:39:31,517
Is that so? I see.

735
00:39:31,517 --> 00:39:34,520
As the CEO of KICKKICKKICKKICK
and a producer,

736
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,222
your current condition,

737
00:39:37,222 --> 00:39:39,191
your body, mind, and soul,

738
00:39:39,191 --> 00:39:41,894
are all in a poor state.

739
00:39:41,894 --> 00:39:45,664
So participate
in Jasmine's 15 Minute Class...

740
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,633
with everyone else...

741
00:39:47,633 --> 00:39:51,737
and take care of the health of your soul.
What do you think?

742
00:39:51,737 --> 00:39:52,838
Don't take it off.

743
00:39:54,306 --> 00:39:55,874
- You look beautiful.
- What?

744
00:39:57,476 --> 00:39:59,778
That opinion of yours, Jasmine.

745
00:40:00,212 --> 00:40:02,748
I'll carefully review it.

746
00:40:03,315 --> 00:40:05,350
I'll excuse myself now.

747
00:40:09,154 --> 00:40:13,292
I think that will make it easier
for you to reach your goal, CEO Cho.

748
00:40:16,562 --> 00:40:17,696
Beautiful?

749
00:40:18,997 --> 00:40:20,465
He knows what beauty is.

750
00:40:20,966 --> 00:40:22,801
(CEO Ji Jin Hee)

751
00:40:24,603 --> 00:40:29,308
After No In Seong entered this company,
what good did he do?

752
00:40:34,012 --> 00:40:35,314
What on earth is happening?

753
00:40:35,314 --> 00:40:37,549
No In Seong caused trouble.

754
00:40:37,549 --> 00:40:40,485
Shin Dong Yeob he contacted as the MC
of "TTC" was not Sin Dong Yeob.

755
00:40:42,688 --> 00:40:44,122
Can't you see well?

756
00:40:44,122 --> 00:40:45,290
(Documents for Approval)

757
00:40:45,724 --> 00:40:47,826
I kindly ask for your prompt approval.

758
00:40:47,826 --> 00:40:49,328
(Letter of Overtime Payment)

759
00:40:49,328 --> 00:40:51,163
(Sum Five Hundred Twenty-Three Dollars)

760
00:40:51,897 --> 00:40:52,865
None.

761
00:40:53,398 --> 00:40:54,633
He has done nothing good.

762
00:40:56,001 --> 00:40:58,103
He's rather a villain.

763
00:41:17,322 --> 00:41:19,191
My goodness…

764
00:41:21,026 --> 00:41:23,762
- CEO Ji.
- In Seong. I didn't know you were there.

765
00:41:23,762 --> 00:41:25,497
Geez.

766
00:41:25,497 --> 00:41:27,566
But is something bad going on?

767
00:41:27,566 --> 00:41:29,034
Something great is going on with me.

768
00:41:29,034 --> 00:41:31,370
Really? What is it?

769
00:41:32,137 --> 00:41:33,972
The video of me being interviewed
in the streets...

770
00:41:33,972 --> 00:41:36,842
just hit four million views.

771
00:41:36,842 --> 00:41:40,078
Really? You're amazing, In Seong.

772
00:41:40,546 --> 00:41:43,749
I'm glad, but I'm also concerned.

773
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,452
What's concerning you?

774
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,388
I think...

775
00:41:50,322 --> 00:41:51,924
I'll become a celebrity soon.

776
00:41:51,924 --> 00:41:55,127
I even got a job offer.

777
00:41:55,127 --> 00:41:56,595
Really?

778
00:41:56,595 --> 00:41:58,664
Good for you, In Seong.

779
00:42:01,266 --> 00:42:02,100
Go.

780
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:08,774
But I'm the founding member
of KICKKICKKICKKICK...

781
00:42:08,774 --> 00:42:11,009
and the key figure.

782
00:42:11,777 --> 00:42:12,945
I see.

783
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,648
Well...

784
00:42:16,648 --> 00:42:21,186
Should I tell you this or not?

785
00:42:21,186 --> 00:42:22,621
Well, so,

786
00:42:22,621 --> 00:42:24,122
the thing is...

787
00:42:24,122 --> 00:42:24,990
Well...

788
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:27,893
No. Just forget it.

789
00:42:27,893 --> 00:42:30,028
Giving and taking away again,
saying something and not finishing.

790
00:42:30,028 --> 00:42:31,830
They're the worst in the world, CEO Ji.

791
00:42:37,836 --> 00:42:38,971
In Seong, come here.

792
00:42:40,772 --> 00:42:43,709
I'm telling you this to you only,
In Seong, because it's you.

793
00:42:43,709 --> 00:42:46,011
- Okay?
- Okay. Top secret.

794
00:42:46,011 --> 00:42:47,279
- To be honest,
- To be honest.

795
00:42:47,846 --> 00:42:49,181
KICKKICKKICKKICK...

796
00:42:50,182 --> 00:42:52,251
is not very stable.

797
00:42:52,251 --> 00:42:53,151
What?

798
00:42:55,454 --> 00:42:56,989
Why not?

799
00:42:56,989 --> 00:43:00,259
We might close soon.

800
00:43:00,826 --> 00:43:01,894
But...

801
00:43:01,894 --> 00:43:04,530
But this is a secret, In Seong, okay?

802
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:05,831
Don't tell anyone.

803
00:43:05,831 --> 00:43:07,699
The morale
of the employees depend on this.

804
00:43:07,699 --> 00:43:09,234
- Okay?
- Okay.

805
00:43:09,902 --> 00:43:13,071
Those days
when I was a celebrity was great.

806
00:43:13,672 --> 00:43:15,307
When I went to restaurants,

807
00:43:15,307 --> 00:43:18,644
they gave me this much food for free.

808
00:43:18,644 --> 00:43:21,213
They gave me this much of a discount.

809
00:43:21,213 --> 00:43:25,317
When there was a new product,
my sponsors gave me this much of it.

810
00:43:25,317 --> 00:43:26,518
I mean...

811
00:43:27,486 --> 00:43:28,654
those were the good old days.

812
00:43:30,022 --> 00:43:32,291
Since the company is crashing anyway,

813
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:36,228
should I quit being a CEO and go back
to being Actor Ji, a celebrity?

814
00:43:36,995 --> 00:43:38,997
Or should I just...

815
00:43:38,997 --> 00:43:41,133
I can't choose.

816
00:43:41,133 --> 00:43:43,635
Is being a celebrity that great?

817
00:43:53,779 --> 00:43:58,550
This much.

818
00:44:03,422 --> 00:44:04,990
Hello?

819
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,593
I'm No In Seong,
the guy you offered a job to earlier.

820
00:44:07,593 --> 00:44:09,127
What were the contract terms
and conditions again?

821
00:44:10,562 --> 00:44:12,097
You're going to make me a superstar?

822
00:44:13,031 --> 00:44:14,500
Yes, sir.

823
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,835
Will I become a star now?

824
00:44:16,835 --> 00:44:17,970
Okay, sir.

825
00:44:23,842 --> 00:44:27,579
Hello. Let's start Jasmine's 15 Minute...

826
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:29,014
Class...

827
00:44:30,249 --> 00:44:31,517
Where's CEO Cho?

828
00:44:31,517 --> 00:44:33,352
He's absent today as always.

829
00:44:35,587 --> 00:44:36,722
I see.

830
00:44:39,191 --> 00:44:41,894
But why are you wearing sunglasses,
In Seong?

831
00:44:42,861 --> 00:44:43,996
Lately,

832
00:44:43,996 --> 00:44:46,398
people have been recognizing me,
a celebrity.

833
00:44:49,101 --> 00:44:51,737
You'll get used to that soon.

834
00:44:51,737 --> 00:44:52,704
Also,

835
00:44:53,739 --> 00:44:55,073
it feels better than you think.

836
00:44:55,073 --> 00:44:56,041
- Really?
- Yes.

837
00:44:57,543 --> 00:44:59,411
Okay, then.

838
00:45:00,179 --> 00:45:01,213
Okay.

839
00:45:01,547 --> 00:45:05,884
We're going to try
a Couple Waltz Circuit Training today.

840
00:45:05,884 --> 00:45:09,221
With your colleagues, friends, and family,

841
00:45:09,221 --> 00:45:12,090
get in pairs and stand in a circle.

842
00:45:17,729 --> 00:45:20,632
Higher, kick higher.

843
00:45:20,632 --> 00:45:21,633
Higher.

844
00:45:29,374 --> 00:45:30,709
Squat.

845
00:45:32,511 --> 00:45:33,979
One more time, squat

846
00:45:36,982 --> 00:45:38,217
Change partners.

847
00:45:39,985 --> 00:45:41,453
Turn.

848
00:45:43,589 --> 00:45:45,090
Lie down.

849
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,592
Hold your partner.

850
00:45:46,592 --> 00:45:49,127
CEO Ji, go all the way up.

851
00:45:49,127 --> 00:45:51,063
You don't have to keep the beat.

852
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:53,432
Are you okay?

853
00:45:56,101 --> 00:45:56,935
What is it?

854
00:45:56,935 --> 00:45:58,504
- In Seong.
- Yes?

855
00:45:58,504 --> 00:46:01,340
Is the negotiation
with the YouTube Agency going well?

856
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:04,142
They mentioned a five-to-five ratio
in profit distribution.

857
00:46:04,142 --> 00:46:05,277
Does that even make sense?

858
00:46:05,277 --> 00:46:07,980
I'm a celebrity,
and they're the celebrity's pawns.

859
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:14,953
I know. I started
with a three-to-seven ratio, too.

860
00:46:14,953 --> 00:46:16,388
Then it changed to seven-to-three.

861
00:46:16,388 --> 00:46:19,258
So five-to-five is actually very generous.

862
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:21,627
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

863
00:46:22,194 --> 00:46:23,428
- Is it?
- Of course.

864
00:46:24,763 --> 00:46:26,231
- Really?
- Go.

865
00:46:26,899 --> 00:46:28,634
- Go where?
- Go

866
00:46:28,634 --> 00:46:29,601
No.

867
00:46:29,601 --> 00:46:33,472
- Go.
- No.

868
00:46:33,472 --> 00:46:34,640
You won't get this opportunity again.

869
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,742
Shiba, I'm good, aren't I?

870
00:46:37,442 --> 00:46:39,444
How many did he do?

871
00:46:40,179 --> 00:46:41,146
- Sorry?
- How many did he do?

872
00:46:41,146 --> 00:46:42,548
- Two.
- Two...

873
00:46:42,548 --> 00:46:44,049
Isn't it 13?

874
00:46:44,049 --> 00:46:45,017
Thirteen.

875
00:46:45,017 --> 00:46:46,552
Isn't it 14 now?

876
00:46:47,019 --> 00:46:48,053
Fourteen.

877
00:47:18,951 --> 00:47:19,818
Don't let go.

878
00:47:26,792 --> 00:47:28,861
We're done with sit-ups.

879
00:47:28,861 --> 00:47:31,964
- Change partners again.
- Partners.

880
00:47:35,801 --> 00:47:37,336
CEO Cho.

881
00:47:37,336 --> 00:47:39,137
Why aren't you participating...

882
00:47:39,137 --> 00:47:42,274
in Jasmine's high-class
therapeutic 15 Minute Class?

883
00:47:44,443 --> 00:47:46,211
Did I ever say I was going to?

884
00:47:49,414 --> 00:47:52,484
- You said you'll think about it.
- "You said you'll think about it?"

885
00:47:55,954 --> 00:47:58,090
I thought about it, and I don't want to.

886
00:48:00,325 --> 00:48:02,427
- Why not?
- "Why not?"

887
00:48:02,995 --> 00:48:04,930
Well, I'm not sure.

888
00:48:29,655 --> 00:48:31,957
He strangely makes me competitive.

889
00:48:43,769 --> 00:48:46,038
- PD Cho, here you are...
- Hello?

890
00:48:46,038 --> 00:48:47,105
Sorry.

891
00:48:47,105 --> 00:48:49,441
Really? I see.

892
00:48:50,209 --> 00:48:53,111
Yes. Really?

893
00:49:02,955 --> 00:49:03,989
CEO Cho.

894
00:49:04,423 --> 00:49:07,626
May I talk to you for a moment?

895
00:49:09,328 --> 00:49:11,396
No, you may not.

896
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:14,533
What was that?

897
00:49:17,069 --> 00:49:21,139
(Don't be clingy.)

898
00:49:27,479 --> 00:49:29,181
"Clingy?"

899
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,321
In Seong.

900
00:49:37,256 --> 00:49:39,358
In Seong, our company KICKKICKKICKKICK...

901
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:41,193
may have to close in one or two weeks.

902
00:49:41,193 --> 00:49:43,529
So you must close this contract.

903
00:49:43,529 --> 00:49:45,197
I'll do my best to help you out.

904
00:49:45,197 --> 00:49:46,632
I'm No In Seong. Don't worry.

905
00:49:46,632 --> 00:49:48,000
Okay. Let's go.

906
00:50:05,684 --> 00:50:07,286
Move, everyone.

907
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:08,387
Come this way.

908
00:50:09,054 --> 00:50:11,190
Hello, producer.

909
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:12,491
Mr. No In Seong is here.

910
00:50:12,491 --> 00:50:13,325
Hello.

911
00:50:14,126 --> 00:50:14,993
Take a seat here.

912
00:50:15,594 --> 00:50:16,695
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

913
00:50:17,396 --> 00:50:18,230
Hello.

914
00:50:21,934 --> 00:50:22,901
Nice to meet you.

915
00:50:22,901 --> 00:50:25,237
I'm Producer Moon Jeong Gi
of the Ten Million Agency.

916
00:50:25,237 --> 00:50:26,605
Thank you for coming to see me.

917
00:50:26,605 --> 00:50:30,142
I took time out of my busy schedule
to come here.

918
00:50:30,142 --> 00:50:31,143
I see.

919
00:50:31,143 --> 00:50:32,544
But who is that man?

920
00:50:33,011 --> 00:50:35,681
I'm Mr. No In Seong's one-day manager,
Manager Ji.

921
00:50:35,681 --> 00:50:36,548
That's enough.

922
00:50:37,015 --> 00:50:39,685
I read the contract.

923
00:50:39,685 --> 00:50:42,120
And I have a few additional clauses.

924
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,490
Tell me and we'll reflect them
as best as we can.

925
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:46,592
First of all, about my house.

926
00:50:46,592 --> 00:50:48,861
I want my house in the best part
of the Gangnam District in Seoul.

927
00:50:48,861 --> 00:50:51,263
It should be an apartment that's 99m²
that was built in less than two years.

928
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:53,131
No monthly rent,
but a key money deposit. Okay?

929
00:50:53,398 --> 00:50:54,199
Excuse me?

930
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:57,636
And for my car, I'd like the safest one.

931
00:50:57,636 --> 00:50:59,004
A Lincoln Alligator.

932
00:50:59,671 --> 00:51:01,807
You can do that, right?
I also need a driver.

933
00:51:01,807 --> 00:51:06,778
What he's saying is
that he'll work this hard.

934
00:51:06,778 --> 00:51:10,249
If you work with this passionate YouTuber
In Seong whose video got 4 million views,

935
00:51:10,249 --> 00:51:12,417
you will not regret it. So please.

936
00:51:12,951 --> 00:51:16,421
But you have a strong build, Manager Ji.

937
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:18,957
You have an elegant image...

938
00:51:18,957 --> 00:51:20,459
and you have a great voice as well.

939
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,163
You're like Actor Ji Jin Hee.

940
00:51:24,163 --> 00:51:26,498
Are you interested in being on YouTube?

941
00:51:26,832 --> 00:51:27,766
I'm not.

942
00:51:27,766 --> 00:51:30,569
No, please think about it and call me.

943
00:51:31,436 --> 00:51:32,704
Are you kidding?

944
00:51:32,704 --> 00:51:34,173
What are you doing?

945
00:51:34,173 --> 00:51:35,874
That's exactly what I need to ask you.

946
00:51:35,874 --> 00:51:39,044
How dare you show interest in this kind
of a loser when I'm right in front of you!

947
00:51:39,044 --> 00:51:41,947
To be honest, you're the loser.

948
00:51:41,947 --> 00:51:45,450
Everyone called you because of
the one percent of possibility they saw.

949
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:48,954
And you said what?
A house in Gangnam? An alligator?

950
00:51:48,954 --> 00:51:51,290
- Are you out of your mind?
- You punk.

951
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:52,624
Mr. In Seong.

952
00:51:52,624 --> 00:51:53,959
Let go.

953
00:51:56,929 --> 00:51:57,796
Manager Ji.

954
00:51:58,664 --> 00:51:59,731
Isn't that Actor Ji?

955
00:52:00,899 --> 00:52:02,534
- Don't film me.
- That's not me.

956
00:52:02,534 --> 00:52:04,336
No, I'm not Ji Jin Hee.

957
00:52:04,603 --> 00:52:06,305
- I'm not Ji Jin Hee.
- Don't shoot me.

958
00:52:07,806 --> 00:52:09,174
No videos, please.

959
00:52:09,174 --> 00:52:11,643
In Seong,
they're not shooting you, you punk.

960
00:52:11,643 --> 00:52:12,711
They're not shooting you.

961
00:52:12,711 --> 00:52:15,247
I'm not Ji Jin Hee
who won the Grand Prize in acting.

962
00:52:15,247 --> 00:52:16,148
That's not me.

963
00:52:20,886 --> 00:52:22,054
That's it.

964
00:52:32,264 --> 00:52:33,265
Darn it.

965
00:52:35,734 --> 00:52:37,069
I should get some sleep
and get back to it.

966
00:52:38,303 --> 00:52:39,137
I'm exhausted.

967
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,348
I'll sleep just a little.

968
00:53:13,739 --> 00:53:15,607
What?

969
00:53:15,607 --> 00:53:16,775
You scared me.

970
00:53:18,644 --> 00:53:19,845
Baek Ji Won?

971
00:53:19,845 --> 00:53:20,746
What?

972
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,581
Where am I?

973
00:53:23,415 --> 00:53:25,717
<i>Somewhere far away</i>

974
00:53:25,717 --> 00:53:29,555
Somewhere far away?

975
00:53:29,555 --> 00:53:30,622
Did you...

976
00:53:30,956 --> 00:53:33,458
kidnap me and lock me up?

977
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:37,262
I invited you
to Baek Ji Won's secret therapy.

978
00:53:37,262 --> 00:53:38,664
I didn't even ask for that.

979
00:53:38,664 --> 00:53:39,698
I'm getting out of here.

980
00:53:41,166 --> 00:53:42,201
Why are you being like this?

981
00:53:43,068 --> 00:53:44,903
Are you out of your mind, Baek Ji Won?

982
00:53:52,778 --> 00:53:55,247
From what I've seen of you so far,

983
00:53:55,247 --> 00:53:59,051
you have the wits
of a great content producer,

984
00:53:59,051 --> 00:54:02,287
but you also have something...

985
00:54:02,287 --> 00:54:04,556
that will be a risk
in being a CEO of a company.

986
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:08,494
Sweating and working,

987
00:54:08,894 --> 00:54:11,563
and resting and meditating.

988
00:54:11,563 --> 00:54:14,466
These are essential

989
00:54:14,466 --> 00:54:17,202
for perfect balance.

990
00:54:19,605 --> 00:54:21,006
- That's five-to-five.
- Yes.

991
00:54:23,542 --> 00:54:25,110
Perfect balance?

992
00:54:25,511 --> 00:54:26,378
Yes.

993
00:54:36,054 --> 00:54:36,889
Wake up.

994
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:39,124
Young Sik, wake up.

995
00:54:39,124 --> 00:54:41,260
Why on earth...

996
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:43,228
are you going this far?

997
00:54:43,929 --> 00:54:46,198
It's my sense of duty...

998
00:54:46,198 --> 00:54:49,301
for KICKKICKKICKKICK that pays me.

999
00:54:49,301 --> 00:54:51,036
- Sense of duty?
- Yes.

1000
00:54:52,471 --> 00:54:54,373
If you're not with me here,

1001
00:54:54,373 --> 00:54:55,974
you cannot go back to Seoul.

1002
00:54:55,974 --> 00:54:58,443
I can't? Where am I?

1003
00:54:58,443 --> 00:55:02,147
So you should make yourself comfortable
and let's have a conversation.

1004
00:55:02,147 --> 00:55:04,516
I guarantee complete secrecy.

1005
00:55:04,516 --> 00:55:07,819
Let's talk in Laku-Laku.

1006
00:55:07,819 --> 00:55:09,288
Talk in what?

1007
00:55:09,288 --> 00:55:10,589
Laku-Laku.

1008
00:55:23,535 --> 00:55:25,237
Are you done thinking about it?

1009
00:55:26,905 --> 00:55:30,509
But why are you so curious
about what I think, PD Kang?

1010
00:55:30,843 --> 00:55:33,812
I told you. We slept together
not just once, but twice.

1011
00:55:33,812 --> 00:55:35,447
We work together all day,

1012
00:55:35,447 --> 00:55:39,418
and we're going to ride that camper van
at least 30 more times.

1013
00:55:39,418 --> 00:55:42,754
So we have to talk about this
for things not to get awkward.

1014
00:55:43,222 --> 00:55:44,590
So,

1015
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:47,226
you don't intend to get
into a serious relationship with me.

1016
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,394
You want to become financially independent
and retire early.

1017
00:55:49,394 --> 00:55:52,264
You also said you're not interested
in dating anyone at work.

1018
00:55:53,131 --> 00:55:54,733
Yes, I did.

1019
00:55:55,434 --> 00:55:56,668
And that...

1020
00:55:59,471 --> 00:56:00,405
hasn't changed.

1021
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:05,477
But...

1022
00:56:07,145 --> 00:56:08,146
whenever I get...

1023
00:56:09,381 --> 00:56:10,482
in there...

1024
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:13,585
with you, PD Kang,

1025
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,556
I can write so smoothly
without any trouble.

1026
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:18,891
Writing?

1027
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:23,862
So let's not date at work...

1028
00:56:25,964 --> 00:56:27,432
but become Friends At Night At Work.

1029
00:56:27,432 --> 00:56:28,267
What?

1030
00:56:29,334 --> 00:56:31,737
Don't you know
what Friends At Night means?

1031
00:56:33,071 --> 00:56:34,606
So what you're saying is...

1032
00:56:34,606 --> 00:56:37,409
Do you mean the thing I'm thinking of?

1033
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:39,545
Friends At Night?

1034
00:56:40,913 --> 00:56:43,415
So you're saying
let's only be friends at night.

1035
00:56:43,415 --> 00:56:44,316
That's right.

1036
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:47,252
Friends who do all kinds of...

1037
00:56:47,252 --> 00:56:48,620
Yes, Friends At Night.

1038
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:51,390
Yes, that's right. You and me.

1039
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:54,226
We have a lot of time.

1040
00:56:54,793 --> 00:56:57,596
So take it slow.

1041
00:56:57,596 --> 00:56:59,698
Slowly.

1042
00:57:00,966 --> 00:57:02,334
Think about it.

1043
00:57:03,368 --> 00:57:04,403
And let go.

1044
00:57:05,103 --> 00:57:08,207
You might feel way better that way.

1045
00:57:08,207 --> 00:57:10,609
So, actually...

1046
00:57:14,613 --> 00:57:15,848
What was that?

1047
00:57:16,381 --> 00:57:19,985
What's this?

1048
00:57:26,692 --> 00:57:28,927
- What was that just now?
- They were people.

1049
00:57:28,927 --> 00:57:31,029
What's going on?

1050
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:33,232
- No way.
- Are they Friends At Night as well?

1051
00:57:36,101 --> 00:57:38,504
(Do not disturb.)

1052
00:57:39,171 --> 00:57:41,273
(KICKKICKKICKKICK Song
Premiere Live Showcase)

1053
00:57:41,273 --> 00:57:43,408
(Singer-songwriter Mark's
KICKKICKKICKKICK Song)

1054
00:57:43,408 --> 00:57:45,644
(The live showcase will be broadcast.)

1055
00:57:45,777 --> 00:57:46,645
Mark.

1056
00:57:47,446 --> 00:57:48,413
Yes?

1057
00:57:48,413 --> 00:57:50,282
- Good luck.
- Okay. Cue.

1058
00:57:52,317 --> 00:57:54,319
Hello, this is Mark.

1059
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:57,256
Today, I'm doing a live showcase...

1060
00:57:57,256 --> 00:57:59,391
of the KICKKICKKICKKICK Song
that I wrote and composed...

1061
00:57:59,391 --> 00:58:01,527
right here on the rooftop.

1062
00:58:01,527 --> 00:58:05,864
Before that, we'll show you
the challenge video first.

1063
00:58:12,804 --> 00:58:17,376
<i>The past days were not all easy</i>

1064
00:58:17,376 --> 00:58:22,014
<i>I didn't believe I'd come this far</i>

1065
00:58:22,014 --> 00:58:25,417
<i>The feelings I had then
that were forgotten</i>

1066
00:58:25,417 --> 00:58:26,351
Is it broadcasting fine?

1067
00:58:26,752 --> 00:58:31,390
<i>I thought they had disappeared
but they were here all along</i>

1068
00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:33,725
<i>I still have a lot to learn</i>

1069
00:58:33,725 --> 00:58:36,094
<i>I'm easily shaken</i>

1070
00:58:36,094 --> 00:58:38,597
<i>To find the moments I've dreamed of</i>

1071
00:58:38,597 --> 00:58:40,933
<i>I've come a long way</i>

1072
00:58:40,933 --> 00:58:43,202
<i>We're like music</i>

1073
00:58:43,202 --> 00:58:45,537
<i>The light that embraces us</i>

1074
00:58:45,537 --> 00:58:47,906
<i>The melody we sing together</i>

1075
00:58:47,906 --> 00:58:49,741
<i>It's always pleasant</i>

1076
00:58:49,741 --> 00:58:52,044
<i>Yeah we are clovers</i>

1077
00:58:52,044 --> 00:58:54,413
<i>And we are lovers</i>

1078
00:58:54,413 --> 00:58:58,116
<i>In any shape, just as it is</i>

1079
00:58:59,084 --> 00:59:01,386
<i>Cause we are clovers</i>

1080
00:59:01,386 --> 00:59:03,322
<i>Just like the others</i>

1081
00:59:03,322 --> 00:59:05,090
Isn't it great?

1082
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:05,958
Yes, it is.

1083
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:30,282
<i>Cause we are clovers</i>

1084
00:59:30,282 --> 00:59:32,718
<i>Just like the others</i>

1085
00:59:32,718 --> 00:59:36,288
<i>If we're together like this, we're fine</i>

1086
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:42,594
<i>Will these words reach you?</i>

1087
00:59:42,594 --> 00:59:43,662
<i>Then...</i>

1088
00:59:47,633 --> 00:59:50,135
I was just proving this was a live.

1089
00:59:52,905 --> 00:59:57,442
<i>Will we be able to believe everything?</i>

1090
00:59:57,442 --> 01:00:02,080
<i>When our imagination unfolds
before our eyes</i>

1091
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:06,218
<i>I will be your audience</i>

1092
01:00:37,983 --> 01:00:40,285
(KICKKICKKICKKICK)

1093
01:00:40,285 --> 01:00:42,788
How about
BaekCho Office Romance Search Team?

1094
01:00:42,788 --> 01:00:44,957
I will eradicate them
and give a strict warning.

1095
01:00:44,957 --> 01:00:46,325
A love triangle with PD Lee Min Jae!

1096
01:00:46,325 --> 01:00:47,960
The moments of my life
went through my mind like a flash.

1097
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,428
And they were all about Joo Ha.

1098
01:00:49,428 --> 01:00:50,262
Confess your feelings for her.

1099
01:00:50,262 --> 01:00:51,063
I like you.

1100
01:00:51,463 --> 01:00:53,732
We just got a request
to create YouTube content.

1101
01:00:53,732 --> 01:00:55,234
She's a top actress.

1102
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:56,201
You're here.

1103
01:00:56,201 --> 01:00:57,536
Are you a fool? Why stay silent?

1104
01:00:57,536 --> 01:01:00,205
She's Yeo Woo Ran
whom I still see in my dreams.

1105
01:01:00,205 --> 01:01:01,306
I don't see Kick anywhere.

1106
01:01:01,306 --> 01:01:02,841
The golden time is only three hours.

1107
01:01:02,841 --> 01:01:04,376
Our goal is to find the missing Kick...

1108
01:01:04,376 --> 01:01:06,111
in three hours.

1109
01:01:09,746 --> 01:01:11,746
