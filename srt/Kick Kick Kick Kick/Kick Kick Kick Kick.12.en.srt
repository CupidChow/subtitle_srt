(All characters, organizations,)

(and events in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,070
(Broadcasting guidelines were followed
during the shooting of animals.)

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,211
Mark, I...

5
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:13,079
It's okay. Just say it.

6
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,083
Mark.

7
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:25,926
To me,

8
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:34,834
you're a very dear friend.

9
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:50,884
I feel better now.

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,990
It's not the end of the world, Joo Ha.
Smile.

11
00:00:58,425 --> 00:00:59,359
Come on.

12
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,465
You know you have
to grant me a wish, right?

13
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:07,567
You fool couldn't guess your Secret Santa.

14
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,771
Sorry.

15
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:20,647
I know I'm being selfish.

16
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,119
But let's go back to the old days.

17
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,557
The days when I was your dear friend...

18
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:31,791
like you said.

19
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:34,694
Mark.

20
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:37,464
I'll give 99 percent effort,
and you can give just one percent.

21
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,566
That's...

22
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:42,802
my wish.

23
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,726
(Episode 1 First Encounter)

24
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:10,730
Who's this?

25
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,800
Yes, this is Ji Jin Hee.

26
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,938
Excuse me?

27
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:21,508
The pipe burst at my house
and the repair takes a month?

28
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:24,077
How can that...

29
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:27,581
Okay. All right, then.

30
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:29,649
Please repair it. Thank you.

31
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,687
Then...

32
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,791
will I be homeless for a month?

33
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:41,728
What should I do?

34
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,747
I had a good sleep.

35
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,088
My back is also fine.

36
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,593
Is this a good spot for sleeping?

37
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,934
Wait. What's with my hair?

38
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:24,204
You surprised me, Ji Jin Hee.

39
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,473
Wait a minute.

40
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,041
Should I wash my hair first?

41
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,676
Or my face?

42
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,011
Hair?

43
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:33,914
Face? Hair?

44
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:34,748
Both.

45
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,987
(Final Episode)

46
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,723
Mondays are always tough.

47
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:49,329
But thanks to my girlfriend,
I'm at work again.

48
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:51,498
Same.

49
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:56,503
Did you think about the composition
for "Camping in Love?"

50
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,605
Yes, I did.

51
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,143
You're even good at your work.

52
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:05,178
("Camping in Love"
"TTC" spin-off)

53
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,279
Nice.

54
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,616
I think it would be great...

55
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,785
if we make "Camping in Love"
a bit more hardcore.

56
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,520
- Hardcore?
- Yes.

57
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,890
That's possible because it's Setflix.

58
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,827
I have to use the restroom.

59
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:21,761
Okay.

60
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,600
Ma'am.

61
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,604
Felix Big Size?

62
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,306
Is he a foreigner?

63
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,743
- I can't wait to see you.
- What?

64
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,945
I'm waiting for the day we hold hands.

65
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,013
Hold hands?

66
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,349
He even sent four hearts.

67
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,424
How is it? Did you read everything?

68
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,460
It's great.

69
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,162
It's already time for work.

70
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,164
Let's go now.

71
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,065
Okay.

72
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,639
Felix Big Size?

73
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,610
Who are you?

74
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:16,182
(Episode 12-1
Who Are You?)

75
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:22,422
The meeting time has passed.
Why isn't CEO Ji here?

76
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,824
- I wonder why.
- He lost discipline.

77
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,593
You're right.

78
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,562
I can't even.

79
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,864
- He's here.
- Look at him.

80
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,466
Sorry. I fell asleep again.

81
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,402
Sorry I'm late.

82
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:36,436
Let's start the meeting.

83
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:39,339
What happened to your hair?

84
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,042
Actor Ji, what's with your hairstyle?

85
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,244
Are you out of conditioner at home?

86
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:47,013
No.

87
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,783
Everyone, who on earth used...

88
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,117
the foot soap I left in the bathroom?

89
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,519
Foot soap?

90
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,988
I saw earlier today
and almost half of it was gone.

91
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,256
Foot soap?

92
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,224
It's highly alkaline...

93
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,193
so it gets rid of foot odor.
It's super expensive.

94
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,263
If you wash your hair with that,
your hair gets really stiff.

95
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,967
CEO Ji, did you wash your hair with...

96
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,969
In Seong, are you out of your mind?

97
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,437
Did you wash your hair with foot soap?

98
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,741
Not only your hair is strange,
but you didn't even shave.

99
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,978
I got cast in a historical drama
so I'm growing a beard.

100
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:18,979
I see.

101
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,681
I'll go now and say no.

102
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,683
- What?
- What are you saying?

103
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,752
I'll go and say I'm not doing it.

104
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:29,089
That director and I are close friends
so it'll take some time.

105
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:30,657
But we have to start the meeting now.

106
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:31,958
CEO Ji.

107
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,096
- My gosh.
- What's wrong with him?

108
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:38,098
Let's start the meeting without him.

109
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:38,999
Okay.

110
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:41,434
Right.
Tae Ho, were you editing all last night?

111
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,770
No, I was home.

112
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,805
Then were you in the company
late at night, Scriptwriter Wang?

113
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:46,973
No.

114
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,276
Why?

115
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:54,547
Then are you saying
nobody was in the company...

116
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,850
late last night?

117
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,752
Who would be here that late?

118
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,820
- Why, CEO Ji?
- What is it?

119
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,790
Late at night yesterday...

120
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,557
Yes.

121
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,993
I came to the company
to get some materials.

122
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:13,099
I heard a humming sound and footsteps.

123
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:17,170
Was it a ghost?

124
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,707
There's no such thing as ghosts.

125
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,409
What are you saying?

126
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:24,578
Be quiet.

127
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:28,081
Okay. Let's start the meeting again.

128
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,416
- Okay.
- Okay.

129
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:36,556
(Hanbang Building)

130
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,898
Did everyone leave work?

131
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:51,738
Then I'll get ready to take a shower.

132
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,176
Did I bring everything? Shampoo...

133
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,210
Yes.

134
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:03,783
Where is it?

135
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:15,562
Here it is.

136
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:46,092
(Hanbang Building)

137
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,032
Right.

138
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:56,670
I forgot
my favorite guitar pick yesterday,

139
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,638
so I came to KICKKICKKICKKICK
late at night.

140
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,442
And I suddenly heard a strange humming...

141
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:03,977
and a head glowing in the dark.

142
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,153
What? What's happening?

143
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:16,056
What's this?

144
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,391
Did the elevator stop?

145
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,426
The light is back on.

146
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,296
Sorry. I'm afraid of ghosts.

147
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:27,033
- I'm sure that was a ghost.
- What?

148
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,569
I heard about it yesterday
at the Hanbang Real Estate.

149
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,470
Heard what?

150
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,940
A few years ago,
an old bachelor fell from the rooftop...

151
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,243
of Hanbang Building and died.

152
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:39,246
That man used to hum.

153
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:43,116
That humming sounded like a man, right?

154
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,684
- Yes, I think it was a man.
- A man.

155
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:48,188
Was the glow-in-the-dark head green?

156
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:49,789
It was green.

157
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:50,857
- Was it?
- Yes. Green.

158
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,026
The color of the hat he liked to wear...

159
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,461
was green.

160
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,833
Everyone, this is worth YouTube content.

161
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:03,303
"Digging Up Ghosts."

162
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,338
- "DUG."
- "DUG."

163
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,974
Don't create this kind of atmosphere.

164
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:11,211
If you want to do that content,
do it on your own, you red man.

165
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,613
You're wearing red
like the butt of a monkey.

166
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,881
We're here. Get off!

167
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,417
Seriously.

168
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,686
- Let's do "DUG."
- We're never doing that.

169
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,354
Good morning, Scriptwriter Wang.

170
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,355
Good morning.

171
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,990
Did you see the ghost?

172
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,258
No.

173
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,762
Ghost?

174
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,098
- Yes.
- Here.

175
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,567
Thank you.

176
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,053
What?

177
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,788
Wait a minute.

178
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:58,558
Scriptwriter Wang was MelanCholyCallme?

179
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,627
No way.

180
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,096
No way. That can't be.

181
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:05,465
What?

182
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:06,533
But that...

183
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:11,104
That circle looks the same.

184
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:13,473
No.

185
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:17,244
Wait.

186
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,705
PD Min Jae and Scriptwriter Joo Ha.

187
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,475
I put the beer we got for advertising
in the pantry.

188
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,810
Check it out
and think about how to advertise it.

189
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:51,511
Okay.

190
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,647
I'm going to the cafe now.
Would you two like something to drink?

191
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:54,748
I'll...

192
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:55,982
CEO Cho.

193
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,417
Are you okay?

194
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,819
I'm having a bad hair day.

195
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:01,688
Okay.

196
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,357
Let's check.

197
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,095
I'll send a message to MelanCholyCallme,

198
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:12,532
and if Scriptwriter Wang checks her phone
right then,

199
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:17,537
there's a 50 percent possibility
Scriptwriter Wang is MelanCholyCallme.

200
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:28,949
(Mellanghanatic
Knock, knock)

201
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:39,926
(Knock, knock)

202
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,695
What?

203
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,838
This is crazy.

204
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:57,377
I got a reply. This is crazy.

205
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:02,249
I'll take this call and come back.

206
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:07,554
Yes?

207
00:13:08,722 --> 00:13:09,623
Yes.

208
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:14,561
But...

209
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,530
why does she have
to take that call elsewhere?

210
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,332
Is that...

211
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,035
Felix Big Size?

212
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,046
It's been a long time. How have you been?

213
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,019
No, I'll go. You don't have to pick me up.

214
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:41,888
Pick her up? So he knows where she lives?

215
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:44,057
Of course, I can't wait to see you, too.

216
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:47,060
Since we're going to hold hands,

217
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,663
I'm applying hand lotion every day.

218
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:54,334
Yes. I'll see you in the lobby
on the first floor of Hanbang Tower.

219
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:56,803
Okay. I'll see you then.

220
00:13:58,605 --> 00:13:59,606
I'm so nervous.

221
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,109
What helps you loosen up,

222
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:06,513
beer and yoga. If these two come together,

223
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:10,450
they will display a positive effect.

224
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,421
So during Jasmine's 15 Minute Class,

225
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:18,024
we will naturally advertise this beer
by doing beer yoga.

226
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,159
What do you think?

227
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,661
That sounds nice.

228
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:25,432
Let's make our CEOs participate
and include it in "LUIC."

229
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:27,701
Okay. Let's give it a try ourselves today,

230
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,570
and then suggest it
to Jasmine and our CEOs.

231
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,273
Let's go.

232
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,575
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

233
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:36,643
Cheers.

234
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:41,314
Beer yoga seems quite nice...

235
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,216
but not so nice. I'm not sure.

236
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,851
- None left.
- What?

237
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,653
- There's none left.
- None?

238
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,121
I'll open it.

239
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:50,991
What?

240
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,025
I'll open it for you.

241
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:54,394
I'm good at it. Watch.

242
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:56,963
Amazing, right?

243
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:03,970
This is "Our Min Jae Has Changed."

244
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:04,905
What?

245
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:08,008
- Yes, you.
- I changed?

246
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:09,042
I mean,

247
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:12,145
when we first met,

248
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:16,483
you were such a mean guy.

249
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:19,653
Don't you remember? I'll tell you.

250
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:21,321
I flipped my hair, and I did this.

251
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,658
This happened, and you said "50 dollars."

252
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:28,595
"One Space Buds Pro costs 50 dollars
in the secondhand market."

253
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,235
Ga Joo Ha.

254
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:36,469
What?

255
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,307
It's not only me who changed.

256
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,444
You changed a lot, too, Joo Ha.

257
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:46,780
How?

258
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,618
You used to be just a weirdo.

259
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:52,419
And?

260
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:56,222
But these days,

261
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,291
you're a CW.

262
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:02,529
CW? What's that? Is it "coward?"

263
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,464
Coward.

264
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,599
Cute Weirdo.

265
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,034
What?

266
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,070
Cute Weirdo.

267
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:13,640
That's funny.

268
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,609
Cute Weirdo is weird.

269
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:17,077
My gosh. Sorry.

270
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:22,282
Min Jae, let's go jump on that trampoline.

271
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:23,483
Let's trampoline.

272
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:25,919
I like trampolines.

273
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,854
Me, too.

274
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:30,257
I'm from the 1st Mountain Brigade.

275
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:32,959
I'm good at trampolining. I'm not afraid.

276
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:41,001
"Tails of Tales of Camping." Music, cue.

277
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:49,175
Yes.

278
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,612
Are you ready, Mark?

279
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,814
Mark is ready, No Character.

280
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:58,018
We'll enter on the count of three.

281
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,219
One, two, three.

282
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,186
- One.
- One.

283
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:01,788
Two.

284
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:02,923
Guys.

285
00:17:02,923 --> 00:17:04,691
- You scared me.
- You scared me.

286
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,127
That was scary.

287
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,397
What's that in your hand?

288
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:12,899
- This is garlic.
- Garlic?

289
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:15,435
Because ghosts are afraid of garlic.

290
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:18,371
Then are you joining "DUG" as well,
CEO Cho?

291
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:22,175
I'm the CEO of Kickickickick,

292
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,378
and this seems like nice content,
that's why.

293
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,047
Okay. Good. Focus, everyone.

294
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,716
Get your cameras rolling now.

295
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,384
- Roll.
- Camera, roll.

296
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:32,752
Okay.

297
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:33,887
Is this it?

298
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,322
- What are you doing?
- Be quiet.

299
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:38,558
We have to perform this ceremony
before we start.

300
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,793
Okay. Here we go.

301
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:45,398
<i>Yalu yalu yalali</i>

302
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,268
What are you doing?

303
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:54,307
To find the ghost that appeared
in KICKKICKKICKKICK,

304
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:57,777
let's start the exorcism.

305
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,813
CEO Cho, to the bathroom.

306
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:01,281
Mark, to the rooftop.

307
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:02,515
Me, to the office.

308
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:06,453
Mark, especially on the rooftop
where that incident happened,

309
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,288
please look around carefully.

310
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:14,194
That's dangerous.

311
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:25,972
Did you see my double tumbling turn?

312
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:29,576
You can't call that
a double tumbling turn.

313
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:35,715
Then what is it I showed you until now?

314
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:39,819
It was a 1.5 turn.

315
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,488
It was only 1.5.

316
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:44,190
Seriously?

317
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,559
You're actually kind of funny.

318
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,146
I remember that day...

319
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:11,051
when you told me to grow together...

320
00:19:12,953 --> 00:19:14,421
and asked me not to leave.

321
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,625
I was really thankful.

322
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:27,400
Me, too.

323
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:31,004
What?

324
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,179
I was also thankful.

325
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:42,882
For what?

326
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:49,689
For you staying here.

327
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:51,591
Darn it.

328
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:59,466
The lights are off.

329
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,167
Joo Ha.

330
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:03,370
Yes?

331
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:55,522
That noise.

332
00:20:57,157 --> 00:21:00,827
Yes, there was some kind of noise.

333
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:06,066
I can't look at him.

334
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:13,840
Everyone left.

335
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:18,478
I'll now get ready to take a shower.

336
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:59,552
I saw something.

337
00:22:04,591 --> 00:22:06,026
Father in heaven.

338
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:07,694
In the name of the Lord,
I will not forgive you.

339
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,934
Lord, I'm so scared.

340
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,539
How lovely.

341
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,712
I'm so scared.

342
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,084
What?

343
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:35,155
I can't get caught. What should I do?

344
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:37,023
I'm so scared. What should I do?

345
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,525
First, let's just keep shooting.

346
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:45,599
If I'm with all of you,
I'm not scared, everyone.

347
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,101
Why did he come inside?

348
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:49,903
Why is he here? What now?

349
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:52,405
Wait.

350
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,441
Is he a thief?

351
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:58,278
You're watching "DUG."

352
00:23:01,314 --> 00:23:02,482
I'm the CEO.

353
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,254
Why get in here?

354
00:23:07,254 --> 00:23:09,356
- You.
- Don't come near me.

355
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:12,259
Get away.

356
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:14,527
That hurts.

357
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:16,263
Ghost, be gone.

358
00:23:16,263 --> 00:23:18,732
- Wait. It's me.
- I know this voice.

359
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:20,600
- It's me.
- This voice...

360
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:23,837
Jin Hee, what's this?

361
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:24,704
That hurts.

362
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:26,640
Why are you here with all that?

363
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:28,575
Why are you here with all that?

364
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:30,877
Was the bachelor ghost you?

365
00:23:30,877 --> 00:23:33,613
You scared me to death.

366
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:34,514
Why is this scary?

367
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:38,518
Why are you walking around like that
in the middle of the night?

368
00:23:38,518 --> 00:23:39,586
Well,

369
00:23:40,954 --> 00:23:41,955
to take a shower.

370
00:23:44,324 --> 00:23:45,225
I can't even.

371
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:49,563
Because your house is under construction
due to a leakage,

372
00:23:49,563 --> 00:23:51,731
you ate here, slept here, and washed here?

373
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:52,999
Yes.

374
00:23:56,002 --> 00:23:56,836
Sorry.

375
00:23:58,204 --> 00:23:59,039
Let's go.

376
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,141
Go where?

377
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:04,177
Are you going to live here
until the construction is over?

378
00:24:04,177 --> 00:24:05,412
Let's go to my house.

379
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:08,148
But Young Sik.

380
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:12,452
Since Yeo Woo Ran,
you never invited anyone to your house.

381
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,354
You're not a person,
so I'm letting you in.

382
00:24:14,354 --> 00:24:15,255
I see.

383
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:18,224
- Take your things.
- Okay.

384
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:20,493
- Where are your clothes?
- I'll take them, too.

385
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:26,499
(The master
of X-rated fantasy romance novels)

386
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:28,501
(Handshake and signing event
of MelanCholyCallme)

387
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,009
If I'm right,

388
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:42,115
Scriptwriter Wang will be here.

389
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:44,851
- Please write the date, too.
- Okay.

390
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:48,555
Thank you.

391
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:49,990
I'll make the story more erotic.

392
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,924
Great.

393
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:54,861
Hello.

394
00:24:57,197 --> 00:24:59,599
Hello. What's your name?

395
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:02,235
Kang Tae Ho.

396
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:08,942
Is it "Northern Duke
Felix's Big Size Has Changed?"

397
00:25:10,577 --> 00:25:12,512
What a cool name.

398
00:25:13,747 --> 00:25:17,317
It's even an X-rated
fantasy romance novel.

399
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:19,319
That's amazing,

400
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,488
Scriptwriter Wang.

401
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:25,725
Amazing.

402
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:32,198
No. I'm not Scriptwriter Wang.

403
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,567
No.

404
00:25:35,135 --> 00:25:36,603
Seriously?

405
00:25:36,603 --> 00:25:39,573
MelanCholyCallme was Scriptwriter Wang.

406
00:25:39,573 --> 00:25:40,807
I can't believe it.

407
00:25:44,945 --> 00:25:46,346
Wait a minute.

408
00:25:47,247 --> 00:25:48,415
What?

409
00:25:49,249 --> 00:25:51,551
Why is PD Tae Ho here?

410
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:52,652
What's going on between them?

411
00:25:53,153 --> 00:25:56,089
Did I just see something I shouldn't have?

412
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:58,158
Wait a minute. My gosh.

413
00:26:05,198 --> 00:26:06,266
What should I do?

414
00:26:06,633 --> 00:26:09,569
If PD Tae Ho reads "Northern Duke
Felix's Big Size Has Changed"...

415
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:15,208
The two drink wine.

416
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:17,844
There's heat in the air.

417
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:21,948
Their eyes meet, and they stare intently.

418
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:24,184
Just then,

419
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:28,188
Northern Duke Felix's big eyes
well up in tears.

420
00:26:29,489 --> 00:26:31,658
I cannot die like this.

421
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:33,493
I'm still a virgin.

422
00:26:36,963 --> 00:26:39,266
No.

423
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:42,602
Below his left chest...

424
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:45,505
are three small moles
in the shape of a triangle...

425
00:26:45,906 --> 00:26:48,441
exquisitely arranged...

426
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:57,784
No, he probably didn't find out.

427
00:26:57,784 --> 00:26:59,152
No, he did.

428
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:04,224
On his right side...

429
00:27:05,025 --> 00:27:07,661
is a scar in the shape of a cross.

430
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:20,040
(MelanCholyCallme is definitely
in a relationship.)

431
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,741
(Yes. Her descriptions of the male
character's body are detailed now.)

432
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:23,743
(Does her boyfriend know
he's the male lead of an X-rated novel?)

433
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:25,745
(Is her boyfriend the model of Felix?)

434
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:27,581
(Authors experience to write.)

435
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:31,384
No way.

436
00:27:32,352 --> 00:27:33,720
There's no way Scriptwriter Wang...

437
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:41,194
Whenever I get in there with you,

438
00:27:42,295 --> 00:27:45,131
I write without any trouble afterward.

439
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:55,342
No way.

440
00:28:02,702 --> 00:28:04,737
Young Sik, breakfast is ready. Come here.

441
00:28:07,473 --> 00:28:10,176
It smells good and it looks good.

442
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,345
The temperature's also good.

443
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:17,250
Perfect. It tastes good, too.

444
00:28:18,284 --> 00:28:19,585
My phone.

445
00:28:20,653 --> 00:28:22,188
It wasn't my phone ringing

446
00:28:23,122 --> 00:28:25,024
It's Young Sik's phone.

447
00:28:25,024 --> 00:28:26,692
(Scriptwriter Wang Jo Yeon)

448
00:28:27,226 --> 00:28:30,363
It may be an urgent call.

449
00:28:30,363 --> 00:28:31,397
Since it's Scriptwriter Wang...

450
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:37,236
Yes, Scriptwriter Wang? No, I'm CEO Ji.

451
00:28:37,236 --> 00:28:40,773
Young Sik is taking a shower now.

452
00:28:40,773 --> 00:28:42,041
Wait.

453
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:43,876
It's Scriptwriter Wang.

454
00:28:44,343 --> 00:28:45,278
Hello?

455
00:28:45,945 --> 00:28:46,913
Scriptwriter Wang, it's me.

456
00:28:46,913 --> 00:28:50,549
I'm enjoying a morning sauna
with Actor Ji.

457
00:28:51,784 --> 00:28:53,019
Really?

458
00:28:53,686 --> 00:28:56,689
Then you should get some rest.

459
00:28:56,689 --> 00:28:57,556
That...

460
00:28:57,556 --> 00:28:59,158
The script for the next episode
is done already, so don't worry.

461
00:28:59,158 --> 00:29:01,060
Is that his chest or just a lump?

462
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,462
Take a good rest and recharge your body.

463
00:29:03,462 --> 00:29:05,197
When did he work out so much?

464
00:29:05,197 --> 00:29:07,366
Tae Ho and I are doing a good job.

465
00:29:07,366 --> 00:29:08,734
But mine is flat.

466
00:29:08,734 --> 00:29:11,037
Okay. Take a rest.

467
00:29:11,504 --> 00:29:12,572
He even has...

468
00:29:13,506 --> 00:29:15,775
Why take someone else's call
without permission?

469
00:29:15,775 --> 00:29:16,943
Permission?

470
00:29:16,943 --> 00:29:19,211
I thought we were like family.
Your words upset me.

471
00:29:19,211 --> 00:29:21,314
I shouldn't have let you in.

472
00:29:22,381 --> 00:29:24,684
At least try the stew. It's tasty.

473
00:29:24,684 --> 00:29:26,218
I don't eat breakfast.

474
00:29:26,686 --> 00:29:27,887
Young Sik.

475
00:29:29,155 --> 00:29:32,391
But when did he work out so much?

476
00:29:40,566 --> 00:29:41,867
CEOs Cho and Ji.

477
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:44,303
Last night, I saw the ghost...

478
00:29:44,303 --> 00:29:45,838
- No.
- Excuse me?

479
00:29:46,405 --> 00:29:47,573
There's no ghost here.

480
00:29:47,573 --> 00:29:48,741
No?

481
00:29:48,741 --> 00:29:53,012
So don't even mention the word "dug"
from now on.

482
00:29:53,012 --> 00:29:54,580
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

483
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,048
While shooting "DUG," Mark also...

484
00:29:56,048 --> 00:29:58,084
You just said not to mention "dug."

485
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:00,953
Mark?

486
00:30:00,953 --> 00:30:03,489
Mark fell on his back,

487
00:30:03,489 --> 00:30:05,124
- so he got a concussion.
- What?

488
00:30:06,225 --> 00:30:09,962
It's not serious. He just got a bump.

489
00:30:09,962 --> 00:30:12,865
So he said a few days' rest will do.

490
00:30:12,865 --> 00:30:14,700
Don't worry.

491
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,704
Scriptwriter Wang said she wasn't feeling
very well, either.

492
00:30:18,704 --> 00:30:20,306
So she took a few days off.

493
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:24,176
- There!
- What?

494
00:30:24,176 --> 00:30:25,244
Sorry.

495
00:30:25,244 --> 00:30:27,880
The number of subscribers
of KICKKICKKICKKICK...

496
00:30:28,714 --> 00:30:30,182
has reached three million.

497
00:30:30,416 --> 00:30:31,617
Three million.

498
00:30:40,626 --> 00:30:42,395
We reached three million.

499
00:30:42,395 --> 00:30:45,665
Then you two have to do
a nude photoshoot together.

500
00:30:45,665 --> 00:30:46,566
What?

501
00:30:59,345 --> 00:31:03,082
(Episode 12-2
KICKKICKKICKKICK, To Be Continued)

502
00:31:03,916 --> 00:31:05,084
Hello?

503
00:31:05,084 --> 00:31:07,053
Mark, it's me.

504
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,522
How's your head? Are you okay?

505
00:31:09,522 --> 00:31:10,890
Did your IQ drop?

506
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:13,626
Do you not remember the songs you wrote?

507
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,396
I'm relieved to hear that.
Then it must not be that serious.

508
00:31:17,396 --> 00:31:18,364
Yes.

509
00:31:18,831 --> 00:31:21,033
You're going to take a rest?

510
00:31:21,033 --> 00:31:23,269
Okay.

511
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:25,504
Take a good rest.

512
00:31:32,044 --> 00:31:35,014
You scared me.

513
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:39,051
It's time for you to water your cilantro,
but you forgot this.

514
00:31:39,986 --> 00:31:41,887
Thanks.

515
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:49,695
Great weather today.

516
00:31:49,695 --> 00:31:50,596
Or not.

517
00:31:53,165 --> 00:31:54,667
- Joo Ha, about yesterday.
- No.

518
00:31:55,101 --> 00:31:56,669
If you're going to apologize
about what happened yesterday, don't.

519
00:31:56,669 --> 00:31:58,938
We drank beer yesterday,

520
00:31:58,938 --> 00:32:01,941
and when we kissed, I closed my eyes,

521
00:32:01,941 --> 00:32:03,709
which may mean I accepted it, but...

522
00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:06,045
What are you saying, Ga Joo Ha?

523
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,149
Anyway, in conclusion,

524
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:12,285
we got carried away by the atmosphere
and made a mistake yesterday.

525
00:32:12,285 --> 00:32:13,352
It wasn't a mistake.

526
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,154
What?

527
00:32:17,223 --> 00:32:18,357
It wasn't a mistake.

528
00:32:20,826 --> 00:32:21,794
I like you.

529
00:32:28,301 --> 00:32:29,602
Whenever I look at you,

530
00:32:32,071 --> 00:32:33,639
my heart strangely pounds hard.

531
00:32:35,474 --> 00:32:36,742
You always catch my eye.

532
00:32:38,678 --> 00:32:39,879
You always make me curious.

533
00:32:41,547 --> 00:32:42,748
You're always on my mind.

534
00:32:44,951 --> 00:32:46,185
Being close to you,

535
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,158
makes my heart race.

536
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,535
Even now?

537
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:40,206
You were right.

538
00:33:43,175 --> 00:33:44,644
So I've come to the conclusion...

539
00:33:46,445 --> 00:33:47,380
that I...

540
00:33:50,449 --> 00:33:51,851
like Ga Joo Ha.

541
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,154
With all my heart.

542
00:34:07,366 --> 00:34:08,334
Well...

543
00:34:13,906 --> 00:34:16,409
- You should water them.
- Yes.

544
00:34:18,544 --> 00:34:21,213
I have to water Cilantree.

545
00:34:37,997 --> 00:34:41,467
Did she use me as inspiration to write
that novel about the Northern Duke?

546
00:34:47,073 --> 00:34:49,675
I'm definitely sure.

547
00:34:50,643 --> 00:34:52,345
She tried to win my heart on purpose.

548
00:34:53,212 --> 00:34:54,280
Yes.

549
00:34:55,581 --> 00:34:56,682
Darn it.

550
00:35:06,592 --> 00:35:10,763
A nude photoshoot. What should I do?

551
00:35:13,065 --> 00:35:15,768
I'm enjoying a morning sauna
with Actor Ji.

552
00:35:19,405 --> 00:35:23,643
CEO Cho was unexpectedly muscular.

553
00:35:30,116 --> 00:35:32,585
Kickickickick forum.

554
00:35:35,021 --> 00:35:36,022
What?

555
00:35:36,022 --> 00:35:38,190
(Show us Actor Ji's body only.
It's obvious.)

556
00:35:38,391 --> 00:35:40,860
What? "An eye-terror?"

557
00:35:42,395 --> 00:35:43,729
"Get lost, PD Cho?"

558
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,365
"I want to pay
for the eyes that haven't seen..."

559
00:35:46,365 --> 00:35:48,000
These brats.

560
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,303
It's not like any of you
have seen my body.

561
00:35:56,242 --> 00:35:57,343
Darn it.

562
00:35:58,878 --> 00:36:00,212
I should work out.

563
00:36:00,746 --> 00:36:01,647
PD Cho.

564
00:36:02,348 --> 00:36:03,983
I'll be the star...

565
00:36:03,983 --> 00:36:06,586
of the nude photoshoot.

566
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:10,656
Nude photoshoot.

567
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:15,428
I can't let PD Cho beat me.

568
00:36:16,395 --> 00:36:17,897
I have to be better than Ji Jin Hee.

569
00:36:18,664 --> 00:36:19,932
My fingers hurt.

570
00:36:19,932 --> 00:36:22,168
- My fingers.
- No.

571
00:36:23,336 --> 00:36:27,073
Forty-six, forty-seven, forty-eight,
forty-nine, fifty.

572
00:36:27,473 --> 00:36:29,375
Fifty-one, fifty-two, fifty-three.

573
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:30,443
How many did you do?

574
00:36:30,443 --> 00:36:33,312
- I did three. No, five.
- Okay.

575
00:36:33,312 --> 00:36:34,580
Let's just do five more.

576
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,749
- We have a promise to keep.
- Are you ready?

577
00:36:36,749 --> 00:36:38,317
- Yes.
- Let's go.

578
00:36:38,317 --> 00:36:41,854
One, two, three, four, five.

579
00:36:41,854 --> 00:36:45,024
Six, seven, eight,
nine, ten, eleven, twelve...

580
00:36:45,024 --> 00:36:47,226
Sorry.

581
00:36:47,226 --> 00:36:48,160
What do you think you're doing?

582
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,730
Your posture is bad.
You should pose like this.

583
00:36:52,031 --> 00:36:54,200
Five, six, seven, eight...

584
00:36:56,435 --> 00:36:58,671
- What are you doing?
- Do you see that push-up bar?

585
00:36:58,671 --> 00:37:00,806
Bring that here
so we can exercise with that later.

586
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,708
I'm refreshed.

587
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:06,846
Here. Drink this.

588
00:37:08,014 --> 00:37:09,081
What's this?

589
00:37:09,448 --> 00:37:12,985
It's Young Sik's special chicken juice.

590
00:37:12,985 --> 00:37:15,121
We'll be doing the photoshoot soon.

591
00:37:15,121 --> 00:37:17,857
So we should take proteins...

592
00:37:17,857 --> 00:37:21,294
to look more muscular in the photoshoot.
It's good for both of us.

593
00:37:21,294 --> 00:37:24,463
Thank you so much.

594
00:37:24,463 --> 00:37:26,065
It's nothing. Drink up.

595
00:37:33,172 --> 00:37:34,307
Hey.

596
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:37,376
This is sweet. How can it be this sweet?

597
00:37:37,376 --> 00:37:38,344
- I know, right?
- Yes.

598
00:37:38,344 --> 00:37:42,481
It's a zero-sugar juice with a banana.

599
00:37:42,481 --> 00:37:44,917
Isn't it sweet?
I got rid of the smell of chicken.

600
00:37:52,758 --> 00:37:54,827
(White sugar)

601
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:01,867
It's made with zero sugar,
but it's sweeter than juice with sugar.

602
00:38:01,867 --> 00:38:05,238
They say zero-sugar products
are 200 times sweeter.

603
00:38:05,238 --> 00:38:06,339
That's why it's so sweet. I see.

604
00:38:06,339 --> 00:38:07,640
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

605
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,508
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

606
00:38:22,655 --> 00:38:24,023
What are you doing holding a dog chew?

607
00:38:24,023 --> 00:38:26,726
What? This looks small, but it's 15kg.

608
00:38:27,727 --> 00:38:28,895
What's this?

609
00:38:28,895 --> 00:38:30,963
Thank you for the chicken juice earlier.

610
00:38:30,963 --> 00:38:34,267
So I made oatmeal porridge
when you went to work.

611
00:38:34,267 --> 00:38:36,335
You need carbohydrates to exercise.

612
00:38:36,802 --> 00:38:38,504
So here.

613
00:38:39,038 --> 00:38:41,040
It smells savory and tasty.

614
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,408
Is this sugar-free?

615
00:38:56,489 --> 00:38:57,390
Bingo.

616
00:39:03,563 --> 00:39:04,530
Isn't it good?

617
00:39:07,767 --> 00:39:10,236
You're loving it. Good.

618
00:39:10,236 --> 00:39:11,170
Open your mouth.

619
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,672
That's right.

620
00:39:12,672 --> 00:39:14,173
Do you like it?

621
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:18,611
This is light.

622
00:39:26,419 --> 00:39:27,420
This is heavy.

623
00:39:29,822 --> 00:39:32,158
One, two, three.

624
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,767
Faster.

625
00:39:44,003 --> 00:39:45,671
This feels good.

626
00:39:45,671 --> 00:39:46,906
I'm getting a good pump.

627
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,343
Two, three.

628
00:39:54,513 --> 00:39:55,448
Perfect.

629
00:39:58,851 --> 00:40:00,286
This chicken juice is sweet.

630
00:40:09,061 --> 00:40:10,029
I love you.

631
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:14,100
Good. Before I change,

632
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,801
it's time for a body check.

633
00:40:15,801 --> 00:40:16,702
Good.

634
00:40:18,738 --> 00:40:19,872
Good.

635
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,174
What's this?

636
00:40:22,975 --> 00:40:24,343
What's this?

637
00:40:25,444 --> 00:40:26,345
What's this?

638
00:40:27,613 --> 00:40:29,715
I eat chicken breast every day.

639
00:40:29,715 --> 00:40:32,018
Why do I have fat all over my body?

640
00:40:33,753 --> 00:40:34,720
What?

641
00:40:35,554 --> 00:40:36,856
I don't feel good about this.

642
00:40:36,856 --> 00:40:38,925
I should check how much I weigh.

643
00:40:39,725 --> 00:40:40,927
This body fat...

644
00:40:45,331 --> 00:40:46,666
How disgusting.

645
00:40:46,666 --> 00:40:47,800
What?

646
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,504
- This body fat percentage...
- No way.

647
00:40:51,504 --> 00:40:53,005
How did I gain 1.5kg of body fat?

648
00:40:53,005 --> 00:40:54,473
This scale is wrong. It needs a beating.

649
00:40:54,473 --> 00:40:56,342
But I've only been eating chicken breast.

650
00:40:56,342 --> 00:40:57,510
Then...

651
00:40:58,444 --> 00:40:59,812
What?

652
00:41:00,513 --> 00:41:01,681
Why...

653
00:41:03,015 --> 00:41:05,451
Why am I gaining so much weight?

654
00:41:08,621 --> 00:41:09,655
Yes.

655
00:41:10,423 --> 00:41:14,460
Honey. Healthy honey.

656
00:41:17,129 --> 00:41:18,898
There. Flour.

657
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:21,467
Flour.

658
00:41:22,969 --> 00:41:24,904
- Stop right there.
- Goodness.

659
00:41:24,904 --> 00:41:25,972
Don't move.

660
00:41:25,972 --> 00:41:28,174
You planned this crime.

661
00:41:28,174 --> 00:41:29,442
That flour.

662
00:41:29,442 --> 00:41:31,877
Did you hate me
getting muscular that much?

663
00:41:31,877 --> 00:41:33,512
This is sugar-free flour.

664
00:41:33,512 --> 00:41:36,449
Don't be ridiculous. This is honey.

665
00:41:36,449 --> 00:41:38,551
Honey is good for you.

666
00:41:38,551 --> 00:41:40,052
How is honey good for you?

667
00:41:40,052 --> 00:41:41,621
This is sugar-free honey.

668
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,561
Okay.

669
00:41:50,529 --> 00:41:51,764
Enough.

670
00:41:52,465 --> 00:41:53,900
Already enough. Okay.

671
00:41:55,434 --> 00:41:56,669
Okay.

672
00:41:58,404 --> 00:42:03,142
For Jin Hee, let me add carrots
that are super healthy.

673
00:42:03,142 --> 00:42:05,811
Yes. They have a nice texture.

674
00:42:05,811 --> 00:42:07,513
Wait a minute.

675
00:42:07,513 --> 00:42:08,447
Right.

676
00:42:10,116 --> 00:42:11,317
Crackers.

677
00:42:17,523 --> 00:42:19,592
What? That was scary.

678
00:42:21,894 --> 00:42:24,897
I'll pour this chicken juice,

679
00:42:25,831 --> 00:42:26,766
and...

680
00:42:27,934 --> 00:42:29,268
as the delicacy...

681
00:42:34,607 --> 00:42:36,442
(White sugar)

682
00:42:36,976 --> 00:42:39,545
What's that? You did the same thing.

683
00:42:39,545 --> 00:42:41,647
- Sugar.
- No.

684
00:42:41,647 --> 00:42:43,149
No. This is sugar-free sugar.

685
00:42:43,149 --> 00:42:46,519
You said this chicken juice was sugar-free
with just a banana.

686
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:48,354
This is not sugar-free, you punk.

687
00:42:48,354 --> 00:42:49,555
"White sugar."

688
00:42:49,555 --> 00:42:51,457
"White sugar-free sugar."

689
00:42:51,457 --> 00:42:53,392
It has 20,000 calories.

690
00:42:54,193 --> 00:42:58,164
(Hanbang Building)

691
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:01,067
Four.

692
00:43:02,068 --> 00:43:03,002
Five.

693
00:43:04,303 --> 00:43:06,472
- Six.
- Good.

694
00:43:06,472 --> 00:43:08,274
- Seven.
- Nice.

695
00:43:08,274 --> 00:43:09,275
Eight.

696
00:43:10,009 --> 00:43:10,910
Nine.

697
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:14,146
- Last one. Ten.
- I'm getting a good pump.

698
00:43:16,182 --> 00:43:19,252
This is the end of today's exercise.

699
00:43:19,252 --> 00:43:20,653
You know your diet is the key, right?

700
00:43:20,653 --> 00:43:21,787
Of course.

701
00:43:22,855 --> 00:43:24,890
- I'll see you next time.
- Thanks, PD Kang.

702
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:27,360
This is effective.
I feel pumped right now.

703
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,561
It'll be a lower body workout next time.

704
00:43:28,561 --> 00:43:30,596
- Lower body?
- I think I'll make it.

705
00:43:30,596 --> 00:43:33,633
Let's forget about the past and play fair.

706
00:43:33,633 --> 00:43:35,501
And make a great photoshoot.

707
00:44:03,729 --> 00:44:06,165
I miss PD Tae Ho.

708
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:09,368
I want to hear his voice.

709
00:44:11,938 --> 00:44:12,905
No.

710
00:44:14,273 --> 00:44:15,741
I'm sure he read my novel.

711
00:44:15,741 --> 00:44:17,777
I'm sure he thinks of me
as the most shameless woman...

712
00:44:17,777 --> 00:44:20,112
in the world who earns money
by writing about her boyfriend's body.

713
00:44:21,347 --> 00:44:25,184
But PD Tae Ho might miss me, too.

714
00:44:25,184 --> 00:44:26,652
Of course not!

715
00:44:28,588 --> 00:44:29,488
Yes.

716
00:44:30,389 --> 00:44:31,357
Right.

717
00:44:31,991 --> 00:44:33,826
If he hears about my annual income,
he might be pleased.

718
00:44:34,293 --> 00:44:37,863
PD Tae Ho, I'll help you retire soon.

(Scriptwriter Wang Jo Yeon)

720
00:44:48,341 --> 00:44:49,342
It's her.

721
00:44:49,976 --> 00:44:51,978
No. Sorry.

722
00:44:51,978 --> 00:44:53,679
You naughty little hand.

723
00:44:55,181 --> 00:44:56,282
I'm taking away your phone.

724
00:44:57,016 --> 00:44:58,918
I'll keep my phone
somewhere I can never...

725
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,327
It's broken.

726
00:45:22,642 --> 00:45:25,778
Unable to connect.
You will be directed to voicemail.

727
00:45:25,778 --> 00:45:27,046
What?

728

Unable to connect...

729
00:45:34,086 --> 00:45:37,390
I should kill myself.

Unable to connect.
You will be directed to voicemail.

731
00:45:40,826 --> 00:45:44,163
What is she doing?

732
00:45:52,104 --> 00:45:54,407
PD Kang seems kind of different today,
doesn't he?

733
00:45:54,407 --> 00:45:55,541
Did he have a rough night?

734
00:45:56,008 --> 00:45:56,842
I think so.

735
00:45:58,844 --> 00:46:00,913
PD Kang, if you're not feeling good today,
we can do this next time and...

736
00:46:00,913 --> 00:46:02,715
There's no next time.

737
00:46:02,715 --> 00:46:05,084
Three hundred dumbbell squats. Go.

738
00:46:08,821 --> 00:46:10,089
Get ready instantly.

739
00:46:12,925 --> 00:46:14,827
- One hundred ninety seven.
- One hundred ninety seven.

740
00:46:17,897 --> 00:46:19,899
- One hundred ninety eight.
- One hundred ninety eight.

741
00:46:22,368 --> 00:46:23,769
PD Tae Ho, I can't anymore.

742
00:46:23,769 --> 00:46:26,439
You can't do anything
with such a weak mind.

743
00:46:26,439 --> 00:46:28,941
You can't leave this rooftop
until you reach 300.

744
00:46:30,476 --> 00:46:31,377
One hundred ninety nine.

745
00:46:31,377 --> 00:46:34,080
- I can't anymore.
- Two hundred.

746
00:46:47,126 --> 00:46:49,128

Unable to connect.
You will be directed to voicemail.

748
00:46:55,334 --> 00:46:58,604
Fine. It's over!

749
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:26,732
<i>It's like a shampoo</i>

750
00:47:28,134 --> 00:47:30,336
<i>The taste like soap</i>

751
00:47:31,737 --> 00:47:37,743
<i>None of it makes me keep eating,
none of it</i>

752
00:47:39,745 --> 00:47:42,214
<i>It's like a shampoo</i>

753
00:47:43,583 --> 00:47:45,818
<i>The taste like soap</i>

754
00:47:47,153 --> 00:47:53,025
<i>I needed none of it, none of it</i>

755
00:47:58,901 --> 00:48:00,866
<i>Bitterness</i>

756
00:48:06,576 --> 00:48:08,307
<i>Bitterness</i>

757
00:48:18,884 --> 00:48:20,286
Bravo.

758
00:48:21,087 --> 00:48:24,090
You hurt your head,
and you were also busy.

759
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:26,759
Yet, you still arranged the song
perfectly.

760
00:48:26,759 --> 00:48:28,661
Mark, you're the best, indeed.

761
00:48:30,129 --> 00:48:32,198
Mark, you're a genius. A total genius.

762
00:48:32,198 --> 00:48:34,800
You're a true genius.

763
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,136
But you're not quite
as great a genius as I, No In Seong, am.

764
00:48:37,136 --> 00:48:38,337
Not yet.

765
00:48:38,337 --> 00:48:40,539
But I missed you so much. Very much.

766
00:48:40,539 --> 00:48:41,908
Calm down.

767
00:48:41,908 --> 00:48:43,242
- Okay.
- Relax.

768
00:48:43,242 --> 00:48:45,177
Mark, that was a great song.

769
00:48:45,177 --> 00:48:47,280
- Thanks.
- It was great.

770
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:57,423
I'm never working out
with that crazy guy again.

771
00:48:57,423 --> 00:48:59,392
My thighs hurt so much.

772
00:48:59,392 --> 00:49:00,793
My butt hurts so much.

773
00:49:00,793 --> 00:49:02,061
After a long time, I...

774
00:49:02,061 --> 00:49:03,930
CEOs Ji and Cho, good morning.

775
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:06,332
- Hey.
- Or not.

776
00:49:06,332 --> 00:49:08,534
Did you two come back from the dead?

777
00:49:08,935 --> 00:49:11,304
Because of some crazy punk...

778
00:49:11,304 --> 00:49:14,440
By the way, Scriptwriter Joo Ha.
You heard the news about Mark, right?

779
00:49:15,141 --> 00:49:15,841
What news?

780
00:49:15,841 --> 00:49:18,945
He got an offer from
Bebruno Mars' company for a record deal.

781
00:49:18,945 --> 00:49:21,881
He thought hard about it
and decided to go.

782
00:49:23,482 --> 00:49:25,217
What are you saying?

783
00:49:25,217 --> 00:49:26,419
Didn't you know, Scriptwriter Joo Ha?

784
00:49:26,419 --> 00:49:29,121
I think he might be flying out today.

785
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:32,124
Wait.

786
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:36,896
Unable to connect.
You will be directed to voicemail.

787
00:49:36,896 --> 00:49:38,331
Please record a message after...

788
00:49:39,031 --> 00:49:40,766
CEO Ji, please take this.

789
00:49:45,104 --> 00:49:48,608
Mark finally decided to leave.

790
00:49:48,841 --> 00:49:50,443
He must be heartbroken.

791
00:49:50,443 --> 00:49:52,478
Don't worry about others.

792
00:49:52,912 --> 00:49:54,914
Worry about yourselves.

793
00:49:55,615 --> 00:49:57,950
No, don't do this.

794
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:00,286
But we've just come to work.

795
00:50:00,286 --> 00:50:01,454
Let's exercise.

796
00:50:01,454 --> 00:50:02,955
Wait. Please.

797
00:50:03,155 --> 00:50:04,790
Lee Mark, why isn't he picking up?

798
00:50:07,093 --> 00:50:08,127
What...

799
00:50:10,396 --> 00:50:13,599
Joo Ha, by the time you read this message,

800
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,067
I'll be on a plane.

801
00:50:15,968 --> 00:50:17,503
I thought hard about this.

802
00:50:18,304 --> 00:50:21,607
I got the opportunity to release an album
with the best label in the US,

803
00:50:21,607 --> 00:50:23,142
but I have to leave you again.

804
00:50:24,243 --> 00:50:25,278
But...

805
00:50:26,412 --> 00:50:28,214
I decided to think more about myself.

806
00:50:28,981 --> 00:50:30,850
So you should also focus
only on yourself, too, Joo Ha.

807
00:50:33,152 --> 00:50:35,922
I'm going to release an album in Atlantis,

808
00:50:35,922 --> 00:50:37,723
become as famous as Bebruno Mars,

809
00:50:37,723 --> 00:50:39,625
and come to you as a surprise.

810
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:41,994
Even if you regret not having said yes
to me, it'll be too late by then.

811
00:50:43,729 --> 00:50:45,798
We'll still be friends,

812
00:50:45,798 --> 00:50:48,501
so I'll let you benefit
from being friends with a superstar.

813
00:50:49,335 --> 00:50:51,203
When I get adjusted
to the new environment, I'll call you.

814
00:50:52,405 --> 00:50:54,740
You can do it! Let's go, Ga Joo Ha!

815
00:50:55,308 --> 00:50:56,709
Let's go, Lee Mark!

816
00:50:59,712 --> 00:51:03,616
Where's the plane?

817
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,986
The plane is there.

818
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:13,359
Goodbye, Lee Mark.

819
00:51:14,093 --> 00:51:16,662
Go and come back as a global star.

820
00:51:17,096 --> 00:51:18,664
Let's go, Lee Mark!

821
00:51:33,546 --> 00:51:34,513
Goodbye.

822
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:38,918
- Bye.
- He's gone.

823
00:51:42,488 --> 00:51:44,090
Bury the memory in your heart,

824
00:51:44,557 --> 00:51:46,492
and move on
from the plane that already left.

825
00:51:46,959 --> 00:51:48,060
Let's go now, Joo Ha.

826
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:50,129
No. Mark.

827
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:53,266
He's not trying to get us ripped.

828
00:51:53,266 --> 00:51:55,167
He's just trying to kill us.

829
00:51:55,167 --> 00:51:56,836
He's a devil.

830
00:51:56,836 --> 00:51:59,538
He's a mole on Don Man Hui's side.

831
00:51:59,538 --> 00:52:02,642
He's trying to get rid of us
and take over this company.

832
00:52:02,642 --> 00:52:04,143
- That bastard.
- He's a jerk.

833
00:52:04,143 --> 00:52:06,312
- It hurts.
- We have to cut him off from the start.

834
00:52:06,312 --> 00:52:08,014
We have to cut him off from the start.

835
00:52:08,014 --> 00:52:10,549
You punk, come here.

836
00:52:10,549 --> 00:52:12,585
You little brat.

837
00:52:12,585 --> 00:52:13,853
You bastard.

838
00:52:14,053 --> 00:52:15,888
Don't pull my pants.

839
00:52:16,689 --> 00:52:18,591
What do you plan to do...

840
00:52:18,591 --> 00:52:20,760
with that rotten lower body and mind?

841
00:52:21,861 --> 00:52:25,731
It seems PD Tae Ho is having
a very hard time.

842
00:52:26,732 --> 00:52:28,167
Get up.

843
00:52:48,554 --> 00:52:52,224
Baek Ji Won, what is it?

844
00:52:56,362 --> 00:52:58,197
The three moles in a triangle.

845
00:52:59,799 --> 00:53:01,767
How did you know that?

846
00:53:01,767 --> 00:53:03,769
That's not the point.

847
00:53:07,807 --> 00:53:13,112
I'm the mental performance coach
Baek Ji Won of KICKKICKKICKKICK.

848
00:53:13,112 --> 00:53:15,848
You can trust me and tell me everything.

849
00:53:22,822 --> 00:53:25,057
Try calling her again.

850
00:53:25,758 --> 00:53:28,261
You know Scriptwriter Wang is
really timid.

851
00:53:28,494 --> 00:53:29,695
There's no need.

852
00:53:30,963 --> 00:53:33,232
She violated my portrait rights
without permission.

853
00:53:33,799 --> 00:53:37,069
No, she might've just used me.

854
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:40,940
You know Scriptwriter Wang
isn't someone who would do such a thing.

855
00:53:42,074 --> 00:53:43,376
I'm not sure anymore.

856
00:53:43,943 --> 00:53:45,778
I'm not sure
what I know about her anymore.

857
00:53:50,383 --> 00:53:51,417
Then...

858
00:53:53,653 --> 00:53:56,222
as someone who was a fan of hers
since her first novel,

859
00:53:56,222 --> 00:53:57,790
I'll guarantee it.

860
00:53:59,325 --> 00:54:00,226
What?

861
00:54:01,027 --> 00:54:03,629
The new experience of authors...

862
00:54:03,629 --> 00:54:07,300
is always naturally shown in their works.
Isn't that right?

863
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,504
Your experience and values...

864
00:54:11,504 --> 00:54:15,741
are shown in your camera angles
and editing, aren't they?

865
00:54:18,177 --> 00:54:22,715
Scriptwriter Wang really likes you.

866
00:54:25,151 --> 00:54:29,221
But it's her first time dating someone,
so she's not experienced.

867
00:54:29,221 --> 00:54:32,191
And she has a bad disposition
of avoiding things.

868
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,092
You know that, right?

869
00:54:38,097 --> 00:54:41,133
So reach out to her first...

870
00:54:42,435 --> 00:54:45,605
since you're braver
and more mature, PD Tae Ho.

871
00:55:01,754 --> 00:55:03,956
That's our camper van.

872
00:55:11,297 --> 00:55:12,198
What?

873
00:55:17,703 --> 00:55:20,573
PD Tae Ho.

874
00:55:20,573 --> 00:55:21,874
How could you do that?

875
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:25,778
What?

876
00:55:26,412 --> 00:55:28,547
You wrote an adult novel
about your boyfriend's body,

877
00:55:29,081 --> 00:55:31,217
and when you got caught,
you just disappeared.

878
00:55:31,217 --> 00:55:32,451
You wouldn't even pick up.

879
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:35,955
Did you call me?

880
00:55:36,155 --> 00:55:38,925
Whatever the situation,
my girlfriend ghosted on me.

881
00:55:38,925 --> 00:55:39,959
Of course, I called you.

882
00:55:43,129 --> 00:55:45,031
Actually...

883
00:55:47,667 --> 00:55:49,869
I had no choice.

884
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:52,438
I got caught...

885
00:55:52,438 --> 00:55:56,008
by the person I least hoped
would find out about me.

886
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:58,778
I was scared.

887
00:55:59,812 --> 00:56:02,915
So I had to hide.

888
00:56:04,617 --> 00:56:07,486
I was scared you'd abandon me.

889
00:56:11,657 --> 00:56:12,658
I...

890
00:56:14,794 --> 00:56:18,064
felt betrayed and angry at first.

891
00:56:19,065 --> 00:56:20,266
But that anger...

892
00:56:23,369 --> 00:56:25,504
all turned into worry...

893
00:56:29,442 --> 00:56:30,810
thinking...

894
00:56:33,579 --> 00:56:35,781
you'd leave me like that,
Scriptwriter Wang.

895
00:56:40,052 --> 00:56:41,687
PD Tae Ho.

896
00:56:43,923 --> 00:56:46,492
How can you be so charming like that?

897
00:56:48,594 --> 00:56:50,463
More than Felix's Big Size?

898
00:56:51,264 --> 00:56:52,498
Don't say that.

899
00:56:56,335 --> 00:56:57,670
Scriptwriter Wang.

900
00:57:00,339 --> 00:57:03,576
You're really petty and annoying.

901
00:57:05,411 --> 00:57:06,479
But you're beautiful...

902
00:57:08,748 --> 00:57:09,815
and cute.

903
00:57:13,853 --> 00:57:14,854
I...

904
00:57:16,722 --> 00:57:17,957
Scriptwriter Wang.

905
00:57:21,727 --> 00:57:22,762
I love you.

906
00:58:08,641 --> 00:58:09,609
Well...

907
00:58:10,676 --> 00:58:12,011
Min Jae.

908
00:58:13,012 --> 00:58:15,281
I know I'm late,

909
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,986
but I feel the same.

910
00:58:24,991 --> 00:58:25,925
About what?

911
00:58:28,728 --> 00:58:29,629
I...

912
00:58:31,264 --> 00:58:33,099
also like you, Min Jae.

913
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,134
A lot.

914
00:58:54,353 --> 00:58:58,224

for getting three million subscribers!)

916
00:59:01,027 --> 00:59:02,094
(Actor Ji and PD Cho's nude photoshoot
will be published.)

917
00:59:02,094 --> 00:59:03,195
(To protect your eyes, it's been changed
to a semi-nude photoshoot.)

918
00:59:03,195 --> 00:59:06,399
Three, two, one.

919
00:59:07,433 --> 00:59:10,336
Hello. I'm CEO Ji of KICKKICKKICKKICK.

920
00:59:10,336 --> 00:59:11,537
And I'm CEO Cho Young Sik.

921
00:59:11,537 --> 00:59:14,440
Kickickickick finally reached
three million subscribers.

922
00:59:15,374 --> 00:59:16,509
Great.

923
00:59:17,276 --> 00:59:20,246
So the nude photoshoot we promised...

924
00:59:20,246 --> 00:59:22,148
Semi-nude.

925
00:59:22,148 --> 00:59:24,216
It's a semi-nude photoshoot
to protect your eyes.

926
00:59:24,216 --> 00:59:27,386
Like we announced,
it will be a semi-nude photoshoot.

927
00:59:28,788 --> 00:59:31,324
CEO Cho, take off your robe.

928
00:59:39,065 --> 00:59:41,167
(KICKKICKKICKKICK channel analysis)

929
00:59:41,167 --> 00:59:43,069
(The current number
of subscribers is 2,998,220.)

930
00:59:43,236 --> 00:59:45,504
Wait.
The number of subscribers is dropping.

931
00:59:45,504 --> 00:59:47,206
We lost 2,200 subscribers.

932
00:59:47,206 --> 00:59:48,741
Put it back on.

933
00:59:48,741 --> 00:59:50,743
We cancel our promise.

934
00:59:50,743 --> 00:59:51,877
What?

935
00:59:51,877 --> 00:59:54,580
(The current number
of subscribers is 3,000,000.)

936
00:59:55,948 --> 00:59:58,050
The number rose again.
We have three million again.

937
00:59:58,417 --> 00:59:59,552
Keep the promise.

938
00:59:59,819 --> 01:00:02,154
- What should we do?
- Keep the promise.

939
01:00:02,154 --> 01:00:02,989
Do it.

940
01:00:02,989 --> 01:00:04,957
What now?

941
01:00:04,957 --> 01:00:05,925
Cancel it.

942
01:00:05,925 --> 01:00:08,494
What's going on?

943
01:00:10,162 --> 01:00:13,165
I'll now shoot pictures of both of you.

944
01:00:13,165 --> 01:00:14,133
Let's go.

945
01:00:14,133 --> 01:00:16,936
The first pose is the pose
of "The Creation of Adam" by Michelangelo.

946
01:00:16,936 --> 01:00:19,105
Make your index fingers meet.

947
01:00:19,105 --> 01:00:22,041
Let's go. Good. The creation.

948
01:00:22,041 --> 01:00:23,943
Okay. Stop.

949
01:00:23,943 --> 01:00:25,211
Yes.

950
01:00:52,104 --> 01:00:55,074
Stay like that. I'll take a close-up shot.

951
01:00:55,074 --> 01:00:57,376
Stay like that. It's a close-up shot.

952
01:00:57,376 --> 01:00:59,645
- Don't.
- Don't come close.

953
01:00:59,645 --> 01:01:00,746
Okay.

954
01:01:06,452 --> 01:01:07,286
No.

955
01:01:07,286 --> 01:01:09,956
(Is this a broadcasting mishap?
What a mess.)

956
01:01:09,956 --> 01:01:11,457
You punk, I told you not to come close.

957
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:19,265
Thank you, everyone. Thanks to all of you,

958
01:01:19,265 --> 01:01:21,968

959
01:01:24,403 --> 01:01:28,241

the semi-nude photoshoot...

960
01:01:28,241 --> 01:01:30,810

961
01:01:32,345 --> 01:01:34,647
Also, CEO Ji here...

got nominated for the Grand Prize
for the Baeksang Variety Show Awards...

963

with "Tails of Tales of Camping."

964
01:01:42,822 --> 01:01:45,424
That was all thanks to all of you.

965
01:01:45,424 --> 01:01:48,494
We will keep on making fun content...

966
01:01:48,494 --> 01:01:49,962
