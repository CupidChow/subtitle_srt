1
00:00:00,093 --> 00:00:01,194
(All characters, organizations,)

2
00:00:01,194 --> 00:00:02,629
(and events in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:04,030
(Broadcasting guidelines were followed
during the shooting of animals.)

4
00:00:33,693 --> 00:00:34,794
Are you okay?

5
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:37,597
Why am I in a camper van?

6
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:42,536
I know where the beers are stacked.

7
00:00:42,802 --> 00:00:44,204
Just follow me.

8
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:46,506
You're a jerk.

9
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:47,507
Pull yourself together.

10
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:51,077
You have no idea how upset I am.

11
00:00:51,678 --> 00:00:52,612
Scriptwriter Wang.

12
00:00:56,316 --> 00:00:58,184
- Move.
- What?

13
00:00:58,184 --> 00:00:59,186
Move out.

14
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:05,258
Scriptwriter Wang.

15
00:01:07,761 --> 00:01:09,629
- Don't look for me.
- What?

16
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:11,965
I said, don't look for me.

17
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:19,039
What's wrong with her?

18
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:24,277
(The one-and-only therapeutic camping show
"TTC!")

19
00:01:24,277 --> 00:01:25,645
(Let's go camping
to naturally get to know others!)

20
00:01:25,645 --> 00:01:27,547
(You watched the pre-leased video
that was uploaded today, right?)

21
00:01:27,547 --> 00:01:29,049
(Join this unexpected journey
with these campers, KICKERs.)

22
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:30,550
(If you know who Camper One is,
please comment.)

23
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:32,485
Min Jae, when did you say
the broadcast was airing?

24
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:34,387
We have three minutes left.
Wait three more minutes.

25
00:01:34,387 --> 00:01:35,689
- Three minutes.
- Calm down.

26
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:36,823
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

27
00:01:36,823 --> 00:01:38,458
You're shaking.

28
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:40,327
Did the show start?

29
00:01:40,327 --> 00:01:41,161
No.

30
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:43,930
The pre-released video received
positive reactions,

31
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,732
so we got
so many camping gear sponsorships.

32
00:01:45,732 --> 00:01:47,534
- Sponsorship?
- Really?

33
00:01:47,534 --> 00:01:49,169
Let's take just a few...

34
00:01:49,169 --> 00:01:52,172
and give the rest to the KICKERs
who helped us find out...

35
00:01:52,172 --> 00:01:53,974
who Camper One is.

36
00:01:53,974 --> 00:01:56,076
- What's this slingshot for?
- To scare away wild animals.

37
00:01:56,076 --> 00:01:57,444
I see.

38
00:01:57,444 --> 00:01:59,646
Stop, everyone.
Put everything away for now.

39
00:01:59,646 --> 00:02:02,515
Put everything away.
This isn't the time for that.

40
00:02:02,515 --> 00:02:04,484
- Did everyone put everything back in?
- Yes.

41
00:02:04,484 --> 00:02:06,820
I don't see Scriptwriter Wang
today as well.

42
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,455
Scriptwriter Wang? Where is she?

43
00:02:08,455 --> 00:02:10,056
I haven't seen her for some time.

44
00:02:10,056 --> 00:02:13,093
She said she'd take a few days off
for personal reasons.

45
00:02:13,093 --> 00:02:14,160
What?

46
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,595
Our show is up now.

47
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:17,797
- Sit down.
- Let's get ready to watch.

48
00:02:17,797 --> 00:02:19,199
(Watch a new episode of "TTC" now.)

49
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:21,935
- Should I play it now?
- Yes.

50
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:22,802
Should I?

51
00:02:25,138 --> 00:02:26,139
Okay, I'll play it.

52
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:28,975
It's starting now.

53
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:49,262
Amazing.

54
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:53,533
How are people reacting?

55
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:55,368
- Do we have positive reactions?
- Wait. I'll check.

56
00:02:56,336 --> 00:02:58,305
Someone said
"I want to go camping with them."

57
00:02:58,305 --> 00:02:59,839
Do they want to go camping?

58
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:02,342
We're getting explosive reactions.
There are so many comments.

59
00:03:02,342 --> 00:03:04,611
We have over 400,000 subscribers.

60
00:03:04,611 --> 00:03:06,146
Four hundred thousand?

61
00:03:06,146 --> 00:03:09,416
PD Kang,
congratulations on your first show.

62
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:12,319
I hope you hit the jackpot.

63
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,754
Congratulations.

64
00:03:14,754 --> 00:03:19,426
Despite the poor environment,
this great show was made...

65
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,728
thanks to me, first of all.

66
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,129
You jerk.

67
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:26,299
And I also want
to thank CEO Ji and PD Cho.

68
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:28,702
You two did a great job...

69
00:03:28,702 --> 00:03:32,339
as the CEOs of KICKKICKKICKKICK,
my senior, and the MC of "TTC."

70
00:03:32,339 --> 00:03:34,441
I also want to thank PD Min Jae
and Scriptwriter Joo Ha...

71
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:36,710
for supporting me all the time.

72
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,510
You're the best.

73
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,546
<i>Stop the season</i>

74
00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:42,182
And you, too, Mark,
for making the great "TTC" song.

75
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,285
- Also...
- You don't have to thank me.

76
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:46,853
I know I was a big help,

77
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:50,223
but I just did my job diligently.
That's all.

78
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:52,425
Okay. Let's say you did.

79
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:55,862
Now, let's diligently promote our show.

80
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:58,231
KICKKICKKICKKICK self-promotion,
let's go!

81
00:03:58,231 --> 00:03:59,933
Let's go!

82
00:04:01,468 --> 00:04:02,602
(You've never seen camping like this one.)

83
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,407
(This is a new kind of camping.)

84
00:04:07,874 --> 00:04:09,309
(I've only seen this kind of camping
in movies.)

85
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,444
(You could be chosen someday.)

86
00:04:11,444 --> 00:04:13,680
(KICKKICKKICKKICK deserves its name.
That camping seems fun.)

87
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:16,783
(Do you want to share?)

88
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,928
Okay.

89
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:29,863
And this one...

90
00:04:29,863 --> 00:04:30,864
Everyone.

91
00:04:30,864 --> 00:04:34,067
Drink a cup of coffee each while you work.

92
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:39,239
What's this, CEO Ji?
It feels like product placement.

93
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:41,975
It's exactly like the product placement
in dramas that appear abruptly.

94
00:04:41,975 --> 00:04:43,310
Wait a minute.

95
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,378
Our show isn't that big
to get any produce placement.

96
00:04:45,378 --> 00:04:46,980
Did you sign for an advertisement
behind our backs?

97
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,349
- No.
- I've heard about things like these.

98
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:50,917
You're so mean, CEO Ji. Meanie.

99
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:52,953
That's not it.

100
00:04:52,953 --> 00:04:54,187
I'm Actor Ji.

101
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:58,325
I gave this coffee out to the people
in the broadcasting station last time...

102
00:04:58,325 --> 00:05:00,827
and I tried it myself, and it was great.

103
00:05:00,827 --> 00:05:03,997
So whenever I'm tired,
I make myself a cup of coffee with this.

104
00:05:03,997 --> 00:05:05,465
You guys seemed tired,

105
00:05:05,465 --> 00:05:08,535
so I made coffee for all of you myself.

106
00:05:09,002 --> 00:05:10,937
Okay. But this is actually good.

107
00:05:10,937 --> 00:05:11,671
I know, right?

108
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:13,707
I'm working out,
so I won't drink instant coffee.

109
00:05:13,707 --> 00:05:17,010
It's okay to drink this one.
It has no sugar.

110
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,478
- It's zero-sugar.
- What?

111
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:21,081
The sweetness is there,
but without any sugar.

112
00:05:21,081 --> 00:05:24,284
What was that comment?
You sounded so natural.

113
00:05:24,284 --> 00:05:26,219
This definitely sounds
like product placement. I'm suspicious.

114
00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:27,187
Same.

115
00:05:27,187 --> 00:05:29,222
I can bet my life as an actor.

116
00:05:30,524 --> 00:05:32,225
- How can this have no sugar?
- Exactly.

117
00:05:32,225 --> 00:05:34,060
It feels like my brain,
which stopped working, is working again.

118
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,395
This is so good.

119
00:05:36,363 --> 00:05:38,164
- Delicious.
- This is good.

120
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:41,234
Whenever we're hiding like this,
they never show themselves.

121
00:05:41,234 --> 00:05:42,068
Exactly.

122
00:05:43,904 --> 00:05:45,005
You.

123
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:47,574
We're undercover, but you can't take
your eyes off your phone.

124
00:05:47,574 --> 00:05:50,176
That's why you never notice anything.

125
00:05:50,176 --> 00:05:51,177
Wait.

126
00:05:51,177 --> 00:05:54,548
Isn't this that camping show
that you were on?

127
00:05:54,548 --> 00:05:56,750
Right. Was the first episode
being broadcast today?

128
00:05:57,584 --> 00:05:59,519
If this becomes a success,

129
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,556
are you going to quit being a detective
and become an influencer?

130
00:06:02,556 --> 00:06:04,191
Not everyone can become an influencer.

131
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:06,326
But it's the trend these days.

132
00:06:06,326 --> 00:06:08,728
Non-celebrities that were
on dating reality shows...

133
00:06:10,864 --> 00:06:14,501
Wait, this man looks familiar.

134
00:06:16,603 --> 00:06:18,104
- Camper One?
- Yes.

135
00:06:18,104 --> 00:06:19,005
Does he look familiar to you, too?

136
00:06:19,806 --> 00:06:22,242
I've seen him somewhere.

137
00:06:23,543 --> 00:06:25,579
But I don't remember.

138
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:26,613
Wait a minute.

139
00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:28,815
This is him.

140
00:06:28,815 --> 00:06:30,750
- Who?
- It's him.

141
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,953
The serial killer of Dongyeom-dong.

142
00:06:33,687 --> 00:06:34,588
Kim Yeon Swae.

143
00:06:35,322 --> 00:06:37,858
(Killer of six people,
Kim Yeon Swae (36, male))

144
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:39,893
(He was the serial killer Kim Yeon Swae
who lost his memory?!)

145
00:06:40,126 --> 00:06:41,595
(How in the world
can something like this happen?)

146
00:06:41,595 --> 00:06:42,529
(They deceived the viewers.)

147
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:45,031
(KICKKICKKICKKICK serial murders,
The show was manipulated.)

148
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:46,032
(Do you want to share?)

149
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:47,334
(Number of subscribers, 330,000)

150
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:51,671
(Episode 4-1
You Are Surrounded)

151
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:55,375
Early this morning, Camper One
who went camping with Actor Ji...

152
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,911
on "TTC," the representative show
of KICKKICKKICKKICK...

153
00:06:57,911 --> 00:07:00,881
that is also the number-one show
on Setflix,

154
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:02,582
turned out to be a serial killer,

155
00:07:02,582 --> 00:07:05,252
so South Korea is in a state of shock.

156
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:07,954
To match the purpose of the show,
"Tails of Tales of Camping,"

157
00:07:07,954 --> 00:07:10,590
Actor Ji suggests Camper One
who is sitting in the alley...

158
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,759
to go camping with him in this scene.

159
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:15,862
But people are suspicious
saying Actor Ji may have already known...

160
00:07:15,862 --> 00:07:17,731
who Camper One was and cast him anyway.

161
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:19,933
Suspicions are growing.

162
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:23,136
Camper Three is even a police officer,

163
00:07:23,136 --> 00:07:25,805
adding to this controversy.

164
00:07:25,805 --> 00:07:28,875
The number of subscribers of
KICKKICKKICKKICK has decreased by 70,000.

165
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,211
We've tried calling KICKKICKKICKKICK,

166
00:07:31,211 --> 00:07:32,712
but they won't pick up.

167
00:07:32,712 --> 00:07:34,147
Pick up, guys.

168
00:07:34,147 --> 00:07:36,082
This is what I think.

169
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:37,984
If the show was truly not manipulated,

170
00:07:37,984 --> 00:07:40,787
Actor Ji and CEO Cho,
the representatives of KICKKICKKICKKICK,

171
00:07:40,787 --> 00:07:44,958
should give a proper explanation
about the identity of Camper One.

172
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:51,164
No wonder he was good at using a knife.

173
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:55,535
He was strangely good at digging, too.

174
00:07:55,535 --> 00:07:57,604
Everything was a foreshadowing.

175
00:07:57,604 --> 00:08:00,941
If you remember anything
that Kim Yeon Swae said,

176
00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:02,609
please tell me even the smallest things.

177
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:03,877
Okay.

178
00:08:03,877 --> 00:08:06,746
About the performance fee
and the post-shoot after the shoot,

179
00:08:06,746 --> 00:08:09,149
Scriptwriter Wang had a talk with him,

180
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:10,850
But she's currently on leave.

181
00:08:12,552 --> 00:08:14,955
Everyone, hurry and...

182
00:08:15,722 --> 00:08:17,457
I'll try calling her again.

183
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,202
Where on earth are you at this situation,
Scriptwriter Wang?

184
00:08:38,612 --> 00:08:42,916
<i>Jeonggueop Jineon suri suri maha suri</i>

185
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,485

00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:50,457
<i>Suri suri maha suri su suri svaha</i>

Eat one each.

189
00:08:57,097 --> 00:08:58,031
Eat one each.

190
00:08:58,031 --> 00:08:59,065
What's this?

191
00:08:59,065 --> 00:09:02,369
CEO Ji says he's fine,
but I know he's not.

192
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:04,604
Think about it.
The non-celebrity he cast himself...

193
00:09:04,604 --> 00:09:05,839
turned out to be a serial killer.

194
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,974
He even stayed with that serial killer
for one night and two days.

195
00:09:07,974 --> 00:09:08,842
I'm fine.

196
00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:11,177
Don't say anything.

197
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:12,812
- You're not okay.
- Of course, not.

198
00:09:14,014 --> 00:09:16,850
We reached 400,000 subscribers
but lost a bunch right away.

199
00:09:17,717 --> 00:09:21,821
Actor Ji emerged
as the icon of manipulation of the era.

200
00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:22,956
What?

201
00:09:22,956 --> 00:09:24,057
What did I...

202
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:26,960
On the KICKKICKKICKKICK online community,

203
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,529
there are so many comments
saying the show is manipulated.

204
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:31,631
"Will Ji Jin Hee turn over a new leaf
as the best actor in manipulation?"

205
00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:34,901
That wasn't a manipulation.

206
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:37,037
"Ji Jin Hee is old
and being ugly manipulating shows."

207
00:09:37,637 --> 00:09:39,105
Ugly? I'm not being...

208
00:09:39,105 --> 00:09:41,942
- "Ji Jin Hee is..."
- That's enough.

209
00:09:41,942 --> 00:09:43,910
Should we block the KICKKICKKICKKICK
online community first?

210
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,212
No. The moment we block it,

211
00:09:45,212 --> 00:09:47,180
it will mean we're admitting
we manipulated the show.

212
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,515
- Right.
- So, no way.

213
00:09:50,617 --> 00:09:51,851
CEO Cho and CEO Ji.

214
00:09:51,851 --> 00:09:54,788
I think we should be honest
and explain it in a video.

215
00:09:55,622 --> 00:09:58,258
That seems like a good idea.
Are both of you okay with that?

216
00:09:58,258 --> 00:09:59,693
Okay, then.

217
00:09:59,693 --> 00:10:03,730
To match the situation,
I'll put on gloomy makeup...

218
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,832
and wear a black suit.

219
00:10:05,832 --> 00:10:06,766
I'll prepare that, too.

220
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:09,436
Just delete comments that cross the line.

221
00:10:09,436 --> 00:10:11,471
- Mean comments cause other mean comments.
- Okay.

222
00:10:11,471 --> 00:10:13,807
Joo Ha and Min Jae,
if you see any malicious comments,

223
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:15,141
please delete them.

224
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:16,776
- I'll do it by my...
- No!

225
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,880
People are leaving malicious comments
in real-time right now.

226
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,615
It would be too much
for you to handle alone.

227
00:10:21,615 --> 00:10:22,282
Right.

228
00:10:22,282 --> 00:10:24,951
I'll work through the night
to delete malicious comments.

229
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,187
I'll join them.

230
00:10:27,187 --> 00:10:28,822
- I won't do it.
- No!

231
00:10:30,123 --> 00:10:31,324
Don't say that.

232
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:34,361
We, the YouTube Team, have to be united.

233
00:10:37,697 --> 00:10:39,633
We'll start with Sunmudo.

234
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:40,600
One.

235
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:43,069
Two.

236
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,105
One.

237
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,707
Two.

238
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:49,976
Balance on one foot.

239
00:10:54,548 --> 00:10:55,882
I miss Kick.

240
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,955
I wonder if Kick is doing well.

241
00:11:02,856 --> 00:11:04,457
I really miss him.

242
00:11:07,027 --> 00:11:08,094
(Enable mobile data)

243
00:11:10,297 --> 00:11:11,565
What's all this?

244
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:16,169
Scriptwriter Wang, where are you?

245
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:18,939
The identity of Camper One
has been revealed. He's a serial killer.

246
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:20,307
Things have become chaotic.

247
00:11:22,742 --> 00:11:24,110
Serial killer.

248
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:26,046
Scriptwriter Wang, what are you doing?

249
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,515
Camper One.

250
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,386
I remembered I had to make an urgent call.

251
00:11:34,354 --> 00:11:36,756
I see.

252
00:11:39,826 --> 00:11:43,296
What are you doing here?

253
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,766
Actually,

254
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:49,769
I was wondering if the first episode
of our show was broadcast.

255
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:52,572
Someone who knew me might've seen it.

256
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,207
Let me see.

257
00:11:54,674 --> 00:11:55,709
No!

258
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,882
Scriptwriter Wang.

259
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,751
What did I just...

260
00:12:05,886 --> 00:12:07,687
Am I possessed by an evil spirit?

261
00:12:07,687 --> 00:12:09,990
Because I came to a temple to get away
from the secular world temporarily,

262
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,925
but I used a phone,
the symbol of the secular world.

263
00:12:11,925 --> 00:12:14,427
Before you get possessed by an evil spirit
as well, we should go and...

264
00:12:14,694 --> 00:12:16,129
It's already lunchtime.

265
00:12:16,129 --> 00:12:16,997
Let's go have temple food.

266
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:20,867
I'll buy you a new phone
once we safely get out of this place.

267
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:22,202
Let's go.

268
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:24,704
Temple food. Wear your shoes.

269
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:26,006
But...

270
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:27,507
I'm going to eat everything up.

271
00:12:27,507 --> 00:12:28,441
Let's go now.

272
00:12:29,643 --> 00:12:30,477
Scriptwriter Wang.

273
00:12:31,478 --> 00:12:33,246
Nice weather.

274
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,586
When I saw you yesterday at the temple,

275
00:12:39,586 --> 00:12:41,454
I was really surprised.

276
00:12:41,454 --> 00:12:44,558
I'm extremely surprised right now
that I'm about to faint.

277
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:49,196
Why are you covered in cold sweat,
Scriptwriter Wang?

278
00:12:49,196 --> 00:12:51,932
Because a serial killer is
right next to me.

279
00:12:52,732 --> 00:12:53,600
Hey.

280
00:12:54,568 --> 00:12:56,269
You're actually sweating heavily.

281
00:12:57,204 --> 00:12:59,206
- Am I?
- Yes.

282
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:01,241
As if...

283
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:03,944
you found out
about a secret you must not know...

284
00:13:03,944 --> 00:13:05,812
and you're extremely nervous about it.

285
00:13:06,446 --> 00:13:08,982
Look at all that sweat.

286
00:13:11,484 --> 00:13:12,953
What's wrong?

287
00:13:13,887 --> 00:13:16,022
The secret is...

288
00:13:17,424 --> 00:13:19,025
to be honest,

289
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,928
I'm suffering from early menopause.

290
00:13:21,928 --> 00:13:24,564
So I can't control my emotions
and my body temperature.

291
00:13:24,564 --> 00:13:26,666
That's why I'm sweating.

292
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,469
I see.

293
00:13:31,671 --> 00:13:34,174
In this temple with fresh air away
from the secular world,

294
00:13:34,174 --> 00:13:37,177
if you take a good rest,
you'll get better.

295
00:13:37,177 --> 00:13:39,012
If I'm lucky,

296
00:13:39,012 --> 00:13:42,282
I may find out who I truly am.

297
00:13:43,016 --> 00:13:45,819
I wonder what the temple food is today.

298
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:49,055
Shall we go have temple food?

299
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:53,960
Yes.

300
00:13:54,828 --> 00:13:56,696
(LIVE KICKKICKKICKKICK!)

301
00:13:58,298 --> 00:13:59,566
Hello, everyone.

302
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:02,536
I'm CEO Ji Jin Hee of KICKKICKKICKKICK.

303
00:14:02,536 --> 00:14:04,337
And I'm Cho Young Sik.

304
00:14:04,337 --> 00:14:06,540
We acknowledged the issue
that people are thinking...

305
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,443
that "Tails of Tales of Camping"
has been manipulated.

306
00:14:10,443 --> 00:14:14,581
That is why we uploaded a video
to explain everything.

307
00:14:15,682 --> 00:14:20,620
Many suspect that I cast Camper One...

308
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,224
knowing who he was.

309
00:14:28,595 --> 00:14:31,298
How did I become
the icon of manipulation of the era?

310
00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:34,534
Are you okay, Actor Ji?
You must've been scared.

311
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:35,569
Thank you, CEO Cho.

312
00:14:36,236 --> 00:14:37,137
Wipe your tears.

313
00:14:39,973 --> 00:14:43,210
But I, Ji Jin Hee, can bet
my 28-year acting career...

314
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,678
that I did not manipulate...

315
00:14:44,678 --> 00:14:45,512
Cut.

316
00:14:46,446 --> 00:14:48,114
Why? He was getting emotional.

317
00:14:48,114 --> 00:14:50,584
Emotional appeal is not a thing anymore.

318
00:14:50,584 --> 00:14:53,386
So be as unemotional as you can.
Sound candid this time.

319
00:14:53,386 --> 00:14:54,955
The trend has changed a lot recently.

320
00:14:54,955 --> 00:14:56,089
I'll go again looking unemotional.

321
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:58,725
- Yes, as best as you can.
- You shouldn't have cried.

322
00:15:11,071 --> 00:15:14,040
Son, are you really not going
to return to school?

323
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,544
I think you are fully able
to overcome that problem.

324
00:15:30,123 --> 00:15:33,293
"He should've just kept acting,
not carelessly become a CEO."

325
00:15:34,661 --> 00:15:35,896
Why didn't you delete this?

326
00:15:37,831 --> 00:15:39,966
If we delete
petty negative comments as well,

327
00:15:39,966 --> 00:15:42,836
they will know
we're interfering as an administrator.

328
00:15:43,937 --> 00:15:46,106
This isn't a petty negative comment.

329
00:15:46,106 --> 00:15:48,842
It's a personal attack.
You have to delete this.

330
00:15:54,748 --> 00:15:55,649
My bad.

331
00:15:59,486 --> 00:16:01,588
Why?

332
00:16:01,588 --> 00:16:03,123
Because we didn't manipulate anything.

333
00:16:03,123 --> 00:16:06,393
They became the judge
and left this comment.

334
00:16:06,393 --> 00:16:09,529
It's like ordering the death penalty
without holding a court.

335
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,965
Isn't that right, PD Tae Ho?

336
00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:12,866
Yes, it is.

337
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,936
See? PD Tae Ho agreed.

338
00:16:17,804 --> 00:16:19,372
We have to delete this.

339
00:16:19,372 --> 00:16:20,273
Delete.

340
00:16:20,807 --> 00:16:22,742
Listen, Scriptwriter Ga Joo Ha.

341
00:16:22,742 --> 00:16:25,912
KICKKICKKICKKICK is a YouTube platform.

342
00:16:25,912 --> 00:16:27,847
Due to the nature of YouTube platform,

343
00:16:27,847 --> 00:16:30,417
if the public's interest is proportional
to the economic gain,

344
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:33,019
we must also take responsibility...

345
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:35,889
for the public's criticism and suspicions.
Do you understand?

346
00:16:37,691 --> 00:16:40,727
Then why did you agree
to delete malicious comments, Shiba?

347
00:16:40,727 --> 00:16:44,264
I agreed to delete
senselessly malicious comments.

348
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:45,432
It's the right of a YouTuber...

349
00:16:45,432 --> 00:16:48,535
to defend oneself
from ridiculous rumors...

350
00:16:48,535 --> 00:16:50,871
bringing about more ridiculous rumors.

351
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:52,739
What do you think about this, PD Tae Ho?

352
00:16:52,739 --> 00:16:54,474
That's awesome.

353
00:16:57,577 --> 00:16:58,245
Darn it.

354
00:16:59,846 --> 00:17:02,549
Who taught you to drop cookie crumbs...

355
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:04,618
all over someone else's keyboard?

356
00:17:05,385 --> 00:17:07,454
I hate these things.

357
00:17:09,256 --> 00:17:12,125
It was a mistake.

358
00:17:14,461 --> 00:17:15,395
I'm sorry.

359
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:21,167
PD Min Jae, you don't like me, do you?

360
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:22,936
I don't. Did you find that out now?

361
00:17:23,436 --> 00:17:24,838
I thought you were...

362
00:17:28,842 --> 00:17:30,277
- My bad.
- It got in my eye.

363
00:17:31,878 --> 00:17:32,946
I'm sorry.

364
00:17:34,714 --> 00:17:35,749
Did you just laugh?

365
00:17:35,749 --> 00:17:36,983
Should I blow it away for you?

366
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:39,186
Let's work in our own seats.

367
00:17:41,021 --> 00:17:42,022
Darn it.

368
00:17:43,123 --> 00:17:44,191
It hurts.

369
00:17:54,768 --> 00:17:56,469
Lee Mark, what are you doing?

370
00:17:56,469 --> 00:17:58,605
- Practicing.
- I'm so annoyed.

371
00:18:00,941 --> 00:18:02,842
I like this.

372
00:18:02,842 --> 00:18:04,411
- Mark.
- What?

373
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:05,545
Give me that.

374
00:18:05,545 --> 00:18:06,746
- This?
- Yes.

375
00:18:08,648 --> 00:18:09,716
It's been a long time.

376
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:13,753
When I have a target...

377
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,293
the queen of ball control is back.

378
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:31,671
Why did something as preposterous
as the things that happen...

379
00:18:31,671 --> 00:18:33,373
in my web novels happen to me?

380
00:18:37,878 --> 00:18:38,979
Should I just run away?

381
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,914
What about the rest of the people here?

382
00:18:41,648 --> 00:18:42,649
No.

383
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:45,051
I can't run away from this place
without a car anyway.

384
00:18:47,988 --> 00:18:49,222
Bathroom.

385
00:18:49,222 --> 00:18:51,458
I have to inform them no matter what
about what's happening.

386
00:18:55,161 --> 00:18:57,097
Right now is my golden opportunity.

387
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:03,069
The target has disappeared, Mark.

388
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:04,204
Respond, Mark.

389
00:19:04,771 --> 00:19:06,406
Roger. I'll look for the target.

390
00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:08,575
Stop.

391
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:10,877
Go.

392
00:19:16,616 --> 00:19:18,184
Agent Ga Joo Ha.

393
00:19:18,184 --> 00:19:20,954
But I'm curious
why Shiba became the target.

394
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:23,023
He hates me.

395
00:19:23,023 --> 00:19:24,824
Yes, you can hate someone
and like the person again and...

396
00:19:24,824 --> 00:19:25,759
No.

397
00:19:26,193 --> 00:19:28,562
I've always liked you, Agent Joo Ha.

398
00:19:29,296 --> 00:19:30,230
Thank you.

399
00:19:31,398 --> 00:19:34,267
But there were lots of times
when I hated you, Agent Mark.

400
00:19:36,203 --> 00:19:37,470
That's okay.

401
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,672
Queen of ball control...

402
00:19:38,672 --> 00:19:41,274
with 99 percent accuracy,

403
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:42,842
where is your target?

404
00:19:43,276 --> 00:19:46,213
The back of his head.

405
00:19:47,013 --> 00:19:48,215
What are you doing?

406
00:19:48,215 --> 00:19:49,082
You scared me.

407
00:19:51,284 --> 00:19:52,919
That hurt.

408
00:19:55,555 --> 00:19:58,425
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

409
00:19:58,425 --> 00:20:00,694
- PD Kang.
- Let me see.

410
00:20:00,694 --> 00:20:01,528
It's red.

411
00:20:01,528 --> 00:20:02,762
What did you shoot?

412
00:20:02,762 --> 00:20:05,465
- Sorry.
- Do we need some ice or something?

413
00:20:21,581 --> 00:20:24,184
I hope he's not dead.

414
00:20:25,418 --> 00:20:26,319
I have to call him first.

415
00:20:31,591 --> 00:20:34,194
Calm down.

416
00:20:34,194 --> 00:20:35,028
(PD Kang Tae Ho)

417
00:20:36,997 --> 00:20:39,533
Come on. Pick up, PD Kang.

418
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:43,236
I'm so sorry.

419
00:20:43,236 --> 00:20:46,139
My forehead is burning.

420
00:20:46,139 --> 00:20:47,340
- I think the ice melted.
- Mark.

421
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,608
Joo Ha, put in more ice.

422
00:20:50,644 --> 00:20:52,178
I'm so sorry.

423
00:20:52,178 --> 00:20:53,847
- Try again.
- Okay.

424
00:20:53,847 --> 00:20:55,048
No.

425
00:20:55,048 --> 00:20:56,516
Pick up the ice cubes and put them inside.

426
00:20:57,417 --> 00:21:00,620
- Put them inside.
- I'm so sorry.

427
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,390
(Scriptwriter Wang Jo Yeon)

428
00:21:03,957 --> 00:21:06,593
- Why isn't he picking up?
- Leave a voice message after...

429
00:21:06,593 --> 00:21:07,427
(PD Kang Tae Ho)

430
00:21:07,427 --> 00:21:08,261
(Low Battery)

431
00:21:18,104 --> 00:21:20,507
("TTC" One, Manghaesa...)

432
00:21:27,347 --> 00:21:29,616
Ms. Wang, what are you doing here?

433
00:21:30,984 --> 00:21:31,818
Well...

434
00:21:31,818 --> 00:21:34,855
You're on your phone again. Give it to me.

435
00:21:35,322 --> 00:21:37,524
One of the reasons you came here
for a temple-stay program was...

436
00:21:37,524 --> 00:21:39,960
digital detox, isn't it?

437
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,061
That's right, but...

438
00:21:41,061 --> 00:21:43,864
You're going to become addicted
to dopamine again.

439
00:21:43,864 --> 00:21:44,831
Give that to me.

440
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,202
Wait a minute.

441
00:21:49,636 --> 00:21:52,806
Sir, why are you here?

442
00:21:53,573 --> 00:21:56,042
Why am I here?

443
00:21:56,042 --> 00:21:57,978
That's what I asked you. Why are you here?

444
00:21:57,978 --> 00:21:59,479
Exactly.

445
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:01,715
When I came here,
he was already lying on the floor.

446
00:22:01,715 --> 00:22:03,683
So I was about to wake him up.

447
00:22:03,683 --> 00:22:06,887
You were about to wake him up,
but he was like this?

448
00:22:07,587 --> 00:22:09,289
You're joking again.

449
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:10,290
This won't do.

450
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,259
Both of you should practice...

451
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:15,161
turning anguish into wisdom.

452
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:16,129
Hold on.

453
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,900
I told you so many times
to think about...

454
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:21,668
why you come for a temple-stay program.

455
00:22:22,235 --> 00:22:25,038
What is nonpossession?
This is Nosoyu Templestay.

456
00:22:26,273 --> 00:22:29,342
Yes. A reservation for eight people?

457
00:22:29,342 --> 00:22:32,812
If eight people come,
one can stay for free.

458
00:22:32,812 --> 00:22:33,613
Yes.

459
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:36,149
In a temple,

460
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:38,318
even if you have an ID,

461
00:22:38,318 --> 00:22:40,854
this is a temple, so that's unnecessary.

462
00:22:40,854 --> 00:22:43,089
It hurts so much.

463
00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:45,292
It was definitely bleeding.

464
00:22:47,194 --> 00:22:48,662
This is cold.

465
00:22:51,998 --> 00:22:53,733
What's wrong with them?

466
00:22:54,668 --> 00:22:56,503
(Scriptwriter Wang Jo Yeon)

467
00:22:58,071 --> 00:23:00,707
The phone is off. Leave a voicemail...

468
00:23:00,707 --> 00:23:01,608
What?

469
00:23:01,608 --> 00:23:03,510
("TTC" One, Manghaesa...)

470
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,212
What?

471
00:23:05,212 --> 00:23:08,848
"TTC" episode one is messed up?

472
00:23:12,018 --> 00:23:15,021
Scriptwriter Wang is so mean.

473
00:23:17,123 --> 00:23:18,291
Is she drunk again?

474
00:23:23,897 --> 00:23:25,866
Did PD Tae Ho read my message?

475
00:23:27,434 --> 00:23:28,702
I hope he did.

476
00:23:30,036 --> 00:23:31,338
Should I contact him again?

477
00:23:32,873 --> 00:23:34,374
Buddhist monks also have phones.

478
00:23:34,374 --> 00:23:36,710
So there must be
a phone charger somewhere.

479
00:23:41,348 --> 00:23:42,682
Two hundred nineteen.

480
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:47,087
It's the 218th one.
Get rid of anguish.

481
00:23:48,021 --> 00:23:49,055
Okay.

482
00:24:02,469 --> 00:24:06,106
Once again,
we apologize for causing a controversy.

483
00:24:06,806 --> 00:24:09,910
Kickickickick will keep devoting ourselves
to make good content.

484
00:24:11,478 --> 00:24:14,681
But will they believe us
just for this video?

485
00:24:14,681 --> 00:24:17,751
The public listens to and watches
what they want to, anyway.

486
00:24:17,984 --> 00:24:18,818
Did you see that?

487
00:24:18,818 --> 00:24:21,321
"TTC" ranked third place
among the non-English global TV shows.

488
00:24:21,321 --> 00:24:24,591
Third place?
This is truly a double-edged sword.

489
00:24:24,591 --> 00:24:27,260
After the video we uploaded to explain,
we got fewer malicious comments.

490
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,529
- What a relief.
- Absolutely.

491
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:32,666
But Scriptwriter Wang interacted
with Kim Yeon Swae the most.

492
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:33,767
Is she still out of touch?

493
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:35,168
She called me yesterday,

494
00:24:35,168 --> 00:24:37,204
but when I called her back,
her phone was off.

495
00:24:38,071 --> 00:24:39,339
But what happened to your forehead?

496
00:24:40,106 --> 00:24:41,241
I know, right?

497
00:24:42,175 --> 00:24:43,843
- She also sent a text message.
- What did she say?

498
00:24:43,843 --> 00:24:45,946
She said "TTC" episode one was mangled.

499
00:24:45,946 --> 00:24:47,180
She's blaming herself.

500
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,949
There's no way
Scriptwriter Wang said that.

501
00:24:48,949 --> 00:24:50,050
She did. Look.

502
00:24:51,017 --> 00:24:51,985
What?

503
00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:55,555
"'TTC' One, Manghaesa." What does that mean?

504
00:24:55,555 --> 00:24:59,426
She meant "TTC" episode one failed
but made a bunch of typos.

505
00:24:59,426 --> 00:25:01,895
I think Scriptwriter Wang was drinking.

506
00:25:01,895 --> 00:25:03,630
So that's the drunken confession?

507
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,464
No way.

508
00:25:04,464 --> 00:25:08,034
Manghaesa. Mangled.

509
00:25:08,034 --> 00:25:10,904
Manghaesa is the name of a temple.

510
00:25:10,904 --> 00:25:12,439
A temple? Manghaesa...

511
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:14,140
So it's not "mangled?"

512
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,142
There's "haesa" in the word.

513
00:25:16,142 --> 00:25:17,811
So it's not "mangled,"

514
00:25:17,811 --> 00:25:20,447
but the Manghaesa Temple.

515
00:25:20,447 --> 00:25:21,381
Temple?

516
00:25:21,681 --> 00:25:22,916
Right.

517
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:25,318
When Scriptwriter Wang wants to run away
or hide somewhere,

518
00:25:25,318 --> 00:25:26,920
she goes to do temple-stay programs.

519
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,956
That's understandable.

520
00:25:29,956 --> 00:25:32,893
If my memory doesn't return,

521
00:25:32,893 --> 00:25:34,895
I'm going to stay at a temple.

522
00:25:34,895 --> 00:25:38,565
I may be able to find myself there.

523
00:25:39,466 --> 00:25:41,268
Right. Kim Yeon Swae also said...

524
00:25:41,268 --> 00:25:43,003
he would go to a temple to find himself.

525
00:25:43,003 --> 00:25:43,737
What?

526
00:25:43,737 --> 00:25:46,506
Does that mean Camper One of "TTC" is
also in the Manghaesa Temple?

527
00:25:46,506 --> 00:25:47,374
What?

528
00:25:47,374 --> 00:25:49,276
Wait. Camper One
of "TTC" is Kim Yeon Swae.

529
00:25:49,276 --> 00:25:50,310
Yes.

530
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,245
So she met Camper One in the temple...

531
00:25:52,245 --> 00:25:54,214
and she wrote a text message
to inform us of that...

532
00:25:54,214 --> 00:25:55,549
but got hit by a wooden fish and fainted?

533
00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:56,783
Then is that message...

534
00:25:56,783 --> 00:25:58,385
Scriptwriter Wang's dying message?

535
00:25:58,985 --> 00:26:00,854
- No.
- No way.

536
00:26:00,854 --> 00:26:01,588
(Camper Three (Police))

537
00:26:01,588 --> 00:26:03,924
Yes, Officer.
I was going to call you just now.

538
00:26:03,924 --> 00:26:06,026
Did you find out anything else?

539
00:26:06,026 --> 00:26:07,060
I'm not sure,

540
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,863
but I think Kim Yeon Swae is
in a temple called Manghaesa Temple.

541
00:26:09,863 --> 00:26:12,465
We also got a report
that Kim Yeon Swae was last spotted...

542
00:26:12,465 --> 00:26:14,067
in Kimsan Rest Area.

543
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:15,001
Kimsan? Where is that?

544
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:17,571
So we're off to Kimsan to track him.

545
00:26:17,571 --> 00:26:18,305
Where is that?

546
00:26:18,305 --> 00:26:19,673
Manghaesa Temple is a temple in Kimsan.

547
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,108
We'll be on our way right away.

548
00:26:22,108 --> 00:26:23,910
We think Scriptwriter Wang is there, too.

549
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:26,012
Let's go. Hurry up.

550
00:26:26,012 --> 00:26:28,682
Hurry.

551
00:26:28,682 --> 00:26:29,783
The car key.

552
00:26:29,783 --> 00:26:31,218
- Bring the car key.
- Okay.

553
00:26:39,993 --> 00:26:40,927
We'll go now.

554
00:26:41,494 --> 00:26:43,163
- Hold tight.
- Okay.

555
00:27:08,522 --> 00:27:10,891
Scriptwriter Wang Jo Yeon,
what are you doing here?

556
00:27:15,262 --> 00:27:18,231
The Venerable asked me to bring something.

557
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:20,667
Is that so?

558
00:27:24,938 --> 00:27:26,206
Scriptwriter Wang, did you know...

559
00:27:27,173 --> 00:27:28,041
Know what?

560
00:27:30,277 --> 00:27:33,747
That my memory returned, thanks to you.

561
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,484
Your memories...

562
00:27:39,252 --> 00:27:40,487
returned?

563
00:27:41,288 --> 00:27:43,390
Yes, they did.

564
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:48,762
After you hit me with this wooden fish
in the head, maybe because of the impact,

565
00:27:48,762 --> 00:27:52,566
my memory started to return
little by little.

566
00:27:55,068 --> 00:27:56,336
So I learned...

567
00:27:58,004 --> 00:27:59,472
what kind of person I was.

568
00:28:15,155 --> 00:28:16,156
Don't come close.

569
00:28:16,156 --> 00:28:17,624
- Stop right there.
- Stay away from me.

570
00:28:21,761 --> 00:28:25,799
Why are you running away from me?
You're making me sad.

571
00:28:26,066 --> 00:28:28,001
Please don't kill me, sir.

572
00:28:28,802 --> 00:28:33,106
You shouldn't have hit me
in the head with a wooden fish.

573
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:37,077
No.

574
00:28:38,545 --> 00:28:39,546
Be quiet.

575
00:28:40,413 --> 00:28:41,514
Don't kill me.

576
00:29:09,276 --> 00:29:10,710
PD Kang. CEO Ji.

577
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,078
Scriptwriter Wang.

578
00:29:12,078 --> 00:29:13,079
Stop what you're doing!

579
00:29:17,984 --> 00:29:20,086
If you move one more step,

580
00:29:20,086 --> 00:29:21,821
you won't see Scriptwriter Wang alive.

581
00:29:22,522 --> 00:29:25,158
Why are you coming in a group like that?

582
00:29:25,158 --> 00:29:26,560
- But...
- What are you holding?

583
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,795
I'm Ji Jin Hee.

584
00:29:28,795 --> 00:29:30,063
Please calm down.

585
00:29:30,063 --> 00:29:31,498
I told you not to come closer.

586
00:29:31,498 --> 00:29:34,201
- Listen to him.
- I didn't intend to go closer.

587
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:35,135
Camper One.

588
00:29:35,869 --> 00:29:38,205
Let go of Scriptwriter Wang first,
and we can talk.

589
00:29:38,205 --> 00:29:39,339
She seems too frightened.

590
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:42,175
Who cares if she's frightened or not?

591
00:29:42,943 --> 00:29:45,779
Ga Joo Ha,
you can shoot with 100 percent,

592
00:29:46,379 --> 00:29:48,215
no, 99 percent accuracy, right?

593
00:29:48,215 --> 00:29:48,982
Here.

594
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:08,802
Now is your time, Scriptwriter Wang.

595
00:30:13,106 --> 00:30:14,441
Are you okay?

596
00:30:15,342 --> 00:30:16,543
KICKKICKKICKKICK.

597
00:30:17,644 --> 00:30:18,545
Assemble.

598
00:30:25,652 --> 00:30:27,354
You're all dead.

599
00:31:03,323 --> 00:31:04,424
Kim Yeon Swae.

600
00:31:05,392 --> 00:31:06,760
You are surrounded.

601
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:14,467
Good job, everyone.

602
00:31:14,467 --> 00:31:19,005
Subscribers, serial killer Kim Yeon Swae
has finally been arrested.

603
00:31:19,005 --> 00:31:20,440
Look at that.

604
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,409
What are you saying?
This isn't manipulated.

605
00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:24,611
I can guarantee this is not manipulated.

606
00:31:24,611 --> 00:31:25,812
This is actually happening.

607
00:31:25,812 --> 00:31:27,214
Let's go closer.

608
00:31:27,214 --> 00:31:29,182
Look at that.

609
00:31:29,182 --> 00:31:32,085
- Venerable...
- Look. Kim Yeon Swae is arrested.

610
00:31:32,085 --> 00:31:33,119
What are you doing?

611
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,955
Ms. Wang.

612
00:31:34,955 --> 00:31:37,123
On the side,

613
00:31:37,123 --> 00:31:39,893
"What is nonpossession?
Buddhist Temple Man of Nosoyu."

614
00:31:39,893 --> 00:31:43,964
I manage this YouTube channel.
I'm currently doing a live.

615
00:31:44,698 --> 00:31:46,066
Hello.

616
00:31:46,066 --> 00:31:47,934
- I'm Ji Jin Hee.
- Yes, Ji Jin Hee.

617
00:31:47,934 --> 00:31:49,369
Thanks to my YouTube live,

618
00:31:49,369 --> 00:31:52,405
the controversy about "TTC"
being manipulated will come to an end.

619
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,808
Was all of that streamed live?

620
00:31:54,808 --> 00:31:56,042
YouTube live.

621
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:57,377
Did you film everything in real time?

622
00:31:57,377 --> 00:32:00,647
All of this happened thanks to Buddha.

623
00:32:00,647 --> 00:32:01,648
So put your hands together
in a prayer position.

624
00:32:01,648 --> 00:32:03,116
Put your hands up.

625
00:32:03,116 --> 00:32:06,152
Put your hands up.

626
00:32:06,753 --> 00:32:08,955
Nam Seong?

627
00:32:08,955 --> 00:32:10,023
What?

628
00:32:11,091 --> 00:32:12,058
In Seong.

629
00:32:12,859 --> 00:32:13,960
Brother.

630
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,794
What?

631
00:32:15,262 --> 00:32:16,329
- No Nam Seong.
- You.

632
00:32:16,329 --> 00:32:18,298
Nam Seong.

633
00:32:35,764 --> 00:32:37,366
Kim Yeon Swae.

634
00:32:37,366 --> 00:32:40,035
You have the right to remain silent.

635
00:32:40,469 --> 00:32:42,671
You have the right to have an attorney.

636
00:32:45,241 --> 00:32:46,642
Is anybody hurt?

637
00:32:46,642 --> 00:32:47,610
No.

638
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:50,112
I'm sorry for not recognizing him first.

639
00:32:50,112 --> 00:32:52,615
Thanks to all of you,
we were able to arrest Kim Yeon Swae.

640
00:32:52,615 --> 00:32:53,649
Thank you.

641
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,518
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

642
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,955
No In Seong, tell us what's going on.

643
00:32:59,955 --> 00:33:01,590
I'll explain.

644
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:05,060
He's my eldest brother, No Nam Seong
who became a Buddhist monk some years ago.

645
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,263
Yes, that's me. Nice to meet you.

646
00:33:07,263 --> 00:33:10,065
If it's okay with all of you,

647
00:33:10,065 --> 00:33:12,334
could you please say something
to my subscribers?

648
00:33:12,334 --> 00:33:15,704
You're receiving explosive reactions.
They're saying you're the hero of Korea.

649
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:17,139
Of course.

650
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:20,309
Thanks to him, everyone learned
"TTC" was not manipulated at all.

651
00:33:20,309 --> 00:33:22,378
We should be thankful
for his beautiful YouTube live.

652
00:33:22,378 --> 00:33:24,380
- Yes.
- Right.

653
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,714
Thank you.

654
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:29,184
The ones
who knocked down the brutal serial killer,

655
00:33:29,184 --> 00:33:30,719
the heroes of Korea,

656
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:32,988
they are the members of KICKKICKKICKKICK.

657
00:33:43,098 --> 00:33:45,367
(KICKKICKKICKKICK employees caught
the serial killer themselves.)

658
00:33:45,367 --> 00:33:48,504
(Will KICKKICKKICKKICK's "TTC"
become an icon of goodess?)

659
00:33:48,504 --> 00:33:52,942
(The police delivered KICKKICKKICKKICK
a Brave Citizen Award for helping.)

660
00:33:55,344 --> 00:33:57,046
Yes!

661
00:33:57,046 --> 00:34:00,316
I received this award
as the representative of KICKKICKKICKKICK,

662
00:34:00,316 --> 00:34:01,684
but this is an award for all of us...

663
00:34:01,684 --> 00:34:04,587
for displaying wits, courage,
and teamwork...

664
00:34:04,587 --> 00:34:07,423
in a desperately dangerous situation
to knock down a serial killer.

665
00:34:07,423 --> 00:34:09,124
Good job.

666
00:34:09,124 --> 00:34:11,060
If my elder brother No Nam Seong...

667
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,828
was not doing a YouTube live at the time,

668
00:34:12,828 --> 00:34:14,563
this situation that you can see in movies
would not have...

669
00:34:14,563 --> 00:34:17,399
CEO Ji, isn't that parcel from YouTube?

670
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:19,168
- What?
- YouTube?

671
00:34:19,168 --> 00:34:21,804
The parcel delivery guy told me
to take this.

672
00:34:21,804 --> 00:34:23,272
- No way.
- No way.

673
00:34:23,272 --> 00:34:24,106
What is it?

674
00:34:33,882 --> 00:34:34,984
The YouTube Silver Play Button.

675
00:34:36,118 --> 00:34:38,153
- I've never seen it in real life.
- It's dazzling.

676
00:34:39,021 --> 00:34:41,457
I'll put this in my room.

677
00:34:41,457 --> 00:34:43,893
Why put this in your room?
We can put it in my room.

678
00:34:43,893 --> 00:34:45,094
You can put that award certificate
in your room.

679
00:34:45,094 --> 00:34:46,228
- Put this in my room.
- No, in my room.

680
00:34:46,228 --> 00:34:48,530
- It matches my room more.
- What's wrong with you?

681
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,798
How about putting it in the editing room?

682
00:34:49,798 --> 00:34:50,833
- No.
- No.

683
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:51,967
Then cut it in half.

684
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:53,035
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Don't be ridiculous.

685
00:34:53,035 --> 00:34:53,869
Then throw it away.

686
00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:56,572
Stop. Let's make it fair
and display it in the common area.

687
00:34:56,572 --> 00:34:58,974
Why? Because it's our Silver Play Button.

688
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:01,277
- Great.
- Let's do that.

689
00:35:02,177 --> 00:35:03,312
It's been settled.

690
00:35:03,312 --> 00:35:06,682
Anyway, there are so many things
to celebrate today.

691
00:35:06,682 --> 00:35:08,918
On days like these,
we need to have a team dinner.

692
00:35:08,918 --> 00:35:11,287
Team dinner.

693
00:35:11,287 --> 00:35:14,790
- Meat.
- Beef.

694
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:18,594
Okay. But it's too abrupt today,

695
00:35:19,261 --> 00:35:20,529
so let's enjoy it tomorrow.

696
00:35:20,529 --> 00:35:21,497
It's the weekend tomorrow.

697
00:35:21,497 --> 00:35:24,233
I'm living alone
so I have to take care of myself tomorrow.

698
00:35:24,233 --> 00:35:26,669
We should strike while the iron is hot.
How about today?

699
00:35:26,669 --> 00:35:29,405
We, the MZ representatives
of KICKKICKKICKKICK...

700
00:35:29,405 --> 00:35:30,339
will take responsibility...

701
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:31,574
and prepare everything.

702
00:35:31,574 --> 00:35:33,776
I'm from Generation MZ as well,
so I'll join.

703
00:35:33,776 --> 00:35:36,178
The other Generation MZ, Min Jae,
should also...

704
00:35:36,178 --> 00:35:37,980
No. I don't want to.

705
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,282
- Were you also Generation MZ, In Seong?
- Yes.

706
00:35:40,282 --> 00:35:44,954
MZ refers to the people
who were born between 1980 and 1996...

707
00:35:44,954 --> 00:35:46,989
called the Millennials,

708
00:35:46,989 --> 00:35:50,259
and also Generation Z...

709
00:35:50,259 --> 00:35:52,161
who are those born between 1997 and 2012.

710
00:35:52,161 --> 00:35:56,599
So Generation MZ includes both
the Millennials and Generation Z.

711
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:58,100
We also call them the MZers.

712
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,102
In conclusion, except for the two CEOs,

713
00:36:00,102 --> 00:36:02,905
we are all MZers.

714
00:36:03,806 --> 00:36:06,742
Let's have a team dinner!

715
00:36:06,742 --> 00:36:08,010
Let's go!

716
00:36:09,612 --> 00:36:15,150
- Team dinner.
- Beef.

717
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:19,688
(Episode 4-2
The Silver Play Button Called Desire)

718
00:36:20,189 --> 00:36:22,658
Welcome, hot tub.

719
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:25,261
Come on, good-looking men.

720
00:36:25,261 --> 00:36:28,097
Come on, baby.

721
00:36:28,097 --> 00:36:30,766
Where should we have the team dinner?

722
00:36:30,766 --> 00:36:32,167
I want to find a place
that's not too cliché.

723
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:33,636
Move it 0.5mm to the right.

724
00:36:33,636 --> 00:36:35,437
And 0.1mm to the middle.

725
00:36:35,437 --> 00:36:36,906
Okay. Perfect.

726
00:36:36,906 --> 00:36:39,541
You can go now. Thanks.

727
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:42,011
Hot tub.

728
00:36:42,011 --> 00:36:44,380
Hot Tub Land is here. Come on.

729
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,314
Malatang?

730
00:36:45,781 --> 00:36:47,483
Members of the Team Dinner
Preparatory Committee.

731
00:36:47,483 --> 00:36:49,585
Have you found a nice place?

732
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:50,552
- No.
- No.

733
00:36:50,552 --> 00:36:52,121
Don't be sad.

734
00:36:53,055 --> 00:36:54,523
Lose.

735
00:36:56,992 --> 00:36:58,994
Joo Ha, your feet are super ugly.

736
00:36:58,994 --> 00:37:00,529
Yours are also ugly.

737
00:37:00,529 --> 00:37:01,497
Thanks.

738
00:37:02,498 --> 00:37:04,266
They look like gorilla paws.

739
00:37:05,668 --> 00:37:06,535
Joo Ha.

740
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:08,637
Thanks.

741
00:37:10,172 --> 00:37:11,707
As we're like this,

742
00:37:11,707 --> 00:37:14,276
it reminds me of the pool party...

743
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:16,278
when I lost myself and enjoyed in Bali.

744
00:37:16,278 --> 00:37:17,379
Pool party?

745
00:37:19,982 --> 00:37:22,985
Pool party.
How about having the team dinner here?

746
00:37:22,985 --> 00:37:25,154
- Here?
- Yes. It'll be with a pool party theme.

747
00:37:25,154 --> 00:37:27,356
This hot tub would be the pool,
and we'll make a bar over there.

748
00:37:27,356 --> 00:37:28,724
That would make a pool party.

749
00:37:28,724 --> 00:37:31,126
What do you think about a team dinner
with a pool party theme?

750
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:32,361
- It sounds nice.
- Yes.

751
00:37:32,361 --> 00:37:34,129
Should we barbecue here, too?

752
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:35,731
- And also barbecue cilantro pancakes?
- That too!

753
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:40,035
That's a very hip and MZ-like idea.

754
00:37:40,035 --> 00:37:41,036
MZ.

755
00:37:41,036 --> 00:37:42,071
MZ.

756
00:37:42,071 --> 00:37:43,105
MZ.

757
00:37:43,105 --> 00:37:44,406
Let's go.

758
00:37:45,274 --> 00:37:47,209
(KICKKICKKICKKICK's first team dinner
on the rooftop, a pool party)

759
00:37:47,209 --> 00:37:49,812
(We invite you to the fancy rooftop
pool party in KICKKICKKICKKICK Land!)

760
00:37:49,812 --> 00:37:52,414
(Dress Code [dazzling black and pink,
a drinking, singing, and dancing look])

761
00:37:52,948 --> 00:37:53,949
Let me see.

762
00:37:56,051 --> 00:37:56,986
Okay.

763
00:37:57,553 --> 00:37:59,488
Perfect. Yes.

764
00:38:00,189 --> 00:38:02,758
If I place it symmetrically here,

765
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:05,094
it would be absolutely perfect.

766
00:38:05,094 --> 00:38:06,562
Darn it.

767
00:38:07,429 --> 00:38:08,964
That punk.

768
00:38:09,632 --> 00:38:12,635
If I place it here,

769
00:38:12,635 --> 00:38:15,804
it would look really charming.

770
00:38:19,508 --> 00:38:20,643
Darn it.

771
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:28,450
I want it.

772
00:38:30,252 --> 00:38:31,687
- The Silver Play Button.
- The Silver Play Button.

773
00:38:53,642 --> 00:38:54,710
Hey.

774
00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:01,750
What are you doing?

775
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,452
I came to take a look
at my Silver Play Button.

776
00:39:03,452 --> 00:39:04,420
Your Silver Play Button?

777
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,788
Yes, it's mine. It's not yours.

778
00:39:05,788 --> 00:39:07,356
Technically, "TTC" is my program...

779
00:39:07,356 --> 00:39:09,191
that my junior producer made.

780
00:39:09,191 --> 00:39:11,060
It's my program, and I'm the MC.

781
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,728
- Let go.
- I won't.

782
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:13,662
- I can't even.
- I will never let go.

783
00:39:13,662 --> 00:39:14,797
- I said let go.
- I won't.

784
00:39:15,564 --> 00:39:17,399
- You punk.
- There.

785
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:19,201
Let's face it.

786
00:39:19,201 --> 00:39:21,704
I'm the one who suggested
founding Kickickickick.

787
00:39:21,704 --> 00:39:23,105
Can't you just give in?
I'm older than you.

788
00:39:23,105 --> 00:39:25,474
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Let go.

789
00:39:25,474 --> 00:39:29,211
This is a company, and I am its CEO.

790
00:39:29,211 --> 00:39:31,447
We're joint CEOs.

791
00:39:31,447 --> 00:39:32,715
Okay, then.

792
00:39:32,715 --> 00:39:35,451
Among you two, the one
with more qualifications as a CEO...

793
00:39:35,451 --> 00:39:37,219
can take the Silver Play Button.
How about that?

794
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,022
- Qualifications as a CEO?
- Qualifications as a CEO?

795
00:39:44,793 --> 00:39:47,763
Has anyone seen Scriptwriter Wang?

796
00:39:47,763 --> 00:39:50,666
Scriptwriter Wang? No. Have you seen her?

797
00:39:50,666 --> 00:39:52,701
- I haven't seen her for quite some time.
- Where is she?

798
00:39:52,701 --> 00:39:53,903
Okay. How about the CEOs?

799
00:39:53,903 --> 00:39:54,937
Who are they?

800
00:39:55,938 --> 00:39:58,240
- Don't listen to him. They went shopping.
- Went shopping? Okay.

801
00:40:00,376 --> 00:40:02,077
This is heavy, so let's get going.

802
00:40:02,077 --> 00:40:04,113
Can I please tie my hair before we go?

803
00:40:04,113 --> 00:40:05,147
You're making a fuss.

804
00:40:05,147 --> 00:40:06,081
I'll tie your hair.

805
00:40:07,249 --> 00:40:09,285
Wait. Hold it right.

806
00:40:09,285 --> 00:40:10,519
I am.

807
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:12,922
- Do you know how to do a ponytail?
- Yes.

808
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:24,767
I used to tie my sisters' hair a lot.

809
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:26,402
There.

810
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,305
Like this.

811
00:40:48,724 --> 00:40:51,026
Okay. It's done, Joo Ha.

812
00:40:51,927 --> 00:40:54,196
Joo Ha, I have to tell you something.

813
00:40:54,196 --> 00:40:57,032
How about just shaving your head bald?

814
00:40:57,032 --> 00:40:58,500
Just like my brother Nam Seong.

815
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,336
Actually, no. You'd look even uglier.

816
00:41:01,637 --> 00:41:03,005
- Just get going.
- Okay.

817
00:41:04,707 --> 00:41:06,408
You.

818
00:41:06,408 --> 00:41:08,277
(The Silver Play Button is mine.)

819
00:41:08,277 --> 00:41:09,411
Do you see this?

820
00:41:09,411 --> 00:41:12,915
The one who put all the items on the list
in the cart and also pays...

821
00:41:12,915 --> 00:41:16,318
will be the sole owner of
the Silver Play Button. Do you understand?

822
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:17,553
Yes, I do.

823
00:41:17,553 --> 00:41:19,188
Turn around.

824
00:41:19,188 --> 00:41:20,322
We'll start on three.

825
00:41:20,322 --> 00:41:21,223
Okay.

826
00:41:21,223 --> 00:41:23,225
One, two.

827
00:41:23,726 --> 00:41:24,793
- Hey!
- Three.

828
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:28,530
That's cheating!

829
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:33,535
Joo Ha.

830
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:36,605
Joo Ha?

831
00:42:23,385 --> 00:42:26,221
Mark,
I honestly think you're out of her league.

832
00:42:26,221 --> 00:42:27,790
What are you saying?

833
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,291
Don't pretend not to know, cutie.

834
00:42:29,758 --> 00:42:32,027
Mark, but using your hand
to make a shade is too cliché.

835
00:42:32,027 --> 00:42:34,330
It's too inefficient.
Your arm is going to hurt later.

836
00:42:37,866 --> 00:42:39,268
Goodness.

837
00:42:39,268 --> 00:42:40,569
My mistake.

838
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:44,506
- That...
- Darn it.

839
00:42:47,042 --> 00:42:48,944
Tuna.

840
00:42:48,944 --> 00:42:51,347
Next. Corn.

841
00:42:51,347 --> 00:42:54,016
Here it is. Stew.

842
00:42:54,817 --> 00:42:56,318
Stew.

843
00:42:56,318 --> 00:42:58,854
Yes. Corn is here.

844
00:42:59,688 --> 00:43:01,190
Curry. Here it is.

845
00:43:03,492 --> 00:43:05,995
Gas. They're all here.

846
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:11,533
This is not on the list,
but it's my favorite.

847
00:43:11,533 --> 00:43:12,234
Let's go.

848
00:43:12,234 --> 00:43:13,969
Bug zapper. Where is it?

849
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:15,337
Bug zapper.

850
00:43:16,005 --> 00:43:17,640
- Hey.
- Seriously?

851
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,908
- Bug zapper.
- You jerk.

852
00:43:18,908 --> 00:43:20,209
Bug zapper.

853
00:43:20,209 --> 00:43:21,844
Give that to me. What's this?

854
00:43:21,844 --> 00:43:23,579
Did everyone see how sticky that is?

855
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:26,815
Everyone, come here.
They're 1.50 dollars each.

856
00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:27,883
This is...

857
00:43:36,759 --> 00:43:37,927
Wait.

858
00:43:39,495 --> 00:43:41,130
Why are all you Koreans being like this?

859
00:43:47,236 --> 00:43:48,504
This looks nice.

860
00:43:48,504 --> 00:43:51,840
Ji Jin Hee is here. The officer is here.

861
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,943
He's the love of Juliet.

862
00:43:55,778 --> 00:43:57,046
Take a picture with me.

863
00:43:57,846 --> 00:43:59,114
Wait.

864
00:44:03,385 --> 00:44:04,353
Actor Ji.

865
00:44:07,022 --> 00:44:08,524
Cho Seung Woo is over there.

866
00:44:16,966 --> 00:44:19,368
That...

867
00:44:21,303 --> 00:44:22,271
That punk.

868
00:44:24,473 --> 00:44:26,075
- I came here first.
- I came here first.

869
00:44:26,075 --> 00:44:27,977
- I was first.
- No, I was first.

870
00:44:30,646 --> 00:44:32,881
I caught it.

871
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:33,782
Let go.

872
00:44:36,518 --> 00:44:38,254
Be quiet.

873
00:44:38,254 --> 00:44:41,190
Do you think
this is your living room or something?

874
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:44,059
- Sorry.
- Why behave so heedlessly?

875
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:46,228
I'll be heedful. I'm Ji Jin Hee.

876
00:44:46,729 --> 00:44:47,997
Next.

877
00:44:47,997 --> 00:44:49,899
- Please come this way, sir.
- Okay.

878
00:44:51,533 --> 00:44:53,535
There are too many people watching.

879
00:44:53,535 --> 00:44:56,772
Let's say we reached here
at the same time and make a truce.

880
00:44:57,106 --> 00:44:58,607
Then you can get in line before me.

881
00:44:58,908 --> 00:45:00,609
- I'm scared. You go first.
- No.

882
00:45:00,609 --> 00:45:02,645
- You go first.
- No, you go first.

883
00:45:02,645 --> 00:45:04,780
- I said you should go first.
- Don't be like that again.

884
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,182
- I'm scared of that old man.
- Why are you always like this?

885
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:08,851
Not again.

886
00:45:08,851 --> 00:45:10,753
Be quiet.

887
00:45:11,921 --> 00:45:14,723
You guys are too loud.

888
00:45:15,991 --> 00:45:17,059
We're close.

889
00:45:17,059 --> 00:45:17,993
I'm Ji Jin Hee.

890
00:45:19,895 --> 00:45:21,263
Where is she?

891
00:45:23,332 --> 00:45:24,633
Scriptwriter Wang?

892
00:45:27,636 --> 00:45:29,004
Scriptwriter Wang!

893
00:45:30,472 --> 00:45:32,741
Scriptwriter Wang!

894
00:45:32,741 --> 00:45:35,277
- No, I'm not Scriptwriter Wang.
- Scriptwriter Wang.

895
00:45:35,277 --> 00:45:36,712
- Move.
- What?

896
00:45:36,712 --> 00:45:37,947
I know it's you.

897
00:45:40,416 --> 00:45:41,317
That was Scriptwriter Wang, right?

898
00:45:41,317 --> 00:45:43,652
Yes, I think so.
She had a yellow blanket over her head.

899
00:45:43,652 --> 00:45:45,554
Yes. That was her.

900
00:45:45,554 --> 00:45:47,356
Yes. But why are you limping?

901
00:45:47,356 --> 00:45:49,625
- It hurts.
- Why does it hurt?

902
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:51,126
What's wrong?

903
00:45:51,126 --> 00:45:53,295
This is the shoot composition plan
for episode two of "TTC."

904
00:45:57,633 --> 00:45:59,702
Scriptwriter Wang,
what do you think you're doing?

905
00:46:03,205 --> 00:46:04,673
What do you mean?

906
00:46:04,673 --> 00:46:05,641
"What do you mean?"

907
00:46:06,542 --> 00:46:09,044
"What do you mean?" You saw me just now.

908
00:46:09,044 --> 00:46:09,945
What?

909
00:46:11,547 --> 00:46:13,582
What? Did I?

910
00:46:15,684 --> 00:46:18,587
The woman who ran away
with a blanket over her was you.

911
00:46:19,922 --> 00:46:22,258
What? A blanket? Me?

912
00:46:24,894 --> 00:46:26,729
What the...

913
00:46:34,603 --> 00:46:35,504
Joo Ha, it's 9:00 p.m.

914
00:46:35,504 --> 00:46:36,672
- Is it?
- Yes.

915
00:46:38,507 --> 00:46:41,143
The KICKKICKKICKKICK pool party...

916
00:46:41,143 --> 00:46:44,346
will start now.

917
00:46:45,748 --> 00:46:48,584
We have the handsome CEO Ji
of KICKKICKKICKKICK.

918
00:46:54,924 --> 00:46:57,526
CEO Ji, you look great in that pink suit.

919
00:46:57,526 --> 00:46:58,294
You pass.

920
00:46:58,294 --> 00:47:00,696
Next is PD Cho,
the popular PD, PD Cho.

921
00:47:01,997 --> 00:47:04,767
Your suit is split right down the middle,
CEO Cho.

922
00:47:05,334 --> 00:47:07,336
Are you a pink moth, Scriptwriter Ga?

923
00:47:07,336 --> 00:47:08,537
I'm not a moth. I'm Tinker Bell.

924
00:47:13,242 --> 00:47:16,378
- Ta-da.
- You look beautiful, Scriptwriter Wang.

925
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:18,847
Hi, Kick.

926
00:47:20,449 --> 00:47:22,184
Unbelievable.

927
00:47:27,623 --> 00:47:30,326
Min Jae, you actually came prepared.

928
00:47:30,326 --> 00:47:32,528
When I decide to do something,
I do it well.

929
00:47:32,528 --> 00:47:35,030
Shiba, you look amazing today.

930
00:47:36,699 --> 00:47:37,533
You pass.

931
00:47:37,533 --> 00:47:38,667
Smile.

932
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:41,837
(Welcome to KICKKICKKICKKICK Land.)

933
00:47:47,109 --> 00:47:49,678
KICKKICKKICKKICK, let's go!

934
00:47:53,861 --> 00:47:54,861
(BlackPink POOL PARTY)

935
00:47:59,088 --> 00:48:01,223
- What's this?
- Abracadabra.

936
00:48:04,093 --> 00:48:08,530
Welcome to the KICKKICKKICKKICK Land's
pool party.

937
00:48:10,466 --> 00:48:14,470
Let me introduce the amazing MC
of the first team dinner...

938
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:15,971
of KICKKICKKICKKICK.

939
00:48:18,908 --> 00:48:19,909
Drumrolls.

940
00:48:21,043 --> 00:48:23,145
He works at Hanbang Café
during the day...

941
00:48:23,145 --> 00:48:24,914
and Hanbang Bar at night.

942
00:48:24,914 --> 00:48:30,352
Let me introduce Michael!

943
00:48:34,023 --> 00:48:35,291
Hello, everyone.

944
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:37,059
Hello.

945
00:48:37,059 --> 00:48:39,528
I'm the MC of the first team dinner
of KICKKICKKICKKICK...

946
00:48:39,528 --> 00:48:42,798
and the mascot of Hanbang Building,
Michael.

947
00:48:43,732 --> 00:48:46,001
- Why is Michael so energetic?
- Is he really Michael?

948
00:48:46,001 --> 00:48:47,703
Yes. Our Michael here...

949
00:48:47,703 --> 00:48:51,340
downed a bottle of liquor in one shot
just for this occasion.

950
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,207
Liquor?

951
00:48:52,207 --> 00:48:55,144
So, his blood alcohol level is the highest
at the moment.

952
00:48:55,144 --> 00:48:56,879
Arrest him immediately!

953
00:48:56,879 --> 00:48:59,048
I'm not Michael today.

954
00:48:59,048 --> 00:49:02,318
- Then what?
- I'm Michael Jackson today.

955
00:49:04,687 --> 00:49:05,821
Cool.

956
00:49:06,322 --> 00:49:07,890
This is so fun.

957
00:49:08,457 --> 00:49:10,693
Why are you being like that?
That's dangerous.

958
00:49:10,693 --> 00:49:11,760
Everyone.

959
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,163
Why does a team dinner exist?

960
00:49:14,163 --> 00:49:15,097
Me.

961
00:49:15,097 --> 00:49:16,532
To have a bunch of fun.

962
00:49:16,532 --> 00:49:20,569
That's one of them,
but the biggest reason is...

963
00:49:20,569 --> 00:49:22,438
for improvement in communication.

964
00:49:22,438 --> 00:49:23,339
Communication.

965
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:25,207
- Strengthening cooperation.
- Cooperation.

966
00:49:25,207 --> 00:49:28,310
And to build trust between colleagues.

967
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:29,645
Colleagues.

968
00:49:29,645 --> 00:49:33,082
That being said, until midnight,

969
00:49:33,616 --> 00:49:36,785
we will have an informal talk time.

970
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,388
Informal talk time.

971
00:49:39,388 --> 00:49:41,790
Why the long face, CEO Cho and CEO Ji?
Do you not like the idea?

972
00:49:43,158 --> 00:49:46,362
No way. Our CEOs are not that stubborn.

973
00:49:47,863 --> 00:49:50,466
Right. We're not stubborn people.

974
00:49:50,466 --> 00:49:51,800
Right, Jin Hee?

975
00:49:52,868 --> 00:49:54,603
Yes. Right.

976
00:49:54,603 --> 00:49:56,338
Why? Jin Hee.

977
00:49:57,306 --> 00:49:58,407
Do you not like informal talk?

978
00:49:59,575 --> 00:50:01,677
- I mean...
- Informal talk time has begun.

979
00:50:01,677 --> 00:50:03,345
- Good.
- Let's go!

980
00:50:04,513 --> 00:50:07,583
Jin Hee and Young Sik,
let's grill barbecue.

981
00:50:12,888 --> 00:50:13,856
My eyes sting.

982
00:50:13,856 --> 00:50:15,958
(Youngest / Young)

983
00:50:15,958 --> 00:50:20,229
Jin Hee, you really look like a chef.

984
00:50:20,229 --> 00:50:21,297
Just on the outside.

985
00:50:21,297 --> 00:50:24,166
Is Young Sik the sous chef,
just on the outside?

986
00:50:24,166 --> 00:50:25,367
Boo.

987
00:50:29,905 --> 00:50:32,107
I thought Jin Hee was good at acting,

988
00:50:32,107 --> 00:50:33,642
but he's just making smoke act up.

989
00:50:33,642 --> 00:50:36,879
Young Sik, is your elder brother's name
Il Sik? No, is it Sam Sik?

990
00:50:38,314 --> 00:50:40,082
Young Sik, what are you doing?
Jjin is tired.

991
00:50:40,082 --> 00:50:41,984
Stop being stubborn
and do a good job in assisting him.

992
00:50:42,918 --> 00:50:45,421
Jjin, would you like a drink with me?

993
00:50:45,854 --> 00:50:46,822
Shall I?

994
00:50:47,156 --> 00:50:49,458
Do you really think you're high enough
in rank to have a drink?

995
00:50:49,458 --> 00:50:52,394
No In Seong.

996
00:50:52,394 --> 00:50:55,698
You really live like your name.
You have no good personality.

997
00:50:55,698 --> 00:50:57,533
Understood, Cloud Cuckoo Land. Let's go.

998
00:50:57,533 --> 00:51:00,469
Get out, both of you. I have to talk
to the young and the youngest.

999
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:06,508
Keep up the good work, you two.

1000
00:51:08,877 --> 00:51:10,212
Seriously?

1001
00:51:17,653 --> 00:51:20,155
- Guys, you're burning the meat.
- Sorry.

1002
00:51:35,671 --> 00:51:39,475
Guys, listen to me.

1003
00:51:39,475 --> 00:51:40,843
Sister.

1004
00:51:40,843 --> 00:51:42,144
I like strawberries.

1005
00:51:42,144 --> 00:51:43,379
No.

1006
00:51:43,379 --> 00:51:44,246
Alcohol.

1007
00:51:45,281 --> 00:51:48,384
<i>I like strawberries</i>

1008
00:51:48,384 --> 00:51:53,022
<i>I like strawberries</i>

1009
00:51:53,022 --> 00:51:53,989
Jo Yeon.

1010
00:51:54,957 --> 00:51:57,960
If I were you, I wouldn't drink.

1011
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:58,894
What?

1012
00:51:59,895 --> 00:52:00,963
Why not?

1013
00:52:00,963 --> 00:52:01,997
"Why not?"

1014
00:52:01,997 --> 00:52:04,166
Jo Yeon, you're so shameless.

1015
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:05,668
What?

1016
00:52:06,702 --> 00:52:07,803
Me?

1017
00:52:08,337 --> 00:52:11,340
- Clap to focus.
- Why?

1018
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,008
Why?

1019
00:52:13,008 --> 00:52:16,745
Starting now,
we'll play the highlight of the day.

1020
00:52:16,745 --> 00:52:18,547
Solo Rooftop.

1021
00:52:18,547 --> 00:52:20,049
Rooftop.

1022
00:52:20,049 --> 00:52:21,984
What's that? What should we do?

1023
00:52:21,984 --> 00:52:26,989
We'll start the couple's game,
Snatch the Cap.

1024
00:52:26,989 --> 00:52:28,991
Snatch the Cap.

1025
00:52:28,991 --> 00:52:32,294
The winning team
who keeps their hat until the end...

1026
00:52:32,294 --> 00:52:36,365
will earn 1,000 KICK points...

1027
00:52:36,365 --> 00:52:41,337
that everyone missed
at the trampoline contest last time.

1028
00:52:42,371 --> 00:52:44,373
We'll form teams of two
through a ghost leg game.

1029
00:52:44,373 --> 00:52:48,644
<i>Ghost leg</i>

1030
00:52:56,719 --> 00:52:59,355
Where the fiery tension is building up,

1031
00:52:59,355 --> 00:53:01,957
this is KICKKICKKICKKICK Stadium.

1032
00:53:02,625 --> 00:53:04,560
Teams of round one,

1033
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,861
get in position.

1034
00:53:09,231 --> 00:53:13,802
Before we start,
show everyone how determined you are.

1035
00:53:13,802 --> 00:53:15,070
Are they the ones?

1036
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:17,139
Yes, sir. They beat me right here.

1037
00:53:17,139 --> 00:53:19,642
He says you beat him. Apologize.

1038
00:53:19,642 --> 00:53:21,577
I can't apologize.

1039
00:53:21,577 --> 00:53:24,513
Then get lost.

1040
00:53:24,513 --> 00:53:25,414
Get lost.

1041
00:53:26,048 --> 00:53:28,217
Has it been a month
since you came here, Mark?

1042
00:53:28,217 --> 00:53:29,818
Yes, it has, Boss.

1043
00:53:29,818 --> 00:53:30,819
Let's go, then.

1044
00:53:30,819 --> 00:53:32,254
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1045
00:53:32,254 --> 00:53:34,023
Get ready, everyone.

1046
00:53:38,594 --> 00:53:41,030
Bring it on.

1047
00:53:42,231 --> 00:53:43,365
Wait, that's...

1048
00:53:44,266 --> 00:53:47,236
the legendary leather belt play
that's been talked about for ages?

1049
00:53:47,236 --> 00:53:49,071
Why?
Are you going to avoid me again, Jo Yeon?

1050
00:53:49,071 --> 00:53:50,873
Are you going to say, "What? Me? Why?"

1051
00:53:50,873 --> 00:53:53,375
No. Mark, charge!

1052
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:56,045
Come here.

1053
00:53:56,879 --> 00:53:58,047
What?

1054
00:54:11,193 --> 00:54:12,995
- You have to snatch the cap.
- Snatch it now.

1055
00:54:12,995 --> 00:54:14,330
- Snatch it.
- Snatch her cap.

1056
00:54:15,097 --> 00:54:16,065
Snatch it.

1057
00:54:18,634 --> 00:54:20,169
They did it.

1058
00:54:20,169 --> 00:54:21,804
Did they snatch it at the same time?

1059
00:54:24,139 --> 00:54:25,007
Referee.

1060
00:54:25,808 --> 00:54:28,477
Both teams showed
an amazing leather belt play.

1061
00:54:29,278 --> 00:54:30,312
Both are out.

1062
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,483
The winner will be chosen in round two.

1063
00:54:34,917 --> 00:54:37,286
(Solo Rooftop Couple Game
Snatch the Cap)

1064
00:54:37,286 --> 00:54:38,921
(Ji Jin Hee x No In Seong
VS Ga Joo Ha x Cho Young Sik)

1065
00:54:38,921 --> 00:54:41,857
You have such a free tongue.

1066
00:54:42,925 --> 00:54:44,760
Leggo.

1067
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,428
Leggo? What's that?

1068
00:54:46,428 --> 00:54:48,597
Let's go.

1069
00:54:48,597 --> 00:54:49,765
Let's go, Young Sik.

1070
00:54:49,765 --> 00:54:53,068
Don't pull my hair.

1071
00:54:54,803 --> 00:54:57,039
The cap.

1072
00:54:57,039 --> 00:54:58,274
Snatch it.

1073
00:55:13,789 --> 00:55:15,558
I think they both fell at the same time.

1074
00:55:15,558 --> 00:55:17,526
A moment for VAR review.

1075
00:55:17,526 --> 00:55:18,994
I request a VAR review for our game, too.

1076
00:55:18,994 --> 00:55:21,063
We got cheated in the leather belt play.

1077
00:55:21,063 --> 00:55:22,364
Do you want me to show you
what cheating is?

1078
00:55:25,568 --> 00:55:27,102
You're always getting in my way.

1079
00:55:27,102 --> 00:55:28,604
You're always getting in mine.

1080
00:55:31,173 --> 00:55:34,743
It seems everyone here is quite insane.

1081
00:55:34,743 --> 00:55:35,911
How about some background music?

1082
00:55:36,845 --> 00:55:38,380
I'll have some popcorn.

1083
00:56:23,225 --> 00:56:24,827
We've arrived in Taean.

1084
00:56:28,197 --> 00:56:31,901
Sirs, you're here.

1085
00:56:33,736 --> 00:56:36,805
I said we've arrived. We're here.

1086
00:56:36,805 --> 00:56:38,641
Where are we?

1087
00:56:39,275 --> 00:56:40,643
You scared me.

1088
00:56:40,643 --> 00:56:43,078
Keep your face away from mine.
Why are you here?

1089
00:56:43,078 --> 00:56:45,714
That's what I want to ask.

1090
00:56:45,714 --> 00:56:47,149
Where are we, sir?

1091
00:56:47,917 --> 00:56:50,653
What do you mean?
We're in Taean, Chungcheongnam-do.

1092
00:56:51,587 --> 00:56:52,655
Taean?

1093
00:56:52,655 --> 00:56:55,157
Both of you were plastered yesterday...

1094
00:56:55,157 --> 00:56:58,928
and said you'd pay me three times the fare
if I drove you here, your memorable place.

1095
00:56:58,928 --> 00:57:00,596
Three times?

1096
00:57:00,863 --> 00:57:01,931
But what's that?

1097
00:57:02,565 --> 00:57:03,465
What's this?

1098
00:57:03,465 --> 00:57:06,001
You had it in your arms,
wrapped in a blanket...

1099
00:57:06,001 --> 00:57:07,036
as if it were a baby.

1100
00:57:07,036 --> 00:57:08,837
This is my Silver Play Button.

1101
00:57:08,837 --> 00:57:10,940
No, it's my Silver Play Button.

1102
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:13,676
Pay me three times the fare and get out.

1103
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:15,678
Let go.

1104
00:57:15,678 --> 00:57:16,679
You can't be...

1105
00:57:17,279 --> 00:57:18,581
Actor Ji Jin Hee.

1106
00:57:19,682 --> 00:57:20,516
Are you?

1107
00:57:22,251 --> 00:57:24,353
- I'm not.
- I see.

1108
00:57:24,353 --> 00:57:26,789
Young Sik, what are you doing?
Pay him three times the fare.

1109
00:57:26,789 --> 00:57:29,558
This guy here is going to pay.

1110
00:57:29,558 --> 00:57:31,126
Where are you going?

1111
00:57:31,126 --> 00:57:34,663
You should pay three times the fare
before you leave.

1112
00:57:36,565 --> 00:57:38,033
He's Actor Ji Jin Hee.

1113
00:57:38,033 --> 00:57:39,568
He's too ugly to be him.

1114
00:57:39,568 --> 00:57:42,071
- He doesn't look like Ji Jin Hee.
- Ji Jin Hee is ditching a taxi.

1115
00:57:42,071 --> 00:57:43,405
No. There's no way
Ji Jin Hee would walk around like that.

1116
00:57:43,405 --> 00:57:45,441
Ji Jin Hee is ditching a taxi.

1117
00:57:45,441 --> 00:57:46,976
Don't come closer.

1118
00:57:46,976 --> 00:57:49,378
I won the physical strength competition
and the quick reaction competition.

1119
00:57:49,378 --> 00:57:50,346
So this is mine.

1120
00:57:50,346 --> 00:57:52,481
I know you were too drunk
to remember anything, you punk.

1121
00:57:52,481 --> 00:57:54,316
Did you just call me "punk?"

1122
00:57:54,316 --> 00:57:56,018
The informal talk time ended long ago.
Don't call me that.

1123
00:57:56,018 --> 00:57:58,287
So you remember that,
but don't remember that I won?

1124
00:57:58,287 --> 00:58:00,222
Don't you have respect for elder people?

1125
00:58:00,222 --> 00:58:01,624
Give it to me.

1126
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,393
It hurts. Let go.

1127
00:58:21,944 --> 00:58:24,446
What are you doing? Go in.

1128
00:58:26,081 --> 00:58:27,082
PD Cho.

1129
00:58:27,883 --> 00:58:30,119
Physical strength and quick reactions
are key in swimming.

1130
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:31,253
You're superior in them, PD Cho.

1131
00:58:31,253 --> 00:58:34,056
I'm a poor swimmer. You go in.

1132
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:36,292
Then you can walk inside.
Walk inside the water.

1133
00:58:36,292 --> 00:58:38,127
You go inside. It's cold.

1134
00:58:38,127 --> 00:58:40,029
It's cold.

1135
00:58:40,029 --> 00:58:41,664
Let go of me.

1136
00:58:41,664 --> 00:58:44,300
- It's cold.
- It got in the water because of you.

1137
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:55,644
This feels good.

1138
00:58:55,644 --> 00:58:56,779
(10 years ago)

1139
00:58:56,779 --> 00:58:59,515
I had to farm, reap,

1140
00:58:59,515 --> 00:59:01,984
and cook three dishes a day
every single day.

1141
00:59:01,984 --> 00:59:03,953
So I blamed you a lot.

1142
00:59:05,921 --> 00:59:09,425
But I feel like my life
has become richer now.

1143
00:59:11,794 --> 00:59:12,728
Same.

1144
00:59:14,063 --> 00:59:16,632
I didn't expect you to do
such a great job.

1145
00:59:21,437 --> 00:59:23,405
- Actor Ji and PD Cho.
- Who is it?

1146
00:59:23,405 --> 00:59:25,140
- Here you are.
- It's you.

1147
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:28,043
The guest of episode seven of
"Three Dishes a Day," Yeo Woo Ran is here.

1148
00:59:28,043 --> 00:59:30,112
- Is she?
- Woo Ran is here.

1149
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:38,556
It must've been hard
coming all the way here.

1150
00:59:39,357 --> 00:59:40,992
- Hello, Jin Hee.
- Hi.

1151
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:43,027
Hello, PD Cho.

1152
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:58,870
(Special thanks to Ki Eun Se,
Lee Ha Yul, and Yun Sung Ho)

1153
01:00:17,862 --> 01:00:20,164
(KICKKICKKICKKICK)

1154
01:00:20,164 --> 01:00:21,966
Why isn't he picking up
after causing such a big problem?

1155
01:00:21,966 --> 01:00:23,635
Who are you?

1156
01:00:23,635 --> 01:00:25,103
That's none of your business.

1157
01:00:25,103 --> 01:00:26,538
The elevator broke down.

1158
01:00:26,538 --> 01:00:27,572
Is anyone inside?

1159
01:00:28,873 --> 01:00:29,641
Savior.

1160
01:00:29,641 --> 01:00:30,675
Let's hire a therapist.

1161
01:00:30,675 --> 01:00:32,443
The touch of the sweet secular world.

1162
01:00:33,311 --> 01:00:35,313
She's the talent we need in the company.

1163
01:00:35,313 --> 01:00:36,714
I'm quite skilled.

1164
01:00:36,714 --> 01:00:40,051
I will become your partner
who will always be beside you.

1165
01:00:40,051 --> 01:00:40,818
I'm touched.

1166
01:00:40,818 --> 01:00:43,621
It seems you were quite lonely, Actor Ji.

1167
01:00:43,621 --> 01:00:44,389
Owner risk?

1168
01:00:44,389 --> 01:00:46,558
Did you two part ways ten years ago
because of a woman?

1169
01:00:46,558 --> 01:00:48,059
Everyone's so mean to me.

1170
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:50,762
You have to wake up.
