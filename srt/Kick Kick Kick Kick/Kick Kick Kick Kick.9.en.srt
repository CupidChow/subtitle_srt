1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,241
(All characters, organizations,)

2
00:00:01,241 --> 00:00:02,609
(and events in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:03,977
(Broadcasting guidelines were followed
during the shooting of animals.)

4
00:00:04,545 --> 00:00:07,014
(Yeo Woo Ran's home)

5
00:00:07,014 --> 00:00:08,448
The reason why I retired?

6
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:16,490
I made up my mind to share my private life
when I started YouTube.

7
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:18,192
So let me tell you.

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,763
Ten years ago, on a variety show,

9
00:00:23,797 --> 00:00:25,933
I worked with a producer and an actor.

10
00:00:28,735 --> 00:00:31,605
I was kind to them,
but they thought I was flirting,

11
00:00:33,507 --> 00:00:35,075
and started to make a move on me.

12
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:39,646
But the problem was...

13
00:00:41,048 --> 00:00:42,049
that at the time...

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,918
in show business,

15
00:00:45,886 --> 00:00:48,222
they were both influential.

16
00:00:54,761 --> 00:00:56,797
To keep working in show business,

17
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:58,565
I had no choice.

18
00:01:07,107 --> 00:01:09,109
(Did Yeo Woo Ran retire because of men?)

19
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:11,411
It's like Hollywood in South Korea.

20
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:13,881
Unbelievable.

21
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:16,049
Actress Yeo Woo Ran who returned
in show business after divorce...

22
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:18,285
revealed the reasons behind
her abrupt marriage ten years ago...

23
00:01:18,285 --> 00:01:21,021
and her retirement
in the entertainment industry as well.

24
00:01:21,221 --> 00:01:24,124
Ten years ago, a producer and actor
of a variety show...

25
00:01:24,124 --> 00:01:26,059
made a move on her simultaneously.

26
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:28,629
Yeo Woo Ran got sick and tired
of the two men's actions...

27
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:30,664
and decided to marry someone.

28
00:01:30,664 --> 00:01:33,634
South Koreans who saw
this video speculate...

29
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:37,004
the two insane men are
Producer Cho and Actor Ji.

30
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:38,405
If this is true,

31
00:01:38,405 --> 00:01:41,041
those two and their company
will go down in smoke.

32
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:43,644
But this is
only Yeo Woo Ran's side of the story.

33
00:01:43,644 --> 00:01:46,313
Mr. Entertainment will keep
an eye on it for a while.

34
00:01:46,313 --> 00:01:48,215
I will be back.

35
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:52,219
(Hanbang Building)

36
00:01:58,492 --> 00:01:59,960
Door closing.

37
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,828
Wait.

38
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:04,031
Actor Ji, it's not true, right?

39
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:06,066
Of course, it's not true.

40
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:08,569
CEO Ji.

41
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:10,771
- Don't worry. It's not true.
- CEO Ji.

42
00:02:10,771 --> 00:02:13,040
- CEO Ji, you're not such a jerk...
- Like that, are you?

43
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,008
No way. Trust me, I'm not.

44
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:17,377
Please wait. I have a question.

45
00:02:17,377 --> 00:02:20,747
No, I said no.
CEO Cho and I are not such jerks.

46
00:02:20,747 --> 00:02:25,285
Calm down. Breathe.

47
00:02:25,285 --> 00:02:26,453
I'm Reporter No In Seong
from Daily Kickkick.

48
00:02:26,453 --> 00:02:29,056
What happened, then?
Tell us the details of the incident.

49
00:02:29,056 --> 00:02:29,990
Seriously?

50
00:02:30,657 --> 00:02:32,759
Calm down.

51
00:02:34,795 --> 00:02:38,599
I'm CEO Ji Jin Hee of KICKKICKKICKKICK.

52
00:02:40,968 --> 00:02:43,937
One more person who is directly involved
is not here right now,

53
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:45,839
so it's hard to say...

54
00:02:47,608 --> 00:02:48,542
Thank you.

55
00:02:49,877 --> 00:02:51,812
As I mentioned,

56
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,982
what Actress Yeo Woo Ran said
on YouTube...

57
00:02:54,982 --> 00:02:56,350
- Is it true?
- Is it true?

58
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,619
Is not true. It's a lie.

59
00:02:59,253 --> 00:03:00,354
Is it a false report?

60
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:02,923
Those two men are not even capable
of such acts.

61
00:03:02,923 --> 00:03:04,892
Then, should we hurry and upload
a statement of explanation about this?

62
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:07,895
No. Rather than blindly making
the incident more of an issue,

63
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:09,963
I think we should take no action.

64
00:03:09,963 --> 00:03:11,064
- I agree.
- Yes.

65
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:12,533
Let's upload our content as scheduled.

66
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:13,500
Okay. Good.

67
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,869
But will CEO Cho be okay?

68
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:17,704
You're right.

69
00:03:17,704 --> 00:03:20,874
I'm also worried about him.

70
00:03:20,874 --> 00:03:23,977
- Enough questions now.
- No.

71
00:03:23,977 --> 00:03:26,246
Wait. This is my final question.

72
00:03:26,246 --> 00:03:28,148
Let me ask the final question.

73
00:03:28,148 --> 00:03:29,183
What on earth happened...

74
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:35,155
(Episode 9-1 The past has gone by.
Prepare for tomorrow.)

75
00:03:37,858 --> 00:03:38,859
(Episode 9)

76
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:40,460
- Hey.
- Hey.

77
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,466
What's with those clothes?
Are you a doctor or what?

78
00:03:45,466 --> 00:03:47,334
I was cleaning the home.

79
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:49,369
I wanted to ask you something.

80
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:50,771
I'm glad you're here. Come in.

81
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:52,473
I haven't been here for years,

82
00:03:53,373 --> 00:03:56,176
but it still looks the same.
Ten years later, still looks new.

83
00:03:57,478 --> 00:03:59,112
Why dust something that's already clean?

84
00:03:59,112 --> 00:04:00,981
It's clean because I dusted it.

85
00:04:01,915 --> 00:04:03,417
You're actually right.

86
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:05,819
Nothing has changed.

87
00:04:07,855 --> 00:04:09,022
Look at that shelf.

88
00:04:09,022 --> 00:04:12,192
Don't you think this side is 5mm more
to the right than the left side?

89
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,367
Young Sik.

90
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,005
You must be having a very hard time.

91
00:04:31,345 --> 00:04:32,379
Take a seat.

92
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:43,757
You should sit in the middle,

93
00:04:44,258 --> 00:04:47,094
not between the two seats.

94
00:04:52,366 --> 00:04:56,770
About Woo Ran.

95
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,939
Was she really that kind of person?

96
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:01,608
I know I said we should bury everything,

97
00:05:01,608 --> 00:05:04,411
so it's awkward to bring this up again.

98
00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:09,650
But did you and Woo Ran really...

99
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:20,093
Breaking news,
Yeo Woo Ran is doing a live broadcast.

100
00:05:20,093 --> 00:05:22,296
- She's doing a live broadcast.
- What for all of a sudden?

101
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:23,697
Take a look at this.

102
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:24,832
Everyone.

103
00:05:24,832 --> 00:05:26,066
Look at this.

104
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,268
I'm doing a live broadcast because...

105
00:05:28,268 --> 00:05:29,837
Why is she crying? I can't even.

106
00:05:30,304 --> 00:05:33,006
It seems many of you have gotten me wrong.

107
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,075
So I'm really upset.

108
00:05:35,075 --> 00:05:37,344
Gotten her wrong? What does she mean?

109
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:40,113
I really loved acting.

110
00:05:41,748 --> 00:05:44,284
Among the sea of new actors,

111
00:05:45,385 --> 00:05:47,187
I was not really well-known.

112
00:05:48,622 --> 00:05:51,492
So my company forced me
to be on this variety show.

113
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:53,160
Forced her?

114
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,562
- That's how I met the two men.
- What is she even saying?

115
00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:57,931
They said if I didn't date them,

116
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:01,068
they would make me unable to set foot
in show business.

117
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:02,736
They threatened me.

118
00:06:02,736 --> 00:06:04,805
- Threatened?
- I still regret it.

119
00:06:04,805 --> 00:06:07,207
What is she saying? This is all a lie.

120
00:06:07,207 --> 00:06:08,475
This is false information.

121
00:06:08,475 --> 00:06:10,310
She's making up everything.

122
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,645
Why did I say I'd do "Three Dishes"...

123
00:06:12,546 --> 00:06:14,748
- What did I just say?
- "Three Dishes"...

124
00:06:14,748 --> 00:06:16,150
- You can edit this, right?
- "Three Dishes?"

125
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,886
Please edit that part out.
What did I say just now?

126
00:06:21,288 --> 00:06:22,856
Right. This is a live broadcast.

127
00:06:23,657 --> 00:06:25,325
Anyway, at the time, PD Cho...

128
00:06:26,326 --> 00:06:28,795
- What? PD Cho?
- PD Cho?

129
00:06:28,795 --> 00:06:31,165
PD Cho is you. This means I'm also...

130
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:33,534
- Then the "two men"...
- I didn't say anything, did I?

131
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:34,601
Are they us?

132
00:06:35,502 --> 00:06:36,770
I think so.

133
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:40,207
Edit? She blurted out everything already.
Nothing can be edited.

134
00:06:40,207 --> 00:06:42,142
Wait a minute. What's going to happen now?

135
00:06:42,142 --> 00:06:45,546
Everyone will think I said those things,
won't they?

136
00:06:45,546 --> 00:06:47,781
No, right? This is ridiculous.

137
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:48,882
No.

138
00:06:48,882 --> 00:06:50,083
This is a live broadcast, you fool.

139
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,852
What's wrong with her?

140
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:53,987
It's burning.

141
00:07:03,964 --> 00:07:06,500
The reality was burning me.

142
00:07:09,269 --> 00:07:11,839
Please do not push me into darkness again.

143
00:07:12,673 --> 00:07:14,308
Please offer me your support.

144
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,743
No. I never threatened her.

145
00:07:16,743 --> 00:07:18,145
- Young Sik.
- I never threatened her.

146
00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:20,514
Young Sik. Pull yourself together.

147
00:07:20,514 --> 00:07:22,516
Young Sik, pull yourself together.

148
00:07:23,183 --> 00:07:24,051
I know you didn't.

149
00:07:24,718 --> 00:07:25,953
But...

150
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,056
how long are we going
to let Yeo Woo Ran damage us like this?

151
00:07:29,823 --> 00:07:32,526
We have a family to protect.

152
00:07:41,802 --> 00:07:44,438
Don't worry.
We're going to solve it at all rates.

153
00:07:44,438 --> 00:07:45,739
We'll explain ourselves,
and it'll be fine, right?

154
00:07:45,739 --> 00:07:46,940
Right. Don't worry.

155
00:07:47,774 --> 00:07:49,510
What's this?

156
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,944
- What's this?
- What's this?

157
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:52,746
What's going on? Who are they?

158
00:07:52,746 --> 00:07:53,847
What's wrong with you guys?

159
00:07:54,615 --> 00:07:58,519
To keep the peace...

160
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,721
in the world
beautiful Yeo Woo Ran lives in,

161
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:01,788
one, two.

162
00:08:01,788 --> 00:08:04,024
We spread love and eggs.

163
00:08:04,024 --> 00:08:06,393
We're Cute Yeo Woo Dan.

164
00:08:06,393 --> 00:08:07,961
- What's...
- What are they?

165
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:10,764
- In the name of justice,
- We will not forgive you.

166
00:08:10,764 --> 00:08:11,999
Egg beam.

167
00:08:19,506 --> 00:08:21,008
How many cavities do you all have?

168
00:08:22,943 --> 00:08:24,178
Why ask about cavities?

169
00:08:24,812 --> 00:08:28,782
I'll chew you all out,
but I'll spare your gold teeth.

170
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:32,019
Yeo Woo Dan, full-scale attack.

171
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:33,220
Full-scale attack.

172
00:08:34,955 --> 00:08:35,789
In Seong.

173
00:08:37,257 --> 00:08:38,258
In Seong.

174
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:43,163
- In Seong.
- No In Seong.

175
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:48,635
- And I got hit right here.
- Where?

176
00:08:48,635 --> 00:08:51,305
CEOs Ji and Cho, a raw egg attack?

177
00:08:51,305 --> 00:08:52,973
They crossed the line.

178
00:08:52,973 --> 00:08:54,308
- You shouldn't let this pass.
- They crossed the line.

179
00:08:54,308 --> 00:08:55,275
This is clearly violence.

180
00:08:55,275 --> 00:08:56,610
Did you see their faces?

181
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,480
We should check the surveillance camera
and report all of them.

182
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,648
This is all because
of that crazy Yeo Woo Ran.

183
00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:03,016
Let's report this.

184
00:09:03,016 --> 00:09:05,018
Everyone.

185
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:08,021
We should report this.
Our company is now...

186
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,324
What's this?

187
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:11,892
Everyone.

188
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:14,928
Aristotle said...

189
00:09:15,395 --> 00:09:18,966
"He who does not lose his peace of mind
in a storm"...

190
00:09:18,966 --> 00:09:21,168
"is the truly strong one."

191
00:09:22,469 --> 00:09:25,539
So, to solve this problem,

192
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:28,542
let's all find our peace of mind, okay?

193
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:29,476
Okay.

194
00:09:29,476 --> 00:09:30,944
Close your eyes.

195
00:09:32,146 --> 00:09:35,749
Slowly inhale through your nose.

196
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:39,620
Tighten your throat slightly,

197
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,489
and like you're making
the sound of ocean waves,

198
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,792
breathe in,

199
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,429
and slowly breathe out.

200
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:56,503
If it's still hard to calm down,
breathe in and out like this once again.

201
00:09:56,503 --> 00:09:57,638
One more time.

202
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,541
My anger subsided. I feel better.

203
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,009
I've cooled down.

204
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:04,645
You're my savior, indeed.

205
00:10:05,546 --> 00:10:06,446
CEOs Ji and Cho.

206
00:10:07,881 --> 00:10:11,185
It's now time you tell us the truth.

207
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:16,790
That's the only way
to completely quiet this storm.

208
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,791
Everyone agrees, right?

209
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:19,393
Yes, we agree.

210
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:22,629
Okay. Talk to me.

211
00:10:24,598 --> 00:10:25,799
Talk to me.

212
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:28,535
Talk to us.

213
00:10:32,873 --> 00:10:34,074
You can do it.

214
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:36,477
- Tell us.
- Tell us.

215
00:10:37,311 --> 00:10:38,479
It all started...

216
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,648
on the day of the shoot...

217
00:10:42,749 --> 00:10:45,185
of "Three Dishes a Day"
Season 2, Episode 7.

218
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:49,756
Actor Ji and PD Cho.

219
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,227
The guest of "Three Dishes a Day"
Episode 7, Actress Yeo Woo Ran, is here.

220
00:10:53,227 --> 00:10:55,095
- Woo Ran, you're here.
- She's here.

221
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:57,865
It must've been tough coming here.

222
00:11:01,368 --> 00:11:02,569
Hello, Jin Hee.

223
00:11:04,104 --> 00:11:05,339
Hello, Producer Cho.

224
00:11:35,469 --> 00:11:37,271
It's time for a meal.

225
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,010
- Enjoy your meal.
- You, too.

226
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:07,534
(Yeo Woo Ran)

227
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,210
No, Young Sik.

228
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,680
PD Cho, you shouldn't feel this way
about the actress on your show.

229
00:12:25,686 --> 00:12:26,720
PD Cho.

230
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,554
It's you.

231
00:12:33,494 --> 00:12:34,928
PD Cho, you're like a baby.

232
00:12:35,496 --> 00:12:36,330
Excuse me?

233
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,031
You dropped sweet potato earlier,

234
00:12:38,765 --> 00:12:41,869
and now,
you have cream all over your mouth.

235
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:48,008
But I like men who are childlike...

236
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:50,077
because they seem innocent.

237
00:12:51,912 --> 00:12:54,014
I also love you,

238
00:12:54,014 --> 00:12:56,216
I mean, I like you.

239
00:12:59,219 --> 00:13:00,087
Then we clicked.

240
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,159
Why are you still awake?

241
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,962
The cold woke me up.

242
00:13:41,962 --> 00:13:43,864
What are you doing not in bed?

243
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,066
I have to go to the bathroom.

244
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,115
(The air conditioner is on.
Close the door.)

245
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:06,854
Did you get my present for you
for our 22nd day together?

246
00:14:06,854 --> 00:14:09,223
Yes. It's been years
since someone gave me 1,000 paper cranes.

247
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,492
- I know, right?
- Yes. Thank you.

248
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,163
But next time, I want something else.

249
00:14:16,363 --> 00:14:18,532
What is it?
Just say it and I'll give it to you.

250
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:20,400
Really?

251
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,468
Honey.

252
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:25,506
You're my first love and my last love.

253
00:14:25,506 --> 00:14:27,174
I'll do everything for you.

254
00:14:27,174 --> 00:14:29,209
So tell me. What is it?

255
00:14:33,614 --> 00:14:34,314
Never mind.

256
00:14:35,482 --> 00:14:37,017
It'll be a pressure on you, honey.

257
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,590
No, tell me.

258
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,626
Come on. I'll give it to you.

259
00:14:45,626 --> 00:14:48,195
What is it?

260
00:14:55,335 --> 00:14:57,371
My own variety show.

261
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,714
Let's eat.

262
00:15:16,523 --> 00:15:18,592
Young Sik,
you're dating someone, aren't you?

263
00:15:18,592 --> 00:15:19,426
What?

264
00:15:20,494 --> 00:15:21,595
You're dating someone.

265
00:15:23,997 --> 00:15:25,532
Keep our relationship a secret.

266
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,036
Why?

267
00:15:29,036 --> 00:15:32,439
You know how bad going public with
romantic relationships is for actresses.

268
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:37,544
I'm too busy to date anyone.

269
00:15:37,544 --> 00:15:39,313
Nobody's too busy to date.

270
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,114
Jin Hee, I'm doing a new show.

271
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:42,850
A new show? What kind?

272
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,817
It's...

273
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,587
a secret.

274
00:15:46,587 --> 00:15:48,021
What? Tell me.

275
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:49,656
Let me go and wash my hands.

276
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:50,757
Let me join your show.

277
00:15:53,093 --> 00:15:54,695
He's so excited.

278
00:15:57,898 --> 00:15:59,233
I'll eat when he's back.

279
00:16:05,305 --> 00:16:06,373
What is it?

280
00:16:07,741 --> 00:16:08,876
Honey.

281
00:16:08,876 --> 00:16:11,612
I think
"Yeo Woo Ran's Foxy Chat" is the best.

282
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,313
Woo Ran?

283
00:16:22,623 --> 00:16:24,758
- Jin Hee.
- Hi.

284
00:16:24,758 --> 00:16:26,193
I didn't expect to see you here.

285
00:16:27,094 --> 00:16:30,063
We're actors, and this is
a broadcasting station, so it's natural.

286
00:16:30,063 --> 00:16:33,467
I heard you'll be doing a drama written
by Scriptwriter Kim Geum Sook.

287
00:16:33,934 --> 00:16:35,836
I also heard the female lead
hasn't been decided on yet.

288
00:16:35,836 --> 00:16:38,605
Can you please recommend me
to the director and the scriptwriter?

289
00:16:40,174 --> 00:16:44,011
"Yeo Woo Ran's Foxy Chat" hit it big,

290
00:16:44,011 --> 00:16:45,512
so I think they'll like me, too.

291
00:16:46,647 --> 00:16:47,815
Well,

292
00:16:48,315 --> 00:16:50,951
I'll mention your name to them.

293
00:16:53,954 --> 00:16:55,055
Bye, then.

294
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:07,167
Don't turn around.

295
00:17:08,435 --> 00:17:09,670
Just listen to what I have to say.

296
00:17:11,472 --> 00:17:12,573
To be honest,

297
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:17,778
I've had feelings for you
since a long time ago.

298
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:24,451
- Time out.
- That was unexpected.

299
00:17:24,451 --> 00:17:25,786
Time out.

300
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:28,121
Why? This is the best part.

301
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:29,122
- She had feelings for you?
- Yes.

302
00:17:29,122 --> 00:17:30,557
She suddenly hugged you?
Yeo Woo Ran did that?

303
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:32,392
- Yes.
- This doesn't make sense.

304
00:17:32,392 --> 00:17:33,494
It makes total sense.

305
00:17:33,494 --> 00:17:35,295
Why would I lie to you in this situation?

306
00:17:35,295 --> 00:17:36,797
Then why didn't you tell me right away
at the time?

307
00:17:36,797 --> 00:17:39,366
- You didn't give me a chance.
- When did I not give you a chance?

308
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:41,168
- You were always sulky.
- Silence.

309
00:17:41,902 --> 00:17:44,138
Let's let him finish his story.

310
00:17:44,138 --> 00:17:46,907
- Tell us what happened.
- Okay. Tell us.

311
00:17:46,907 --> 00:17:48,509
Young Sik, I mean,

312
00:17:49,076 --> 00:17:51,612
CEO Cho was useless to Yeo Woo Ran now,

313
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,080
so she started kicking him around.

314
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,081
Seriously?

315
00:17:54,081 --> 00:17:56,817
CEO Cho gradually got ruined.

316
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:00,254
What an idiot.

317
00:18:03,724 --> 00:18:05,492
Scriptwriter Nam, what is it?

318
00:18:06,193 --> 00:18:08,262
I'm sure PD Cho is dating someone,

319
00:18:08,262 --> 00:18:09,763
but his date seems like a bitch.

320
00:18:09,763 --> 00:18:13,167
He's been on the phone for an hour now
having a dramatic and cliché conversation.

321
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,235
It's super fun.

322
00:18:15,235 --> 00:18:18,472
I'll go and talk to him. Hold on.

323
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,408
I mean...

324
00:18:21,942 --> 00:18:25,746
I'll call you again soon. Please pick up.

325
00:18:31,185 --> 00:18:32,219
Jin Hee.

326
00:18:35,055 --> 00:18:35,889
Young Sik.

327
00:18:37,925 --> 00:18:41,261
Yeo Woo Ran is not a good person.

328
00:18:45,232 --> 00:18:46,400
- What?
- Especially...

329
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,971
for an innocent man like you
who has never dated anyone before.

330
00:18:53,407 --> 00:18:56,677
What do you know about Woo Ran
to speak ill of her like that?

331
00:18:58,111 --> 00:19:00,414
I know this will hurt you,
but I'll be honest.

332
00:19:00,414 --> 00:19:01,482
You and I...

333
00:19:03,884 --> 00:19:07,020
are mere tools for success to Yeo Woo Ran.

334
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,590
"You and I?"

335
00:19:13,093 --> 00:19:14,528
Do you have feelings for Woo Ran?

336
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,899
Are you jealous because we're dating?
Is that why you're being like this?

337
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:20,000
What are you saying?

338
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,034
If not,

339
00:19:21,835 --> 00:19:24,071
don't ever say that to me again.

340
00:19:24,071 --> 00:19:25,839
If you do, even though we're close now,
I will cut ties with you.

341
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,941
Young Sik.

342
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:28,809
Let go of me.

343
00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:30,444
Hey!

344
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,922
Jin Hee, what are you doing?

345
00:19:42,422 --> 00:19:45,292
I know a nice wine bar.
How about going there with me tomorrow?

346
00:19:46,193 --> 00:19:47,394
Darn it.

347
00:19:50,197 --> 00:19:52,833
She's seriously a bitch.

348
00:19:53,267 --> 00:19:56,103
Stop drinking.
You're going to become a drunkard again.

349
00:19:56,703 --> 00:19:59,706
Even after that,
I tried many times to tell him.

350
00:19:59,706 --> 00:20:01,708
But he wouldn't listen at all.

351
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:05,145
So I reluctantly decided
to take extreme measures.

352
00:20:05,145 --> 00:20:07,014
How?

353
00:20:08,182 --> 00:20:12,519
I decided to show CEO Cho
the real Yeo Woo Ran.

354
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:13,654
Great idea.

355
00:20:14,288 --> 00:20:17,524
Young Sik, meet me in the dressing room.
This is urgent.

356
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:19,293
Okay. I'll be there now.

357
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,466
You're here.

358
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,136
I'm so pleased you called me first.

359
00:20:30,337 --> 00:20:33,207
Are you saying yes to me now?

360
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,411
What made you fall in love with me,
Woo Ran?

361
00:20:40,481 --> 00:20:43,484
Those romantic eyes that make my heart race.

362
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:48,322
Those full lips
that make me want to kiss you.

363
00:20:51,425 --> 00:20:52,259
No.

364
00:21:06,707 --> 00:21:07,541
Young Sik.

365
00:21:10,911 --> 00:21:12,880
No!

366
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,348
No.

367
00:21:14,348 --> 00:21:17,017
Love quarrel is the best genre, indeed.

368
00:21:17,017 --> 00:21:19,953
So what happened after that?

369
00:21:22,422 --> 00:21:23,390
PD Cho thought...

370
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,593
I flirted with his girlfriend.

371
00:21:26,593 --> 00:21:28,662
- My gosh.
- Of course.

372
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:32,266
And I hated that PD Cho didn't trust me.

373
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:34,168
Can't you trust me?

374
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,569
You're despicable.

375
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:37,271
I want to carve out
those romantic eyes of yours.

376
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:38,739
What did you just say to me, you punk?

377
00:21:38,739 --> 00:21:40,541
Do you want to hear it again?

378
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,209
Darn it.

379
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:43,877
You bastard.

380
00:21:43,877 --> 00:21:46,113
- You bastard.
- Young Sik.

381
00:21:46,113 --> 00:21:48,649
- How could you do this to me?
- Stop.

382
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,257
Yeo Woo Ran.

383
00:21:58,258 --> 00:21:59,693
Tell him the truth.

384
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,396
Woo Ran, you chose me, right?

385
00:22:02,396 --> 00:22:05,265
Tell me you chose me.
You were just swayed, right?

386
00:22:06,733 --> 00:22:07,701
I...

387
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,469
Yes?

388
00:22:11,271 --> 00:22:12,105
I...

389
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,145
choose Jin Hee now.

390
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,484
Young Sik. No.

391
00:22:23,484 --> 00:22:25,786
She said she chose Jin Hee.

392
00:22:27,754 --> 00:22:30,123
Woo Ran, wait.

393
00:22:34,495 --> 00:22:37,064
If you're going to dump me, slap me and...

394
00:22:42,202 --> 00:22:43,337
Young Sik, are you okay?

395
00:22:45,606 --> 00:22:46,607
You bastard.

396
00:22:47,274 --> 00:22:49,943
No. Listen to me.

397
00:22:49,943 --> 00:22:50,944
I don't want to.

398
00:22:52,946 --> 00:22:54,515
You have to listen to me.

399
00:22:55,816 --> 00:22:57,584
Young Sik, are you okay?

400
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:00,521
- I can't hear you.
- Young Sik.

401
00:23:00,521 --> 00:23:02,289
Young Sik, are you okay?

402
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,626
Young Sik, don't be like this.

403
00:23:05,626 --> 00:23:07,060
- Young Sik.
- Let go of me.

404
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,165
Don't follow me.

405
00:23:11,165 --> 00:23:12,800
- Young Sik.
- I said don't follow me.

406
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:23,010
That was...

407
00:23:24,478 --> 00:23:25,946
the end of us.

408
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,581
Young Sik.

409
00:23:28,148 --> 00:23:31,251
Why didn't you listen to CEO Ji
at the time?

410
00:23:32,219 --> 00:23:33,253
At the time,

411
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:37,825
I was really emotionally hurt. Also,

412
00:23:38,058 --> 00:23:39,793
it's not all my fault.

413
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,396
You left Korea the very next day
for some overseas schedule.

414
00:23:42,396 --> 00:23:45,466
Exactly. I left Korea for work.

415
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:47,434
Are you sure it was work?
Didn't you just run away?

416
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:48,268
I did not.

417
00:23:48,268 --> 00:23:50,204
Before I left,
I wrote a long e-mail to you...

418
00:23:50,204 --> 00:23:53,507
about the details of what happened
and how I felt about it.

419
00:23:53,507 --> 00:23:54,575
- An e-mail?
- Yes, an e-mail.

420
00:23:54,575 --> 00:23:56,076
What are you saying? I didn't get it.

421
00:23:56,076 --> 00:23:57,444
Then your inbox must be full.

422
00:23:57,444 --> 00:23:59,079
- No.
- I even called you.

423
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,581
- Did you make an international call?
- Yes.

424
00:24:00,581 --> 00:24:02,216
I don't take international calls.

425
00:24:02,216 --> 00:24:03,450
I even sent you a parcel.

426
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,886
Do you still not get it?

427
00:24:05,886 --> 00:24:09,156
Every single thing
that bitch Yeo Woo Ran says is a lie.

428
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,792
When are you going to stop calling her
"Woo Ran?"

429
00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:15,462
If you're a CEO, act like one, CEO Cho.

430
00:24:16,563 --> 00:24:17,798
She's right!

431
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:20,868
How could you drop a friendship
because of love?

432
00:24:20,868 --> 00:24:21,869
Exactly.

433
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:25,038
Now, the point is...

434
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:28,542
not to blame someone
for causing this big problem...

435
00:24:28,542 --> 00:24:30,844
because of his past foolish judgment.

436
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,949
The point is to solve
this current problem.

437
00:24:35,949 --> 00:24:36,683
Yes.

438
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:39,153
Then, should we do a live broadcast
as well and call her out?

439
00:24:39,153 --> 00:24:41,054
Tell everyone, Actor Ji and PD Cho
has never done anything like that.

440
00:24:41,054 --> 00:24:43,924
- Good idea.
- Everything is Yeo Woo Ran's plot.

441
00:24:43,924 --> 00:24:45,659
"Plot." That's a good word. Okay.

442
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,594
No. If we hastily respond like that,

443
00:24:47,594 --> 00:24:49,196
it will just sound like an excuse.

444
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,564
Then do we have to keep silent?

445
00:24:50,564 --> 00:24:51,932
Is there any way?

446
00:24:51,932 --> 00:24:53,267
We need proof.

447
00:24:53,267 --> 00:24:55,903
We need proof to accurately refute
her claim.

448
00:24:55,903 --> 00:24:58,038
I'll upload our official statement
on the forum first.

449
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,073
Let's find exact proof...

450
00:25:00,073 --> 00:25:01,575
and open a press conference.

451
00:25:03,677 --> 00:25:05,312
(KICKKICKKICKKICK
YouTube Community Announcement)

452
00:25:05,312 --> 00:25:07,881
(The controversy about CEOs Ji Jin Hee
and Cho Young Sik is not true.)

453
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,450
(We will officially indicate our position
regarding this.)

454
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:14,121
CEO Cho, do you still have the phone
you used when you were dating her?

455
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:16,757
It was ten years ago,
so I don't have it anymore.

456
00:25:17,324 --> 00:25:19,359
Do you have any pictures or videos...

457
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:22,129
of you two together?

458
00:25:22,129 --> 00:25:23,497
I had them on my laptop...

459
00:25:23,497 --> 00:25:25,098
but someone stole it when I was in Europe.

460
00:25:25,098 --> 00:25:26,333
Darn it.

461
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:30,270
Have you ever uploaded any pictures
or videos of you two together...

462
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,005
on your social media?

463
00:25:32,005 --> 00:25:32,973
Right.

464
00:25:32,973 --> 00:25:36,977
I have all of them made private
on my Fakebook.

465
00:25:36,977 --> 00:25:37,945
Yes.

466
00:25:38,378 --> 00:25:41,482
But it's been years,
so I don't remember my ID and password.

467
00:25:41,482 --> 00:25:43,150
- We'll find them.
- Yes.

468
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,985
I have a few IDs I use.

469
00:25:44,985 --> 00:25:47,221
We can combine them,
but we don't have much time now.

470
00:25:47,221 --> 00:25:48,288
CEO Cho, you can send them to me...

471
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,756
and I'll combine them as fast as I can
and find your ID and password.

472
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,792
- Then I'll send them to you right away.
- Okay.

473
00:25:51,792 --> 00:25:52,893
Mark.

474
00:25:52,893 --> 00:25:55,062
Can you find proof
that I did not date Yeo Woo Ran?

475
00:25:55,062 --> 00:25:56,296
- Okay.
- Thank you.

476
00:25:56,296 --> 00:25:59,566
But CEO Ji,
I can find proof that two people dated...

477
00:25:59,566 --> 00:26:01,335
but how can anyone find proof
that two people did not date?

478
00:26:01,835 --> 00:26:02,803
Is there any...

479
00:26:02,803 --> 00:26:04,938
Why are you saying there's no proof?
There's proof.

480
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,673
Really? Where?

481
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,775
Those romantic eyes.

482
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,611
They're telling the truth.

483
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,315
Right, I just remembered something.

484
00:26:15,315 --> 00:26:16,817
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

485
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:18,719
- Min Jae, I sent them to you.
- Yes, I got them.

486
00:26:27,728 --> 00:26:29,530
I found the e-mail and password
of CEO Cho.

487
00:26:31,098 --> 00:26:33,600
I organized all the information
that KICKERs gathered.

488
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,137
I boiled herbs I grew myself...

489
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,872
to make this tea that's good
for concentration and relaxation.

490
00:26:38,872 --> 00:26:42,409
This is Attention Tea.

491
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:45,913
Here you go.

492
00:26:45,913 --> 00:26:48,682
Wait. Yeo Woo Ran just started
a live broadcast.

493
00:26:48,682 --> 00:26:50,150
You should take a look at this.

494
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:55,389
I heard KICKKICKKICKKICK will
officially announce their position.

495
00:26:55,923 --> 00:26:57,357
So before that,

496
00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:00,561
I wanted to tell you...

497
00:27:01,361 --> 00:27:02,663
one more time...

498
00:27:05,265 --> 00:27:06,934
that I've been falsely accused.

499
00:27:08,135 --> 00:27:10,070
That's why I turned on the camera again.

500
00:27:12,272 --> 00:27:13,907
We should confront her.

501
00:27:13,907 --> 00:27:15,776
Let's do a live press conference.

502
00:27:15,776 --> 00:27:18,378
Yes, but before that, like I said,

503
00:27:18,378 --> 00:27:20,414
we need proof
that I did not date Yeo Woo Ran.

504
00:27:20,414 --> 00:27:22,716
We've been attacked twice already.

505
00:27:22,716 --> 00:27:24,952
If she attacks us one more time,
we'll be KOed.

506
00:27:24,952 --> 00:27:27,554
It's time for a proper counterattack.

507
00:27:27,554 --> 00:27:30,257
- Attack.
- Let's do a live broadcast, too.

508
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:37,731
Hello. I'm Actor Ji Jin Hee...

509
00:27:38,298 --> 00:27:40,000
And I'm Producer Cho Young Sik.

510
00:27:40,434 --> 00:27:43,237
Before we talk
about what's true and what's not,

511
00:27:43,237 --> 00:27:47,374
we apologize for bringing negative news.

512
00:27:47,641 --> 00:27:49,409
(You can do it, CEOs Ji and Cho.)

513
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:55,749
We plan to frankly reveal
the truth that we both know.

514
00:27:55,749 --> 00:27:57,851
Yes. First of all,

515
00:27:58,952 --> 00:28:01,755
Actress Yeo Woo Ran's assertion
is not true at all.

516
00:28:01,755 --> 00:28:04,625
Ten years ago,
Actress Yeo Woo Ran and I dated...

517
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:06,860
for exactly 222 days.

518
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,429
The first proof is this. Min Jae.

519
00:28:12,366 --> 00:28:16,336
Ten years ago, when Yeo Woo Ran
and I were dating,

520
00:28:16,336 --> 00:28:18,005
we wore these matching items.

521
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,174
Also...

522
00:28:20,974 --> 00:28:22,943
There's this pose I'm into these days.

523
00:28:22,943 --> 00:28:24,912
(A message of love for her fans)

524
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,079
I love you.

525
00:28:28,382 --> 00:28:30,117
In her gesture,

526
00:28:30,984 --> 00:28:35,923
this circle means the letter O
in my name Young Sik.

527
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:41,395
Those matching items.

528
00:28:41,395 --> 00:28:44,231
Doesn't everyone have them these days?

529
00:28:44,832 --> 00:28:48,635
And did you say my gesture means
the letter O in Young Sik?

530
00:28:49,169 --> 00:28:51,472
Don't you think you're being
too self-conscious?

531
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:54,174
- Self-conscious?
- She's shameless.

532
00:28:54,174 --> 00:28:55,742
I can't even.

533
00:28:55,742 --> 00:28:58,445
She's so shameless.

534
00:29:00,013 --> 00:29:01,315
And lastly,

535
00:29:01,315 --> 00:29:03,951
I agonized over
whether or not I should reveal...

536
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:07,454
this video to everyone. However,

537
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:11,792
I can't let KICKKICKKICKKICK and I
be wronged like this.

538
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,894
That's why I decided to reveal this.

539
00:29:14,428 --> 00:29:15,829
- PD Min Jae.
- Yes.

540
00:29:17,998 --> 00:29:19,833
- I prepared this for you.
- What is it?

541
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:22,269
Drumrolls. Ta-da.

542
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:24,404
(Cho Young Sik
Yeo Woo Ran)

543
00:29:25,005 --> 00:29:26,707
- Do you like it?
- Look at this.

544
00:29:26,707 --> 00:29:30,811
Show it to the camera.
Cho Young Sik and Yeo Woo Ran.

545
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:31,712
When did you make this?

546
00:29:31,712 --> 00:29:33,680
I woke up really early to make this.

547
00:29:35,382 --> 00:29:36,884
Look at this.

548
00:29:38,886 --> 00:29:40,954
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

549
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:46,193
As you saw, the relationship
between Actress Yeo Woo Ran and I...

550
00:29:46,727 --> 00:29:50,097
was not a forced relationship at all.

551
00:29:50,097 --> 00:29:51,064
We actually...

552
00:29:53,634 --> 00:29:55,602
promised to get married.

553
00:29:56,136 --> 00:29:57,671
Ta-da.

554
00:29:58,705 --> 00:30:01,175
Young Sik, thank you so much.

555
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:02,476
Young Sik, I love you.

556
00:30:03,777 --> 00:30:04,945
Congratulations.

557
00:30:04,945 --> 00:30:07,848
- "Yeo Woo Ran's Foxy Chat" started.
- Young Sik, you're the best.

558
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,485
Yes.

559
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:14,788
He played good cop, bad cop,
so I couldn't help but date him.

560
00:30:14,788 --> 00:30:17,291
But everyone takes videos like that
when they're dating, don't they?

561
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:19,159
Don't we all promise to marry?

562
00:30:21,428 --> 00:30:24,164
But we don't promise that
with 100 percent sincerity, right?

563
00:30:24,832 --> 00:30:26,500
100 percent sincerity...

564
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,734
But Young Sik was sincere.

565
00:30:27,734 --> 00:30:30,170
If you're going to refute what I say,

566
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:33,440
show everyone proof
that Actor Ji and I did not date, either.

567
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,608
Everyone.

568
00:30:34,608 --> 00:30:35,609
What is it?

569
00:30:36,677 --> 00:30:41,148
I brought proof to completely refute
Yeo Woo Ran's assertion.

570
00:30:41,148 --> 00:30:43,317
Breaking news. We have absolute proof.

571
00:30:43,317 --> 00:30:45,285
Please wait a minute. Play that right now.

572
00:30:45,285 --> 00:30:49,189
Hello. I'm Producer Kang Tae Ho
who also produced "Three Dishes a Day."

573
00:30:49,189 --> 00:30:51,892
I managed to get this videotape
from the KVS reference room.

574
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,193
Good job.

575
00:30:53,193 --> 00:30:56,530
This is a conversation between a hair
and makeup staff and Yeo Woo Ran...

576
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:59,266
during "Yeo Woo Ran's Foxy Chat."

577
00:30:59,266 --> 00:31:00,300
Listen to it.

578
00:31:00,934 --> 00:31:03,504
How long am I going
to date PD Cho Young Sik?

579
00:31:03,504 --> 00:31:04,471
Look at that.

580
00:31:04,872 --> 00:31:08,008
I got my own variety show,
and it was a success.

581
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:09,977
So I'm thinking of breaking up.

582
00:31:10,544 --> 00:31:14,548
Actor Ji is going to be
on a blockbuster drama soon.

583
00:31:14,548 --> 00:31:15,983
If I become Actor Ji's girlfriend,

584
00:31:15,983 --> 00:31:18,552
I might become the female lead
of that drama, so I'm hitting on him.

585
00:31:18,552 --> 00:31:20,821
But he won't say yes. How annoying.

586
00:31:22,189 --> 00:31:25,125
You heard that, right?
I did not say yes to her.

587
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:28,061
I'm not that kind of person.
I'm Ji Jin Hee.

588
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,633
Turn off the camera.

589
00:31:32,633 --> 00:31:34,434
Turn it off.

590
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,969
She turned it off.

591
00:31:40,007 --> 00:31:41,542
You should explain yourself to finish up.

592
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,744
- Everyone.
- PD Tae Ho.

593
00:31:43,744 --> 00:31:45,145
You saw everything, right?

594
00:31:45,145 --> 00:31:49,149
Finally, the truth has been revealed.

595
00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:49,983
Yes.

596
00:31:49,983 --> 00:31:53,086
Yeo Woo Ran made a move...

597
00:31:53,086 --> 00:31:55,889
on this diligent
and honest Producer, Cho Young Sik...

598
00:31:55,889 --> 00:31:57,324
merely to get something from him.

599
00:31:57,324 --> 00:32:00,427
This undeniable fact has been revealed.

600
00:32:00,427 --> 00:32:02,763
We announce this truth to you,

601
00:32:02,763 --> 00:32:06,366
and this is the end of our live broadcast.

602
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:07,367
Thank you.

603
00:32:08,168 --> 00:32:09,002
We did it.

604
00:32:14,274 --> 00:32:17,377
- Good job, everyone.
- Good job.

605
00:32:18,712 --> 00:32:19,546
Good job.

606
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:22,182
You played a big role.

607
00:32:33,193 --> 00:32:37,197
I trusted both of you.

608
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:57,818
Jin Hee.

609
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,224
Sorry.

610
00:33:12,232 --> 00:33:15,302
Was I blind at the time? Why...

611
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:18,405
couldn't I see the truth?

612
00:33:21,742 --> 00:33:23,610
You must've hated me so much.

613
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,846
I'm so sorry.

614
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:28,582
I did hate you.

615
00:33:30,751 --> 00:33:33,720
It was love over friendship for you,

616
00:33:34,688 --> 00:33:36,123
that's why.

617
00:33:45,632 --> 00:33:50,237
But we met again like this
after ten years...

618
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,739
and became the CEOs of KICKKICKKICKKICK.

619
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:56,143
Yes.

620
00:33:58,045 --> 00:34:00,514
How we met on the rooftop that day...

621
00:34:00,514 --> 00:34:01,715
feels like destiny.

622
00:34:02,816 --> 00:34:05,452
So from now on,
believe what I say, you brat.

623
00:34:06,553 --> 00:34:07,521
I'll do that.

624
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:10,791
Thanks.

625
00:34:11,525 --> 00:34:14,261
Thank you for not giving up
on your ugly friend until the end.

626
00:34:31,712 --> 00:34:32,646
It must've been hard for you.

627
00:34:33,347 --> 00:34:34,181
You, too.

628
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:54,468
We've been hugging for too long.

629
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:56,103
- Right?
- Right.

630
00:34:58,739 --> 00:34:59,940
Aren't you hungry?

631
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,509
How about a drink after a long time?

632
00:35:02,509 --> 00:35:05,679
Good. I'll be waiting
at Young Hee's nearby.

633
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,880
Okay.

634
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,972
The truth, quite dirty but hot,

635
00:35:21,972 --> 00:35:24,241
about Actor Ji, PD Cho,
and Actress Yeo Woo Ran...

636
00:35:24,241 --> 00:35:26,142
has finally been revealed.

637
00:35:26,142 --> 00:35:28,211
Actor Ji and PD Cho and Yeo Woo Ran...

638
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:31,314
even went on a live broadcast,
sparking a battle for the truth.

639
00:35:31,314 --> 00:35:33,483
The battle did not seem to end
until the end,

640
00:35:33,483 --> 00:35:36,853
but the video that PD Kang Tae Ho brought
was revealed to everyone,

641
00:35:36,853 --> 00:35:39,522
and Yeo Woo Ran was KOed.

642
00:35:39,522 --> 00:35:42,025
Yeo Woo Ran got on a flight to failure
with no way back.

643
00:35:42,025 --> 00:35:44,761
She actually ran away on a plane today.

644
00:35:44,761 --> 00:35:47,397
On the other hand,
with support for KICKKICKKICKKICK,

645
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:49,933
their subscriber numbers are rising.

646
00:35:49,933 --> 00:35:52,202
KICKKICKKICKKICK has been at the center
of controversy from the start.

647
00:35:52,202 --> 00:35:53,837
Are there still any other controversies?

648
00:35:53,837 --> 00:35:55,272
I'm personally curious.

649
00:35:56,506 --> 00:35:59,042
The central figures
of the dirty and hot issue,

650
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:00,677
Actor Ji and PD Cho.

651
00:36:00,677 --> 00:36:02,779
Will they be able to date anyone
after what happened?

652
00:36:02,779 --> 00:36:04,314
Will they ever be happy?

653
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:06,750
Of course, they can date someone.

654
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,318
Of course, they can be happy.

655
00:36:12,956 --> 00:36:13,957
Yes, Professor.

656
00:36:14,391 --> 00:36:15,859
At the time,

657
00:36:16,192 --> 00:36:19,229
I strangely didn't faint
even after seeing blood.

658
00:36:19,229 --> 00:36:22,065
It may be a temporary change
in the reaction of the nervous system.

659
00:36:22,065 --> 00:36:25,135
Vasovagal syncope that you have...

660
00:36:25,135 --> 00:36:27,270
can change depending on various factors.

661
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,806
I'm guessing it was mainly
due to psychological factors.

662
00:36:30,473 --> 00:36:33,143
That is to say, the difference
in the environment and situation.

663
00:36:35,145 --> 00:36:36,846
Wait. It really hurts.

664
00:36:38,248 --> 00:36:39,549
It hurts.

665
00:36:39,549 --> 00:36:42,419
Was the situation when you saw the blood
different from previous ones?

666
00:36:42,419 --> 00:36:44,721
Yes. I think so.

667
00:36:45,155 --> 00:36:45,989
I see.

668
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:48,992
I'm getting a call.
Pay a visit when you have the time.

669
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,062
Okay. Thank you, Professor.

670
00:36:52,863 --> 00:36:53,697
Okay.

671
00:36:54,764 --> 00:36:55,932
- Hello.
- Hello.

672
00:36:55,932 --> 00:36:58,435
One iced americano with an extra shot...

673
00:36:58,435 --> 00:36:59,769
and one Today's Sandwich, please.

674
00:37:01,037 --> 00:37:03,006
Wait.

675
00:37:03,006 --> 00:37:05,942
And one venti iced americano...

676
00:37:05,942 --> 00:37:07,777
and one venti iced vanilla latte.

677
00:37:07,777 --> 00:37:10,881
Add these two, and I'll pay with this.

678
00:37:11,381 --> 00:37:12,382
Okay.

679
00:37:12,782 --> 00:37:15,252
Is it all on you? Bang.

680
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:17,020
Bang Bang.

681
00:37:17,988 --> 00:37:19,623
Joo Ha, why are you buying this?

682
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:24,194
Because I'm thankful to you for this.

683
00:37:26,796 --> 00:37:27,898
Is your knee okay now?

684
00:37:29,966 --> 00:37:30,800
Yes.

685
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:32,536
I'm fine.

686
00:37:33,937 --> 00:37:36,206
Please hurry.

687
00:37:36,206 --> 00:37:37,073
I'm fine.

688
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:39,009
Thank you.

689
00:37:52,756 --> 00:37:54,591
Someone's phone is vibrating.

690
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:56,660
But it's not my phone.

691
00:37:57,861 --> 00:37:58,695
Right.

692
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,868
Hello?

693
00:38:06,736 --> 00:38:07,604
Hello?

694
00:38:23,353 --> 00:38:24,221
Darn it.

695
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:31,127
Who was that
to make you hang up like that?

696
00:38:31,661 --> 00:38:32,796
Was it voice phishing?

697
00:38:32,796 --> 00:38:33,830
Or your ex?

698
00:38:34,431 --> 00:38:35,498
No, it wasn't any of that.

699
00:38:39,736 --> 00:38:43,773
You know that show "Rebound Relationship?"

700
00:38:43,773 --> 00:38:45,342
People are reaching out to their exes
to be on that show together.

701
00:38:45,342 --> 00:38:47,043
Back in the day,
they used to drunk-text their ex...

702
00:38:47,043 --> 00:38:49,579
saying "Are you sleeping? I miss you."

703
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:52,782
But these days, dating shows of rebound
relationships and reunion and such...

704
00:38:52,782 --> 00:38:55,986
Yes, I know.
I think I've seen that show, too.

705
00:38:55,986 --> 00:38:57,721
You have? Okay.

706
00:38:57,721 --> 00:38:59,756
Dating shows.

707
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,158
Dating shows were the answer.

708
00:39:02,859 --> 00:39:03,927
Excuse me.

709
00:39:05,028 --> 00:39:05,962
He scared me.

710
00:39:05,962 --> 00:39:08,665
I just got a fantastic idea.

711
00:39:08,665 --> 00:39:09,666
Get inside.

712
00:39:12,402 --> 00:39:14,104
Okay, everyone.

713
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:16,940
There are days
when you want to keep shaking your body...

714
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,275
without thinking, right?

715
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:20,277
Today's that day.

716
00:39:20,277 --> 00:39:24,981
Jasmine's 15 Minute Class, belly dance.

717
00:39:25,749 --> 00:39:27,350
No need for a flexible pelvis.

718
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:29,152
No need for a flexible waist.

719
00:39:29,152 --> 00:39:34,224
Just shake as much as you want.

720
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:37,994
Hello? Yes.

721
00:39:37,994 --> 00:39:38,895
Hey.

722
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:41,131
Yes?

723
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,034
Yes.

724
00:39:44,034 --> 00:39:45,535
- You.
- Yes?

725
00:39:45,535 --> 00:39:47,137
The ladies have been cast?

726
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:49,139
- I'll let you know the schedule soon.
- You.

727
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,176
We just cast the ladies for the DS.

728
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:56,046
What's a DS?

729
00:39:56,046 --> 00:39:57,781
It's short for "dating show."

730
00:39:57,781 --> 00:39:58,782
I see.

731
00:39:59,516 --> 00:40:01,618
But what kind of DS is it?

732
00:40:02,118 --> 00:40:03,820
- For lonely...
- You.

733
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,754
I'm tired.

734
00:40:05,956 --> 00:40:07,157
I'll tell you later, not now.

735
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:10,827
Because we're
in Jasmine's 15 Minute Class right now.

736
00:40:10,827 --> 00:40:13,763
So everyone, shake your waists.

737
00:40:13,763 --> 00:40:17,133
Shake.

738
00:40:17,133 --> 00:40:19,836
(A DS on KICKKICKKICKKICK?
Who's the cast?)

739
00:40:19,836 --> 00:40:20,837
Yes.

740
00:40:24,608 --> 00:40:28,078
(Episode 9-2
The Era of Dating Shows)

741
00:40:28,812 --> 00:40:30,680
But I'm so busy.

742
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,850
No In Seong, what are you up to this time?

743
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,051
Calm down.

744
00:40:35,051 --> 00:40:37,487
For our two lonely CEOs,

745
00:40:38,121 --> 00:40:40,156
I planned a blind date.

746
00:40:40,156 --> 00:40:41,725
A blind date?

747
00:40:41,725 --> 00:40:43,793
I'm Actor Ji. I don't do blind dates.

748
00:40:43,793 --> 00:40:44,828
I don't do blind dates, either.

749
00:40:44,828 --> 00:40:46,663
Why call me to say that when I'm busy?

750
00:40:47,864 --> 00:40:48,932
They're pretty.

751
00:40:49,633 --> 00:40:51,601
- What?
- Pretty?

752
00:40:51,601 --> 00:40:54,037
They're intelligent, beautiful,
and good-hearted.

753
00:40:54,037 --> 00:40:55,906
Perfect ladies were cast.

754
00:40:55,906 --> 00:40:57,774
Why do something we never asked?

755
00:40:57,774 --> 00:40:58,842
Do you have pictures of them?

756
00:40:58,842 --> 00:40:59,976
Pictures that aren't photoshopped?

757
00:40:59,976 --> 00:41:02,245
I don't have any pictures
because this is a blind date.

758
00:41:02,245 --> 00:41:06,049
Meet ladies who truly click with you.

759
00:41:06,049 --> 00:41:07,817
How can I trust you, In Seong?

760
00:41:07,817 --> 00:41:09,719
- I'm for it.
- What?

761
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:11,688
Dating shows are popular these days,

762
00:41:11,688 --> 00:41:13,156
and the blind date seems
like a good concept.

763
00:41:13,156 --> 00:41:15,258
If we shoot it well
and upload it on "LUIC,"

764
00:41:15,258 --> 00:41:16,359
I think we'll get positive reactions.

765
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:17,394
Sounds good.

766
00:41:17,394 --> 00:41:20,397
It's the era of dating shows now,
so, let's do it to get more subscribers.

767
00:41:20,397 --> 00:41:23,633
Who knows? You two might end up
actually dating someone.

768
00:41:25,035 --> 00:41:26,303
Is there one more spot for me?

769
00:41:26,303 --> 00:41:27,170
No.

770
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,238
- Too bad.
- No.

771
00:41:28,939 --> 00:41:32,008
A blind date must be super fun.

772
00:41:33,577 --> 00:41:36,880
Now that I think about it,
I was too selfish.

773
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,450
I have no choice but to go
on that blind date for our company.

774
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,285
What else can I do?

775
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:44,788
I guess I should also do it
because there's no other way, right?

776
00:41:44,788 --> 00:41:45,622
Fine.

777
00:41:48,124 --> 00:41:49,993
- Don't mind him.
- Really?

778
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:52,062
You have their pictures, right?

779
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:54,865
- Are you going to do it?
- You have them, don't you?

780
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:57,033
Follow me.

781
00:42:00,403 --> 00:42:02,138
Me too.

782
00:42:17,787 --> 00:42:19,623
My cilantro.

783
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:23,793
Grow big and strong quickly
so I can eat all of you.

784
00:42:28,198 --> 00:42:29,165
Hello?

785
00:42:29,699 --> 00:42:30,734
Mark.

786
00:42:30,734 --> 00:42:33,436
Me? I'm watering my cilantro babies.

787
00:42:34,938 --> 00:42:35,906
What?

788
00:42:36,606 --> 00:42:38,708
You were cast on "Siblings Dating?"

789
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:42,445
But your elder sisters are asking
to be on that show with them...

790
00:42:42,445 --> 00:42:44,714
and you're refusing their offers,
so you're going to be late?

791
00:42:44,714 --> 00:42:45,916
You jerk.

792
00:42:48,084 --> 00:42:49,586
Okay. Fine.

793
00:42:49,953 --> 00:42:51,855
Okay. See you later.

794
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,558
Seriously?

795
00:42:56,226 --> 00:42:58,895
It's bright and sunny today.

796
00:43:02,732 --> 00:43:04,067
I'm so sleepy.

797
00:43:05,569 --> 00:43:06,703
I'm going to take a nap.

798
00:43:09,739 --> 00:43:12,909
There's even a blanket here.

799
00:43:23,887 --> 00:43:26,489
PD Min Jae, someone wants to see you.

800
00:43:26,957 --> 00:43:27,824
Me?

801
00:43:27,824 --> 00:43:30,527
She's really pretty.

802
00:43:30,527 --> 00:43:31,595
She wants to see you on the rooftop.

803
00:43:34,831 --> 00:43:35,765
Who is it?

804
00:43:39,102 --> 00:43:40,003
Pretty?

805
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:43,540
Who's pretty?

806
00:43:45,242 --> 00:43:47,677
A trampoline and a hot tub.

807
00:43:48,778 --> 00:43:50,013
What a unique company.

808
00:43:54,718 --> 00:43:55,585
Hey.

809
00:43:57,854 --> 00:44:00,290
- Why are you here?
- To see you, of course.

810
00:44:01,057 --> 00:44:02,626
Are you still angry at me, Min Jae?

811
00:44:02,626 --> 00:44:03,460
Stop.

812
00:44:04,427 --> 00:44:05,562
Just get to the point.

813
00:44:08,164 --> 00:44:10,233
I want to be on "Rebound Relationship."

814
00:44:11,535 --> 00:44:12,536
On what?

815
00:44:12,536 --> 00:44:15,405
"Rebound Relationship."
I want to be on that show with you.

816
00:44:16,773 --> 00:44:18,174
If that's why you're here,
I'm leaving now.

817
00:44:18,475 --> 00:44:21,044
Why? It'll be good for you, too.

818
00:44:21,044 --> 00:44:22,646
We will definitely draw attention.

819
00:44:22,646 --> 00:44:25,081
I'm not interested in any of that.
Sorry, Gyu Ri.

820
00:44:26,449 --> 00:44:27,417
Hey.

821
00:44:28,852 --> 00:44:30,554
Do you still resent me?

822
00:44:31,121 --> 00:44:33,690
Wasn't asking me to wait two years till
you were out of the military a bit much?

823
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:37,260
Right.

824
00:44:39,229 --> 00:44:41,198
That was why you dumped me.
That's a fact.

825
00:44:42,098 --> 00:44:44,367
But remember what you said
in your broadcast?

826
00:44:45,869 --> 00:44:46,836
That...

827
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:51,441
I thought you'd say it before I did.

828
00:44:52,242 --> 00:44:55,545
So I was scared
I'd lose my subscribers and fans.

829
00:44:56,179 --> 00:44:58,048
That's why I lied to them
and said you dumped me.

830
00:44:58,048 --> 00:44:59,082
Sure, good for you.

831
00:44:59,282 --> 00:45:01,651
That beanpole was so mean to him.

832
00:45:01,918 --> 00:45:04,588
Just keep saying that from now on, okay?

833
00:45:04,588 --> 00:45:06,256
- Min Jae.
- Also,

834
00:45:11,561 --> 00:45:12,996
let's never see each other ever again.

835
00:45:14,231 --> 00:45:15,265
Bye.

836
00:45:18,902 --> 00:45:21,438
I'm regretting it. Let's start over.

837
00:45:22,305 --> 00:45:23,106
What?

838
00:45:23,106 --> 00:45:25,275
Let's start over
on "Rebound Relationship."

839
00:45:25,275 --> 00:45:26,843
- I'll make it up to you.
- Stop.

840
00:45:30,013 --> 00:45:30,914
I can't even.

841
00:45:35,952 --> 00:45:37,520
You haven't changed at all.

842
00:45:40,757 --> 00:45:42,559
Isn't this why you liked me
in the first place?

843
00:45:43,326 --> 00:45:44,728
And you hate me now, right?

844
00:45:46,229 --> 00:45:48,765
But Min Jae,
there's a thin line between love and hate.

845
00:45:48,765 --> 00:45:49,866
No.

846
00:45:49,866 --> 00:45:51,835
I have no feelings for you now.

847
00:45:56,072 --> 00:45:57,307
And I like someone else.

848
00:45:59,075 --> 00:45:59,976
Someone else?

849
00:45:59,976 --> 00:46:02,312
You can't like someone other than me.

850
00:46:02,646 --> 00:46:03,747
Why can't I?

851
00:46:03,747 --> 00:46:04,681
You're lying.

852
00:46:06,883 --> 00:46:07,918
No.

853
00:46:08,785 --> 00:46:09,953
My goodness.

854
00:46:09,953 --> 00:46:13,323
A bee.

855
00:46:17,928 --> 00:46:19,896
Hey, are you okay?

856
00:46:19,896 --> 00:46:20,730
Move.

857
00:46:21,798 --> 00:46:24,067
Excuse me. Who are you?

858
00:46:26,636 --> 00:46:27,571
Me...

859
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:30,941
Me?

860
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:35,278
I'm Min Jae's girlfriend.

861
00:46:36,546 --> 00:46:37,847
What?

862
00:46:38,481 --> 00:46:39,649
Why are you suddenly like this?

863
00:46:39,649 --> 00:46:40,483
Honey.

864
00:46:41,218 --> 00:46:43,520
We're secretly dating at work,
aren't we?

865
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,456
But she's not working here.

866
00:46:46,456 --> 00:46:50,227
So we can tell her
that we're dating, right?

867
00:46:50,227 --> 00:46:51,661
That we're on fire, right?

868
00:46:51,661 --> 00:46:53,763
Seriously? Are you really dating her?

869
00:46:57,467 --> 00:46:59,703
Yes.

870
00:46:59,703 --> 00:47:01,571
- Yes?
- Yes.

871
00:47:01,571 --> 00:47:02,806
So you.

872
00:47:03,373 --> 00:47:04,975
Don't tell Min Jae...

873
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:08,645
to be on "Rebound Relationship" with you.

874
00:47:09,412 --> 00:47:13,116
Honey,
I picked a bunch of cilantro earlier.

875
00:47:13,116 --> 00:47:15,685
Let's go eat hamburgers with cilantro.

876
00:47:16,453 --> 00:47:18,255
My foot hurts.
I mean, I don't like cilantro.

877
00:47:18,255 --> 00:47:19,990
- Honey.
- Okay, let's go.

878
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:21,491
- Okay?
- Okay.

879
00:47:21,491 --> 00:47:23,960
But I forgot my shoes. Let's go.

880
00:47:26,796 --> 00:47:29,933
A bee chased after me earlier.

881
00:47:29,933 --> 00:47:31,268
- I see.
- You saw that, right?

882
00:47:31,268 --> 00:47:32,502
Hold these for me.

883
00:47:33,336 --> 00:47:34,237
We'll go now.

884
00:47:34,237 --> 00:47:36,139
- Yes.
- Honey.

885
00:47:41,711 --> 00:47:44,281
Joo Ha, why did you do that?

886
00:47:48,118 --> 00:47:50,754
Sorry. I suddenly got too nosy.

887
00:47:50,754 --> 00:47:52,422
I'm sorry, Shiba.

888
00:47:52,422 --> 00:47:53,423
No.

889
00:47:54,124 --> 00:47:56,126
- Thanks.
- Okay.

890
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:57,694
Put on your shoes.

891
00:47:57,694 --> 00:47:58,995
Okay.

892
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:03,400
That woman won't ask you to be...

893
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,501
on "Rebound Relationship" anymore.

894
00:48:06,236 --> 00:48:07,137
So there.

895
00:48:11,408 --> 00:48:13,243
I want to eat a hamburger, too.

896
00:48:14,144 --> 00:48:15,979
It's on me. Let's eat together.

897
00:48:17,047 --> 00:48:20,116
That's okay, right,
Min Jae's Current Girlfriend?

898
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:23,720
Why insist...

899
00:48:25,388 --> 00:48:26,856
Of course, it's okay.

900
00:48:27,357 --> 00:48:28,491
Min Jae's...

901
00:48:29,759 --> 00:48:31,628
Ex-Girlfriend.

902
00:48:35,498 --> 00:48:37,634
- Let's go. Smile.
- Okay.

903
00:48:42,105 --> 00:48:43,406
Hey, Ji Jin Hee.

904
00:48:44,908 --> 00:48:46,676
Why are you so handsome?

905
00:48:48,345 --> 00:48:50,747
When are you going to stop being handsome?

906
00:48:53,049 --> 00:48:56,486
I'm doing this for KICKKICKKICKKICK
because I have no choice.

907
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:58,555
But wait.

908
00:48:59,522 --> 00:49:00,457
PD Cho.

909
00:49:02,325 --> 00:49:03,960
You look fine today.

910
00:49:04,794 --> 00:49:06,396
I love you. No.

911
00:49:06,396 --> 00:49:08,131
Saying "I love you" is too much
on a first encounter.

912
00:49:08,765 --> 00:49:10,634
You're just a producer.

913
00:49:10,634 --> 00:49:12,402
So stop looking fine.

914
00:49:12,903 --> 00:49:14,404
It's not like you're an actor.

915
00:49:14,404 --> 00:49:15,472
Seriously.

916
00:49:34,558 --> 00:49:38,395
Customer Number 560,
your cheeseburger set is ready.

917
00:49:38,395 --> 00:49:39,596
I'll bring it.

918
00:49:44,401 --> 00:49:45,268
Excuse me.

919
00:49:46,336 --> 00:49:48,405
How long have you
and Min Jae been together?

920
00:49:49,105 --> 00:49:50,707
Not so long.

921
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:54,945
Min Jae is not the type
to open up so easily.

922
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,481
But he did to me,
so he must have found me so charming.

923
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:03,720
Min Jae likes cute girls,

924
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,822
so you must be quite cute.

925
00:50:05,822 --> 00:50:09,092
Isn't it obvious?
I look super cute already.

926
00:50:10,961 --> 00:50:13,630
But Min Jae probably didn't like you
that much.

927
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:15,031
Because you weren't that cute.

928
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:18,702
- Too much is as bad as too little.
- But you don't even have enough.

929
00:50:23,006 --> 00:50:24,908
This is plenty.

930
00:50:26,576 --> 00:50:27,544
Honey.

931
00:50:28,545 --> 00:50:31,748
Joo Ha got a double cheeseburger, right?

932
00:50:32,182 --> 00:50:33,016
What?

933
00:50:35,886 --> 00:50:37,287
Yes, it is.

934
00:50:37,921 --> 00:50:39,256
Great!

935
00:50:39,256 --> 00:50:42,259
Honey, Joo Ha will eat
a double cheeseburger with...

936
00:50:42,792 --> 00:50:43,760
ta-da!

937
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,396
A whole bunch of cilantro.

938
00:50:46,396 --> 00:50:49,232
But if you don't like cilantro,
so you can pass on it.

939
00:50:49,232 --> 00:50:50,367
And you?

940
00:50:50,367 --> 00:50:52,802
Would you like some cilantro?
It's super tasty.

941
00:50:55,472 --> 00:50:58,275
I'm going to add a bunch of cilantro.

942
00:51:01,011 --> 00:51:02,612
I guess you don't like cilantro.

943
00:51:02,612 --> 00:51:05,782
My mom said I shouldn't hang out
with people who hate cilantro.

944
00:51:08,051 --> 00:51:12,088
Honey, double cheeseburgers
with cilantro is...

945
00:51:12,088 --> 00:51:14,291
what I like the second most
in the whole world.

946
00:51:14,291 --> 00:51:15,492
Guess what I like the most.

947
00:51:16,993 --> 00:51:18,261
You.

948
00:51:18,261 --> 00:51:20,497
I love you, honey.

949
00:51:21,198 --> 00:51:22,933
What's wrong with her?

950
00:51:22,933 --> 00:51:24,668
I lost all my appetite.

951
00:51:24,668 --> 00:51:27,037
Does she think
she's in a sitcom or something?

952
00:51:29,272 --> 00:51:31,308
Lee Min Jae, are you really dating...

953
00:51:32,008 --> 00:51:33,310
this lady who talks like a baby?

954
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:42,252
Yes.

955
00:51:43,853 --> 00:51:46,389
Joo Ha, she just realized.

956
00:51:46,957 --> 00:51:49,626
Min Jae also likes Joo Ha...

957
00:51:49,626 --> 00:51:53,263
the most in the whole world.

958
00:51:53,263 --> 00:51:54,064
This much.

959
00:51:54,064 --> 00:51:57,167
No, this much.

960
00:51:57,167 --> 00:51:58,134
Really?

961
00:51:58,668 --> 00:51:59,870
I love you, too.

962
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:01,638
I love you. Come here.

963
00:52:01,638 --> 00:52:04,674
Honey, I love you so much.

964
00:52:04,674 --> 00:52:05,709
I love you, too.

965
00:52:05,709 --> 00:52:07,611
- You look great in twin tails.
- They're crazy.

966
00:52:08,612 --> 00:52:10,680
- I love you, honey.
- I love you.

967
00:52:18,655 --> 00:52:19,789
I think I'm going to throw up.

968
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:27,564
The KICKKICKKICKKICK Blind Date
will start now.

969
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:30,500
Before we start, let me explain.

970
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,502
The mic you're wearing...

971
00:52:32,502 --> 00:52:35,105
makes your voice sound different.

972
00:52:35,105 --> 00:52:37,374
So you cannot find out...

973
00:52:37,374 --> 00:52:40,610
who the person sitting in front of you is.

974
00:52:41,044 --> 00:52:42,779
To match this "blind" date,

975
00:52:42,779 --> 00:52:45,015
until you take off your blindfolds,

976
00:52:45,015 --> 00:52:46,950
your personal details must be kept
completely secret.

977
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:49,853
You must refer to yourself...

978
00:52:49,853 --> 00:52:53,557
as the café menu you chose earlier.

979
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:56,760
Also, only the couple
that remains at the end...

980
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,330
will get to see each other.

981
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:02,566
Okay, then.

982
00:53:02,566 --> 00:53:03,466
Let's start now.

983
00:53:05,769 --> 00:53:06,703
Okay.

984
00:53:07,304 --> 00:53:09,773
Hello, I'm Cappuccino.

985
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:13,143
Hello, I am Americano.

986
00:53:13,143 --> 00:53:14,077
Hello.

987
00:53:14,077 --> 00:53:15,712
I am Caffè Mocha.

988
00:53:15,712 --> 00:53:16,846
Nice to meet you.

989
00:53:16,846 --> 00:53:17,881
I am Caffè Latte.

990
00:53:17,881 --> 00:53:19,082
Nice to meet you.

991
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:24,621
I am curious
about why you chose those drinks.

992
00:53:26,256 --> 00:53:27,757
Because mine is sweet and tasty.

993
00:53:28,858 --> 00:53:30,694
I chose mine
because it's what I always order.

994
00:53:30,694 --> 00:53:31,761
I see.

995
00:53:32,362 --> 00:53:35,232
The reason I chose an americano is...

996
00:53:36,066 --> 00:53:38,034
because among all the types of coffee,

997
00:53:38,034 --> 00:53:41,004
it's the most common, but indeed...

998
00:53:41,004 --> 00:53:43,206
Sorry. I'll take this call
and be right back.

999
00:53:43,206 --> 00:53:44,875
- Okay.
- Okay.

1000
00:53:44,875 --> 00:53:46,476
I'll escort you outside.

1001
00:53:46,476 --> 00:53:48,879
The three of you can focus
on your conversation.

1002
00:53:49,813 --> 00:53:50,981
Should we just go on?

1003
00:53:50,981 --> 00:53:54,117
- Yes, please go on.
- Okay.

1004
00:53:54,117 --> 00:53:57,287
Why are Americanos the most popular?

1005
00:53:57,687 --> 00:54:01,224
- Open the door.
- Okay. Hold on.

1006
00:54:01,224 --> 00:54:04,060
Wait a minute.

1007
00:54:06,229 --> 00:54:07,130
Yes, Mom?

1008
00:54:08,965 --> 00:54:11,434
What? You fell down the stairs?

1009
00:54:12,302 --> 00:54:13,403
An emergency surgery?

1010
00:54:13,403 --> 00:54:14,971
Okay. I'll be there now.

1011
00:54:14,971 --> 00:54:17,707
I'm sorry, but I have to go now. Sorry.

1012
00:54:17,707 --> 00:54:21,211
Where are you going, Caffè Mocha?

1013
00:54:21,211 --> 00:54:22,445
Guess who it is.

1014
00:54:23,213 --> 00:54:24,748
Yes.

1015
00:54:25,248 --> 00:54:27,183
Also, an americano is...

1016
00:54:27,183 --> 00:54:30,353
quite easy to make.

1017
00:54:30,353 --> 00:54:31,187
Yes, it is.

1018
00:54:31,187 --> 00:54:32,956
In an espresso,

1019
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:37,594
you just need to add water
to adjust the concentration.

1020
00:54:37,594 --> 00:54:39,062
That's an advantage.

1021
00:54:39,062 --> 00:54:41,731
I'm sorry,
but I suddenly have a stomachache.

1022
00:54:42,098 --> 00:54:43,400
I'll be right back.

1023
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,902
- You can go.
- You have a stomachache.

1024
00:54:45,902 --> 00:54:47,504
That's too bad.

1025
00:54:47,504 --> 00:54:48,905
You must go when you can hold back.

1026
00:54:48,905 --> 00:54:51,174
- Also, americanos...
- Yes.

1027
00:54:51,174 --> 00:54:54,144
promote digestion.
That's another advantage.

1028
00:54:54,144 --> 00:54:55,245
I didn't know that.

1029
00:54:55,245 --> 00:54:57,480
What is it?

1030
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,349
I have to go to the hospital.

1031
00:54:59,349 --> 00:55:00,517
The hospital?

1032
00:55:01,251 --> 00:55:03,620
Where are you going, Caffè Latte?

1033
00:55:04,788 --> 00:55:05,822
Darn it.

1034
00:55:06,189 --> 00:55:08,124
How amazing.

1035
00:55:08,124 --> 00:55:10,427
Your insight...

1036
00:55:10,427 --> 00:55:13,196
into americano was impressive, Americano.

1037
00:55:13,196 --> 00:55:15,232
That was nothing.

1038
00:55:15,232 --> 00:55:17,901
My phone call went on too long.
I'm sorry.

1039
00:55:17,901 --> 00:55:18,802
It's okay.

1040
00:55:18,802 --> 00:55:21,004
- Come and take a seat.
- Take a seat.

1041
00:55:21,004 --> 00:55:24,374
Sorry for staying
in the restroom for too long.

1042
00:55:24,374 --> 00:55:25,342
Don't be. You can take a seat.

1043
00:55:25,342 --> 00:55:27,444
- Then are the four of us here again?
- Yes.

1044
00:55:27,444 --> 00:55:30,914
Then, Cappuccino, why...

1045
00:55:30,914 --> 00:55:33,350
Excuse me.
Your drinks and cookies are here.

1046
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:35,719
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

1047
00:55:37,087 --> 00:55:38,021
Our coffee is here.

1048
00:55:38,021 --> 00:55:39,389
Yes.

1049
00:55:39,389 --> 00:55:40,357
How...

1050
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,095
My goodness.

1051
00:55:46,196 --> 00:55:48,064
That was...

1052
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:51,635
That...

1053
00:55:52,369 --> 00:55:54,938
What should we do now?

1054
00:55:57,107 --> 00:55:58,108
Actually...

1055
00:55:58,108 --> 00:56:02,145
This kind of makes my heart flutter,

1056
00:56:02,145 --> 00:56:04,581
and it also feels nice and fresh.

1057
00:56:04,581 --> 00:56:08,418
I get why young people these days say
it's the era of dating shows.

1058
00:56:08,952 --> 00:56:12,188
Your drinks are in front of you now.

1059
00:56:12,188 --> 00:56:16,226
Twine your arms with the person you like
and enjoy your drink.

1060
00:56:16,226 --> 00:56:19,796
Let's start with Cappuccino.

1061
00:56:21,331 --> 00:56:22,365
I'd like...

1062
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,305
Drumrolls.

1063
00:56:29,472 --> 00:56:31,608
I'd like to drink with Americano.

1064
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,015
I'd like...

1065
00:56:39,883 --> 00:56:40,951
to drink...

1066
00:56:41,885 --> 00:56:44,387
with Cappuccino.

1067
00:56:51,595 --> 00:56:54,731
- And the others?
- The others...

1068
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:00,670
I'd like to drink with Caffè Latte.

1069
00:57:02,072 --> 00:57:03,173
Then I'll drink...

1070
00:57:04,507 --> 00:57:06,343
with Caffè Mocha.

1071
00:57:08,078 --> 00:57:09,813
Good.

1072
00:57:09,813 --> 00:57:13,783
Now twine your arms and drink together.

1073
00:57:15,318 --> 00:57:17,854
Americano, where are you?

1074
00:57:19,522 --> 00:57:21,625
Are you Cappuccino?

1075
00:57:21,625 --> 00:57:23,593
Yes, I am. You're Americano, right?

1076
00:57:23,593 --> 00:57:24,661
Yes.

1077
00:57:24,661 --> 00:57:25,629
Cappuccino.

1078
00:57:26,897 --> 00:57:28,932
Sorry, I'm scared I might spill it.

1079
00:57:28,932 --> 00:57:30,800
Your hand.

1080
00:57:32,269 --> 00:57:33,436
You have big bones.

1081
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:36,573
My drink is too hot,
so I'm going to blow it.

1082
00:58:31,127 --> 00:58:33,029
I can't help it anymore.

1083
00:58:33,597 --> 00:58:36,700
I want to stare into your eyes
and talk with you, Americano.

1084
00:58:37,467 --> 00:58:38,501
Don't do that.

1085
00:58:39,169 --> 00:58:42,172
But actually, I do, too.

1086
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,276
To the point
where I couldn't hear the others,

1087
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:49,613
I feel like...

1088
00:58:50,213 --> 00:58:51,448
I've clicked with you, Cappuccino.

1089
00:58:52,015 --> 00:58:53,550
Then...

1090
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:57,153
No In Seong,
can we take off our blindfolds now?

1091
00:58:57,153 --> 00:58:58,822
- Should we take them off?
- Let's do that.

1092
00:58:58,822 --> 00:59:01,858
Why aren't you answering us, MC No?

1093
00:59:01,858 --> 00:59:02,893
No In Seong.

1094
00:59:03,793 --> 00:59:05,529
- No In Seong.
- Yes.

1095
00:59:05,529 --> 00:59:07,864
When I count to three,

1096
00:59:07,864 --> 00:59:10,834
take off your blindfolds
and look at each other.

1097
00:59:10,834 --> 00:59:12,202
- Okay.
- Okay.

1098
00:59:14,337 --> 00:59:16,339
- One.
- One.

1099
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,808
- Two.
- Two.

1100
00:59:19,509 --> 00:59:20,544
Th...

1101
00:59:21,111 --> 00:59:23,179
Why didn't he say "Three?"

1102
00:59:23,179 --> 00:59:24,214
I wonder why.

1103
00:59:24,214 --> 00:59:25,582
Should we just take our blindfolds off?

1104
00:59:25,582 --> 00:59:26,850
Let's do that after three.

1105
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:28,251
Let's take it off.

1106
00:59:28,251 --> 00:59:31,388
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1107
00:59:34,991 --> 00:59:36,793
- Let go of me.
- You jerk.

1108
00:59:37,627 --> 00:59:38,962
- What's this?
- Why are you here?

1109
00:59:38,962 --> 00:59:42,265
- Americano?
- I'm Americano.

1110
00:59:42,732 --> 00:59:44,267
Cappuccino.

1111
00:59:44,267 --> 00:59:45,368
No.

1112
00:59:46,102 --> 00:59:47,037
Cappuccino.

1113
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:50,473
Excuse me.

1114
00:59:50,473 --> 00:59:52,509
Where are the two ladies
who were with us before?

1115
00:59:52,509 --> 00:59:54,110
What happened? What's going on?

1116
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:57,113
The two ladies disappeared
as soon as the blind date started.

1117
00:59:57,113 --> 00:59:58,215
You didn't know?

1118
00:59:58,215 --> 00:59:59,616
They left shortly after.

1119
00:59:59,616 --> 01:00:01,851
You two talked to each other all along,

1120
01:00:01,851 --> 01:00:04,254
smelled each other, fed each other,

1121
01:00:04,254 --> 01:00:06,723
and tapped the back of each other's hands.

1122
01:00:06,723 --> 01:00:08,358
It was hilarious.

1123
01:00:09,626 --> 01:00:11,661
No In Seong.

1124
01:00:11,661 --> 01:00:14,598
- Where is No In Seong, that punk?
- No In Seong.

1125
01:00:14,598 --> 01:00:16,933
Where is he?

1126
01:00:18,869 --> 01:00:20,470
This is a mess.

1127
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:21,605
That was hilarious.

1128
01:00:22,372 --> 01:00:24,507
(Go on a blind date, Go find your date.)

1129
01:00:24,507 --> 01:00:26,810

1130
01:00:52,502 --> 01:00:54,771
(KICKKICKKICKKICK)

1131
01:00:54,771 --> 01:00:56,039
Are you still angry at me?

1132
01:00:56,039 --> 01:00:58,475
I was jealous. That's what you do
to people you have feelings for.

1133
01:00:58,475 --> 01:00:59,809
Something's concerning you, right?

1134
01:00:59,809 --> 01:01:00,844
We don't have enough money.

1135
01:01:00,844 --> 01:01:02,646
- How much do I get as a cameo?
- Laugh and die.

1136
01:01:02,646 --> 01:01:03,313
He died again.

1137
01:01:03,313 --> 01:01:04,281
He died again?

1138
01:01:04,281 --> 01:01:06,016
If you want to go fast, go alone.

1139
01:01:06,016 --> 01:01:08,485
If you want to go far, go together.

1140
01:01:08,485 --> 01:01:09,319
What's this?

1141
01:01:09,319 --> 01:01:10,186
There's no water.

1142
01:01:10,186 --> 01:01:12,055
I'm not so patient.

1143
01:01:12,055 --> 01:01:14,024
Restructuring. Go.

1144
01:01:14,024 --> 01:01:16,660
If you don't need me,
I don't need you, either.

1145
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,928
I want to make this company mine.

1146
01:01:17,928 --> 01:01:18,762
Let's move to another company.

1147
01:01:18,762 --> 01:01:20,830
I don't want to leave like this.

1148
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:22,399
They're our people,
so we must protect them.

1149
01:01:22,399 --> 01:01:24,034
We can't let anyone go.

1150
