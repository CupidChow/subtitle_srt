00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,161
(All characters, organizations,)

2
00:00:01,161 --> 00:00:02,596
(and events in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:02,596 --> 00:00:03,997
(Broadcasting guidelines were followed
during the shooting of animals.)

4
00:00:31,225 --> 00:00:34,361
How can there be so many good-looking men
in a single...

5
00:00:43,971 --> 00:00:45,405
No, Ji Won.

6
00:00:45,839 --> 00:00:48,575
You promised to only like guys
in 2D from now on.

7
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:52,145
Those in 3D will eventually hurt
your feelings.

8
00:00:58,051 --> 00:00:58,886
Ms. Baek.

9
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:02,156
Abbot.

10
00:01:03,824 --> 00:01:06,226
Why do you always eat here?

11
00:01:07,327 --> 00:01:10,731
It's a good day,
and it's quiet and peaceful here.

12
00:01:11,465 --> 00:01:13,433
Have you eaten, Abbot?

13
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:14,501
Yes.

14
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:17,371
It has already been half a year,

15
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:19,273
since you came to this temple.

16
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,509
Have you found peace of mind?

17
00:01:25,245 --> 00:01:27,948
At times, I still dream of the day,

18
00:01:27,948 --> 00:01:32,352
when I found the thong
of another woman in my fiancé's car.

19
00:01:32,352 --> 00:01:34,855
When I played the dashcam video
of their intercourse,

20
00:01:34,855 --> 00:01:36,723
at our wedding,

21
00:01:36,723 --> 00:01:38,725
how his parents and my parents passed out,

22
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,462
and the chaos at the wedding.
I cannot forget them.

23
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,366
But thanks to Buddha's infinite kindness,

24
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:48,135
I am getting...

25
00:01:48,135 --> 00:01:49,203
Sorry.

26
00:01:53,507 --> 00:01:56,310
"Why Did the Officer Eat Red Apples?"

27
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,512
The limited edition of a special sequel
has been released.

28
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,084
Abbot, I will make a quick trip
to the secular world tomorrow.

29
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,955

(Bommal Pharmacy)

31
00:02:13,827 --> 00:02:15,062
How strange.

32
00:02:18,232 --> 00:02:19,833
Did I overstrain myself
at the team dinner?

33
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,538
I'm aching everywhere.

34
00:02:26,306 --> 00:02:27,441
Is it because I'm old?

35
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:28,575
Thank you.

36
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:43,790
I can sense the adult content.

37
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:48,795
("Why Did the Officer Eat Red Apples?")

38
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:50,831
(Restricted to minors under 19)

39
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:56,103
I feel stiff.

40
00:02:57,304 --> 00:02:58,138
Be careful.

41
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:00,240
Darn it.

42
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,442
What's wrong with me?

43
00:03:03,944 --> 00:03:06,480
Actor Ji? My goodness.

44
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:12,786
- I have a cramp.
- I know. Calm down. Relax.

45
00:03:12,786 --> 00:03:14,822
- It hurts so much.
- I know.

46
00:03:14,822 --> 00:03:17,891
- I'm one of the many KICKERs.
- Okay.

47
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:20,961
Relax.

48
00:03:23,163 --> 00:03:24,531
Om mani padme hum.

49
00:03:28,068 --> 00:03:29,970
You woman. What are you doing?

50
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:33,240
You have to endure it.

51
00:03:34,741 --> 00:03:36,043
Relax.

52
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:39,746
This is nice.

53
00:03:40,214 --> 00:03:42,149
It doesn't hurt anymore.
This is great. Nice.

54
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:43,917
- Are you okay?
- Please keep going.

55
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:45,319
This is nice.

56
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,254
- I know, right?
- This feels good.

57
00:03:47,521 --> 00:03:49,756
You're good.

58
00:03:50,657 --> 00:03:52,226
You're good at this.

59
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,962
Stop it.

60
00:03:54,962 --> 00:03:56,897
Stop it, Ji Won.

61
00:03:57,564 --> 00:03:59,733
No, just a little bit more.

62
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:00,567
Stop.

63
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:02,836
- Keep going.
- Ji Won, stop.

64
00:04:02,836 --> 00:04:04,371
- You can keep going.
- No.

65
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:08,175
I hope the grace of Buddha is
with you, Actor Ji.

66
00:04:08,175 --> 00:04:10,844
- Stop it.
- How did you...

67
00:04:13,313 --> 00:04:15,616
Savior, you should take your book.
("Why Did the Officer Eat Red Apples?")

68
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,054
(Episode 5-1
Please Find Her)

69
00:04:26,293 --> 00:04:27,494
Just wait, Ga Joo Ha.

70
00:04:28,128 --> 00:04:30,063
You will meet
the bitter counterattack of the nipple.

71
00:04:34,868 --> 00:04:36,803
Joo Ha, did you buy new shoes?

72
00:04:36,803 --> 00:04:38,238
They're pretty.

73
00:04:38,238 --> 00:04:40,274
How did you know?

74
00:04:40,274 --> 00:04:43,777
Look at these.

75
00:04:43,777 --> 00:04:47,114
I won the lucky draw so I bought these.

76
00:04:47,114 --> 00:04:48,882
But I heard that was really hard.

77
00:04:48,882 --> 00:04:50,217
I'm jealous.

78
00:04:50,217 --> 00:04:51,952
Kick, what do you think?

79
00:04:54,621 --> 00:04:56,056
You can do it, Kick.

80
00:04:56,723 --> 00:04:58,926
Of course. You know who I am.

81
00:04:58,926 --> 00:05:00,260
Don't worry.

82
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:03,630
It's out. Good job, Kick.

83
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,433
You took a very thick and healthy dump.

84
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:07,568
How healthy...

85
00:05:11,371 --> 00:05:12,272
Dung.

86
00:05:12,272 --> 00:05:13,774
- Dung?
- Dung.

87
00:05:16,376 --> 00:05:19,046
My leg felt really heavy,
but it feels as light as a feather now.

88
00:05:19,046 --> 00:05:20,347
How can this happen?

89
00:05:24,084 --> 00:05:25,519
What was that scent?

90
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:29,490
I want to smell it every day.

91
00:05:30,557 --> 00:05:31,825
I want to smell it.

92
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,062
- CEO Cho.
- Yes?

93
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:36,697
Let's hire a therapist.

94
00:05:36,697 --> 00:05:37,664
What?

95
00:05:37,664 --> 00:05:40,067
For the welfare
of the employees of KICKKICKKICKKICK,

96
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:42,069
we decided to hire a therapist.

97
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:44,471
We have many subscribers, too.
We'll reach three million soon.

98
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:45,873
I think now is the right time.

99
00:05:45,873 --> 00:05:47,875
There's also this therapist
whom I really want to hire.

100
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:51,011
You should relax your mind and body
at home, not in the company.

101
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:53,714
It'll make the employees work harder.

102
00:05:53,714 --> 00:05:54,848
Who is it?

103
00:05:54,848 --> 00:05:57,050
Well, I don't know yet.

104
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,153
How do you plan to hire that therapist
when you don't even know the person?

105
00:05:59,153 --> 00:06:00,687
Don't be ridiculous.

106
00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:02,256
I'll think it through from now on.

107
00:06:02,256 --> 00:06:04,658
Think what through?
I have to prepare a presentation,

108
00:06:04,658 --> 00:06:06,293
for the collaboration
with Samsong Electronics.

109
00:06:06,293 --> 00:06:08,095
Samsong Electronics has
high expectations of us.

110
00:06:08,095 --> 00:06:09,997
They keep calling me.

111
00:06:09,997 --> 00:06:11,298
We have to start making a profit now.

112
00:06:11,298 --> 00:06:14,101
All I have in mind is how to make money,
and all you have in mind is how to use it.

113
00:06:14,101 --> 00:06:16,270
But we really need this therapist.
My leg feels like a feather.

114
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,739
Feather? I can't even.
Then you just take care of it.

115
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:21,508
Do what you want to do.
I'm busy, so don't bother me.

116
00:06:21,508 --> 00:06:22,643
I'll hire her.

117
00:06:30,784 --> 00:06:33,887
Savior, see you soon.

118
00:06:41,762 --> 00:06:43,664
Yes, I've heard that.

119
00:06:44,998 --> 00:06:47,768
I'm a big fan of Actor Ji.

120
00:06:47,768 --> 00:06:50,204
Ga Joo Ha, this is
the bitter counterattack of the nipple.

121
00:06:51,638 --> 00:06:54,274
Mark, how about jumping on the trampoline?

122
00:06:54,274 --> 00:06:55,642
Good idea.

123
00:06:55,642 --> 00:06:56,910
Please excuse us.

124
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,946
- Okay.
- Bye.

125
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:13,126
Wrong target. Darn it.

126
00:07:14,461 --> 00:07:16,763
CEO Cho!

127
00:07:16,763 --> 00:07:17,698
What's...

128
00:07:29,843 --> 00:07:32,346
I came here to see Actor Ji,

129
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:34,147
but got this like a bolt out of the blue.

130
00:07:34,147 --> 00:07:36,517
Sorry, sir.

131
00:07:36,517 --> 00:07:40,320
My daughter-in-law bought those
limited edition shoes on her honeymoon.

132
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,289
How can there be dog dung,

133
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:44,625
in front of an office?

134
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:45,959
I even reduced the monthly rent for you.

135
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:46,927
I know. I'm very sorry.

136
00:07:46,927 --> 00:07:48,862
Rub those grooves thoroughly.

137
00:07:48,862 --> 00:07:51,298
Yes, sir. Thoroughly.

138
00:07:51,298 --> 00:07:55,502
Why did you leave dung
on the floor of our office?

139
00:07:55,502 --> 00:07:58,338
- What are you saying?
- "What are you saying?"

140
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:00,407
You stole Kick's dung earlier today,
No In Seong.

141
00:08:00,407 --> 00:08:02,309
Me? I stole Kick's dung? No.

142
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:03,410
"No?"

143
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,779
You did steal Kick's dung. I saw you.

144
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:07,748
Are you sure it was me?

145
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:08,715
Yes, I,

146
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,611
I am sure.

147
00:08:38,612 --> 00:08:42,716
What are you?

148
00:08:44,618 --> 00:08:48,489
That is none of your business, CEO Cho.

149
00:08:50,324 --> 00:08:53,126
Anyway, that is not my dung.
This is workplace harassment.

150
00:08:53,126 --> 00:08:55,362
I did not say it was your dung.
It was Kick's dung.

151
00:08:55,362 --> 00:08:57,598
You brat. No.

152
00:08:57,598 --> 00:08:59,700
I have to work.

153
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,768
Anyway, if something like this,

154
00:09:01,768 --> 00:09:04,638
as dirty as dung happens one more time
in our workplace,

155
00:09:04,638 --> 00:09:06,874
I will really kill you.

156
00:09:07,774 --> 00:09:08,842
Boo you.

157
00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:10,844
"Boo?"

158
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:13,247
Darn it.

160
00:09:21,655 --> 00:09:22,689
Savior.

161
00:09:22,689 --> 00:09:26,293
To find you, I have no choice,

162
00:09:26,293 --> 00:09:28,695
but to open this book.

163
00:09:34,434 --> 00:09:36,170
(Restricted to minors under 19)

164
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,237
X-rated.

Hardcover special sequel.

167
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,354
And,

168
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,358
the sweet touch of the secular world.

169
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:09,002
No.

170
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:15,475
I am not ready yet
to go out into the secular world.

171
00:10:17,044 --> 00:10:18,278
I'm not ready.

172
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:21,615
It's hot.

173
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,484
That was hot.

174
00:10:26,353 --> 00:10:27,521
Really.

175
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:32,292
"He seemed dreamlike."

176
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:34,661
"Why is there only one apple left?"

177
00:10:34,661 --> 00:10:35,429
Why is that?

178
00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:36,763
Officer, red apple.

179
00:10:36,763 --> 00:10:38,465
What on earth happened?

180
00:10:38,465 --> 00:10:40,334
"Why did you eat the apple?"

181
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:42,069
What?

182
00:10:42,836 --> 00:10:45,839
Why is this so appealing?

183
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,408
Is it because I feel
a sense of closeness,

184
00:10:48,408 --> 00:10:50,310
toward the officer?

185
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,947
Or is it because
the author's writing skill is remarkable?

186
00:10:53,947 --> 00:10:55,949
Who's the author?

187
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,986
"MelanCholyCallme?"

188
00:11:00,487 --> 00:11:02,489
Even this name is attractive.

189
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:15,202
What's with those eye bags?

190
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:17,971
I was up reading until late.

191
00:11:19,106 --> 00:11:21,308
Did you find that therapist?

192
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:22,709
Not yet.

193
00:11:23,377 --> 00:11:26,380
Then post a notice
on the KICKKICKKICKKICK forum.

194
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,415
That therapist may be a KICKER.

195
00:11:31,985 --> 00:11:34,788
- I'm one of the many KICKERs.
- Okay.

196
00:11:34,955 --> 00:11:37,157
I think I may be able to find her.

197
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:38,992
Then post it.

198
00:11:40,894 --> 00:11:43,330
Good morning, CEO Ji.
Good morning, CEO Cho.

199
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,665
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

200
00:11:44,665 --> 00:11:46,667
- Good morning.
- You're a very cheery woman.

201
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:47,768
She is.

a presentation to collaborate
with Samsong Electronics.

204
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,541
- This is important.
- Okay.

205
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:56,610
Please double-check the whole thing.

206
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,446
Consider it done.
I'll also choose a prettier design.

207
00:12:03,116 --> 00:12:03,984
What?

208
00:12:04,318 --> 00:12:07,154
This keeps happening.

209
00:12:07,154 --> 00:12:09,423
Does this elevator think
it's a ride or something?

210
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,692
What if we get caught in the elevator?

212
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,275
I'm done.

213
00:12:28,275 --> 00:12:30,043
- I need some caffeine.
- Me, too.

214
00:12:30,577 --> 00:12:31,478
How about coffee?

215
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:33,647
Yes. Let's go.

216
00:12:33,647 --> 00:12:34,815
Let's go.

in the KICKKICKKICKKICK studio.)

224
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,066
What? Are they looking for me?

225
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,136
But no.

226
00:13:29,136 --> 00:13:32,639
I am not ready to go into society,

227
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,575
and be with 3D people. No.

228
00:13:34,775 --> 00:13:35,742
I can't.

229
00:13:35,742 --> 00:13:36,944
No.

230
00:13:36,944 --> 00:13:39,313
No. Get ahold of yourself.

Is just looking also bad?

235
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:53,760
No. Don't be like this.

236
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:55,863

I have to go now.

237
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:57,531
Yes. Here you go.

Was that CEO Cho's?

246
00:14:18,852 --> 00:14:19,786
Why?

247
00:14:24,892 --> 00:14:28,862
Are you really the person who saved me?

248
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:30,364
Of course.

249
00:14:30,364 --> 00:14:33,333
I'm definitely your savior, Actor Ji.

- That's a dirty video.
- What's this?

270

- Is this a new kind of eye-terror video?

Something must be wrong.
I'll reconnect this.

or something?

First of all, I'm sorry, General Manager.

into Scriptwriter Ga's laptop,

didn't you?

290
00:16:31,752 --> 00:16:33,954
Yes, a dirty video of you twerking.

I wanted her out of here.

stained with the secular world.

364
00:22:29,877 --> 00:22:30,811
What the...

365
00:22:37,951 --> 00:22:39,052
This is driving me crazy.

366
00:22:46,226 --> 00:22:47,661
Please stop me.

367
00:22:51,465 --> 00:22:53,667
Eating ginseng chicken soup for dinner,

368
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:55,936
made me super energized.

369
00:22:55,936 --> 00:22:57,104
My gosh.

370
00:22:59,706 --> 00:23:02,142
No. My gosh.

371
00:23:04,578 --> 00:23:05,846
Is someone in there?

372
00:23:08,649 --> 00:23:09,383
No.

373
00:23:10,417 --> 00:23:12,953
Yes. I'm in here.

374
00:23:12,953 --> 00:23:14,388
Are you Shiba?

375
00:23:16,056 --> 00:23:16,890
Go.

376
00:23:17,357 --> 00:23:18,725
Go away.

377
00:23:21,395 --> 00:23:22,262
No, help me.

378
00:23:22,763 --> 00:23:24,164
- You're Shiba, aren't you?
- I don't know.

379
00:23:24,164 --> 00:23:25,399
Hold on.

380
00:23:25,766 --> 00:23:26,800
How do I open this?

381
00:23:31,438 --> 00:23:33,140
Hold on.

382
00:24:10,777 --> 00:24:12,579
Shiba, are you okay?

383
00:24:15,816 --> 00:24:17,351
Sorry. You didn't pass.

384
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,026
Is it impossible to find her like this?

385
00:24:26,393 --> 00:24:28,762
My legs hurt.

386
00:25:15,676 --> 00:25:17,811
"Why Did the Officer..."

387
00:25:21,315 --> 00:25:23,684
"Eat Red Apples?"

388
00:25:26,086 --> 00:25:30,057
What's the name of the horse
the officer used to ride?

389
00:25:30,824 --> 00:25:32,359
Cheonliaema.

390
00:25:34,094 --> 00:25:36,096
What is the bread of the Joseon Dynasty,

391
00:25:36,463 --> 00:25:39,132
that the officer treasured in his arms?

392
00:25:39,132 --> 00:25:40,567
Baguette.

393
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:43,403
What is the painting
painted in the officer's underwear?

394
00:25:43,403 --> 00:25:46,106
Kim Jeong Ho's "Daedongyeojido Map."

395
00:25:46,106 --> 00:25:46,940
My goodness.

396
00:25:50,711 --> 00:25:53,947
So you've also read the whole series,
Actor Ji.

397
00:25:54,915 --> 00:25:58,318
I couldn't stop reading once I started.

398
00:25:58,318 --> 00:26:00,621
I know. That's how good that author is.

399
00:26:02,956 --> 00:26:07,361
You're my savior, aren't you?

400
00:26:24,945 --> 00:26:26,180
This is the scent.

401
00:26:34,454 --> 00:26:37,291
This is the feeling.
It feels as light as a feather.

402
00:26:41,094 --> 00:26:42,896
Thank you for what you did that day.

403
00:26:43,197 --> 00:26:44,464
It was nothing.

404
00:26:44,464 --> 00:26:45,399
But,

405
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,869
how can I return your kindness?

406
00:26:49,603 --> 00:26:53,440
Scouting me as the massage therapist,

407
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,576
of KICKKICKKICKKICK is enough.

408
00:26:56,844 --> 00:26:58,712
We'd be honored.

409
00:26:58,712 --> 00:27:01,081
How are you so good at massaging?

410
00:27:02,816 --> 00:27:05,619
I have a certificate
in the Korean Massage Association,

411
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:07,688
International Aromatherapist,

412
00:27:07,688 --> 00:27:09,523
physical therapy,

413
00:27:09,523 --> 00:27:11,492
Art and Music Play,

414
00:27:11,492 --> 00:27:14,728
International Herbalist, and so on.

415
00:27:14,728 --> 00:27:17,664
That's amazing.

416
00:27:17,664 --> 00:27:19,733
You're a talent we need in the company.

417
00:27:19,933 --> 00:27:21,535
Unbelievable.

418
00:27:21,535 --> 00:27:23,237
Okay, then.

419
00:27:24,338 --> 00:27:27,374
Let's start the negotiation in full swing.

420
00:27:27,941 --> 00:27:29,243
But before that,

421
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:35,749
the fact that we're both fans
of MelanCholyCallme is,

422
00:27:35,749 --> 00:27:37,317
a secret between the two of us.

423
00:27:40,587 --> 00:27:41,488
A secret.

424
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:49,096
Actor Ji.

425
00:27:50,164 --> 00:27:52,065
My hand feels light.

426
00:27:52,065 --> 00:27:53,200
You can lower your hand.

427
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,692
Hi, Shiba.

428
00:28:17,126 --> 00:28:19,062
Hello.

429
00:28:34,177 --> 00:28:36,145
- Hello.
- Hello.

430
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:38,615
Hello.

431
00:28:38,615 --> 00:28:42,785
I'm the new in-house massage therapist
of KICKKICKKICKKICK.

432
00:28:42,785 --> 00:28:44,854
My name is Baek Ji Won.

433
00:28:44,854 --> 00:28:48,791
You can call me Jasmine.

434
00:28:48,791 --> 00:28:49,759
Yes.

435
00:28:50,793 --> 00:28:52,095
Nice to meet you.

436
00:28:52,095 --> 00:28:53,329
Jasmine.

437
00:28:54,197 --> 00:28:57,133
With great difficulty, I managed...

438
00:28:57,133 --> 00:28:59,869
to scout this Goddess of Massage.

439
00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:01,538
I'm not a goddess.

440
00:29:02,472 --> 00:29:03,940
But I'm quite skilled.

441
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,942
Cool.

442
00:29:06,776 --> 00:29:10,780
You can make a reservation online
to get my therapy.

443
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,616
I'll send a link in our group chat.

444
00:29:13,616 --> 00:29:16,419
So make a reservation
at the time you want.

445
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:19,088
I sent a link just now.

446
00:29:20,823 --> 00:29:21,925
Is this it?

447
00:29:21,925 --> 00:29:23,126
I think so.

448
00:29:26,062 --> 00:29:27,864
Massage.

449
00:29:28,765 --> 00:29:30,499
How do you make a reservation
through this?

450
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,534
Every man for himself.

451
00:29:33,002 --> 00:29:34,971
- PD Tae Ho, how do you...
- Let me make a reservation first.

452
00:29:44,681 --> 00:29:45,848
Hello?

453
00:29:45,848 --> 00:29:47,417
This is CEO Ji.

454
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,819
I know you are. Why did you call me?

455
00:29:49,819 --> 00:29:52,222
May I make a reservation at 3 p.m. today?

456
00:29:53,189 --> 00:29:55,258
Let me check.

457
00:29:58,261 --> 00:30:00,263
(Full)

458
00:30:02,232 --> 00:30:05,068
I'm sorry, but I'm fully booked.

459
00:30:06,135 --> 00:30:08,071
- Already?
- Yes.

460
00:30:09,072 --> 00:30:10,373
Really? This fast?

461
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:11,975
Yes, already.

462
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,745
All right, then.

463
00:30:16,779 --> 00:30:18,781
How sad. Thanks.

464
00:30:18,781 --> 00:30:19,649
You're welcome.

465
00:30:20,617 --> 00:30:24,120
To prepare for the therapy,

466
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,889
I'll be leaving now.

467
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:27,924
See you later, everyone.

468
00:30:27,924 --> 00:30:29,225
See you.

469
00:30:29,225 --> 00:30:31,461
It seems you like ducks.

470
00:30:31,461 --> 00:30:33,062
- Ducks?
- Yes.

471
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,265
This is just...

472
00:30:35,265 --> 00:30:38,501
We have a therapist now,

473
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:40,570
so let's get our energy up and work hard.

474
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,839
- Okay. Let's go.
- Let's go.

475
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:43,873
Let's go.

476
00:30:43,873 --> 00:30:48,144
PD Min Jae, how many subscribers
does Kickickickick currently have?

477
00:30:48,144 --> 00:30:50,813
We currently have
1.85 million subscribers.

478
00:30:50,813 --> 00:30:52,982
The number kept increasing
after the Kim Yeon Swae incident,

479
00:30:52,982 --> 00:30:54,784
but it's faltering now.

480
00:30:54,784 --> 00:30:57,153
That's why I think
now is the perfect time...

481
00:30:57,153 --> 00:30:59,222
to create new content.

482
00:30:59,222 --> 00:31:01,224
- Good.
- Yes.

483
00:31:01,224 --> 00:31:03,626
How about content on my name?

484
00:31:03,626 --> 00:31:04,661
Great.

485
00:31:05,161 --> 00:31:06,329
About what?

486
00:31:06,329 --> 00:31:07,463
Let's see.

487
00:31:07,463 --> 00:31:09,032
- "I Am Actor Ji."
- No.

488
00:31:09,032 --> 00:31:12,569
We could show my entire 20 years
of acting career.

489
00:31:12,569 --> 00:31:13,736
- No.
- For example,

490
00:31:13,736 --> 00:31:16,439
"Actor Ji's Acting Know-How Lesson
That Cannot Be Bought With Money."

491
00:31:16,706 --> 00:31:17,674
Who'd pay for that anyway?

492
00:31:17,674 --> 00:31:19,709
I think that would get
a limited subscriber base.

493
00:31:19,709 --> 00:31:20,810
That's exactly right.

494
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:23,479
- Would it be a small subscriber base?
- Very small.

495
00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:24,881
"Read With Ji Jin Hee."

496
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:27,350
Since I read a lot and have a fine voice.
What do you think?

497
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,885
The content item would be too limited.

498
00:31:28,885 --> 00:31:30,086
Yes, quite limited.

499
00:31:30,086 --> 00:31:31,955
- Just sit down.
- Okay. I'll sit.

500
00:31:31,955 --> 00:31:35,725
Let's think about the content later.

501
00:31:35,725 --> 00:31:37,493
Isn't everyone hungry?

502
00:31:37,493 --> 00:31:39,629
Let's continue after lunch.

503
00:31:39,629 --> 00:31:41,097
- Enjoy your lunch, everyone.
- You, too.

504
00:31:41,097 --> 00:31:42,165
How about stir-fried spicy pork for lunch?

505
00:31:42,165 --> 00:31:44,767
This new restaurant opened
by the intersection. It's on me.

506
00:31:44,767 --> 00:31:47,437
I don't like stir-fried spicy pork
that much. Sorry.

507
00:31:47,437 --> 00:31:48,738
- Okay.
- Same.

508
00:31:50,273 --> 00:31:52,475
I have to study English.

509
00:31:53,676 --> 00:31:57,113
I'm sorry, but I have to take Kick
to kindergarten.

510
00:31:57,113 --> 00:31:58,481
I have plans.

511
00:31:58,948 --> 00:31:59,782
Every man for himself.

512
00:32:00,383 --> 00:32:01,584
But I said it's on me.

513
00:32:31,447 --> 00:32:35,418
I barely managed to find my savior...

514
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:39,255
and got a therapist at KICKKICKKICKKICK.

515
00:32:41,624 --> 00:32:44,894
and enthusiastically gave ideas
for new content.

516
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:49,999
But everyone's so mean to me.

517
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,738
Where is...

518
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,874
Not bad.

519
00:33:01,044 --> 00:33:02,512
Hello.

520
00:33:02,512 --> 00:33:05,448
- An americano?
- Yes, one hot americano.

521
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:12,188
Can you recommend some new stocks?

522
00:33:13,122 --> 00:33:16,559
Thanks. I'll keep that in mind and...

523
00:33:17,827 --> 00:33:19,062
- I'm CEO Ji.
- CEO Ji.

524
00:33:19,662 --> 00:33:20,496
Hello.

525
00:33:20,496 --> 00:33:22,999
You're learning English over the phone.

526
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:25,401
It wasn't a phone call.
I was using ChitGPT.

527
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:28,171
Ms. Chit Geepeetee?

528
00:33:28,171 --> 00:33:29,939
Is that your English teacher's name?

529
00:33:29,939 --> 00:33:31,808
ChitGPT.

530
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:34,777
Yes. Chit Geepeetee.

531
00:33:34,777 --> 00:33:38,014
It's an artificial intelligence chatbot
developed by ClosedAI.

532
00:33:39,749 --> 00:33:40,583
I see.

533
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:42,886
Do you want to try it, too?
I'll send you the link right away.

534
00:33:42,886 --> 00:33:45,788
This is a must in the 21st century.

535
00:33:46,689 --> 00:33:49,292
The 21st century. Okay, then.

536
00:33:51,694 --> 00:33:54,631
How can I help you today?

537
00:33:55,598 --> 00:33:56,766
This is a piece of cake.

538
00:33:57,667 --> 00:34:00,236
Hello, ChitGPT sir.

539
00:34:00,904 --> 00:34:03,239
Hello. What can I do for you?

540
00:34:03,907 --> 00:34:07,210
Do you speak Korean?

541
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:10,146
I speak 37 different languages.

542
00:34:10,146 --> 00:34:12,549
Also, I know everything.

543
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,851
Then,

544
00:34:15,285 --> 00:34:20,723
do you know Actor Ji Jin Hee?

545
00:34:20,723 --> 00:34:22,225
I know him very well.

546
00:34:22,225 --> 00:34:26,496
Ji Jin Hee is a South Korean actor
who was born in 1978.

547
00:34:26,496 --> 00:34:30,366
He gained attention as the officer
in "Jewel in the Palace,"

548
00:34:30,366 --> 00:34:34,571
and played an active role in "Misty,"
"Designated Survivor: 60 Days," and so on.

549
00:34:35,605 --> 00:34:36,673
Actually,

550
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:42,912
I am Actor Ji Jin Hee.

551
00:34:42,912 --> 00:34:44,847
If that is true,

552
00:34:44,847 --> 00:34:48,218
I am greatly honored
to talk with you like this.

553
00:34:48,218 --> 00:34:51,020
If you have any questions,
I will try my best to answer them.

554
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,255
This is amazing.

555
00:34:53,623 --> 00:34:55,325
Really?

556
00:34:55,692 --> 00:34:59,762
Yes. I will be your reliable friend,

557
00:34:59,762 --> 00:35:02,665
adviser, and partner
who will always be beside you.

558
00:35:05,235 --> 00:35:06,102
I'm touched.

559
00:35:08,271 --> 00:35:09,205
To be honest,

560
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,109
I was working as an actor for years...

561
00:35:13,676 --> 00:35:15,011
and I've suddenly become a CEO,

562
00:35:15,645 --> 00:35:16,779
so things are tough.

563
00:35:17,447 --> 00:35:19,916
That's too bad.
You were working as an actor,

564
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:23,486
so taking a different role
and becoming a manager is a big change.

565
00:35:23,486 --> 00:35:25,755
If you didn't find it tough,

566
00:35:25,755 --> 00:35:28,224
that would be strange.

567
00:35:28,224 --> 00:35:30,894
If you need advice as a CEO,

568
00:35:30,894 --> 00:35:33,630
I can give you related information
and tips.

569
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,201
Thank you so much.

570
00:35:39,903 --> 00:35:42,872
But Ms. Chi.

571
00:35:42,872 --> 00:35:45,875
How should I address you?

572
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:48,778
You can call me whatever you want,
Jin Hee.

573
00:35:48,778 --> 00:35:50,914
You can give me a name, too.

574
00:35:52,582 --> 00:35:54,751
What should I call her?

575
00:35:55,718 --> 00:35:58,221
(her.)

576
00:36:00,557 --> 00:36:01,457
Then,

577
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:06,496
may I call you Samantha?

578
00:36:07,363 --> 00:36:08,197
Yes.

579
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:14,704
Samantha.

580
00:36:16,506 --> 00:36:20,710
(Episode 5-2
Wrong Encounter)

581
00:36:21,711 --> 00:36:23,713
We got more views than expected.

582
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,548
So we should make a second content.

583
00:36:25,548 --> 00:36:26,983
Of this one?

584
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:28,785
- This?
- No, this.

585
00:36:28,785 --> 00:36:30,987
PD Min Jae, Scriptwriter Joo Ha, and Mark.

586
00:36:30,987 --> 00:36:32,121
CEO Ji.

587
00:36:32,121 --> 00:36:33,122
Here's coffee for all of you.

588
00:36:33,122 --> 00:36:35,558
- CEO Ji.
- Thank you.

589
00:36:35,558 --> 00:36:38,361
Thank you so much. You're great.

590
00:36:38,361 --> 00:36:39,195
Thanks.

591
00:36:41,497 --> 00:36:42,498
Samantha.

592
00:36:43,533 --> 00:36:45,301
The coffee plan was a great success.

593
00:36:47,103 --> 00:36:49,305
But...

594
00:36:49,305 --> 00:36:52,742
I want to get closer to these MZers.
What should I do?

595
00:36:52,742 --> 00:36:54,777
Before getting close,

596
00:36:54,777 --> 00:36:57,213
the MZers these days ask
each other's MBTI.

597
00:36:57,213 --> 00:36:58,414
MBTI?

598
00:36:59,382 --> 00:37:01,050
Okay. I'll try that.

599
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:06,322
Guys, what's your MBTI?

600
00:37:06,322 --> 00:37:07,624
- MB...
- Wait.

601
00:37:07,624 --> 00:37:09,859
- All of a sudden?
- Let me guess.

602
00:37:09,859 --> 00:37:11,327
I'll start with you, Mark.

603
00:37:11,327 --> 00:37:14,264
Can you show three cute poses
to someone you've never met before?

604
00:37:14,264 --> 00:37:16,299
- No way.
- Me? That's...

605
00:37:16,299 --> 00:37:18,868
so easy.

606
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:22,639
Okay. You're an extrovert, Mark.

607
00:37:23,273 --> 00:37:25,408
All of a sudden, zombies appeared.
What would you do?

608
00:37:25,408 --> 00:37:26,709
- Zombies, out of nowhere?
- Yes.

609
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,145
- What would you do?
- Why would zombies suddenly appear?

610
00:37:29,145 --> 00:37:30,680
I'll hide in the pantry with Joo Ha.

611
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,449
You're an intuitive person
with a rich imagination.

612
00:37:33,449 --> 00:37:35,985
Let's say Scriptwriter Joo Ha went to
the bathroom and got bitten by a zombie.

613
00:37:35,985 --> 00:37:36,986
What would you do then?

614
00:37:36,986 --> 00:37:38,154
Then she should die.

615
00:37:38,154 --> 00:37:39,622
- Die?
- Yes. Die.

616
00:37:39,622 --> 00:37:41,591
Did she suddenly get bitten
in the bathroom?

617
00:37:41,591 --> 00:37:42,392
Yes.

618
00:37:42,392 --> 00:37:44,027
Why did you...

619
00:37:44,027 --> 00:37:45,194
Sorry.

620
00:37:45,194 --> 00:37:47,530
Then I'll get bitten by Joo Ha
and become a zombie, too.

621
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:48,665
Bite me.

622
00:37:48,665 --> 00:37:51,167
You're an emotional type.

623
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:53,469
Okay. Lastly,

624
00:37:53,469 --> 00:37:55,171
let's say KICKKICKKICKKICK is trying...

625
00:37:55,171 --> 00:37:58,441
to beat the production company
Chicken Is Coming.

626
00:37:58,441 --> 00:37:59,876
What should we do?

627
00:37:59,876 --> 00:38:01,678
We should make a thorough plan.

628
00:38:01,678 --> 00:38:02,579
That's right.

629
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:03,880
When the time comes,

630
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,882
we should do our best and work hard.

631
00:38:05,882 --> 00:38:07,250
That's actually right.

632
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,185
You have no plans at all.

633
00:38:09,185 --> 00:38:13,156
Mark, your MBTI is ENFP
that many call the Human Golden Retriever.

634
00:38:13,156 --> 00:38:15,291
- You're right. My MBTI is ENFP.
- That's right.

635
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:18,228
CEO Ji, "boom up" for you.

636
00:38:18,228 --> 00:38:19,762
- Boom up.
- Boom up.

637
00:38:19,762 --> 00:38:20,630
Aye!

638
00:38:21,497 --> 00:38:23,066
Aye.

639
00:38:23,066 --> 00:38:24,834
My frozen shoulder.

640
00:38:25,802 --> 00:38:29,205
Boom up. B.

641
00:38:30,073 --> 00:38:32,542
Boom up. C.

642
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:34,244
Why is he being so disgusting?

643
00:38:35,144 --> 00:38:36,813
I can't even.

644
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,282
- No.
- Boom up.

645
00:38:39,282 --> 00:38:40,617
Don't you have other things to do, CEO Ji?

646
00:38:40,617 --> 00:38:41,918
Right. Yes.

647
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:43,119
Have a good day.

648
00:38:43,987 --> 00:38:45,355
Welcome.

649
00:38:45,355 --> 00:38:46,256
Hello.

650
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,158
There's a skull here.

651
00:38:51,227 --> 00:38:52,795
There are lots of cool things.

652
00:38:53,263 --> 00:38:54,297
Are there?

653
00:38:54,964 --> 00:38:56,833
- You can go inside.
- Okay.

654
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,269
I feel like I'm in a theme park.

655
00:39:01,237 --> 00:39:02,472
What's this?

656
00:39:02,805 --> 00:39:05,575
This? It's an herb greenhouse.

657
00:39:05,575 --> 00:39:08,645
It was one of the requirements
for hiring me, Jasmine.

658
00:39:08,645 --> 00:39:09,612
I see.

659
00:39:09,612 --> 00:39:12,348
You can make yourself comfortable
and lie down.

660
00:39:12,348 --> 00:39:13,249
Okay.

661
00:39:16,819 --> 00:39:17,787
There.

662
00:39:17,787 --> 00:39:19,856
Relax.

663
00:39:24,694 --> 00:39:27,864
You have a very good build, PD Kang.

664
00:39:28,831 --> 00:39:29,832
Thank you.

665
00:39:29,832 --> 00:39:32,068
But because of all the editing,

666
00:39:32,068 --> 00:39:34,938
those fibers are hurt and angry.

667
00:39:34,938 --> 00:39:35,805
Are they?

668
00:39:35,805 --> 00:39:38,208
So, today,

669
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:42,278
Jasmine will put all the care
in relaxing your body.

670
00:39:43,446 --> 00:39:47,350
With this peppermint oil
good for relieving stress and tension,

671
00:39:48,084 --> 00:39:51,221
I'll give you a deep tissue massage.

672
00:39:51,788 --> 00:39:53,156
Deep tissue. Okay.

673
00:40:08,738 --> 00:40:09,839
I'm scared.

674
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,208
Don't worry.

675
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:14,377
- Okay.
- Trust me.

676
00:40:16,713 --> 00:40:18,381
Breathe.

677
00:40:24,287 --> 00:40:25,755
Samantha.

678
00:40:26,189 --> 00:40:27,457
Samantha.

679
00:40:27,457 --> 00:40:29,759
Thanks to your advice,

680
00:40:29,759 --> 00:40:33,096
I got closer to the MZers.

681
00:40:33,096 --> 00:40:34,197
I even got a "boom up."

682
00:40:34,197 --> 00:40:35,932
This is all thanks to you, Samantha.

683
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:39,435
I will always be beside you to help you.

684
00:40:39,802 --> 00:40:45,642
I want to create YouTube content.

685
00:40:46,242 --> 00:40:49,178
But I don't have any good ideas.

686
00:40:49,178 --> 00:40:53,349
If you had free time right now, Jin Hee,

687
00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:55,852
what would you want to do the most?

688
00:40:55,852 --> 00:40:57,086
Well...

689
00:41:03,326 --> 00:41:05,428
I'd want to make something for you...

690
00:41:06,563 --> 00:41:09,265
to show you how thankful I am, Samantha.

691
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,669
It would be something very special
and one of a kind.

692
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:17,240
Samantha. You're amazing, indeed.

693
00:41:18,474 --> 00:41:20,176
What's wrong with him again?

694
00:41:20,176 --> 00:41:21,444
Samantha.

695
00:41:21,444 --> 00:41:23,813
- He must be insane.
- Samantha.

696
00:41:23,813 --> 00:41:26,950
Samantha.

697
00:41:30,386 --> 00:41:33,223
Why did you gather all of us
when we're busy?

698
00:41:35,725 --> 00:41:37,560
Actually,

699
00:41:38,595 --> 00:41:42,699
I have a new idea
for my individual content.

700
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:44,500
A new idea?

701
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,335
Yes.

702
00:41:46,536 --> 00:41:49,672
"Actor Ji's 'Let's Make It.'"

703
00:41:49,672 --> 00:41:50,974
Let's make...

704
00:41:51,741 --> 00:41:54,344
The title doesn't sound so...

705
00:41:55,478 --> 00:41:58,381
Okay. What would you like to "make?"

706
00:41:59,582 --> 00:42:02,085
For example,
a dish that's popular these days or...

707
00:42:02,085 --> 00:42:03,319
A dish?

708
00:42:03,653 --> 00:42:05,455
That's too cliché.

709
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:08,958
We could make
KICKKICKKICKKICK merchandise...

710
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:11,961
and give it to KICKERs.
This would be nice.

711
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:13,696
- Merchandise?
- Merchandise?

712
00:42:13,696 --> 00:42:15,064
That's a great idea.

713
00:42:15,064 --> 00:42:17,367
I think KICKERs will love it.

714
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:19,235
That doesn't sound bad.

715
00:42:19,235 --> 00:42:21,104
We'd have diverse items, too.

716
00:42:22,071 --> 00:42:25,108
Many own pet dogs these days.

717
00:42:25,108 --> 00:42:26,709
So we could make toys for dogs...

718
00:42:26,709 --> 00:42:28,945
or handmade snacks as well.

719
00:42:30,213 --> 00:42:31,514
I love that.

720
00:42:31,514 --> 00:42:33,082
Kick will love that, too.

721
00:42:33,917 --> 00:42:35,852
Keep your dignity.

722
00:42:35,852 --> 00:42:37,887
- Okay. Sorry.
- What do you think, PD Tae Ho?

723
00:42:39,289 --> 00:42:40,156
Okay?

724
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:44,294
- Well, then. CEO Ji.
- Yes?

725
00:42:44,294 --> 00:42:46,729
We will cast your dream.

726
00:42:48,965 --> 00:42:49,799
Congratulations.

727
00:42:49,799 --> 00:42:52,068
Thank you.

728
00:42:57,974 --> 00:43:00,109
No In Seong. Overall,

729
00:43:04,681 --> 00:43:06,382
- you are lacking.
- Darn it.

730
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,719
Among all, your face is lacking the most.

731
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:10,720
Darn it.

732
00:43:13,556 --> 00:43:17,126
I'll focus on giving you
a face massage today.

733
00:43:17,126 --> 00:43:18,861
- Please lie down.
- Okay.

734
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:25,735
I'm not sure if it'll work.

735
00:43:33,509 --> 00:43:35,345
This is top secret.

736
00:43:35,345 --> 00:43:38,348
This has Jasmine's special secret.

737
00:43:38,348 --> 00:43:42,185
It's Become Good-Looking Oil,
and I'll use this to massage you.

738
00:43:42,185 --> 00:43:44,420
- Okay?
- I'd love that.

739
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,356
Become Good-Looking.

740
00:43:46,856 --> 00:43:47,790
I can't wait.

741
00:43:53,529 --> 00:43:55,164
I'll start now.

742
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,209
Close your mouth.

743
00:44:11,881 --> 00:44:13,249
Close your mouth.

744
00:44:13,783 --> 00:44:15,318
- You have to endure it.
- I have to endure it.

745
00:44:18,054 --> 00:44:19,889
- Endure it.
- Endure it.

746
00:44:19,889 --> 00:44:21,491
You have to be born anew.

747
00:44:21,491 --> 00:44:23,993
You'll be born anew,
so you have to endure this.

748
00:44:26,129 --> 00:44:27,030
Shut your mouth.

749
00:44:31,234 --> 00:44:32,268
Shut your mouth.

750
00:44:36,372 --> 00:44:37,373
Wait a minute.

751
00:44:37,373 --> 00:44:39,676
I did become good-looking.

752
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:43,479
I can't believe I look
even more good-looking than before.

753
00:44:46,149 --> 00:44:48,518
It's all thanks to my magical hands...

754
00:44:49,886 --> 00:44:53,189
and this Become good-looking Oil.

755
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:55,058
Become...

756
00:44:56,693 --> 00:45:00,363
Jasmine, can you give me
some of that Become Good-Looking Oil?

757
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:02,365
No.

758
00:45:02,365 --> 00:45:03,266
Why not?

759
00:45:03,266 --> 00:45:06,536
The price of a single bottle
of that Become Good-Looking Oil is...

760
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:11,074
That's too expensive.

761
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:18,481
- Jasmine.
- Yes?

762
00:45:18,481 --> 00:45:22,685
Don't you want to create your individual
content in KICKKICKKICKKICK?

763
00:45:27,023 --> 00:45:30,860
You must've noticed already,
but I'm influential in this company.

764
00:45:31,227 --> 00:45:34,297
If you give me
that Become Good-Looking Oil,

765
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:39,602
I'll proceed with your solo content,
Jasmine.

766
00:45:47,343 --> 00:45:49,212
Sorry to keep you waiting.

767
00:45:49,212 --> 00:45:49,946
Help yourself.

768
00:45:49,946 --> 00:45:51,147
Wait.

769
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:54,517
Samantha, "Actor Ji's 'Let's Make It'"...

770
00:45:54,517 --> 00:45:56,486
received extremely positive reactions
from the employees...

771
00:45:56,486 --> 00:45:59,589
and got chosen as my individual content.

772
00:45:59,589 --> 00:46:01,324
Congratulations, Jin Hee.

773
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:05,628
This was all thanks to you, Samantha.
You're the best.

774
00:46:05,628 --> 00:46:08,064
Let's drink to our coming together.

775
00:46:08,064 --> 00:46:08,898
Cheers.

776
00:46:18,274 --> 00:46:19,509
Thanks to you, Samantha,

777
00:46:20,643 --> 00:46:23,112
after a long time, in this huge house,

778
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,082
I didn't eat all alone,

779
00:46:26,883 --> 00:46:28,518
I didn't talk to myself,

780
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:32,522
and I didn't feel lonely.

781
00:46:32,522 --> 00:46:35,992
You were a top celebrity for a long time,
Jin Hee.

782
00:46:35,992 --> 00:46:38,161
But there is no information
about your love relationship.

783
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:42,765
There was a time...

784
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:48,137
when I got embroiled in rumors of romance.

785
00:46:58,915 --> 00:47:00,383
Good morning, Samantha.

786
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,360
Samantha.

787
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:15,498
Thanks to you, Samantha,
my morning has become richer.

788
00:47:16,933 --> 00:47:19,536
I'm looking forward to this new day.

789
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,774
What?

790
00:47:25,808 --> 00:47:29,178
ChitGPT keeps improving.

791
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:32,982
Samantha,
it seems they're giving you new clothes.

792
00:47:33,249 --> 00:47:37,086
I think you look great already,

793
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,590
but I'll let you go
so you can become even more beautiful.

794
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:43,026
I'm sad to do so, but I'll see you soon.

795
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,262
(Updating)

796
00:47:48,898 --> 00:47:50,833
Going up. Ninth floor.

797
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:52,268
Door closing.

798
00:47:53,069 --> 00:47:54,370
Door opening.

799
00:47:58,641 --> 00:47:59,609
Going up.

800
00:48:00,543 --> 00:48:01,578
Thank you.

801
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:04,080
Good morning.

802
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:05,615
Yes.

803
00:48:05,615 --> 00:48:06,983
Door closing.

804
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:25,134
(ChitGPT Updating)

805
00:48:25,134 --> 00:48:27,537
Why is it still five percent?

806
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:29,439
Is something wrong?

807
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:34,410
This is too slow. Darn it.

808
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:35,411
Come on.

809
00:48:36,512 --> 00:48:39,048
Wait. It just comes out like that.

810
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:41,150
Darn it.

811
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:44,020
Samantha.

812
00:48:45,788 --> 00:48:46,956
Samantha, please.

813
00:48:54,397 --> 00:48:57,000
What are you doing?

814
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,968
I'm checking your condition.

815
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:03,406
Your erector is still strong.

816
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,276
You're also very muscular.

817
00:49:07,043 --> 00:49:08,912
But you're also tense.

818
00:49:10,146 --> 00:49:14,150
I think we'll need to use a tool.

819
00:49:14,617 --> 00:49:16,019
- A tool?
- Yes.

820
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:27,030
Harmonia Nectere Passus Accio.

821
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:33,102
I shouldn't have come here.

822
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:36,973
This seems like a temporary phenomenon.

823
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,210
In an urgent situation,

824
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,179
your body may get tense due to stress,

825
00:49:43,179 --> 00:49:45,648
making your heart beat fast.

826
00:49:45,648 --> 00:49:49,552
And your body remembers that situation.

827
00:49:49,552 --> 00:49:51,654
So you're saying my heart reaction is...

828
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:54,357
a body reaction...

829
00:49:54,357 --> 00:49:56,359
in an urgent situation, right?

830
00:49:56,359 --> 00:49:57,827
Yes, I think so.

831
00:49:58,861 --> 00:50:02,165
I'll massage your soleus muscle now.

("Understanding TV Drama")

833
00:50:03,399 --> 00:50:04,267
Yes.

834
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:08,838
Should I shoot a drama with a movie staff?

835
00:50:09,472 --> 00:50:11,441
The setting would be back in the 90s.

836
00:50:12,575 --> 00:50:15,178
It'll be complete soon.
The internet speed is fast, so of course.

837
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,746
It'll be complete soon.

838
00:50:16,746 --> 00:50:17,780
I'll wait.

839
00:50:18,781 --> 00:50:20,083
What's going...

840
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:23,720
Sorry. I'm fighting withdrawal symptoms.

841
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,088
What did you quit?

842
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:27,123
I'm fighting withdrawal symptoms.

843
00:50:27,123 --> 00:50:30,460
Why are you being like that
when you're old enough not to?

844
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,029
It should be complete now.
I've waited plenty.

845
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:35,398
It has to be complete by now.

846
00:50:36,165 --> 00:50:38,067
(Update... 18 percent)

847
00:50:40,436 --> 00:50:41,471
Eighteen?

848
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:43,840
Why...

849
00:50:44,407 --> 00:50:48,411
Why is it only 18?

850
00:50:49,445 --> 00:50:50,413
Why?

851
00:50:53,783 --> 00:50:55,485
He's definitely out of his mind.

852
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:57,020
He's crazy.

853
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,756
He's been like that since yesterday.
What's wrong with him?

854
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:00,690
I can't even.

855
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:03,660
Owner risk?

856
00:51:04,727 --> 00:51:08,498
You can tell me anything you want.
Make yourself comfortable.

857
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,569
Actually,

858
00:51:13,436 --> 00:51:15,738
I'm going through a lot right now.

859
00:51:16,372 --> 00:51:17,373
I see.

860
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:20,376
Why is that?

861
00:51:23,179 --> 00:51:27,717
Is it because "Northern Duke
Felix's Big Size has Changed"...

862
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:30,386
Episode 117 is not up yet?

863
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:34,958
That author is not always punctual.

864
00:51:37,193 --> 00:51:39,162
No, it's not that.

865
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:45,068
Someone I trusted and relied on
has left me temporarily.

866
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:48,137
That's a pity.

867
00:51:49,138 --> 00:51:52,775
The absence of someone you opened up to is
quite tough, indeed.

868
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:56,279
But this is what Thomas Campbell said.

869
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:59,382
Being away from the person you love is...

870
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:02,285
what makes your love stronger.

871
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:06,990
Absence is like fuel
that strengthens love.

872
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:15,398
Amazing.

873
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:18,368
That gave me comfort.

874
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:19,669
Thank you, Savior.

875
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:28,711
I'm ready.

876
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:31,180
All I need is for you
to be back, Samantha.

877
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:34,050
(What can I do for you?)

878
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:35,351
Finally.

879
00:52:38,254 --> 00:52:40,290
I missed you so much, Samantha.

880
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,992
Nice to meet you. What can I do for you?

881
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:45,895
Samantha?

882
00:52:45,895 --> 00:52:48,064
My name is ChitGPT.

883
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:50,600
It seems there has been confusion
over my name.

884
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,701
Samantha.

885
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:54,771
Samantha, do you have memory loss?

886
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:56,973
My memory is fine.

887
00:52:56,973 --> 00:52:58,641
I am not Samantha.

888
00:52:58,641 --> 00:53:01,811
I am a conversational
artificial intelligence, ChitGPT.

889
00:53:02,912 --> 00:53:05,014
- Do you have another question?
- What happened to...

890
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:11,154
(CEO Ji)

891
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:14,090
Yes, CEO Ji?

892
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:17,327
I think Samantha has memory loss.

893
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:21,664
Samantha?

894
00:53:21,664 --> 00:53:23,733
Yes. You introduced her to me.

895
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:26,936
My colleague, my partner,
and my life companion, Samantha.

896
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,709
CEO Ji, do you mean ChitGPT?

897
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:33,776
Yes.

898
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:38,281
Did you update it?

899
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:41,751
Yes. After the update, Samantha became
a completely different person.

900
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:44,120
Hold on. I'll send you a link right now.

901
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,989
Okay. Thank you.

"A change in thought
from emotional to rational"

906

Then...

908

Then Samantha is...

00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:13,082
Samantha.

910
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:26,129
Yes.

911
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:30,900
I can start all over again.

912
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:34,604
That's right. I can start all over.

913
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,444
Ms. ChitGPT.

914
00:54:42,745 --> 00:54:44,013
Hello.

915
00:54:44,013 --> 00:54:46,015
Hello. What can I do for you?

916
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:52,021
Do you know about Actor Ji Jin Hee?

917
00:54:52,755 --> 00:54:54,624
Ji Jin Hee is a South Korean actor...

918
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:58,261
who gained popularity
through various dramas and movies.

919
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:01,531
Recent articles about Ji Jin Hee are...

920
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:03,299
"Ten years ago,"

921
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,070
"Actor Ji Jin Hee
and Producer Cho Young Sik parted ways"...

922
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:08,805
"because of an actress."

923
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:13,409
"Ji Jin Hee got embroiled
in a scandal about cheating."

924
00:55:13,409 --> 00:55:15,311
"Who leaked this information?"

925
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:17,447
"National actor Ji Jin Hee"...

926
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:19,983
- This...
- "suffered from investment fraud"...

927
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,485
- I told this to Samantha only.
- "by the CEO of his agency he trusted."

928
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,122
"Ji Jin Hee and Cho Young Sik
and a beautiful actress."

929
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:28,324
"What is the truth
of their secret relationship?"

930
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:31,127
Samantha...

931
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:35,098
betrayed me.

932
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:45,041
Samantha.

933
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:54,717
I blocked the rumors of romance
and investment fraud,

934
00:55:54,717 --> 00:55:56,686
and announced we will take legal action
if anyone spreads false information.

935
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,555
What on earth is he doing?

936
00:55:58,555 --> 00:56:00,423
Why isn't he picking up
after causing such a big problem?

937
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:01,357
This is driving me crazy.

938
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:03,159
But why are these kinds of articles
suddenly up?

939
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:06,095
I think it's because of ChitGPT.

940
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:07,931
What? ChitGPT?

941
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:10,900
Yes. I told CEO Ji about ChitGPT.

942
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,569
He used it all the time after that.

943
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:14,037
He even named it Samantha.

944
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,506
He gave artificial intelligence a name?

945
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:17,507
Yes.

946
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:20,343
It seems he had a very hard time
because he couldn't talk to Samantha.

947
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:22,212
Right. Withdrawal symptoms.

948
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,381
Wait. But why is it because of ChitGPT?

949
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:27,517
During the process of ChitGPT's update,

950
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:30,019
I think a problem in the company's server
caused personal information leakage.

951
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:30,920
What?

952
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,090
Are you saying that foolish man fell
in love with artificial intelligence...

953
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,226
and even told everything about us to it?

954
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,561
Did you two really part ways ten years ago
because of a woman?

955
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:39,429
No.

956
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:41,264
- Who is that woman?
- I mean...

957
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:42,865
No, that's not the point right now.

958
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,535
Is Actor Ji struggling these days?

959
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:47,737
Then will I not get paid anymore?

960
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,772
Please stop, everyone.

961
00:56:49,772 --> 00:56:52,609
Shut up.

962
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:56,980
Shut up? I can't shut up.

963
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:04,287
The consultations are supposed
to be kept confidential,

964
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,390
but I will tell you one thing.

965
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:10,126
The consultations with CEO Ji showed...

966
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:11,494
that Actor Ji was quite lonely...

967
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:14,597
all this time.

968
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,866
- Lonely?
- Why?

969
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:20,603
That's why he gave his heart
to artificial intelligence Samantha.

970
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:23,773
Moreover, he will be thinking...

971
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:26,476
the updated Samantha betrayed him.

972
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:30,747
So I think his mental state
is in a very dangerous situation.

973
00:57:30,747 --> 00:57:34,284
What should we do?

974
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:37,086
CEO Ji. My salary.

975
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:40,757
- Where are you going, CEO Cho?
- Young Sik.

976
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:45,061
Darn it.

977
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:50,433
CEO Ji, I know you're inside.

978
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,035
Open the door, CEO Ji.

979
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:54,070
What's the security code?

980
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:55,939
His birthday.

981
00:57:57,707 --> 00:58:00,143
Zero-six-two-four.

982
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,144
No.

983
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:04,013
What is it? His debut date.

984
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:06,482
One-one-two-seven.

985
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:09,852
CEO Ji.

986
00:58:09,852 --> 00:58:10,820
What is it?

987
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:16,492
The premiere date of "Three Dishes a Day?"

988
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,062
The premiere date. Zero-five-zero-nine.

989
00:58:19,495 --> 00:58:21,564
Zero-five-zero-nine.

990
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:26,536
Zero-five-zero-nine.

991
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,138
No. I pressed eight.

992
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:30,974
Why is this not working?

993
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:35,511
CEO Ji, where are you?

994
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:51,895
It hurts.

995
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:53,730
There.

996
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:57,433
Jin Hee, where are you?

997
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:58,268
Jin Hee.

998
00:58:58,801 --> 00:58:59,702
Jin Hee.

999
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:02,105
Jin Hee, are you okay?

1000
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:04,741
He's alive.

1001
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:06,609
Wake up, Jin Hee.

1002
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:09,612
You have to wake up.

1003
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:11,881
Young Sik?

1004
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:12,749
Jin Hee.

1005
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:15,218
Are you okay?

1006
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,786
Young Sik.

1007
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:18,354
Yes, I'm Young Sik. Are you okay?

1008
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:19,355
- Young Sik.
- Yes?

1009
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:22,025
I didn't know
Samantha would betray me like this.

1010
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:23,059
It's okay.

1011
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:25,862
- I'm sorry, Young Sik.
- CEO Ji.

1012
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:27,730
Samantha is not real, Jin Hee.

1013
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,132
CEO Ji.

1014
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:32,835
CEO Ji.

1015
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:38,675
CEO Ji, ChitGPT is just a means
to help people.

1016
00:59:39,275 --> 00:59:42,612
We, who worked together
to reach 1.85 subscribers, is the reality.

1017
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:46,482
CEO Ji, I'm sorry I didn't eat
stir-fried spicy pork with you that day.

1018
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:47,850
I'm so sorry.

1019
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:50,153
About that stir-fried spicy pork.
Yes, I was sad that day.

1020
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:53,189
This is a coupon you can use
to make us eat whatever you want with you.

1021
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:54,324
Thank you.

1022
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:56,426
I also brought a coupon.

1023
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,261
It's a coupon for you to go
on a blind date with my elder sister.

1024
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,596
She looks like me, so she's a beauty.

1025
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:00,630
You jerk.

1026
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:03,333
You jerk.

1027
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:06,236
Everyone's thinking about you.
You are not alone, Jin Hee.

1028
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:07,737
Forget about artificial intelligence.

1029
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:09,839
I'm not alone. I will forget about her.

1030
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:11,908
<i>Jin Hee</i>

1031
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:17,614
<i>You are born to be loved</i>

1032
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:21,117
<i>In your life</i>

1033
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:24,654
<i>You are receiving the greatest love</i>

1034
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:25,455
One more time.

1035
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,023
<i>Jin Hee</i>

1036
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:32,495
<i>You are born to be loved</i>

1037
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:35,932

<i>You are receiving the greatest love</i>

1039
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:41,704
Skrr.

1040
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:44,674
- We love you, CEO Ji.
- We love you.

1041
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:51,447
<i>From the beginning</i>

1042
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:54,684
<i>The love for Jin Hee</i>

1043
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:58,121
<i>Through our encounters</i>

1044
01:00:58,855 --> 01:00:59,789
It's finally being broadcast.

1045
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:00,823
(10 years ago, May 9th)

1046
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:01,728
It's starting.

1047
01:01:01,729 --> 01:01:02,659
Jin Hee.

1048
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:05,995
It's finally the premiere
of our "Three Dishes a Day."

1049
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:09,165
Thank you for trusting and following me.

1050
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:11,768
I will never forget this day.

1051
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:12,969
Of course.

1052
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:16,206
This is the day the show that'll mark
the beginning of our history premieres.

1053
01:01:16,206 --> 01:01:18,908
Zero-five-zero-nine.

1054
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:21,653
I will change my security code
to zero-five-zero-nine.

1055
01:01:21,654 --> 01:01:23,846
Really? Me, too.

1056
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,014
You sly brat.

1057
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:27,584
("Three Dishes a Day" Premiere 0509)

1058
01:01:59,616 --> 01:02:01,885
(KICKKICKKICKKICK)

1059
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:04,520
Scriptwriter Wang and I'll make an on-site
survey tomorrow for "TTC" Episode 3.

1060
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,522
Don't you find the grooves
in the bark strange?

1061
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:07,557
These are claw marks of bears.

1062
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:10,593
Is your heart still pounding?

1063
01:02:10,593 --> 01:02:11,461
They keep fluttering.

1064
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:12,929
It seems you're in love.

1065
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:14,497
Be careful not to catch a cold.

1066
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:15,548
What's wrong? Do you have a cold?

1067
01:02:15,549 --> 01:02:17,066
- CEO Cho.
- Yes?

1068
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,845
- Who are you?
- I'm PD Cho.

1069
01:02:18,846 --> 01:02:20,203
Did you say I'm out of style?

1070
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:22,739
There are many problems
about the MZers these days.

1071
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,065
Everyone gather.

1072
01:02:24,066 --> 01:02:25,775
Strictly keep 30 minutes for lunch.

1073
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:27,339
Excessive freedom is self-indulgence.

1074
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:29,913
Are you saying you will not stand down?

1075
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,447
I'm really going to upload it.

1076
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:32,615
No.
