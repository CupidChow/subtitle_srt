1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,161
(All characters, organizations,)

2
00:00:01,161 --> 00:00:02,596
(and events in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:02,596 --> 00:00:03,997
(Broadcasting guidelines were followed
during the shooting of animals.)

4
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:09,870
(Hanbang Building)

5
00:00:13,273 --> 00:00:15,809
Did you see the reactions
to the KICKKICKKICKKICK Song showcase?

6
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:17,211
- They were positive.
- Really?

7
00:00:17,211 --> 00:00:19,847
- The number of subscribers increased.
- That's good.

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,521
What's this?

9
00:00:32,392 --> 00:00:36,497
I think the challenge we danced
to will also go viral soon.

10
00:00:36,497 --> 00:00:38,999
Right. Mark shared the link
with other celebrities...

11
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:41,368
and it's becoming widely known.

12
00:00:41,368 --> 00:00:42,936
Good job, Mark.

13
00:00:42,936 --> 00:00:44,438
That natural physical contact.

14
00:00:46,406 --> 00:00:47,474
You good boy.

15
00:00:47,474 --> 00:00:50,277
Can I upload it, too?
I mean, the challenge video.

16
00:00:50,277 --> 00:00:51,879
- That would be great.
- That would be great.

17
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:54,581
- How do you do it?
- The dance is easy. Should we teach you?

18
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:56,216
But not today.

19
00:00:56,216 --> 00:00:58,418
Please teach me thoroughly
when you have time.

20
00:00:58,418 --> 00:01:00,521
- Okay.
- Thank you.

21
00:01:03,223 --> 00:01:04,057
Hey.

22
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:06,293
What?

23
00:01:07,494 --> 00:01:09,329
What's with that eye contact?

24
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:12,466
Since Scriptwriter Joo Ha, PD Min Jae,
and Mark show great teamwork,

25
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:14,935
how about the three of you make
another MZ content?

26
00:01:14,935 --> 00:01:15,736
That's a good idea.

27
00:01:15,736 --> 00:01:18,572
It could be content derived
from the KICKKICKKICKKICK Song challenge.

28
00:01:18,572 --> 00:01:20,974
Okay. MZers,

29
00:01:20,974 --> 00:01:23,443
let's make another viral content.

30
00:01:23,443 --> 00:01:25,212
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

31
00:01:28,315 --> 00:01:29,550
A wink?

32
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,888
He's whispering in her ear so openly.

33
00:01:39,793 --> 00:01:43,096
Why does PD Min Jae keep looking at
Scriptwriter Joo Ha with those sweet eyes?

34
00:01:43,964 --> 00:01:45,933
- Me.
- Think about it.

35
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:47,568
Don't just think, but take action.

36
00:01:47,568 --> 00:01:49,403
Everyone's suspicious.

37
00:01:49,403 --> 00:01:50,871
Everyone except for me.

38
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,073
CEO Cho.

39
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:57,311
- Here goes the madman again.
- CEO Cho.

40
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:06,687
Was I wrong?

41
00:02:14,695 --> 00:02:17,731
Who on earth were they?

42
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:24,838
Hello.

43
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,876
What do you think about office romance?

44
00:02:28,876 --> 00:02:31,845
- Excuse me?
- I couldn't sleep at all last night.

45
00:02:31,845 --> 00:02:33,947
Because that scene kept playing
on my mind.

46
00:02:33,947 --> 00:02:36,650
Wait a minute.

47
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:47,694
I know we were
all over each other last night.

48
00:02:47,694 --> 00:02:49,796
But our lips didn't touch.

49
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:52,266
- What?
- And let me speak my mind.

50
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:57,437
I'm not really for office romance.

51
00:02:57,437 --> 00:02:58,338
- And...
- What are you even...

52
00:02:58,338 --> 00:02:59,873
Listen to me first.

53
00:03:04,611 --> 00:03:05,445
Okay.

54
00:03:06,547 --> 00:03:08,949
While two people date,

55
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:10,817
the emotional conflicts...

56
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:13,654
and private conversations affect
the work we do.

57
00:03:13,654 --> 00:03:15,422
And when they break up,

58
00:03:15,422 --> 00:03:18,325
they have to keep seeing each other
in the same place.

59
00:03:18,325 --> 00:03:21,261
That uncomfortable situation
and the thoughts of other people...

60
00:03:21,261 --> 00:03:24,832
can cause major emotional stress.

61
00:03:24,832 --> 00:03:29,636
This results in even poorer performance
than while they were dating.

62
00:03:29,636 --> 00:03:30,604
Do you get...

63
00:03:38,178 --> 00:03:39,446
You're somewhat a handful.

64
00:03:45,686 --> 00:03:46,520
That woman.

65
00:03:48,255 --> 00:03:49,189
Anyway,

66
00:03:50,123 --> 00:03:52,326
(Episode 8)

67
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,864
After hearing what you said,
I got more certain, Ji Won.

68
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:02,503
Office romance is old evil.

69
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:03,337
Excuse me?

70
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,040
You probably didn't see it that day,
but I clearly did with my own two eyes.

71
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,876
- Rocking behind the curtains...
- Office romance?

72
00:04:08,876 --> 00:04:11,845
were the silhouettes of a man
and a woman overlapping.

73
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:14,314
I will eradicate them
and give a strict warning.

74
00:04:14,314 --> 00:04:17,184
Until we reach three million subscribers
and start to make profit,

75
00:04:17,184 --> 00:04:19,853
office romance is strictly forbidden.

76
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:25,259
But PD Cho,

77
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:29,029
office romance does not
only have disadvantages.

78
00:04:30,097 --> 00:04:31,098
Even so,

79
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:36,136
would you like me to help out?

80
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,840
Due to my job, I'm an old hand...

81
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,141
at people dating at work.

82
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:42,276
Are you?

83
00:04:42,276 --> 00:04:43,911
But under one condition.

84
00:04:45,746 --> 00:04:49,249
Participate in my yoga class or therapy
at least once a week.

85
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:51,652
We can simply have a cup of tea like this.

86
00:04:51,652 --> 00:04:53,554
You can just have a chat and leave.

87
00:04:54,621 --> 00:04:55,556
Okay?

88
00:04:57,257 --> 00:04:58,125
Okay.

89
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:03,063
Then the name of our team is...

90
00:05:03,063 --> 00:05:04,231
Let's see...

91
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:07,000
Since we're Baek Ji Won and PD Cho,

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,436
how about
BaekCho Office Romance Search Team?

93
00:05:09,436 --> 00:05:10,838
BaekCho?

94
00:05:13,173 --> 00:05:14,708
Then let's go...

95
00:05:15,475 --> 00:05:19,646
to the place the two lovers frequented
like a sweet tooth in a bakery.

96
00:05:19,646 --> 00:05:20,581
Let's go.

97
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:24,818
Scriptwriter Wang,
I have something to say.

98
00:05:24,818 --> 00:05:26,086
I'm sick of it!

99
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,988
What?

100
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:32,292
Yes, I know you're greedy, PD Kang.

101
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:34,228
But "TTC" is doing great.

102
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:36,663
Just play along.

103
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:40,100
Right.

104
00:05:41,368 --> 00:05:42,836
So why...

105
00:05:42,836 --> 00:05:45,038
are you trying to bite the head off
of the only scriptwriter you have?

106
00:05:45,506 --> 00:05:48,375
Composition, script,
on-site survey, shooting,

107
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,677
editing, and subtitling.
I'm working my butt off in all of them.

108
00:05:51,445 --> 00:05:52,679
Right.

109
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:54,715
So if you grill me one more time,

110
00:05:55,782 --> 00:05:56,750
darn it.

111
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,785
Then I will quit working
with you, PD Kang.

112
00:05:58,785 --> 00:06:00,687
That's that!

113
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:05,058
- Hello.
- I didn't know you were there.

114
00:06:05,058 --> 00:06:06,326
- Well...
- Well...

115
00:06:07,094 --> 00:06:08,028
Bye.

116
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:15,169
Hey.

117
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:18,138
You jerk, don't push her.

118
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:20,240
We can't easily find
someone like Scriptwriter Wang elsewhere.

119
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:22,676
Yes, I know.

120
00:06:22,676 --> 00:06:23,677
What?

121
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:24,978
- Hello.
- Hello.

122
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,881
That brat.

123
00:06:28,882 --> 00:06:30,751
We should go and get ready.

124
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:32,519
For what?

125
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,555
Get ready for what?

126
00:06:36,123 --> 00:06:37,324
But okay.

127
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:42,229
(Episode 8-1
BaekCho Office Romance Search Team)

128
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:48,936
I'm sorry, PD Kang.

129
00:06:48,936 --> 00:06:50,237
I know you are.

130
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:54,775
But I want an explanation.

131
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:58,378
I happened to eavesdrop
on their conversation.

132
00:06:58,378 --> 00:07:01,648
PD Cho asked Baek Ji Won for help
to track down the people dating at work.

133
00:07:01,648 --> 00:07:03,016
What should we do?

134
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,252
What do you think?

135
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:06,920
Just behave like you usually do.

136
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,824
And we're not dating at work.
We're Friends At Night.

137
00:07:10,824 --> 00:07:13,126
- Seriously?
- So everything's fine during the day.

138
00:07:13,927 --> 00:07:16,997
But I wonder what made them
track down the secret lovers.

139
00:07:18,365 --> 00:07:22,536
Are the other two Friends At Night
PD Cho and Baek Ji Won?

140
00:07:22,536 --> 00:07:24,705
I'll buy lunch. Let's go out.

141
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:27,875
What? Did you say you're buying?

142
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:30,043
Are you out of your mind?

143
00:07:30,043 --> 00:07:33,146
I promised to buy you a decent meal
if we survived in the camper van.

144
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:34,982
Let's go.

145
00:07:36,717 --> 00:07:38,585
This is a rare opportunity.

146
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:40,687
I'm glad we survived.

147
00:07:48,462 --> 00:07:49,730
- You're here.
- Yes.

148
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,833
Mark, I purchased an application
that's popular among the MZers these days.

149
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:56,069
It's "No-ture's Secrets"
that shows you your daily horoscope.

150
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,804
"No-ture's Secrets?"

151
00:07:57,804 --> 00:07:58,772
Yes.

152
00:07:58,772 --> 00:08:01,108
I'll read you your horoscope, Mark.
Tell me your date of birth.

153
00:08:02,109 --> 00:08:03,443
August 2nd, 2000.

154
00:08:06,013 --> 00:08:07,748
- What does it say?
- Stop.

155
00:08:09,316 --> 00:08:12,653
Your female friend you've had a crush on
for long will start a new relationship.

156
00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:15,088
If you don't want to lose her,
hurry and confess your love.

157
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:16,824
Amazing. Isn't this your situation, Mark?

158
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:20,627
Mark, do you have a secret crush
on someone?

159
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:22,529
How youthful.

160
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,600
CEO Ji, since when were you eavesdropping
on our conversation?

161
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,735
Since the moment I was watering
Cilantree over there.

162
00:08:28,735 --> 00:08:30,637
I could hear your voice
from all the way there, No In Seong.

163
00:08:30,637 --> 00:08:32,906
But keep going.

164
00:08:32,906 --> 00:08:34,541
- Let's confess.
- What?

165
00:08:35,075 --> 00:08:36,743
"Cyrano Agency"...

166
00:08:36,743 --> 00:08:40,380
"The Proposal of Long Male
and Female Friends Part 2."

167
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,149
I, No In Seong, a former great part-timer,

168
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:46,053
will fully support your asking her out
from now on.

169
00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:47,654
I can guarantee...

170
00:08:47,654 --> 00:08:50,023
that you will succeed 100 percent.

171
00:08:50,023 --> 00:08:52,326
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

172
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,462
But to do that,

173
00:08:55,462 --> 00:08:57,564
I have to know more about you two.

174
00:08:57,564 --> 00:09:00,100
When, where, and how...

175
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,203
did your friendship start?

176
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,106
When, where, and how.

177
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:07,841
Well,

178
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:10,010
Joo Ha moved next door to me
when I was seven.

179
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:22,656
Hi.

180
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:25,759
I'm seven-year-old Ga Joo Ha
and I moved here just now.

181
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,862
I'm Lee Mark. I'm also seven.

182
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:30,230
I see.

183
00:09:30,697 --> 00:09:33,367
You should become my comrade
in Joo Ha World.

184
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:35,569
How many comrades are there?

185
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,272
You and me.

186
00:09:52,586 --> 00:09:55,656
- Lee Mark, aren't you late?
- That hurts.

187
00:09:56,323 --> 00:09:57,591
I hope we're not late to school.

188
00:09:57,591 --> 00:09:59,526
- I think we'll be late because of you.
- No way.

189
00:09:59,526 --> 00:10:01,962
This won't do. Joo-torcycle, ready.

190
00:10:01,962 --> 00:10:02,930
Vroom.

191
00:10:04,665 --> 00:10:06,533
But fortunately, Joo Ha didn't like me.

192
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:07,367
Stop right there.

193
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:09,937
- Why?
- What was that supposed to mean just now?

194
00:10:10,537 --> 00:10:12,372
Just now?

195
00:10:12,372 --> 00:10:16,543
As you can see, In Seong,
I'm good-looking.

196
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,847
So whenever I become friends with a girl,
they fall in love with me.

197
00:10:19,847 --> 00:10:21,715
So it's always been hard
to maintain the friendship.

198
00:10:21,715 --> 00:10:23,817
I know perfectly well. I can relate.

199
00:10:23,817 --> 00:10:25,552
I've always experienced that.
I do so even now.

200
00:10:26,286 --> 00:10:28,455
- So you know.
- Few people know this. He doesn't.

201
00:10:28,455 --> 00:10:29,590
Don't.

202
00:10:30,157 --> 00:10:31,191
Keep going.

203
00:10:31,191 --> 00:10:32,559
Also,

204
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:34,361
I started playing the guitar
because of Joo Ha.

205
00:10:34,361 --> 00:10:37,698
After watching "S-pop Star,"
she said we should go to a guitar academy.

206
00:10:38,165 --> 00:10:39,933
She quit after one week,

207
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:42,402
but I was head over heels
in love with playing the guitar.

208
00:10:45,272 --> 00:10:47,007
Mark, let's make a nice video.

209
00:10:47,007 --> 00:10:48,575
Okay. I'm nervous.

210
00:10:48,575 --> 00:10:50,811
- I'll make you look fine.
- Okay.

211
00:10:51,745 --> 00:10:54,181
- Can you see my face clearly?
- Yes, I can.

212
00:10:55,048 --> 00:10:57,284
One, two, three, cue.

213
00:10:58,285 --> 00:11:00,854
<i>I miss you so much</i>

214
00:11:00,854 --> 00:11:03,757
<i>But then I don't want to see you</i>

215
00:11:03,757 --> 00:11:06,627
<i>If I let go of this</i>

216
00:11:06,627 --> 00:11:09,930
<i>I feel like we'll be over</i>

217
00:11:20,674 --> 00:11:23,110
<i>It's my fault again</i>

218
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,646
<i>It's always been like this</i>

219
00:11:25,646 --> 00:11:27,481
<i>At times, I hate you so much</i>

220
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:30,817
The video of me that Joo Ha shot
went viral on social media...

221
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,154
and I went on an audition programme
and won second place.

222
00:11:34,688 --> 00:11:37,291
Thanks to that, I got a practical music
scholarship to university.

223
00:11:40,027 --> 00:11:41,428
Now that I think about it,

224
00:11:41,428 --> 00:11:43,864
my parents gave birth to me,
but Joo Ha raised me.

225
00:11:44,398 --> 00:11:47,401
This is like a teen movie. How beautiful.

226
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:48,836
Don't.

227
00:11:49,102 --> 00:11:50,003
What?

228
00:11:50,003 --> 00:11:51,905
So, what's important is this.

229
00:11:51,905 --> 00:11:55,475
Since when did you grow feelings
for Ga Joo Ha?

230
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:58,412
Last year,
I figured I needed more experience...

231
00:11:58,412 --> 00:12:00,113
to write more interesting music.

232
00:12:00,113 --> 00:12:01,782
So I went backpacking.

233
00:12:01,782 --> 00:12:03,717
In Italy, and I'm not joking,

234
00:12:03,717 --> 00:12:05,819
I had a near-death experience.

235
00:12:06,386 --> 00:12:08,856
I can't even breathe properly now.

236
00:12:08,856 --> 00:12:11,658
But it feels like Mars here. Look.

237
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:19,633
Joo Ha.

238
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,042
The moment of my 24 years of life
which some may say is short...

239
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:31,144
went through my mind
like a flash just then.

240
00:12:31,144 --> 00:12:32,179
Right.

241
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:33,947
And they were all about Joo Ha.

242
00:12:34,948 --> 00:12:39,119
That's when I realized
I had feelings for Joo Ha.

243
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:40,320
I like her a lot.

244
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:43,323
After that realization,

245
00:12:43,323 --> 00:12:46,160
I was buoyed up
and it's hard to hide it now.

246
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,197
But that jerk Lee Min Jae appeared
out of nowhere.

247
00:12:50,864 --> 00:12:52,633
What?

248
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:54,768
- A love triangle with PD Lee Min Jae.
- Don't.

249
00:12:54,768 --> 00:12:56,170
- Right?
- Stop.

250
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,472
- Don't stop me. It's a love triangle.
- That's enough.

251
00:12:58,472 --> 00:12:59,306
Seriously?

252
00:12:59,306 --> 00:13:01,475
"Cyrano Agency"...

253
00:13:01,475 --> 00:13:03,944
"The Proposal of Long Male
and Female Friends Part 2."

254
00:13:03,944 --> 00:13:06,079
I, No In Seong, a former great part-timer,

255
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,881
will plan...

256
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:10,150
a 100 percent accurate way
to ask her out.

257
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,984
What?

258
00:13:11,585 --> 00:13:12,619
100 percent accurate?

259
00:13:17,591 --> 00:13:19,793
I'm full.

260
00:13:19,793 --> 00:13:21,762
They make the best pork cutlet.

261
00:13:21,762 --> 00:13:23,697
I kept my promise.

262
00:13:23,697 --> 00:13:28,035
I'll be asking you for a bite of your food
and staying in the pantry for some time.

263
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:30,671
For better digestion, glycemic control,

264
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:34,007
and cardiovascular health,
I'm going to use the stairs.

265
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:35,342
You should join me.

266
00:13:35,843 --> 00:13:36,910
How unexpected.

267
00:13:38,745 --> 00:13:40,581
Wait for me.

268
00:13:40,581 --> 00:13:41,648
Hurry up.

269
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:50,958
I do not understand it at all.

270
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,594
Why do they meet on the emergency stairs?

271
00:13:55,963 --> 00:13:58,298
It's quiet and secret.

272
00:13:58,298 --> 00:13:59,700
Don't you know that?

273
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:01,201
No, I don't.

274
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:04,371
Of course, you don't.

275
00:14:04,371 --> 00:14:07,474
Because you probably never dated anyone
at work.

276
00:14:07,474 --> 00:14:09,276
Don't be ridiculous.

277
00:14:09,276 --> 00:14:11,512
In my earliest days,
I've had that kind of relationship.

278
00:14:11,512 --> 00:14:12,713
"In my earliest days."

279
00:14:13,146 --> 00:14:14,715
How unexpected.

280
00:14:14,715 --> 00:14:17,017
Why was that unexpected? You're weird.

281
00:14:17,017 --> 00:14:20,154
Be quiet. I hear footsteps. They're here.

282
00:14:20,787 --> 00:14:22,289
I'm so tired.

283
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:25,526
It's daytime right now. Hurry up.

284
00:14:26,693 --> 00:14:28,162
They're PD Kang and Scriptwriter Wang.

285
00:14:28,162 --> 00:14:30,297
You should build your physical strength,
Scriptwriter Wang.

286
00:14:30,297 --> 00:14:32,699
Do you work out a lot, PD Kang?

287
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:34,101
I go hiking every weekend.

288
00:14:34,101 --> 00:14:36,136
I also swim in the Hangang River often.

289
00:14:36,803 --> 00:14:38,972
That's why you're fit.

290
00:14:38,972 --> 00:14:41,675
Don't you think
you're being too obsessive?

291
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:42,976
Me?

292
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:44,778
Wait.

293
00:14:51,251 --> 00:14:52,753
What is it again?

294
00:14:54,388 --> 00:14:55,656
It hurts, doesn't it?

295
00:14:55,656 --> 00:14:58,091
Of course, it does. You kicked my shin.

296
00:14:58,091 --> 00:15:00,427
- Why did she do that?
- I'm also hurting.

297
00:15:00,427 --> 00:15:02,763
Yesterday, I was adding subtitles
all night long...

298
00:15:02,763 --> 00:15:05,332
and I went to the bathroom half asleep...

299
00:15:05,332 --> 00:15:06,967
and hit my shin.

300
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:08,936
It also hurt so bad.

301
00:15:08,936 --> 00:15:12,272
So you wanted me to experience
the same thing?

302
00:15:12,272 --> 00:15:13,941
Did you tell me to come here to kick me?

303
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:15,709
Don't grab me by the collar.

304
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:19,746
That's right. Isn't this the best place
to kick people in the shin...

305
00:15:19,746 --> 00:15:21,548
without anyone knowing?

306
00:15:21,548 --> 00:15:23,750
I feel so much better now.

307
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,420
Is this the best place
to kick people in the shin?

308
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,521
Darn it.

309
00:15:33,494 --> 00:15:34,428
How about...

310
00:15:35,796 --> 00:15:37,798
- doing office romance with me?
- What?

311
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:41,134
No?

312
00:15:41,134 --> 00:15:45,005
What should we do after "TTC?"

313
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:46,773
I thought about that,

314
00:15:46,773 --> 00:15:49,009
and office romance seemed good.

315
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:50,577
He's talking about a new show.

316
00:15:50,577 --> 00:15:53,680
If men and women are in the same room,
they will definitely fall in love.

317
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,115
And if they break up,

318
00:15:55,115 --> 00:15:57,784
it will cause more harm than good,
so they will try to hide it.

319
00:15:57,784 --> 00:16:00,988
But they say even the printer
and the plants know who's dating who.

320
00:16:00,988 --> 00:16:03,290
So it's obvious
their colleagues also know.

321
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,560
So there will be people trying to hide it
and people trying to pretend not to know.

322
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,062
Interviewing them would be interesting.

323
00:16:09,062 --> 00:16:10,931
That's a good idea.

324
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:13,333
Seriously?

325
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:14,968
No way.

326
00:16:14,968 --> 00:16:17,738
I'm not doing my next show
with you again, PD Kang.

327
00:16:17,738 --> 00:16:19,006
Really?

328
00:16:19,006 --> 00:16:20,440
Okay, then.

329
00:16:22,142 --> 00:16:24,912
To be honest, I don't like you either,
Scriptwriter Wang.

330
00:16:25,913 --> 00:16:26,947
What?

331
00:16:29,383 --> 00:16:31,185
- Why not?
- Don't you know?

332
00:16:31,518 --> 00:16:34,288
You know how things are, but you're
always whining about too much work.

333
00:16:34,288 --> 00:16:35,823
Also, it was your fault you fell...

334
00:16:35,823 --> 00:16:38,091
but you called me all the way here
to kick me in the shin.

335
00:16:38,091 --> 00:16:40,761
Also, even though
we have to see each other every day...

336
00:16:41,295 --> 00:16:42,362
Every day?

337
00:16:42,362 --> 00:16:44,798
You're not my style at all.

338
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,501
That's why.

339
00:16:47,835 --> 00:16:50,737
That jerk. He was being too honest.

340
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:52,706
Is he out of his mind?
Shouldn't we go and stop him?

341
00:16:52,706 --> 00:16:54,541
Just keep your mouth shut.

342
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,677
You're not my style, either, PD Kang.

343
00:16:59,446 --> 00:17:01,114
You always ask me for a bite of my food,

344
00:17:01,114 --> 00:17:04,051
you're always making jokes,
and you're never serious about anything.

345
00:17:04,051 --> 00:17:07,221
Fine. Let's finish the current show
and part ways.

346
00:17:08,322 --> 00:17:10,357
Why finish the current show
and not part ways immediately?

347
00:17:12,493 --> 00:17:13,527
Because...

348
00:17:14,328 --> 00:17:16,463
it's Actor Ji's show.

349
00:17:16,463 --> 00:17:18,799
I can't do something
that will damage Actor Ji.

350
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,300
Fine, then.

351
00:17:20,868 --> 00:17:25,772
Let's just finish "TTC,"
the show of your favorite Actor Ji,

352
00:17:25,772 --> 00:17:28,275
and never see each other again.

353
00:17:29,576 --> 00:17:30,878
My goodness.

354
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:33,347
Fine.

355
00:17:34,882 --> 00:17:35,916
Darn it.

356
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:37,951
No.

357
00:17:37,951 --> 00:17:40,654
What if the editing goes sideways now?

358
00:17:40,654 --> 00:17:42,456
We can't let that happen
when we're close to three million.

359
00:17:42,456 --> 00:17:45,225
PD Cho, relax.

360
00:17:47,094 --> 00:17:49,863
Those two are professionals,

361
00:17:49,863 --> 00:17:51,665
so they're going to take care of this.

362
00:17:51,665 --> 00:17:56,036
We've failed here,
so let's go somewhere else.

363
00:17:56,036 --> 00:17:57,037
Let's go.

364
00:17:58,605 --> 00:17:59,606
You.

365
00:18:08,382 --> 00:18:10,017
Did you mean what you said earlier?

366
00:18:10,584 --> 00:18:11,552
What did I say?

367
00:18:14,054 --> 00:18:15,956
You said I'm not your style at all.

368
00:18:16,857 --> 00:18:20,060
Well, it's true you're not my style.

369
00:18:22,095 --> 00:18:25,332
I see.

370
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:27,501
But...

371
00:18:27,501 --> 00:18:29,169
since I always ask
for a bite of your food...

372
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:32,372
and always make jokes
and never seem serious,

373
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:34,074
I must not be your style, either.

374
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:37,578
Of course, you're not.

375
00:18:38,278 --> 00:18:39,580
Actually, you're not even close.

376
00:18:41,014 --> 00:18:43,550
You add subtitles while drooling
and showing your private feelings.

377
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,985
You're not even close to my style, either.

378
00:18:45,752 --> 00:18:48,155
Me? When?

379
00:18:48,155 --> 00:18:50,524
Your favorite actor, Actor Ji.

380
00:18:50,524 --> 00:18:52,626
When you added subtitles to the scene
where he was chopping firewood.

381
00:18:53,427 --> 00:18:54,761
I wasn't drooling.

382
00:18:54,761 --> 00:18:57,231
Okay, let's say you weren't.

383
00:18:59,433 --> 00:19:01,969
Were you always like this, PD Tae Ho?

384
00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:03,403
What am I like?

385
00:19:03,837 --> 00:19:05,973
Unlike your favorite actor, Actor Ji,

386
00:19:05,973 --> 00:19:07,774
always asking for a bite...

387
00:19:07,774 --> 00:19:11,211
of your food, making jokes,
and never serious?

388
00:19:11,211 --> 00:19:12,412
If that's what you mean, yes.

389
00:19:15,616 --> 00:19:17,618
Let's end it.

390
00:19:21,021 --> 00:19:23,557
You probably don't mean
to finish "TTC"...

391
00:19:23,557 --> 00:19:26,793
which is your favorite actor,
Actor Ji's show.

392
00:19:26,793 --> 00:19:31,165
So do you mean we should end
our Friends At Night relationship?

393
00:19:32,232 --> 00:19:33,333
Yes.

394
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,103
Let's end being Friends At Night.

395
00:19:38,472 --> 00:19:39,439
Fine.

396
00:19:40,007 --> 00:19:43,043
Starting today,
we're not Friends At Night anymore.

397
00:19:43,043 --> 00:19:44,878
Let's just do business only.

398
00:19:44,878 --> 00:19:46,280
Fine.

399
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,915
Let's just do business.

400
00:19:48,582 --> 00:19:49,883
My ears hurt.

401
00:20:05,632 --> 00:20:07,134
As you said, Ji Won,

402
00:20:07,134 --> 00:20:10,704
I hid in the stairs, on the rooftop,
and the empty meeting room.

403
00:20:10,704 --> 00:20:13,473
But I didn't see any couples,
let alone lovebugs.

404
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:14,908
Right.

405
00:20:14,908 --> 00:20:16,543
We saw Tae Ho and Scriptwriter Wang.

406
00:20:19,947 --> 00:20:21,448
Let's go with the last resort.

407
00:20:22,616 --> 00:20:23,650
The last resort?

408
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:27,054
The criminal always appears
on the scene of the crime again.

409
00:20:28,055 --> 00:20:30,491
Let's wait in the camper van.

410
00:20:30,491 --> 00:20:31,692
Camper van.

411
00:20:42,236 --> 00:20:43,103
Okay.

412
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:47,407
Mark, can we really use the camper van?

413
00:20:47,407 --> 00:20:48,375
Yes.

414
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,210
In Seong in charge of trivial work
gave us permission.

415
00:20:50,978 --> 00:20:53,647
In Seong?
Since when were you so close to him?

416
00:20:53,647 --> 00:20:54,581
Since today.

417
00:20:55,682 --> 00:20:57,985
But where are we going?

418
00:20:57,985 --> 00:20:59,086
It's a surprise.

419
00:20:59,653 --> 00:21:01,388
I love surprises.

420
00:21:01,388 --> 00:21:02,289
Should I wear a blindfold?

421
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:04,791
Or should I bang my head on the window
and faint...

422
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,161
so you can wake me up when we're there?

423
00:21:07,161 --> 00:21:09,096
That would be a surprise trip.

424
00:21:10,364 --> 00:21:12,633
But Mark.

425
00:21:12,633 --> 00:21:15,602
You know how to drive, right?

426
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,838
I got a Class D Driver's License recently.

427
00:21:17,838 --> 00:21:21,041
Lee Mark.

428
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:24,278
Then let's go on a trip in a camper van.

429
00:21:24,278 --> 00:21:25,712
Let's go.

430
00:21:26,713 --> 00:21:27,881
Let's go.

431
00:21:29,783 --> 00:21:32,553
- Just trust me.
- Let's go.

432
00:21:33,821 --> 00:21:34,922
You're good.

433
00:21:52,472 --> 00:21:53,907
What?

434
00:21:55,309 --> 00:21:56,643
The van is moving.

435
00:21:56,643 --> 00:21:58,445
They're here.

436
00:21:58,445 --> 00:22:00,447
You said the criminal appears
on the scene of the crime again.

437
00:22:00,447 --> 00:22:01,582
You were right.

438
00:22:01,582 --> 00:22:02,583
I told you.

439
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,084
Should I attack them this instant?

440
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:06,653
- Wait a minute.
- Why?

441
00:22:06,653 --> 00:22:09,823
We have to check who they are first.

442
00:22:09,823 --> 00:22:13,594
And we have to catch them red-handed.

443
00:22:13,594 --> 00:22:16,196
So we should wait and watch first.

444
00:22:16,196 --> 00:22:17,631
- Okay.
- Okay.

445
00:22:18,632 --> 00:22:20,400
They're caught now.

446
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,535
We have them.

447
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:26,607
We're here.

448
00:22:36,783 --> 00:22:39,019
There are so many stars.

449
00:22:39,786 --> 00:22:40,754
Isn't this great?

450
00:22:41,788 --> 00:22:44,658
Not long ago,
you said you wanted to see stars.

451
00:22:44,658 --> 00:22:46,393
Yes. I like it.

452
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:54,268
I want just one of all those stars
to be mine.

453
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:59,540
With that said, how about a song?

454
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,574
Let's go.

455
00:23:00,574 --> 00:23:01,608
That one.

456
00:23:01,608 --> 00:23:02,776
- That one?
- Yes.

457
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:10,984
<i>Let's go see the stars</i>

458
00:23:12,853 --> 00:23:18,325
<i>I'm in front of your house
so come out</i>

459
00:23:20,227 --> 00:23:24,431
<i>Just put on a light jacket</i>

460
00:23:24,431 --> 00:23:29,269
<i>And come out</i>

461
00:23:55,729 --> 00:24:00,634
<i>Let's go together</i>

462
00:24:00,634 --> 00:24:02,169
You've improved.

463
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:03,136
Thanks.

464
00:24:06,073 --> 00:24:07,708
There are so many stars.

465
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,245
I wonder what star that one is.

466
00:24:11,945 --> 00:24:13,447
That's the Big Dipper.

467
00:24:13,447 --> 00:24:14,748
Those two...

468
00:24:15,816 --> 00:24:20,721
don't seem to have done
what we think they did in the camper van.

469
00:24:22,422 --> 00:24:24,424
You're right.

470
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,828
Come on!

471
00:24:30,597 --> 00:24:32,633
What a starry night.

472
00:24:37,638 --> 00:24:39,206
- Joo Ha.
- Yes?

473
00:24:40,908 --> 00:24:41,842
What?

474
00:24:48,382 --> 00:24:49,316
I...

475
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,921
I like you.

476
00:25:04,832 --> 00:25:06,900
Hey, I also like you as a friend.

477
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,168
Not as a friend.

478
00:25:18,879 --> 00:25:21,315
I should've told you a long time ago.

479
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:23,450
But...

480
00:25:25,652 --> 00:25:26,787
I was scared.

481
00:25:31,725 --> 00:25:34,895
Sorry. I should've responded right away.

482
00:25:34,895 --> 00:25:36,530
- What movie was this line...
- Joo Ha.

483
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,999
Is it a drama or a webtoon?

484
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:42,002
I remember now. Hold on.

485
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,373
Mark.

486
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:51,144
I can't accept your feelings
at the moment.

487
00:25:51,144 --> 00:25:53,247
I don't even know what to say.

488
00:25:53,247 --> 00:25:56,283
Because...

489
00:25:57,551 --> 00:25:58,819
I'm getting married.

490
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:07,594
Is Ga Joo Ha getting married?

491
00:26:08,362 --> 00:26:09,463
That's the line...

492
00:26:10,297 --> 00:26:14,668
from the American high-teen
romance movie, "Love, Rosie."

493
00:26:15,569 --> 00:26:18,872
How could you not know that
when you manage a production company?

494
00:26:18,872 --> 00:26:22,543
Then are you saying
what she said just now is not true?

495
00:26:23,977 --> 00:26:28,215
Well, only Mark would know.

496
00:26:34,321 --> 00:26:35,189
I know.

497
00:26:35,923 --> 00:26:37,791
I don't want you to do anything.

498
00:26:38,659 --> 00:26:40,494
I just had to tell you the truth.

499
00:26:41,395 --> 00:26:43,197
I couldn't wait any longer.

500
00:26:48,569 --> 00:26:49,503
Mark.

501
00:26:50,103 --> 00:26:53,140
I'm so sorry, but this timing is...

502
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:53,974
I understand.

503
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:00,581
But I just want you to know, Joo Ha.

504
00:27:11,158 --> 00:27:16,129
Is that also a line from the movie?

505
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:18,232
Yes.

506
00:27:22,536 --> 00:27:26,840
Your acting in emotional scenes
has improved.

507
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,509
- You could even become an actor.
- Really?

508
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:31,078
- Should I be your manager?
- Okay.

509
00:27:32,212 --> 00:27:33,947
It's cold now. Should we go?

510
00:27:33,947 --> 00:27:36,550
Okay. I'll clear up everything.

511
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,684
No, I'll do it.

512
00:27:37,684 --> 00:27:40,087
- No, I'll do it.
- No, I'll do it.

513
00:27:41,288 --> 00:27:43,323
Poor Mark.

514
00:27:43,323 --> 00:27:45,826
I'm Ga Joo Ha. I can do this.

515
00:27:45,826 --> 00:27:46,793
Okay, then.

516
00:27:51,098 --> 00:27:52,132
CEO Cho.

517
00:27:53,634 --> 00:27:56,970
Let's quit tracking down
who's dating who at work.

518
00:27:58,172 --> 00:27:59,106
Why?

519
00:27:59,306 --> 00:28:02,543
KICKKICKKICKKICK is a production company.

520
00:28:02,543 --> 00:28:06,213
We need that kind
of a whirlpool of emotion...

521
00:28:06,213 --> 00:28:08,882
to get good content.

522
00:28:08,882 --> 00:28:10,250
What do you think?

523
00:28:16,023 --> 00:28:18,625
Whirlpool of emotion.

524
00:28:19,526 --> 00:28:20,427
Yes.

525
00:28:25,232 --> 00:28:26,233
What?

526
00:28:27,401 --> 00:28:30,137
PD Cho, catch it.

527
00:28:51,024 --> 00:28:52,326
What should I say?

528
00:28:58,098 --> 00:28:59,433
- Mark.
- Yes?

529
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:01,635
There were so many stars earlier.
Isn't that right?

530
00:29:01,635 --> 00:29:04,605
Yes, there were a bunch of stars.

531
00:29:04,605 --> 00:29:07,574
How did you find a place like that?

532
00:29:07,574 --> 00:29:09,843
I joined a star club,

533
00:29:09,843 --> 00:29:11,545
and they told me the places
to see the stars clearly.

534
00:29:12,646 --> 00:29:14,181
A star club. I see.

535
00:29:16,817 --> 00:29:18,085
What should I say?

536
00:29:19,186 --> 00:29:22,856
Mark, it's kind of boring.
How about listening to the radio?

537
00:29:22,856 --> 00:29:24,791
Good idea. Let's go.

538
00:29:24,791 --> 00:29:27,094
What should I play?
I'll just play anything.

539
00:29:27,094 --> 00:29:27,928
Okay.

540
00:29:27,928 --> 00:29:31,765
<i>My old friend</i>

541
00:29:31,765 --> 00:29:35,435
<i>I think I fell in love with you</i>

542
00:29:35,435 --> 00:29:36,870
Why is this kind of song playing?

543
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:37,804
No.

544
00:29:38,338 --> 00:29:39,773
I like this song.

545
00:29:41,341 --> 00:29:43,143
I see.

546
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:51,752
<i>Seeing you smile</i>

547
00:29:51,752 --> 00:29:57,057
<i>I was scared we might become awkward</i>

548
00:29:57,057 --> 00:30:02,029
<i>I couldn't say anything</i>

549
00:30:02,029 --> 00:30:08,602
<i>I just turned away with tears</i>

550
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,906
<i>I have to tell you</i>

551
00:30:12,906 --> 00:30:15,409
<i>But when I'm in front of you</i>

552
00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:18,045
<i>I can't say anything</i>

553
00:30:18,045 --> 00:30:20,547
<i>I hate myself</i>

554
00:30:20,547 --> 00:30:23,150
<i>I have to pluck up my courage</i>

555
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:26,420
<i>So there are no regrets</i>

556
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,490

You're here.

563
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,803
I'm so pleased you called me first.

564
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,573
Are you saying yes to me now?

565
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:19,744
What made you fall in love with me,
Yeo Woo Ran?

566
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:21,146
Well,

567
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,816
those romantic eyes
that make my heart flutter.

568
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:29,320
Those full lips
that make me want to kiss you.

Today, we'll do a mini-ball exercise...

571
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,768
to loosen the muscles in your whole body.

572
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:24,376
- This hurts.
- How do I loosen this part?

573
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:26,177
- Is it hard?
- Yes.

574
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:31,182
Then lie down
with the ball placed further up.

575
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,020
Yes? Yes.

576
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,556
Is that really true?

577
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:40,025
My goodness.

578
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:42,027
Please keep silent during class.

579
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:43,161
Sorry.

580
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,396
What is it, In Seong?

581
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:48,066
We just got a request
to create new YouTube content.

582
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,768
With a top star, no less.

583
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:51,903
- Top star who?
- Who is it?

584
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:52,804
Silence.

585
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:56,174
Can you please tell me
who the top star is?

586
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,142
Cha Eun Woo?

587
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,012
It's top secret,
so they will tell us at the meeting.

588
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,283
We'll give you a call soon. Thank you.

589
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:07,118
We should applaud.

590
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:08,987
Right,
because this is something to celebrate.

591
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:12,924
Hi. I mean, hello.

592
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:18,797
The subtitles at the end seem weak,
so I'm editing them.

593
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,532
Okay.

594
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,369
Scriptwriter Wang,
you haven't had lunch yet, right?

595
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,404
Do you want one? I bought two for one.

596
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:28,473
No, thanks.

597
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:31,476
I was about to order delivery food.

598
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:33,578
Whatever.

599
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:34,546
What should I order?

600
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,582
Spicy seafood noodle soup, black bean
sauce noodles, sweet and sour pork?

601
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,286
Let me see the subtitles.

602
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:42,954
(Your order has been completed.)

603
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:47,859
If there's no issue,
let's finish it like that.

604
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:49,828
Okay.

605
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:51,529
Enjoy your lunch.

606
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,904
My lunch is here.

607
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,086
This is good.

608
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:25,363
Is he still working?

609
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,666
It's tasty, though.

610
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:33,805
Scriptwriter Wang.

611
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,475
Sweet and sour pork and Dongpo pork.

612
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,613
But why are you eating alone?
Where's PD Tae Ho?

613
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:44,816
Why are you looking for PD Kang
when I'm eating lunch?

614
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,186
- Because you two always eat together.
- No, we don't.

615
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:49,988
You should have some.

616
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:51,222
Really?

617
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,324
Nice!

618
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:54,259
Thank you.

619
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,927
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

620
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:02,067
Scriptwriter Wang,
can I eat the Dongpo pork, too?

621
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,568
- Of course.
- Yes!

622
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:05,937
This was too much for me anyway.
Let's eat together.

623
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,405
Thank you.

624
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,941
This is so good.

625
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,712
You guys eat with relish like Kick.

626
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:18,783
Kick?

627
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,253
Kick?

628
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,189
I haven't seen Kick for some time.

629
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:25,590
I thought he was in the dog daycare.

630
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,194
Kick.

631
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:30,962
Kick.

632
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,031
Kick.

633
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:38,370
(Episode 8-2
Golden Time)

634
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,445
We've arrived at the meeting place.

635
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:49,447
We're having a meeting in a house?

636
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,049
Yes. The top star feels comfortable...

637
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:53,284
at home to stay away
from people's attention.

638
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,887
- A meeting at home.
- That's understandable.

639
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,189
The wind is so strong.

640
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:00,759
- Has anyone seen Kick?
- Kick?

641
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:03,395
I searched everywhere,
but I couldn't find Kick.

642
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:06,264
I closed the dog fence earlier
because it was open. What if...

643
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:07,098
What?

644
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,701
What if Kick went outside?

645
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:11,169
Did you check the surveillance camera?

646
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,904
- What is it?
- I got a message.

647
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:15,407
- Wait.
- What's going on?

648
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:17,375
This is an important meeting
to start making profit.

649
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,743
For a successful meeting,

650
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,345
let your Secretary No keep your phones
in the meantime.

651
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:21,179
What are you doing?

652
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,148
And something urgent came up,
so please excuse me for a while.

653
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:24,916
Where are you going?
Give us our phones before you go.

654
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:27,285
The meeting room is
in Unit 102 Number 2111.

655
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:29,988
- What are you doing?
- Give me my phone back.

656
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:31,723
In Seong, why lock...

657
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:33,725
No In Seong.

658
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:36,127
What on earth is happening right now?

659
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:38,296
That insane man.
Did you hear the meeting room number?

660
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:40,331
- Yes, I did.
- Okay.

661
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:43,902
Unit 102 Number 1000, no, 2110.

662
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:45,937
No, was it Unit 102 Number 2112?

663
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:46,871
You don't know?

664
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,406
I'm not sure.

665
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,208
Call him and ask him.

666
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:53,011
That brat stole our phones.

667
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:55,513
Right.

668
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:58,650
Wait. Unit 102...

669
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,119
Unit 102 Number 2110.

670
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,554
I'm sure it started with 211.

671
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,989
Yes, I'm sure it started with 211.

672
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:06,591
But you're not good
at memorizing your lines.

673
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:28,513
What should I do?

674
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:29,981
What happened to Kick?

675
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:33,118
This is my fault.
If only I didn't order delivery food...

676
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:35,086
Pull yourself together, Scriptwriter Wang.

677
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,154
We can find him.

678
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:38,990
I'm sure we can, and we will.

679
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,260
But to do so, you have
to pull yourself together as Kick's mom.

680
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,461
That is right.

681
00:37:45,397 --> 00:37:47,332
A dog hotel, dog daycare,
and a dog shelter.

682
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:50,235
I've worked part-time
in all three for two months each.

683
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:53,338
So I know exactly
the manual for finding a missing dog.

684
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:55,040
Really?

685
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,008
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

686
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,077
The time we have to find the missing dog,

687
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:01,146
in other words,
the golden time, is three hours.

688
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:03,748
- I've heard this somewhere, too.
- Me, too.

689
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:05,784
Our goal is to find Kick...

690
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,686
in three hours from now.

691
00:38:07,686 --> 00:38:09,254
To do so, we must stay alert...

692
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:11,790
and you must follow my instructions
with complete trust.

693
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,291
That's how we'll get Kick back
into his mom's arms...

694
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,161
and back to KICKKICKKICKKICK safely.

695
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:24,436
First, Scriptwriter Wang,

696
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:27,005
search the trail nearby...

697
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:28,773
that you used to walk Kick often.

698
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:32,343
Leave your clothes and Kick's clothes
on the streets.

699
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:34,045
Looking for him...

700
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:36,915
using his favorite noisy toy
will help a lot.

701
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,719
We'll communicate with this.

702
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,823
Scriptwriter Wang, you can go first.

703
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,858
I'll take Kick's toys and join you.

704
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:48,626
Okay.

705
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:52,097
Pull yourself together, okay?

706
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,331
Go.

707
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:55,734
- Okay.
- Hurry.

708
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:15,820
(We are desperately looking for a friend.
Name Kick)

709
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,956
(Golden time to find Kick
2 hours 40 minutes left)

710
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:20,825
Sorry.

711
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:22,360
It's not this one.

712
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,962
We have one room left now.

713
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:25,897
I hope this is the right one.

714
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:27,432
No In Seong, that crazy punk.

715
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:30,068
We knocked on all the rooms
on the 21st floor of Unit 102.

716
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:31,970
We're going to get complaints.

717
00:39:34,773 --> 00:39:36,508
- Ring the bell.
- You ring it.

718
00:39:36,508 --> 00:39:37,642
- Me?
- Yes.

719
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:46,751
What?

720
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:49,821
It opened.

721
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:57,328
The door opened.

722
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,363
Go inside.

723
00:39:59,798 --> 00:40:01,466
Excuse me.

724
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:02,434
Anybody there?

725
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:05,103
- I hope this is the right room.
- It is. They opened the door.

726
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:06,004
She's an actress.

727
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:08,139
Finding this room was hard.

728
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,974
- She's an actress.
- Yes.

729
00:40:13,812 --> 00:40:14,679
Hey.

730
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:19,551
- Hello.
- Hello.

731
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:23,154
We're the CEOs of KICKKICKKICKKICK.
I'm CEO Ji.

732
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,055
And I'm CEO Cho.

733
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:29,294
You guys are here.

734
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:35,367
Young Sik.

735
00:40:37,302 --> 00:40:38,203
Pull yourself together.

736
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:41,573
It's the first time we're seeing
each other since that day, isn't it?

737
00:40:44,376 --> 00:40:47,145
Have you two gotten older?

738
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:50,582
Look at me. I look the same, right?

739
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,250
What happened?

740
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:55,086
Good genes and a bit of care.

741
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:57,389
I'm not talking about your face.
What's going on?

742
00:40:57,389 --> 00:40:59,190
Didn't you hear about the YouTube offer?

743
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:03,762
Young Sik seems quite shocked.

744
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:06,097
Let's take a seat first.

745
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,808
Here.

746
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:21,846
As you might've seen in the news,
I got divorced.

747
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:29,120
So?

748
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:32,023
So I'm returning to show business.

749
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:34,392
As you and Young Sik know,

750
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:37,095
I was the icon
who influenced an entire era.

751
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:40,432
So I thought about
how to make my comeback,

752
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:42,167
and YouTube seemed perfect.

753
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:44,736
Don't be ridiculous.

754
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:49,441
Fine. This is my chance.

755
00:41:49,708 --> 00:41:51,576
Yeo Woo Ran, tell the truth.

756
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:52,577
About what?

757
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:54,345
Tell him that you and I never dated.

758
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,082
I heard you told Young Sik that we dated.

759
00:41:57,816 --> 00:41:58,883
Did I?

760
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:01,586
It's been such a long time,
so I don't remember clearly.

761
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:10,528
It seems both of you
still live in the past.

762
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:13,465
But I'm a future-oriented person.

763
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:17,035
We should name the channel
"Maison Yeo Woo Ran."

764
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:19,037
What do you think, Young Sik?

765
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:22,374
Seriously?

766
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:24,809
Are you nervous, Young Sik?

767
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:28,813
How cute.

768
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:37,789
Don't tell me you're still not over me.

769
00:42:39,824 --> 00:42:42,327
Young Sik, you're more of a romanticist
than I thought.

770
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:45,964
No. Don't touch his ear.

771
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:47,665
Don't touch him.

772
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:49,667
Why not? Are you Young Sik or what?

773
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,302
Just don't touch him. Also,

774
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:54,205
we respectfully decline
opening a YouTube channel together.

775
00:42:56,474 --> 00:42:57,675
Let's go, CEO Cho.

776
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:59,878
- Young Sik.
- I said don't touch him.

777
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:02,180
Get up.

778
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,088
Hey.

779
00:43:12,991 --> 00:43:14,959
Are you a fool?

780
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:16,161
Why can't you say anything?

781
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:18,963
She's acting so shamelessly,
why are you just staying silent?

782
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:22,534
How can I say anything?

783
00:43:22,534 --> 00:43:23,935
Why can't you?

784
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:25,837
You have a mouth. Can't you shout?

785
00:43:25,837 --> 00:43:27,605
Why can't you say
"Take your hands off me?"

786
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,741
Inside, I wanted to shout at her.

787
00:43:30,709 --> 00:43:31,643
But...

788
00:43:32,644 --> 00:43:33,611
But...

789
00:43:36,581 --> 00:43:38,249
she's Yeo Woo Ran.

790
00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:40,652
She's...

791
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:43,855
She's Yeo Woo Ran...

792
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,158
whom I still see in my dreams.

793
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:02,407
Let's go.

794
00:44:10,415 --> 00:44:11,282
(Golden time to find Kick
2 hours left)

795
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:12,150
Kick.

796
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:13,585
Kick.

797
00:44:15,186 --> 00:44:16,154
Please.

798
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:19,891
Kick.

799
00:44:21,426 --> 00:44:22,360
Kick.

800
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:26,564
(We are desperately looking for a friend.
Name Kick)

801
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:28,366
No, Kick.

802
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:30,702
My heart aches so much I'm going to die.

803
00:44:30,702 --> 00:44:34,572
I see, so don't forget to give this flyer
to every customer who comes here.

804
00:44:34,572 --> 00:44:36,007
- Okay?
- Okay.

805
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,709
We don't have much time.

806
00:44:40,578 --> 00:44:41,479
Kick.

807
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,082
I'm sticking flyers everywhere.
Has anyone found Kick?

808
00:44:44,816 --> 00:44:46,518
How many hours do we have?

809
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:47,452
Kick.

810
00:44:48,453 --> 00:44:49,287
Kick.

811
00:44:51,556 --> 00:44:53,525
Kick.

812
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:55,226
No.

813
00:44:58,863 --> 00:44:59,798
Kick.

814
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:06,938
It's cold,

815
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:11,042
so wear this and let's look for him again.

816
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:12,744
Okay?

817
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:15,447
Okay.

818
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:20,318
- Kick.
- Ma'am.

819
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:22,987
You can't stick flyers here. Take it back.

820
00:45:22,987 --> 00:45:25,056
We lost our dog.

821
00:45:35,867 --> 00:45:37,302
(We are desperately looking for a friend.
Name Kick)

822
00:45:37,302 --> 00:45:39,971
(Golden time to find Kick
1 hour 30 minutes left)

823
00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:49,347
I got a DM just now.

824
00:45:49,748 --> 00:45:52,951
Someone saw a dog that looked like Kick
wandering alone on Hanbang Trail.

825
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:54,052
Is this true?

826
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:56,354
(Hanbang-dong, Seoul)

827
00:45:56,354 --> 00:45:57,455
Can you hear me?

828
00:45:58,256 --> 00:45:59,224
- Yes.
- Yes, I can.

829
00:45:59,224 --> 00:46:01,459
We got a report.
Someone saw a dog that looked like Kick...

830
00:46:01,459 --> 00:46:03,828
wandering alone on Hanbang Trail.

831
00:46:04,696 --> 00:46:07,966
They called it "Kick,"
and the dog tilted its head.

832
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:11,403
Scriptwriter Wang is the closest,
so you should go first.

833
00:46:11,403 --> 00:46:12,937
The rest of you,

834
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:15,073
please try your best like you're doing now
and look for Kick where you are.

835
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:16,007
This is all.

836
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:17,409
- Got it.
- Okay.

837
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:18,643
I'll go there, too.

838
00:46:19,744 --> 00:46:22,013
Okay, I'll hurry and get there.

839
00:46:23,515 --> 00:46:24,449
Kick.

840
00:46:26,785 --> 00:46:28,386
Kick.

841
00:46:30,822 --> 00:46:31,656
Kick.

842
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:32,957
Kick.

843
00:46:34,492 --> 00:46:36,094
I'm sorry.

844
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:38,963
I'm glad you're safe.

845
00:46:39,898 --> 00:46:42,500
Kick, let's go home.

846
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:48,740
Kick.

847
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:53,378
(Keuk)

848
00:46:57,716 --> 00:46:59,851
Scriptwriter Wang, did you find Kick?

849
00:47:01,686 --> 00:47:02,620
No.

850
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:05,690
He wasn't Kick. He was Keuk.

851
00:47:09,794 --> 00:47:12,764
Scriptwriter Wang,
we still have a lot of time.

852
00:47:13,131 --> 00:47:14,399
We will find Kick.

853
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,336
I'll do everything I can to find him.

854
00:47:23,241 --> 00:47:25,710
But I'll call Keuk's owner first.

855
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:29,047
You should go and find Kick.

856
00:47:29,314 --> 00:47:31,149
He'll be desperately looking for his mom.

857
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,362
Okay. My Kick...

858
00:47:46,031 --> 00:47:48,166
will definitely come back to me.

859
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:52,570
Please take care of this dog.
I'll look for Kick.

860
00:47:53,104 --> 00:47:54,072
Kick.

861
00:47:54,773 --> 00:47:55,707
Kick.

862
00:48:00,612 --> 00:48:02,714
Unfortunately, the dog wasn't Kick.

863
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:05,417
Everyone,
please continue searching for Kick.

864
00:48:05,417 --> 00:48:06,651
- Darn it.
- Yes, sir.

865
00:48:06,651 --> 00:48:07,819
Yes, sir.

866
00:48:09,154 --> 00:48:10,155
Let's check again.

867
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:12,590
My goodness.

868
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:15,760
To get reports in real-time,

869
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,563
how about we go live on YouTube
about finding Kick?

870
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:19,631
Proceed with that immediately.

871
00:48:19,631 --> 00:48:20,598
Roger.

872
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:24,135
(Golden time to find Kick
50 minutes left)

873
00:48:45,557 --> 00:48:46,558
Drink up.

874
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:20,025
We've been getting lots of reports,

875
00:49:20,025 --> 00:49:21,826
but we still haven't found Kick.

876
00:49:21,826 --> 00:49:25,130
We have about 20 minutes left now
until the golden time ends.

877
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:27,232
Even the smallest report is appreciated.

878
00:49:27,232 --> 00:49:28,900
We'll keep the live going,

879
00:49:29,868 --> 00:49:30,869
so please help us.

880
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:36,674
I think I saw Kick just now
in the park behind Dubang Station.

881
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:39,144
He looks the same as the description.
Hurry and come here.

882
00:49:40,879 --> 00:49:42,180
Kick.

883
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,448
Can you hear me?

884
00:49:44,883 --> 00:49:46,384
- Yes, I can.
- Yes, I can.

885
00:49:46,384 --> 00:49:48,420
In the park behind Dubang Station,

886
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,189
someone spotted a dog
that looks like Kick.

887
00:49:51,189 --> 00:49:53,958
If he gets on the subway,
it'll be a big problem.

888
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:56,294
So go to the park as fast as you can.

889
00:49:56,294 --> 00:49:57,295
That is all.

890
00:49:57,295 --> 00:49:59,497
I have a scooter.

891
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:00,999
I'll be on my way.

892
00:50:09,741 --> 00:50:13,445
(Golden time to find Kick
10 minutes left)

893
00:50:16,181 --> 00:50:17,115
Kick.

894
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:29,027
Joo Ha.

895
00:50:29,728 --> 00:50:30,595
Are you okay?

896
00:50:31,563 --> 00:50:33,198
Shiba.

897
00:50:33,198 --> 00:50:34,532
You're hurt.
I'll take you to the hospital...

898
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:36,568
- No. We have to find Kick.
- I'll look for Kick, so you...

899
00:50:36,568 --> 00:50:39,704
We only have three minutes left now.

900
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:42,040
Move that somewhere else
and let's go to the park together.

901
00:50:42,874 --> 00:50:44,542
- But you're...
- Come on.

902
00:50:46,211 --> 00:50:47,178
Move that.

903
00:50:59,624 --> 00:51:01,459
Kick.

904
00:51:01,459 --> 00:51:03,194
Here.

905
00:51:03,194 --> 00:51:04,929
- Are you the dog's owner?
- Yes.

906
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:08,500
I bought a dog treat at a convenience
store and gave it to him first.

907
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,502
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

908
00:51:10,502 --> 00:51:12,037
- Kick.
- Joo Ha.

909
00:51:12,804 --> 00:51:14,639
We might surprise Kick.

910
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:17,308
So don't go too fast, take it slow,
and get down to his level.

911
00:51:18,076 --> 00:51:20,045
Not too fast, take it slow,

912
00:51:20,779 --> 00:51:22,213
down to his level.

913
00:51:25,016 --> 00:51:25,884
Kick.

914
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:28,119
Kick.

915
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:29,954
- Thank you.
- I'm here.

916
00:51:30,822 --> 00:51:31,756
Kick.

917
00:51:35,293 --> 00:51:36,194
Kick.

918
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:39,097
Kick.

919
00:51:40,699 --> 00:51:43,168
You doggie, where were you?

920
00:51:46,037 --> 00:51:48,573
We found Kick. He's with Joo Ha.

921
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:53,411
Kick.

922
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:55,814
- Scriptwriter Wang.
- Kick.

923
00:52:03,521 --> 00:52:05,223
PD Min Jae, good job.

924
00:52:05,924 --> 00:52:06,891
Kick.

925
00:52:11,229 --> 00:52:13,164
I'm so relieved.

926
00:52:14,399 --> 00:52:17,068
It's all my fault.

927
00:52:17,068 --> 00:52:19,738
I will never leave you all alone.

928
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:21,639
Kick.

929
00:52:30,382 --> 00:52:34,052
(Golden time to find Kick
Ended)

930
00:52:34,452 --> 00:52:35,687
Thanks.

931
00:52:39,858 --> 00:52:42,260
Thank you, Buddha.

932
00:52:42,961 --> 00:52:45,163
- Everything's okay now.
- Our little Kick.

933
00:52:45,163 --> 00:52:46,231
Scriptwriter Wang.

934
00:52:48,133 --> 00:52:49,100
Scriptwriter Wang.

935
00:52:51,636 --> 00:52:54,105
Wear these and let's go now.

936
00:52:57,809 --> 00:53:01,146
What about you, then, PD Tae Ho?

937
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,983
I have a thick skin
and I have thick socks on as well.

938
00:53:05,417 --> 00:53:06,317
So I'm fine.

939
00:53:16,394 --> 00:53:17,662
Thank you.

940
00:53:17,996 --> 00:53:21,399
Let's go, Kick.

941
00:53:22,434 --> 00:53:23,601
I'm fine.

942
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:26,037
- Joo Ha, come here for a second.
- What?

943
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:29,441
- You went through trouble.
- You, too.

944
00:53:29,441 --> 00:53:30,375
Sit down.

945
00:53:33,545 --> 00:53:34,913
This is nothing.

946
00:53:34,913 --> 00:53:35,947
- Joo Ha.
- Yes?

947
00:53:37,082 --> 00:53:38,750
- Sorry.
- What?

948
00:53:40,819 --> 00:53:43,121
Wait. It hurts so much.

949
00:53:49,127 --> 00:53:50,061
Are you okay?

950
00:53:50,762 --> 00:53:53,365
This cut is more serious than I thought.
I'll have to take her to the hospital.

951
00:53:53,365 --> 00:53:54,799
I'll take care of Joo Ha.

952
00:53:54,799 --> 00:53:57,602
So you can take care
of Scriptwriter Wang first, PD Tae Ho.

953
00:53:57,602 --> 00:53:59,037
You can go. I'm okay.

954
00:54:00,004 --> 00:54:00,939
Let's go.

955
00:54:01,373 --> 00:54:02,407
Thank you.

956
00:54:07,479 --> 00:54:09,681
I'll go back to the office, too.
Thank you, Min Jae.

957
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:11,649
- See you.
- Take your time.

958
00:54:11,649 --> 00:54:13,218
My goodness. That must hurt.

959
00:54:13,852 --> 00:54:15,120
- Joo Ha.
- Yes?

960
00:54:15,453 --> 00:54:16,988
- This will hurt.
- What?

961
00:54:17,889 --> 00:54:19,657
No, wait.

962
00:54:23,228 --> 00:54:24,095
Wait.

963
00:54:25,597 --> 00:54:26,765
It hurts.

964
00:54:28,066 --> 00:54:30,035
- Let's go to the hospital.
- What?

965
00:54:30,035 --> 00:54:31,069
We're going to the hospital.

966
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:33,204
No need to do that.

967
00:54:33,204 --> 00:54:35,073
Don't make me say it twice.
Get on my back.

968
00:54:35,707 --> 00:54:36,641
Come on.

969
00:54:45,016 --> 00:54:45,950
Let's go.

970
00:54:50,355 --> 00:54:51,956
Kick.

971
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:56,494
Thank you for staying safe.

972
00:54:56,494 --> 00:54:57,696
He's not hurt, is he?

973
00:54:57,696 --> 00:55:00,365
All of you went through trouble today.

974
00:55:00,365 --> 00:55:03,368
I'll make some tea for everyone
to rest your mind and body.

975
00:55:03,368 --> 00:55:04,769
Wait a minute.

976
00:55:05,804 --> 00:55:08,339
Thank you so much, everyone.

977
00:55:08,339 --> 00:55:09,708
We did what we had to do.

978
00:55:09,708 --> 00:55:10,709
Right.

979
00:55:10,709 --> 00:55:11,776
And...

980
00:55:13,845 --> 00:55:15,180
you, too, PD Kang.

981
00:55:17,515 --> 00:55:18,717
You're the one...

982
00:55:19,584 --> 00:55:21,486
who went through the biggest trouble.

983
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:33,398
Kick.

984
00:55:46,745 --> 00:55:47,879
So,

985
00:55:50,448 --> 00:55:53,084
you still see her in your dreams?

986
00:55:56,354 --> 00:55:58,556
I think it's time we talk about this.

987
00:55:59,858 --> 00:56:01,793
The story of what happened then
that we just stored up.

988
00:56:04,963 --> 00:56:09,067
At the time, because you didn't trust
my words, I was so...

989
00:56:09,067 --> 00:56:10,101
Let's store it up.

990
00:56:13,304 --> 00:56:15,173
- What?
- Let's just store it up.

991
00:56:16,374 --> 00:56:19,844
Like she said, it was ten years ago.

992
00:56:19,844 --> 00:56:23,281
Like a fool,
I couldn't forget about her for ten years.

993
00:56:23,281 --> 00:56:26,751
I'm such a fool. I'm an idiot.

994
00:56:26,751 --> 00:56:27,952
I'm a loser.

995
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:29,754
Young Sik.

996
00:56:30,321 --> 00:56:32,357
Yes, you're a fool, an idiot,

997
00:56:32,357 --> 00:56:33,792
- and a loser.
- Darn it.

998
00:56:33,792 --> 00:56:37,395
But if that wound is still there
and just festering...

999
00:56:37,395 --> 00:56:40,765
Then I'll drink heavily and pop it out.

1000
00:56:40,765 --> 00:56:41,900
You little...

1001
00:56:44,769 --> 00:56:47,706
Fine. Then let's drink
like a fish today...

1002
00:56:48,807 --> 00:56:50,475
and bury the past, okay?

1003
00:56:51,176 --> 00:56:52,043
Let's bury it.

1004
00:56:52,377 --> 00:56:54,145
Let's just bury it. Pour me a drink.

1005
00:56:56,448 --> 00:56:59,284
This much won't do.

1006
00:56:59,284 --> 00:57:01,753
Let's drink from this glass.
This will be easier.

1007
00:57:01,753 --> 00:57:02,587
Pour me a drink.

1008
00:57:03,988 --> 00:57:06,024
Chug down, okay?

1009
00:57:07,158 --> 00:57:08,760
- Chug down.
- Chug down.

1010
00:57:09,627 --> 00:57:11,162
- Bottoms up.
- You drink first.

1011
00:57:11,162 --> 00:57:12,197
- Let's bury it.
- Let's bury it.

1012
00:57:12,197 --> 00:57:14,165
- Let's just bury it.
- Yes, let's do that. Drink up.

1013
00:57:19,537 --> 00:57:21,439
You were badly hurt.

1014
00:57:28,346 --> 00:57:29,781
It's bitter.

1015
00:57:35,787 --> 00:57:38,790
You're a big drinker. Have another glass.

1016
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:40,291
I can't drink more.

1017
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:41,359
Seriously?

1018
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:43,928
I quit drinking for skincare.

1019
00:57:43,928 --> 00:57:46,398
Are you serious?

1020
00:57:46,398 --> 00:57:48,066
I'm an actor. I'm a star.

1021
00:57:48,066 --> 00:57:49,734
But you said we should bury it.

1022
00:57:49,734 --> 00:57:52,871
I'll take care of it myself.

1023
00:57:52,871 --> 00:57:54,372
And you're the one who should bury it.

1024
00:57:54,372 --> 00:57:55,507
So you drink.

1025
00:58:27,906 --> 00:58:28,973
No Choco.

1026
00:58:36,281 --> 00:58:37,749
Today, your big brother here...

1027
00:58:38,983 --> 00:58:41,119
did not miss the golden time.

1028
00:58:43,855 --> 00:58:47,359
So, Kick safely returned
to Scriptwriter Wang.

1029
00:58:52,397 --> 00:58:54,632
Your big brother did an important job.

1030
00:59:02,874 --> 00:59:05,744
But I'm sorry, Choco.

1031
00:59:07,946 --> 00:59:11,549
I couldn't find you in the golden time.

1032
00:59:20,258 --> 00:59:24,596
Why still smile at someone like me?
You're a complete fool.

1033
00:59:42,981 --> 00:59:46,184
It's been long,
so let's sleep together today.

1034
00:59:47,852 --> 00:59:49,254
I'll see you in my dream.

1035
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:56,695
I'll play fetch with you
until you get tired.

1036
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,136
(I miss you, Choco.)

1037
01:00:40,605 --> 01:00:42,874
(KICKKICKKICKKICK)

1038
01:00:42,874 --> 01:00:44,476
Who was that
to make you hang up like that?

1039
01:00:44,476 --> 01:00:45,543
Let's get back together.

1040
01:00:45,543 --> 01:00:46,378
I like someone else.

1041
01:00:46,378 --> 01:00:48,380
- I'm Min Jae's girlfriend.
- What?

1042
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,148
Joo Ha here would like
a double cheeseburger.

1043
01:00:50,148 --> 01:00:52,350
Love quarrel is the best genre, indeed.

1044
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:53,585
After retirement?

1045
01:00:53,585 --> 01:00:55,754
It's like Hollywood in South Korea.

1046
01:00:55,754 --> 01:00:57,956
It's time you tell the truth.

1047
01:00:57,956 --> 01:00:59,758
I like men who are innocent like children.

1048
01:00:59,758 --> 01:01:01,659
CEO Cho gradually got ruined.

1049
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,895
Emergency news,
Yeo Woo Ran is doing a live broadcast.

1050
01:01:03,895 --> 01:01:05,030
This is false information.

1051
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:06,264
We need proof.

1052
01:01:06,264 --> 01:01:07,332
We should confront her.

1053
01:01:07,332 --> 01:01:09,801
We plan to reveal it honestly.

1054
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:14,703
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
