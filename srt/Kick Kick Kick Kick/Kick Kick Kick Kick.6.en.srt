1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,141
(All characters, organizations,)

2
00:00:01,141 --> 00:00:02,576
(and events in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:02,576 --> 00:00:03,977
(Broadcasting guidelines were followed
during the shooting of animals.)

4
00:00:04,545 --> 00:00:07,314
I'm leaving work now
and it takes 15 minutes to get home.

5
00:00:07,314 --> 00:00:09,449
So I'd like a fried chicken,

6
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:12,386
one Coke Zero,
pickled radishes, and...

7
00:00:19,293 --> 00:00:21,428
Ms. Baek Ji Won?

8
00:00:22,462 --> 00:00:24,464
Ji Won, why did you kidnap me
for no reason?

9
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:27,801
I cannot wait any longer.

10
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,339
If you give me
that Become Good-Looking Oil,

11
00:00:32,339 --> 00:00:35,709
I'll proceed
with your Jasmine solo content.

12
00:00:39,813 --> 00:00:42,516
Please wait a bit longer.

13
00:00:44,852 --> 00:00:46,386
I've waited long enough.

14
00:00:47,054 --> 00:00:50,324
This was not what you promised.

15
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,062
All right. I will give you a response
by tomorrow, no matter what.

16
00:00:57,097 --> 00:00:57,898
Tomorrow?

17
00:00:58,999 --> 00:00:59,900
Are you sure?

18
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:03,570
Yes. Please trust me.

19
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,404
Okay.

20
00:01:14,648 --> 00:01:15,682
- Mouth.
- Mouth.

21
00:01:17,184 --> 00:01:18,685
- No.
- Mouth.

22
00:01:21,188 --> 00:01:25,159
(Hanbang Building)

23
00:01:26,593 --> 00:01:28,795
(Episode 6)

24
00:01:29,396 --> 00:01:30,898
Door closing.

25
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:34,802
Nice save today as always.

26
00:01:35,602 --> 00:01:36,770
Hi, Shiba.

27
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:39,339
Door closing.

28
00:01:40,107 --> 00:01:41,008
Yes.

29
00:01:46,146 --> 00:01:47,381
Why does this keep happening?

30
00:01:49,449 --> 00:01:51,118
Excuse me? What was that?

31
00:01:51,552 --> 00:01:52,452
What was what?

32
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,188
Why? What?

33
00:01:54,188 --> 00:01:56,690
I thought you said something just now.

34
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,693
No, I didn't say anything.

35
00:01:59,693 --> 00:02:01,895
I see.

36
00:02:01,895 --> 00:02:02,763
Okay.

37
00:02:03,997 --> 00:02:05,299
Do I have to pick my ears?

38
00:02:08,335 --> 00:02:09,736
I'm going to drink coffee.

39
00:02:22,282 --> 00:02:24,318
The Silver Play Button...

40
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:26,720
from Pennsylvania has just arrived.

41
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,789
Already?

42
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:29,957
Wait.

43
00:02:29,957 --> 00:02:32,226
The Gold Play Button also arrived today.

44
00:02:32,226 --> 00:02:34,228
Let me see. The Gold Play Button.

45
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:37,464
Look. I'm Ji Jin Hee.

46
00:02:37,464 --> 00:02:38,565
You're Ji Jin Hee.

47
00:02:39,466 --> 00:02:40,667
The Gold Play Button.

48
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:45,439
Are you crazy?
How dare you drop our Goldie!

49
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,741
You have to stay alert.
You must not drop this.

50
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:48,675
Be gentle.

51
00:02:48,675 --> 00:02:51,845
Sorry. I was too excited
and my grip got loose.

52
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:54,548
But what's wrong with your voice and all?
Do you have a cold?

53
00:02:54,548 --> 00:02:57,017
A cold? You have a cold?

54
00:02:57,017 --> 00:02:58,852
Would you like a nice
and warm cilantro tea?

55
00:02:58,852 --> 00:03:01,755
No, thanks. I'll go to the hospital later.

56
00:03:01,755 --> 00:03:04,091
Thank you, Scriptwriter Ga.

57
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:07,127
PD Cho, be careful not to catch a cold.

58
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:11,365
Let's start the meeting.

59
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:12,399
Okay.

60
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:13,634
Is there a mask?

61
00:03:16,203 --> 00:03:20,607
(Episode 6-1
The Reason My Heart is Fluttering.)

62
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:27,314
Scriptwriter Wang and I will investigate on-site
tomorrow for 'TTC' Episode Three.

63
00:03:27,714 --> 00:03:31,718
You said the concept was
detox camping, right?

64
00:03:31,718 --> 00:03:32,686
Yes.

65
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:36,323
It's a camping to get away from stress
caused by smartphones and social media.

66
00:03:36,323 --> 00:03:37,958
That's a good idea.

67
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,360
There's something I have to...

68
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,663
How are things going
with the Kickickickick song?

69
00:03:42,663 --> 00:03:44,331
We have a date to start recording.

70
00:03:44,331 --> 00:03:46,934
KICKKICKKICKKICK Song coming soon.

71
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:48,402
Stay tuned.

72
00:03:49,303 --> 00:03:50,771
There's something I have to say to...

73
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:52,639
This is the end of the meeting.

74
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,042
Everyone can get on with their work now.
Good luck.

75
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:56,810
- Okay.
- Thank you.

76
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,980
- Good job, everyone.
- Good job.

77
00:04:09,857 --> 00:04:12,960
Honey, fan properly.

78
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,061
Seriously.

79
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:15,796
I'm doing my best.

80
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:17,431
Is it because I lack energy now?

81
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:19,766
It would be great
if someone gave me some herbal medicine.

82
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:22,569
You're talking
like you have a bunch of money.

83
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:23,537
This is strange.

84
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:26,073
This is strange, indeed.

85
00:04:27,774 --> 00:04:30,310
Mr. Neighbour!

86
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,311
Hi.

87
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:35,883
Can you come and help fan this?

88
00:04:37,317 --> 00:04:38,152
No?

89
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,728
It seems his heart hurts.

90
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:48,929
It seems so.

91
00:04:48,929 --> 00:04:50,697
Cilantro tea is the best for the heart.

92
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,065
Isn't it?

93
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:54,701
How did it go?

94
00:04:57,237 --> 00:05:00,908
When will Jasmine's content be created?

95
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:02,609
Actually...

96
00:05:02,609 --> 00:05:03,877
Actually what?

97
00:05:03,877 --> 00:05:06,947
Don't slur your words and be coherent.

98
00:05:07,948 --> 00:05:10,551
Actually, CEO Cho said...

99
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:13,053
he'll think about it some more.

100
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:14,054
That's what he said.

101
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:18,058
You said you were influential
in KICKKICKKICKKICK, No In Seong.

102
00:05:18,058 --> 00:05:20,494
Didn't you promise me that if I gave you
the Become Good-Looking Oil,

103
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:24,431
then you'd proceed
with Jasmin's solo content?

104
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:27,801
Well, actually,

105
00:05:27,801 --> 00:05:28,769
that's...

106
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:31,405
Give me back the Become Good-Looking Oil.

107
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:34,608
But I used it up already.

108
00:05:34,608 --> 00:05:36,543
What? No way.

109
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,413
That doesn't make sense.

110
00:05:39,413 --> 00:05:41,515
If you used a whole bottle
of the Become Good-Looking Oil,

111
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:44,251
you can't look like this. No way.

112
00:05:44,251 --> 00:05:45,752
Can you? No, right?

113
00:05:45,752 --> 00:05:48,121
Miss Jasmine.

114
00:05:48,121 --> 00:05:51,191
Please calm down and listen to me.

115
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:53,460
During the general meeting today,

116
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,763
the topic of your solo content
was brought up.

117
00:05:56,763 --> 00:06:00,000
It seems they're thinking
about the direction of it.

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,802
You know he's a popular PD.

119
00:06:01,802 --> 00:06:03,971
He must be sensitive
with so much on his mind.

120
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:20,654
I'm so scared.

121
00:06:21,955 --> 00:06:24,892
My heart is about to burst.

122
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:26,059
I'm so scared.

123
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,564
This is strange.

124
00:06:32,132 --> 00:06:33,433
Everything's strange in here.

125
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:37,404
Mom, I'm scared.

126
00:06:39,706 --> 00:06:40,607
Yes?

127
00:06:41,408 --> 00:06:43,343
It's you.

128
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,746
Go down there.

129
00:06:45,746 --> 00:06:48,048
I won't get a massage today.

130
00:06:48,982 --> 00:06:49,850
Why not?

131
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,853
To be honest,
I hate it when others touch me.

132
00:06:54,087 --> 00:06:55,255
Then will you get a consultation today?

133
00:06:55,823 --> 00:06:56,557
Yes.

134
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,692
Okay, then. Have a seat here.

135
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:03,397
Would you like some tea?

136
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:05,532
Okay.

137
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,236
This is herb tea that's good
for relaxing the mind and body.

138
00:07:16,076 --> 00:07:18,512
You can tell me.

139
00:07:26,353 --> 00:07:27,454
Last time,

140
00:07:28,188 --> 00:07:31,458
you said my heart hurting
was a temporary phenomenon.

141
00:07:31,725 --> 00:07:35,662
Yes, I said it could be
a temporary phenomenon.

142
00:07:36,597 --> 00:07:40,567
Why? Does your heart still hurt
and keep pounding?

143
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:41,201
Yes.

144
00:07:42,102 --> 00:07:43,871
Quite often.

145
00:07:46,673 --> 00:07:47,608
Does it go...

146
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:52,679
"ba ba bump?"

147
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:57,017
Or does it go "ba bump?"

148
00:07:57,584 --> 00:08:00,387
Or does it go "ba bump bump?"

149
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,424
Hold on.

150
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:14,835
Bump bump bump, ba ba ba bump,
ba ba ba bump.

151
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:16,870
Bump bump bump.

152
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,007
I think it goes like that.

153
00:08:20,007 --> 00:08:21,742
That rhythm.

154
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:25,846
I think you're in love.

155
00:08:25,846 --> 00:08:26,747
What?

156
00:08:27,714 --> 00:08:29,316
No.

157
00:08:30,117 --> 00:08:32,085
I hate things like that.
Things like love.

158
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:35,956
Of course, when you meet someone you hate
or think about them,

159
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:38,692
your heart may beat faster.

160
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:41,261
It's part of a stress reaction.

161
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:43,630
The body prepares to fight or run away.

162
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,667
It's a reaction of struggle or escape.

163
00:08:47,968 --> 00:08:48,969
No wonder.

164
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:51,538
I'm relieved.

165
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:55,909
Is there a solution for this?

166
00:08:57,044 --> 00:08:57,878
Face it.

167
00:08:58,946 --> 00:08:59,780
Face it?

168
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,517
If you're in an inevitable situation...

169
00:09:03,517 --> 00:09:05,886
where you have to be
in the same place and time...

170
00:09:05,886 --> 00:09:07,821
- with the person you hate,
- Yes.

171
00:09:07,821 --> 00:09:12,025
it's important
to properly face the problem.

172
00:09:12,025 --> 00:09:13,927
You have to get used to it.

173
00:09:13,927 --> 00:09:15,963
- Get used to it.
- One more thing.

174
00:09:15,963 --> 00:09:19,399
Trying to find the person's virtue is...

175
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,734
also a good way.

176
00:09:23,937 --> 00:09:24,872
Virtue.

177
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,541
Then...

178
00:09:32,713 --> 00:09:33,680
Thank you.

179
00:09:34,181 --> 00:09:36,750
I think I can solve this.

180
00:09:37,151 --> 00:09:38,418
- Thank you.
- Really?

181
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:41,588
And thank you for the tea.

182
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,526
Face it.

183
00:09:45,526 --> 00:09:46,660
Face it. Okay.

184
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,095
- Virtue.
- Virtue.

185
00:09:48,095 --> 00:09:49,029
Excuse me.

186
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:54,434
During the general meeting today,

187
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:57,704
did anyone bring up the topic
about Jasmine's content?

188
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:04,077
No. I haven't heard anything about that.

189
00:10:05,746 --> 00:10:07,648
I see. Okay.

190
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,450
Virtue.

191
00:10:10,851 --> 00:10:12,352
- Face it.
- Face it.

192
00:10:12,352 --> 00:10:13,253
Thank you.

193
00:10:18,926 --> 00:10:19,927
Look at you.

194
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,198
No In Seong, you come right here.

195
00:10:24,198 --> 00:10:25,599
Come here again.

196
00:10:29,102 --> 00:10:30,170
It's hot.

197
00:10:31,872 --> 00:10:33,240
Every day...

198
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,441
Why is this stuck?

199
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:37,110
Seriously.

200
00:10:43,016 --> 00:10:44,051
Yes, Ms. Baek Ji Won?

201
00:10:44,618 --> 00:10:46,220
No In Seong.

202
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,589
During the general meeting today,

203
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:52,292
I heard that nothing about my content
was brought up.

204
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:53,894
Can you explain this?

205
00:10:53,894 --> 00:10:56,029
Who said that?

206
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:57,831
That's not the point.

207
00:10:57,831 --> 00:10:59,666
Was it brought up or not?

208
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,401
Actually...

209
00:11:01,401 --> 00:11:04,738
Lying will cause bigger trouble.

210
00:11:04,738 --> 00:11:06,373
I'll be honest. Listen to me.

211
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:09,042
I had a talk alone with CEO Cho.

212
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:10,110
Are you sure?

213
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,211
Yes, of course.

214
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:14,915
Okay.

215
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:19,386
Then I'll check with CEO Cho myself.

216
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:25,025
What should I do?

217
00:11:26,293 --> 00:11:28,195
Think.

218
00:11:28,996 --> 00:11:31,532
CEO Cho.

219
00:11:31,532 --> 00:11:32,633
You scared me. What is it?

220
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:34,935
I have to urgently call someone
but my phone died.

221
00:11:34,935 --> 00:11:36,270
So I need your phone, CEO Cho.

222
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,105
- What?
- Yes, this is it. Thank you.

223
00:11:38,105 --> 00:11:39,173
- What...
- You're sick, aren't you?

224
00:11:39,173 --> 00:11:40,674
What are you doing?

225
00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:42,309
Keep being sick.

226
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:43,677
- You're insane.
- Bye.

227
00:11:43,677 --> 00:11:46,313
(CEO Cho)

228
00:11:56,023 --> 00:11:57,891
(Baek Ji Won)

229
00:11:58,659 --> 00:11:59,726
Yes, this is PD Cho.

230
00:12:02,996 --> 00:12:03,897
CEO Cho?

231
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:07,100
What's wrong with your voice, CEO Cho?

232
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:10,337
I have severe flu.

233
00:12:10,337 --> 00:12:12,539
This virus spread all over my body
in an instant...

234
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:15,776
so I lost my voice.

235
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:19,046
Then I'll go and talk to you in person.

236
00:12:19,046 --> 00:12:21,048
I'm losing connection so...

237
00:12:21,048 --> 00:12:22,883
No In Seong!

238
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,419
- Where are you, No In Seong?
- No In Seong?

239
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:29,556
No In Seong, where did this brat go?

240
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,761
My Samsong Limited Edition.

241
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:40,067
(Editing Room)

242
00:12:46,273 --> 00:12:48,075
Shiba, what are you doing?

243
00:12:49,276 --> 00:12:50,811
I was working on something.

244
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,379
I see.

245
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:57,017
Shiba, what do you think
about free hot pot?

246
00:12:57,017 --> 00:12:58,986
It's free only until today.

247
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,420
I was going to eat with Mark,

248
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,290
but this jerk suddenly called it off.

249
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:06,426
So I want to give
this great opportunity...

250
00:13:06,426 --> 00:13:08,929
to you, Shiba. What do you think?

251
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:15,769
I have to keep working here.
I have to try.

252
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:17,805
Nobody only has flaws.

253
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:20,374
Face it. Virtue. Let's go.

254
00:13:23,944 --> 00:13:24,878
Let's go.

255
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,756
CEO Cho, why is your face wrapped
in bandages?

256
00:13:35,756 --> 00:13:37,891
Cold.

257
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:39,126
Poor you.

258
00:13:39,126 --> 00:13:41,328
I'm fine.

259
00:13:41,328 --> 00:13:43,363
Your solo content has been approved.

260
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,267
Really?

261
00:13:49,403 --> 00:13:51,338
Then I'll leave this here and...

262
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:53,173
Okay.

263
00:13:53,173 --> 00:13:54,942
Don't strain your throat too much.

264
00:13:54,942 --> 00:13:56,910
Take a rest. Okay.

265
00:14:01,348 --> 00:14:03,851
It's hot.

266
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:09,923
I hope she doesn't come here again.

267
00:14:09,923 --> 00:14:11,191
I can't believe this just happened.

268
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:16,230
Boil.

269
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,965
Do you come here often?

270
00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:18,665
Yes.

271
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:22,803
Here's your cilantro.

272
00:14:22,803 --> 00:14:24,705
Please leave the cilantro here.

273
00:14:24,705 --> 00:14:25,806
He's a cilantro hater, that's why.

274
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,875
- She remembers that?
- Thank you.

275
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,009
I hope you enjoy.

276
00:14:31,512 --> 00:14:32,513
This amazing smell of cilantro.

277
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,214
She's actually scrupulous.

278
00:14:34,214 --> 00:14:36,283
Do you want me to roll meat?

279
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:37,851
I'm really good at that.

280
00:14:37,851 --> 00:14:40,320
Is she always considerate of others?
Is this her virtue?

281
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,555
I'm good at rolling meat, so watch me.

282
00:14:42,322 --> 00:14:43,290
Ready.

283
00:14:48,562 --> 00:14:49,696
I'm sorry.

284
00:14:49,696 --> 00:14:53,367
But that stuck to your face perfectly.

285
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:56,804
It's like you're wearing
a meat facial mask.

286
00:14:58,138 --> 00:14:59,373
Sorry.

287
00:15:00,407 --> 00:15:02,509
No, I did not find her virtue.

288
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:03,877
Do you want an oil-control film?

289
00:15:03,877 --> 00:15:05,546
She's definitely not normal.

290
00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:06,580
I'm fine.

291
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:10,484
It's hot.

292
00:15:10,484 --> 00:15:12,920
This is today's free ingredient,
a whole squid.

293
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,188
A whole squid?

294
00:15:14,188 --> 00:15:15,422
I'll cut it for you.

295
00:15:15,422 --> 00:15:17,057
Okay, thank you.

296
00:15:23,497 --> 00:15:24,565
My goodness.

297
00:15:25,332 --> 00:15:27,768
- I'm so sorry.
- Can I open my eyes?

298
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,872
- Can I open my eyes?
- My goodness.

299
00:15:31,872 --> 00:15:33,373
Why won't this come off?

300
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:36,109
No.

301
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:38,545
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

302
00:15:38,545 --> 00:15:41,482
A squid with no ink is
all sizzle and no steak.

303
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,549
I'm fine.

304
00:15:48,522 --> 00:15:49,490
CEO Cho.

305
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,390
- Yes?
- Yes?

306
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,191
What?

307
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:52,993
Who are you?

308
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,461
I'm obviously CEO Cho.

309
00:15:54,461 --> 00:15:57,598
Who are you? Why are you impersonating me?

310
00:15:57,598 --> 00:15:59,299
I'm not. Who are you?

311
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:00,734
I'm CEO Cho.

312
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,294
Open your eyes.

313
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:34,034
So, that insane guy,

314
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,736
I mean, No In Seong,

315
00:16:35,736 --> 00:16:38,806
promised to make content
on your name, and...

316
00:16:38,806 --> 00:16:40,507
And took the Become Good-Looking Oil...

317
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:43,043
that money cannot buy.

318
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:43,811
That...

319
00:16:43,811 --> 00:16:46,079
I have a very brilliant idea
for this content.

320
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,948
- Do you want to hear about it?
- Shut up.

321
00:16:47,948 --> 00:16:49,850
If you lower your arms,
you'll have to stay ten more minutes.

322
00:16:51,118 --> 00:16:52,653
You said to go for it first, didn't you?

323
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:53,587
What?

324
00:16:53,587 --> 00:16:56,557
Our goal is three million subscribers.

325
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,825
So if something unexpectedly succeeds,
we'll be lucky.

326
00:16:57,825 --> 00:17:00,060
So let's upload it first,
and if nobody's that interested,

327
00:17:00,494 --> 00:17:01,595
we could just cancel it.

328
00:17:01,595 --> 00:17:04,531
That's right.
As I said, I have a very brilliant idea.

329
00:17:04,531 --> 00:17:05,933
I'll risk my life to help you out.

330
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:08,268
So please, give me a chance.

331
00:17:16,276 --> 00:17:19,279
Darn it.

332
00:17:20,647 --> 00:17:21,748
I hope you enjoy.

333
00:17:21,748 --> 00:17:22,749
Thank you.

334
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:27,654
Getting ink on my face and getting a free
tanghulu coupon from the store next.

335
00:17:27,654 --> 00:17:29,490
I'm lucky Joo Ha.

336
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,624
Here.

337
00:17:30,624 --> 00:17:32,893
I hate tanghulu.

338
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:34,661
Really? Then I'll have two tanghulus.

339
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:38,966
This is kind of ugly,
so I'll eat one by one.

340
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:49,943
Look here.

341
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,011
What are you doing?

342
00:17:51,011 --> 00:17:55,048
My gold tooth came off.

343
00:17:55,048 --> 00:17:58,952
Then this is a golden tanghulu.

344
00:17:59,987 --> 00:18:01,755
The price of gold is totally rising
these days.

345
00:18:01,755 --> 00:18:04,391
I'm lucky. I'll post this
on a secondhand market and sell it.

346
00:18:04,391 --> 00:18:05,893
Joo Ha, are you okay?

347
00:18:05,893 --> 00:18:07,761
Yes. Has your gold tooth
never come off before?

348
00:18:10,731 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm lucky Joo Ha.

349
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,869
I ate hot pot for free, tanghulu for free,

350
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:17,171
my gold tooth came off
while eating tanghulu...

351
00:18:17,171 --> 00:18:21,809
and I got a coupon to take a picture
in the Hanbang Photo Studio next door.

352
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,510
I'm lucky, lucky Joo Ha.

353
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,345
Isn't this exciting, Min Jae?

354
00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:26,246
Not at all.

355
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,652
Are you okay, Shiba?

356
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,220
Yes, I am.

357
00:18:33,887 --> 00:18:35,389
I'm relieved.

358
00:18:36,223 --> 00:18:37,891
Your face almost got crushed.

359
00:18:37,891 --> 00:18:39,159
You're lucky Shiba.

360
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:39,893
Sorry.

361
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:42,229
You shouldn't play baseball here.

362
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:45,299
There's a vacant lot by the intersection.
Play baseball there.

363
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:51,205
Shiba, are you okay?

364
00:18:52,473 --> 00:18:55,075
There's the Hanbang Photo Studio.
Let's go.

365
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:56,243
I really hate Hanbang Photo...

366
00:19:04,384 --> 00:19:05,252
Wait for me.

367
00:19:06,487 --> 00:19:07,921
What else should I choose?

368
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,257
A devil.

369
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,593
PD Min Jae.

370
00:19:12,593 --> 00:19:13,460
Number one.

371
00:19:16,797 --> 00:19:18,131
And number two. Which one's better?

372
00:19:18,131 --> 00:19:19,299
Both look bad.

373
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:20,934
Don't say that.

374
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:26,874
My face...

375
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,910
Why didn't you tell me
my face was painted with ink?

376
00:19:30,644 --> 00:19:33,013
I thought you knew.
It seemed you were enjoying it.

377
00:19:33,847 --> 00:19:36,250
Yes, I was enjoying it,

378
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,985
but it's not enjoyable
when you're trying to take pictures.

379
00:19:39,186 --> 00:19:40,521
But this is actually kind of funny.

380
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,924
I'll wash my face and come back,
so save that booth in the far end.

381
00:19:43,924 --> 00:19:45,692
I really hate saving spots.

382
00:19:45,692 --> 00:19:48,362
I really hate not saving spots, so do it.

383
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:49,563
Where are you going?

384
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,497
To wash.

385
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,215
Like this...

386
00:20:12,553 --> 00:20:14,655
What am I doing?

387
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,850
Shiba, did you save a spot?

388
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,754
Which one is it? This one?

389
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:51,925
Come inside.

390
00:20:51,925 --> 00:20:53,260
Come on.

391
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:57,464
I look better with my hair tied,
but there's no hairband.

392
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,365
They're there.

393
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:02,069
- Thanks. Hold on.
- Okay.

394
00:21:23,357 --> 00:21:24,224
How do I look?

395
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,828
How do I look?

396
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,431
Okay.

397
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:33,267
Then, let's get our picture taken.

398
00:21:38,806 --> 00:21:39,773
The remote.

399
00:21:41,275 --> 00:21:42,109
Okay.

400
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,979
One, two, three.

401
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:49,016
You're so out of style.
Haven't you tried this before?

402
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,284
Follow me.

403
00:21:50,284 --> 00:21:51,318
Cup your face.

404
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:52,953
Cup your face.

405
00:22:17,277 --> 00:22:19,947
The harmony of yoga and cycling.

406
00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:23,784
Jasmine's Yoga-cling.

407
00:22:24,351 --> 00:22:26,153
Let's cycle hard.

408
00:22:26,153 --> 00:22:27,921
Everyone, cycle.

409
00:22:27,921 --> 00:22:29,289
Follow me.

410
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:32,693
Cycle like you're a racehorse.
Clip-clop.

411
00:22:32,693 --> 00:22:33,827
No In Seong...

412
00:22:33,827 --> 00:22:35,095
Cycle.

413
00:22:35,629 --> 00:22:36,830
Young man.

414
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,532
Keep cycling.

415
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:40,267
Don't stop, guys.

416
00:22:40,267 --> 00:22:41,935
(This is performance art.)

417
00:22:41,935 --> 00:22:43,704
(I'm unsubscribing.
Get rid of that dirty gray top.)

418
00:22:43,704 --> 00:22:45,005
(Is that a stream of armpit sweat?)

419
00:22:45,672 --> 00:22:48,976
(Number of subscribers -20,000)

420
00:22:50,644 --> 00:22:51,545
How could...

421
00:22:52,646 --> 00:22:55,816
we lose 20,000 subscribers...

422
00:22:55,816 --> 00:22:57,251
in just two hours?

423
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:01,021
Twenty thousand? Just like that?

424
00:23:02,856 --> 00:23:04,191
Exactly.

425
00:23:04,191 --> 00:23:07,594
This was all No In Seong's idea.

426
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,097
So I want to proceed with my idea now.

427
00:23:10,664 --> 00:23:11,832
What's your idea?

428
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,334
I'll think about it from now.

429
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:19,807
Get out.

430
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:21,675
Get out.

431
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,545
Twenty thousand...

432
00:23:24,545 --> 00:23:26,613
- Smile.
- Smile...

433
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:31,485
(Hanbang Building rooftop)

434
00:23:31,485 --> 00:23:33,787
(All members
of KICKKICKKICKKICK must participate.)

435
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,089
(If you work in the Hanbang Building,
you're qualified.)

436
00:23:56,076 --> 00:23:58,612
Fifteen minutes a day for office workers.

Jasmine's 15 Minute Class.

438
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,718
Together, let's...

439
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:09,490
Save Our Souls.

440
00:24:21,602 --> 00:24:23,103
Okay, then.

441
00:24:26,073 --> 00:24:27,341
But where's CEO Cho?

442
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:30,277
He suddenly wasn't feeling well,
so he chose to leave work.

443
00:24:30,277 --> 00:24:31,578
That's why he's CEO Cho.

444
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,549
Sorry. My apologies. Namaste.

445
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:40,254
This is Jasmine's 15 Minute Class.

446
00:24:40,254 --> 00:24:44,324
Save Our Souls.

447
00:24:44,324 --> 00:24:46,326
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

448
00:24:46,326 --> 00:24:48,195
But we're not even.

449
00:24:50,564 --> 00:24:52,132
No, we had Kick.

450
00:24:52,132 --> 00:24:55,235
- Bow wow.
- Then we're even.

451
00:24:55,235 --> 00:24:59,807
We're going to start
with a simple couple yoga.

452
00:25:00,574 --> 00:25:02,943
- Get in pairs.
- Joo Ha will be my partner.

453
00:25:02,943 --> 00:25:03,944
Well,

454
00:25:04,678 --> 00:25:08,115
but you two are friends already, so no.

455
00:25:08,115 --> 00:25:10,984
Let's get in pairs like this.

456
00:25:11,418 --> 00:25:14,288
This is a pose that's great to form trust.

457
00:25:14,288 --> 00:25:17,090
It's a couple airplane pose.

458
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,827
One will lie down,

459
00:25:19,827 --> 00:25:23,330
and the other one will lean on the arms
and legs of his or her partner...

460
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,033
and go up in the air.

461
00:25:26,033 --> 00:25:28,669
So it would be better
if the lighter one goes up, right?

462
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:29,436
Decide on your positions.

463
00:25:29,436 --> 00:25:30,370
- Seventy-eight.
- What?

464
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:32,072
I weigh 78kg. And you?

465
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,575
I obviously weigh less than you,
so you lie down, In Seong.

466
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:35,275
Darn it.

467
00:25:35,275 --> 00:25:36,777
Michael, I'm your junior colleague,
so I'll lie down.

468
00:25:36,777 --> 00:25:39,913
But I'm taller and heavier than you,
so I'll lie down.

469
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,248
You're right.

470
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,683
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

471
00:25:42,683 --> 00:25:44,084
What position would you like, CEO Ji?

472
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,019
I'm the great actor Ji Jin Hee,
so I'd like to go in the air.

473
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:47,754
- Lie down.
- Okay.

474
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:52,259
Rely on the arms of your partner
and float in the air.

475
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,727
One, two, three.

476
00:25:54,661 --> 00:25:56,730
- There.
- Superman.

477
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,232
What do you see, CEO Ji?

478
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:02,102
- Maintain a 90-degree angle.
<i>- Plane in the sky</i>

479
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:05,439
That's right. You're doing great, Mark.

480
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,508
Wait a minute.

481
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,011
Wait.

482
00:26:11,812 --> 00:26:13,780
Please wait.

483
00:26:15,082 --> 00:26:17,050
- I have to poo.
- Wait.

484
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,919
Be careful.

485
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:20,787
I'm going to poo. I don't have hair.

486
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,623
My goodness.

487
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:24,391
No.

488
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,561
In Seong has to poo.

489
00:26:28,395 --> 00:26:29,863
Kick.

490
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,270
You have a nosebleed.
Jasmine, come here.

(Yoga class disaster! KICKKICKKICKKICK)

492
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,678
What should I do?

Just 15 minutes a day,

Let's make it a regular!

497
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:10,895
It really hurts.

498
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:18,503
The weather is great today.

499
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,272
You're mean.

500
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,808
I can't even wear sunglasses,

501
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,411
because someone hurt my nose.

502
00:27:27,745 --> 00:27:28,746
The sun is too dazzling.

503
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:30,782
I'm sorry.

504
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:34,018
I hope this detox camping is okay.

505
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,588
We shouldn't give regular people
a hard time on our show.

506
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:39,190
I had a nosebleed for two days.
Nothing will beat this.

507
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:42,493
Sorry.

508
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:44,662
What's "sorry?"

509
00:27:45,129 --> 00:27:47,465
I've never been sorry my whole life.

510
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,500
It's you who should be sorry,
Scriptwriter Wang, right?

511
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,670
Say sorry to me. Apologise now.

512
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,938
Seriously.

513
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:54,706
Sorry.

514
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:56,941
My mom said I had the best-looking nose.

(Episode 6-2
Your Toner Scent in the Camper Van)

516
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,723
I think five cameras will be enough.

517
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:15,193
One for full shots, one to keep fixed,
two for bust shots, one for tight shots.

518
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,194
Good.

519
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,296
And PD Cho,

520
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:20,932
I need a reflector
and a lot of retouching.

521
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,101
My face is not the same anymore.

522
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,469
In the past,
I used to have super fine skin.

523
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,437
It was never super fine.

524
00:28:26,437 --> 00:28:27,705
So grant my favor.

525
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,908
Who asks for a reflector
on a variety show?

526
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:32,644
You should just look natural
and show how naturally old you're getting.

527
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:35,079
But we need a lot of views
to earn more money.

528
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:36,314
This is good for KICKKICKKICKKICK.

529
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,149
Having fine skin won't increase
the number of views.

530
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:39,484
Just do me a favor.

531
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:41,886
- Fine. I'll think about it.
- Okay.

532
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,488
How many staff are you thinking?

533
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:46,824
Seven in the camera team,
and we need some for audio and lighting.

534
00:28:46,824 --> 00:28:48,927
I think it'll be less than twenty.

535
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,195
Really? Can't we hire more?

536
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:51,496
No.

537
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:52,897
Okay, then.

538
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,966
The costs of labor
and production are too high.

539
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,501
Okay.

540
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:57,368
CEO Cho.

541
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,237
- CEO Cho.
- Yes?

542
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:02,774
Minimalism is a thing
for YouTube videos these days.

543
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,709
So one or two cameras will be enough.

544
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,244
- One or two?
- Yes.

545
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:10,682
Trivialness and naturalness are
the recent trend.

546
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,550
- What?
- You had no idea.

547
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,819
Trivialness? Naturalness?

548
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:15,653
Yes.

549
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:19,591
That's hilarious.

550
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,126
Trend? That's good.

551
00:29:22,126 --> 00:29:23,561
You made a very good point.

552
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:26,397
But following the trend is not
always the answer.

553
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:27,899
That's what I, PD Cho, think.

554
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:32,670
So we will follow standard tactics
to get ten million views.

555
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,772
- Ten million?
- That's too...

556
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:35,540
Ten million.

557
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:37,575
That's going to be hard.

558
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,744
What's with those faces?

559
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:41,112
Is there a problem?

560
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,749
Ten million is actually ridiculous.

561
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,851
I also think "Let's Make It"...

562
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,653
will be out of style
if we follow standard tactics.

563
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:50,221
Out of...

564
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:51,890
Did you say I'm out of style?

565
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,892
You should follow the trend
of the era, too, PD Cho.

566
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,026
The trend...

567
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,731
No. I think I am right.

568
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:01,666
When everyone said no,

569
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,801
I'm the one who chose Actor Ji Jin Hee...

570
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:05,103
who was only acting in dramas and such...

571
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:08,239
How about asking KICKERs
their opinions, then?

572
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,208
That's a good idea.

573
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:11,976
Let's post a notice for a vote
on the forum.

574
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,312
Okay. Deal.

575
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,346
- Deal?
- Deal.

576
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:20,652
The GPS is not working,
probably because we're deep in the mountain.

577
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,654
I have eyes, too.

578
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,255
Although I have a hurt nose.

579
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:25,356
Don't touch it.

580
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,326
(Searching for a new route)

581
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,128
The GPS is working again.

582
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,930
I said I have eyes, too.

583
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,231
It's just my nose that's hurt.

584
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,266
Don't touch my phone. You'll hurt it.

585
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:41,272
Seriously. My nose hurts.

586
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:44,609
Suppress it.

587
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,223
There.

588
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,661
How nice.

589
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:07,298
There's really nothing at all
because it's an unmanned campsite.

590
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,000
It opened not long ago,

591
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,169
so we can't even see traces
of others, either.

592
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:12,136
Right.

593
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,708
First of all...

594
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,245
(Composition Plan)

595
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,347
(1 Digital Detox,
Bury phones and car key)

596
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,382
(2. Trivial Thoughts Detox:
Zone out looking at the mountains)

597
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,451
(3. Collection and Cooking:
Prepare meals in nature)

598
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,590
I think this is enough.

599
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:37,262
You should dig ten more meters.

600
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:40,164
That'll be enough.

601
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:44,969
Do you want me to bury you here?

602
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,005
No way.

603
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,408
What are you doing?
Leave your phone there. Here's mine.

604
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:57,182
- I'm tired.
- And the car key, too.

605
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:58,750
Air conditioners are the main contributors
to environmental damage as well.

606
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:13,665
What was after burying phones?

607
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,000
I should check the composition plan.

608
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,170
Wait, where's my phone?

609
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,875
Right. I buried it.

610
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,311
It's okay. I know it by heart.

611
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,379
Of course, you should know it by heart.

612
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:29,747
Because you can't know it by your nose.

613
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,330
To zone out properly
looking at the mountains,

614
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,465
the way of breathing is important.

615
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,566
Breathe in,

616
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:50,902
breathe out.

617
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,170
Breathe in...

618
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:59,043
What are you doing?

619
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:01,346
I'm detoxing the wounds you gave me...

620
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,147
by breathing in and out.

621
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:14,726
Double nosebleed.

622
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:19,197
Double nosebleed.

623
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,335
This works.

624
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,677
(Vote for the KICKKICKKICKKICK

627
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,483
Ninety-nine point nine percent?

628
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,084
And 0.1 percent.

629
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:41,786
I can't believe this.

630
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:43,087
Do we have to shoot
with only one or two cameras?

631
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:46,357
What are you saying?
We can't shoot with just one or two.

632
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,559
This is so...

633
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,894
What's the result?

634
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:54,332
It seems our CEOs were checking
the result of the vote.

635
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,433
We were right, weren't we?

636
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,534
Right?

637
00:33:57,335 --> 00:34:00,004
It does seem that triviality
and naturalness are the recent trends.

638
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:01,105
We should follow that.

639
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:02,607
- We can't.
- Be quiet.

640
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,143
- Aren't you guys hungry?
- That was unexpected.

<i>Jin Hee is born to be loved</i>

642
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,249
I have this stir-fried spicy pork coupon.

643
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,484
Let's talk about the recent trend
while we eat.

644
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:14,452
Let's go have a meal.

(Joo Ha's Coupon)
(Eating whatever Jin Hee wants with him)

646
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:18,489
Okay.

647
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,892
Let's eat stir-fried spicy pork
for lunch today.

648
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,862
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

649
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:24,729
Darn it.

650
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:26,965
I can't even.

651
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,736
Everyone's so mean.

652
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:35,073
Despite everything,
you were once a popular producer,

653
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,641
and you're the CEO of this company.

654
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,912
Is that what you think as well,
In Seong?

655
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:44,115
There are many problems
about the MZs these days.

656
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,417
But you're also an MZ, In Seong.

657
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,921
I'm a half MZ and a sane one, too.

658
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:50,989
- HMZ?
- HMZ.

659
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:51,890
- SMZ?
- SMZ.

660
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,425
Then what's the problem with MZs?

661
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:59,631
Not only in their house
but also in the company,

662
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:01,499
they want senseless freedom.

663
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:02,166
Right.

664
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,335
That's commonplace
in KICKKICKKICKKICK, too.

665
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:05,403
Commonplace.

666
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,871
- No fixed time to go to and leave work.
- Right.

667
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,439
Disrespect toward the boss and elders.

668
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,340
Disrespect.

669
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,608
The overuse of emojis.

670
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,510
The overuse of emojis is so annoying.

671
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:14,612
For the future of KICKKICKKICKKICK,

672
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,548
I believe this requires improvement
no matter what.

673
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:19,184
Make everyone gather right now.

674
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:20,285
- Gather.
- Gather.

675
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,853
- Okay, I'll do that.
- Okay.

676
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,288
I'm going to gather them.

677
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,490
Everyone gather for an urgent meeting.

678
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,326
Gather in the communal space
in ten minutes.

679
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:29,494
There.

680
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:31,930
There.

681
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,032
- Wait just a little.
- Let's see.

682
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:35,233
Yes, let's see.

683
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,134
I'm going to see...

684
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,902
Those ridiculous brats.

685
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,342
- A response.
- Already.

686
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,910
They still reply fast.

687
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:47,011
"Okay."

688
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,913
Actor Ji said "Okay." And Baek Ji Won...

689
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:51,583
As you know,
I have to attend a seminar today.

690
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:52,951
So I can't attend the meeting.

691
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,953
- She reported this before.
- She reported that before.

692
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:57,088
Why aren't the MZers replying?

693
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:59,257
Just wait a little.

694
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:01,893
We have to check their reaction.

695
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,261
Scriptwriter Ga.

696
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:04,295
It's a selfie.

697
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:05,797
Where are they?

698
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:08,299
"We're waiting in line
in the new macaron place."

699
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:10,134
"It'll be our turn soon,"

700
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:11,603
"so start the meeting without us."

701
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:14,472
"We'll bring a super tasty macaron set."

702
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,141
They're hopeless.

703
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:19,277
- They're out of their minds.
- Calm down.

704
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:20,311
What's this?

705
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:22,514
Someone used the company card.

706
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,415
(Daldal Macaron 168 dollars)

707
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:31,489
Why buy macaron she wants to eat
with the company credit card?

708
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,359
It's 168 dollars.

709
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:38,196
Those rude little brats.
This shows how much they disregard you.

710
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,664
You have to take action, CEO Cho.

711
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:42,333
- I'm going to get them.
- You're going to get them.

712
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:47,672
Mark, this is good.

713
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:48,806
- I know, right?
- Yes.

714
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:51,075
This is delicious.

715
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:52,110
It tastes the same, right?

716
00:37:06,124 --> 00:37:07,192
Everyone, focus.

717
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,260
Where did I see that before?

718
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,563
What's with your outfits?

719
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:14,399
Are you a drill instructor or something?

720
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,834
Did you decide to give a change
in your style?

721
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:17,735
That doesn't suit you at all.

722
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,605
There's been indiscipline
in KICKKICKKICKKICK recently.

723
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:22,006
- Isn't that right?
- That's right.

724
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:23,007
Yeah.

725
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:24,342
First of all, PD Lee Min Jae.

726
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:27,679
Why do you keep ignoring
CEO Cho's KakaoTalk messages?

727
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,113
I never ignored them.

728
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:31,583
I'm always the first one to respond.

729
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:32,584
Show us.

730
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,652
See? There's the check mark.

731
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,054
- Where?
- There.

732
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:38,256
- What's this?
- Why do you reply like this?

733
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,058
I can't see clearly, either. Where is it?

734
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:42,193
- Here. Press it, and it'll show.
- I see it now.

735
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:45,263
What do you see?

736
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,999
Pressing it shows who made the check mark.
I see.

737
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:48,867
I can see it clearly.

738
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:52,503
Anyway, we currently have
2.19 million subscribers,

739
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:53,972
and until we reach our goal,
three million,

740
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:56,541
we need 810,000 more.
This is a pivotal moment.

741
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:58,943
- You memorized all that?
- Cool.

742
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:00,912
- Pull yourself together.
- Pull myself together.

743
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:04,048
This is a pivotal moment,
and for peace and development...

744
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:06,150
of KICKKICKKICKKICK,
Director No In Seong and I made...

745
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,119
some new rules.

746
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,554
Wait, what?

747
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:10,855
Why was I not informed of this?

748
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:13,491
Since when was No In Seong the director?

749
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:16,394
Did In Seong get promoted to director?

750
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:17,629
How about a team dinner, then?

751
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:20,465
- Team dinner?
- Team dinner. Beef.

752
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:21,766
- Pull yourself together.
- Pull myself together.

753
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,702
So what are the internal regulations?

754
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,170
Drill instructor.

755
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,540
Entering the pantry more than three times
a day is not allowed.

756
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,374
What?

757
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:31,976
- Strictly keep 55 minutes for work.
- Work.

758
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,945
- Strictly keep five minutes for breaks.
- Breaks.

759
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:35,547
During work hours, entering the bathroom,
pantry, and rooftop,

760
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:36,681
- not allowed.
- Not allowed.

761
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:37,916
This is ridiculous.

762
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,784
How can anyone go to the bathroom, pantry,

763
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:41,286
and jump on a trampoline
in just five minutes?

764
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:43,454
I even have to water Cilantree.

765
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:45,924
I have to play games, so this...

766
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:49,827
Strictly keep thirty minutes
for lunch and dinner.

767
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,463
You get one negative point
for each minute you're late.

768
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,465
Ten negative points result
in a deduction on your monthly salary.

769
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,602
That's ridiculous. You can't deduct...

770
00:38:57,602 --> 00:39:01,472
No compromise whatsoever.

771
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:07,779
I don't have to follow these rules, do I?

772
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:09,681
No exceptions.

773
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,817
You're the CEO,
so you must lead by example.

774
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,018
Lead by example.

775
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:15,253
But...

776
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:16,988
CEO Ji, please say something.

777
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:19,490
What do you think you guys are...

778
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,258
Darn it.

779
00:39:20,258 --> 00:39:22,961
Silence. From now on, conduct yourselves.

780
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:23,862
Conduct yourselves.

781
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:24,863
- Drill instructor.
- Yes?

782
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,264
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

783
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:32,904
But...

784
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:35,273
CEO Ji, are you going to let this pass?

785
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:36,207
Conduct yourselves.

786
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,141
What?

787
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:38,843
That's right.

788
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:45,984
What was that?

789
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:48,419
I did what you told me,
but it doesn't work.

790
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:49,554
Seriously?

791
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:53,825
You have to target the center
of the firewood.

792
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:54,692
Try it again.

793
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,701
I can't.

794
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,171
Move.

795
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,042
- Just go and prepare wild greens.
- Okay.

796
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,948
It's hot.

797
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,491
That's enough...

798
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:29,394
to stack up to the Northern Duke
Grand Master Federik.

799
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:47,645
That's worth saving in my gallery.

800
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:48,413
Camera.

801
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:52,350
My phone.

802
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:57,155
Right. I don't have it. No.

803
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,393
Yes.

804
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,296
I think this is enough.

805
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:11,603
Wait, you still haven't prepared
anything at all.

806
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:13,905
Why are you so slow?

807
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:15,692
Gosh.

808
00:41:15,693 --> 00:41:17,275
How do you even work?

809
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,410
Are you a slowpoke or what?

810
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:23,615
Yes, you're a slowpoke.

811
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:30,755
Joo Ha, I think I drank too much coffee.

812
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:32,857
This is urgent.
How many minutes do we have left?

813
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:34,192
Not many.

814
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:35,360
No chatting.

815
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,061
I'm going to wet my pants.

816
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:40,999
Move.

817
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,468
Wait.

818
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:44,536
Sorry.

819
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,542
I'm going to eat chips.

820
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:52,010
What should I eat?

821
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:52,944
You scared me.

822
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:55,747
Ga Joo Ha, you've been
to the pantry three times already.

823
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:56,981
You cannot enter the pantry anymore.

824
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,184
What? There's no way.

825
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,987
Let me see that.

826
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,355
I'm going to eat this up.

827
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:06,691
I'm going to get rid of this.

828
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:11,062
Just a bit more. Yes.

829
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,268
- What was that?
- Didn't you hear the alarm?

830
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,437
Go back to your seat
or you'll get a negative point.

831
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:20,271
Move!

832
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,906
What was that? I was almost done.

833
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,580
Fine.

834
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:31,149
He's crazy.

835
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:36,020
You two should also go back
to your seats immediately. Move!

836
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,322
We are.

837
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:48,800
Not yet.

838
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:52,337
Break time is over.

839
00:42:52,337 --> 00:42:54,172
I'm done peeing.

840
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:55,640
No exceptions.

841
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,342
You have one negative point.

842
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:59,110
Darn it.

843
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,111
You're mean.

844
00:43:12,857 --> 00:43:14,659
CEO Ji, break time is over.

845
00:43:14,659 --> 00:43:16,861
As the CEO, you should be more punctual.

846
00:43:17,462 --> 00:43:20,265
In Seong, please just pretend
you didn't see this.

847
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:21,866
I'm Director No.

848
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:25,336
Director No, I have constipation.

849
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:26,538
So please give me more time.

850
00:43:26,538 --> 00:43:27,639
No exceptions.

851
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:29,173
Get out now. Move!

852
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:30,275
But...

853
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:31,809
Hold on.

854
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,812
- Take this, at least.
- Get out immediately and...

855
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:40,618
I'll make an exception
and give you five more minutes.

856
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,520
So deal with it in five and come out.

857
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,388
Yes, sir.

858
00:43:54,933 --> 00:43:56,634
You have exactly 30 minutes for dinner.

859
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,803
Dinnertime starts now. Move!

860
00:43:58,803 --> 00:43:59,737
What?

861
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:02,473
What's wrong with him?

862
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,108
Just go.

863
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,344
- Why? What's wrong?
- Hurry up.

864
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:08,980
What's going on?

865
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,782
What's there we can eat in 30 minutes?

866
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:12,417
Going there and coming back
should not take more than ten minutes.

867
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:14,085
It shouldn't be something too hot.

868
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:17,555
But you're the CEO, CEO Ji.

869
00:44:17,555 --> 00:44:18,957
Why are you also suppressed like us?

870
00:44:18,957 --> 00:44:19,958
You're right.

871
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:23,061
Well, I don't know why, either.

872
00:44:23,595 --> 00:44:25,663
KICKKICKKICKKICK is one, that's why.

873
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,398
- It's here.
- Let's go.

874
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:31,636
I'll eat a sandwich, CEO Ji.

875
00:44:31,636 --> 00:44:33,705
Okay. Let's make it four sandwiches, then.

876
00:44:33,705 --> 00:44:34,906
Okay. Good.

877
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:36,474
Michael.

878
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:39,310
I'd like this, and this one, too.

879
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,546
Hello. Are you here for a sandwich?

880
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:43,781
Yes. Make your order.

881
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:45,750
Wheat bread is the bread
that doesn't make you fat, right?

882
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:46,584
Right.

883
00:44:46,584 --> 00:44:49,354
Then make a hinge cut in it, please.

884
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:50,622
And tomatoes...

885
00:44:50,622 --> 00:44:52,223
They taste bad, so take them out.

886
00:44:52,223 --> 00:44:54,259
Okay. We'd like four sandwiches.
All of them in...

887
00:44:54,259 --> 00:44:57,495
No. They're healthy, so just add them.

888
00:44:57,495 --> 00:44:58,763
Okay, add them.

889
00:44:58,763 --> 00:45:00,265
Are you done?

890
00:45:00,265 --> 00:45:03,268
Take out raw onions
because I have gastritis.

891
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:05,036
You have to pay.

892
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:06,838
- You're done, right?
- Four sandwiches in...

893
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:08,273
Right. I almost forgot.

894
00:45:08,273 --> 00:45:09,607
Pay.

895
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:12,277
How much is 70g of beef bulgogi?

896
00:45:12,277 --> 00:45:14,312
Beef bulgogi will make you fat.

897
00:45:14,312 --> 00:45:15,947
Earlier you said that you wanted
to lose weight.

898
00:45:15,947 --> 00:45:18,283
You even asked for a hinge cut,
so why ask to fill the cut with meat?

899
00:45:18,283 --> 00:45:20,752
I'd also like 30g of beef bulgogi.

900
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,922
Hurry.

901
00:45:23,922 --> 00:45:25,123
Did we get it? No?

902
00:45:25,123 --> 00:45:27,692
It's all Michael's fault.

903
00:45:30,528 --> 00:45:32,197
This is my second time, CEO Ji.

904
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:33,698
I'm in big trouble if I get caught again.

905
00:45:33,698 --> 00:45:34,999
Hurry and eat up.

906
00:45:34,999 --> 00:45:36,568
I'm back.

907
00:45:37,268 --> 00:45:40,772
Did something happen while I was gone?

908
00:45:52,217 --> 00:45:53,518
Calm down.

909
00:45:55,153 --> 00:45:56,487
Calm down.

910
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:57,488
You have to trust her.

911
00:45:58,857 --> 00:46:00,225
What I'm saying is...

912
00:46:00,225 --> 00:46:03,161
that CEO Cho is Tyrant Cho.

913
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:05,330
Tyrant Cho?

914
00:46:06,865 --> 00:46:10,535
That's CEO Cho's new nickname.
Tyrant Cho, the dictator.

915
00:46:10,535 --> 00:46:13,271
And his informant, Mr. NoFormant.

916
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:14,572
He's the biggest problem.

917
00:46:14,572 --> 00:46:16,074
Rebuke them.

918
00:46:16,074 --> 00:46:17,942
We need help.

919
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:26,217
(CEO Cho Young Sik)

920
00:46:26,217 --> 00:46:27,385
I'll pour you a drink.

921
00:46:34,058 --> 00:46:36,194
This water smells amazing.

922
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:39,430
We should've done this earlier.

923
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,966
Everyone's more productive
and they reply right away.

924
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,101
Director No.

925
00:46:43,568 --> 00:46:46,938
You're doing big work in Kickickickick.

926
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:50,909
Thank you for your appreciation,
Chairman Cho.

927
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:52,477
Chairman Cho?

928
00:46:54,712 --> 00:46:56,514
That sounds nice.

929
00:46:56,514 --> 00:46:59,117
- While we're at it,
- Yes?

930
00:46:59,117 --> 00:47:01,853
How about making everyone come
to work a bit earlier?

931
00:47:01,853 --> 00:47:05,490
I'm a morning person, that's why.

932
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,158
Wait a minute.

933
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:09,928
Dinnertime is almost over, isn't it?

934
00:47:09,928 --> 00:47:10,962
You're right, sir.

935
00:47:10,962 --> 00:47:11,896
Check the time.

936
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:16,000
We have exactly three minutes left.

937
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,535
I'm this accurate.

938
00:47:17,535 --> 00:47:18,903
I'll go out and collect tardiness fees.

939
00:47:18,903 --> 00:47:22,907
This time, I'll join you, Director No.

940
00:47:22,907 --> 00:47:24,943
Okay. Let's go, Chairman Cho.

941
00:47:24,943 --> 00:47:26,277
- Let's go.
- Yes.

942
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:28,713
But about negotiating my annual salary...

943
00:47:28,713 --> 00:47:33,751
Let's think about that together some more.

944
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:35,486
- Great.
- Take the lead.

945
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:40,491
He shows such disciplined movements.

946
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:42,460
He's Mr. Discipline himself.

947
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:47,498
Everyone gather.

948
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:58,843
Director, what's this?

949
00:47:59,911 --> 00:48:02,814
I know. Is everyone out of their minds?

950
00:48:02,814 --> 00:48:04,048
Those brats.

951
00:48:05,149 --> 00:48:06,017
See what's going on.

952
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:07,252
Yes, I'll search for them.

953
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:13,591
The fire is kind of weak.

954
00:48:13,591 --> 00:48:14,559
I know, right?

955
00:48:16,327 --> 00:48:19,998
Scriptwriter Wang, I've been thinking
this was really strange.

956
00:48:19,998 --> 00:48:24,402
Don't you find the grooves
in the bark strange?

957
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:25,470
They're too deep.

958
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,739
These are claw marks of bears.

959
00:48:27,906 --> 00:48:28,940
What?

960
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,642
When I was working on "Law Of Survival,"

961
00:48:30,642 --> 00:48:33,311
they said you should run away right away
when you see these marks on wood...

962
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:34,512
because it means bears live there.

963
00:48:37,549 --> 00:48:39,384
What if a bear comes here?

964
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:41,586
Isn't it obvious?

965
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:45,557
Scriptwriter Wang, it'll be impossible
for both of us to survive anyway.

966
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:48,259
You're slow,
so you should sacrifice yourself,

967
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,861
and I'll run away in the meantime.

968
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:51,663
Where should I run away?

969
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,265
Where to?

970
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:55,633
You scared me.

971
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:56,634
Why?

972
00:49:00,305 --> 00:49:01,706
This is good.

973
00:49:10,348 --> 00:49:13,585
Is what I'm seeing now a bear?

974
00:49:13,751 --> 00:49:15,920
I think so.

975
00:49:22,427 --> 00:49:24,796
Scriptwriter Wang, get up.

976
00:49:24,796 --> 00:49:26,497
Get up.

977
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,634
It's a bear.

978
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:32,971
It's a bear. No.

979
00:49:34,005 --> 00:49:35,139
That's a bear.

980
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,207
Get inside.

981
00:49:43,181 --> 00:49:45,250
Do you think it'll leave
once it eats all of that?

982
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,117
I hope so.

983
00:49:47,886 --> 00:49:49,721
Why is it coming this way?

984
00:49:49,721 --> 00:49:51,556
How can I know?

985
00:49:51,556 --> 00:49:53,992
This won't do. We have to call 911.

986
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:55,426
Yes, we do.

987
00:49:55,426 --> 00:49:57,695
I can't find my phone.
Use your phone, Scriptwriter Wang.

988
00:49:57,695 --> 00:49:59,697
Hold on.

989
00:50:03,735 --> 00:50:05,003
- Time capsule.
- Time capsule.

990
00:50:08,373 --> 00:50:10,008
Where's the car key? Start the camper van.

991
00:50:10,008 --> 00:50:11,009
Okay.

992
00:50:14,879 --> 00:50:15,947
Time capsule.

993
00:50:27,759 --> 00:50:30,395
What do they want to say
to us as a group?

994
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:32,864
Are they planning to form
a labour union or something?

995
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:34,966
CEO Cho, pull yourself together.
Everything's fine.

996
00:50:34,966 --> 00:50:37,702
Don't grow weak. We can do this.

997
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:41,472
- Overthrow dictatorship. Protect freedom.
- What's that?

998
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:44,309
Overthrow dictatorship. Protect freedom.

999
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:47,712
(Overthrow dictatorship. Protect freedom.)

1000
00:50:50,982 --> 00:50:52,750
What's that?

1001
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:58,323
- Overthrow dictatorship. Protect freedom.
- Overthrow dictatorship. Protect freedom.

1002
00:50:58,623 --> 00:50:59,624
- CEO Ji.
- What?

1003
00:50:59,624 --> 00:51:01,292
Why are you there when you're the CEO?
Come here.

1004
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:02,393
He won't.

1005
00:51:02,961 --> 00:51:04,295
- Come here.
- Yes.

1006
00:51:04,295 --> 00:51:05,330
What?

1007
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,031
I'm the CEO.

1008
00:51:07,031 --> 00:51:08,233
What?

1009
00:51:08,233 --> 00:51:09,300
I'm the CEO.

1010
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,935
You traitor.

1011
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:12,237
- You're so petty.
- Petty?

1012
00:51:12,237 --> 00:51:14,472
- What do you think you're doing?
- What do you think you're doing?

1013
00:51:14,472 --> 00:51:16,741
What do you think you're doing, CEO Cho?

1014
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:18,743
Enter the pantry no more than three times?

1015
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:20,912
Fifty-five minutes of work,
and five minutes of rest?

1016
00:51:20,912 --> 00:51:22,981
Thirty minutes for dinner?

1017
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:24,582
That causes an upset stomach.

1018
00:51:24,816 --> 00:51:26,718
This is a violation of human rights.

1019
00:51:26,718 --> 00:51:29,854
Isn't that right, CEO Ji?

1020
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:32,156
- No, that's not right.
- No.

1021
00:51:32,156 --> 00:51:33,358
That doesn't cause an upset stomach.

1022
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:34,893
- You had an upset stomach.
- But that is kind of short.

1023
00:51:34,893 --> 00:51:36,094
You had an upset stomach.

1024
00:51:36,895 --> 00:51:37,762
You are right!

1025
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:39,264
- Grab him.
- Yes!

1026
00:51:39,264 --> 00:51:41,366
You jerks. Thirty minutes is too short.

1027
00:51:41,366 --> 00:51:42,367
Five minutes is too short.

1028
00:51:42,367 --> 00:51:44,602
- I had to stop in the middle of pooing.
- Same.

1029
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:48,072
Human rights? Yes, that's important.

1030
00:51:48,072 --> 00:51:50,041
But this is a company.

1031
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:51,976
It's not a place where you come
to have fun.

1032
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:53,077
No, it's not.

1033
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:55,213
You should enjoy your hobby at home.

1034
00:51:55,213 --> 00:51:56,247
Yes, you should.

1035
00:51:56,247 --> 00:51:58,983
Excessive freedom threatening
the development and peace of the company.

1036
00:51:58,983 --> 00:52:01,219
That's self-indulgence.
It has to be restrained.

1037
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:02,954
Don't you agree, CEO Ji?

1038
00:52:02,954 --> 00:52:05,323
CEO Ji, recover!

1039
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:06,457
Recover!

1040
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:07,725
- No way.
- No.

1041
00:52:08,193 --> 00:52:09,227
That's right.

1042
00:52:09,794 --> 00:52:12,597
Joo Ha, why raise cilantro on the rooftop?

1043
00:52:12,597 --> 00:52:14,465
Mark, you're always playing games.

1044
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:17,135
Min Jae, you're always on your computer.

1045
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:18,102
What's with you guys?

1046
00:52:18,603 --> 00:52:20,338
You traitor.

1047
00:52:20,338 --> 00:52:21,606
You guys are traitors.

1048
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,511
Are you saying you will not stand down?

1049
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:27,445
We won't.

1050
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:29,714
Okay, then.

1051
00:52:29,714 --> 00:52:31,249
Then...

1052
00:52:32,884 --> 00:52:34,953
we declare a strike.

1053
00:52:35,687 --> 00:52:37,055
A strike?

1054
00:52:37,055 --> 00:52:38,623
- No.
- We won't work.

1055
00:52:38,623 --> 00:52:40,024
What are you saying?
A strike, out of nowhere?

1056
00:52:40,024 --> 00:52:43,828
Representative of the labor union,
state your opinion.

1057
00:52:43,828 --> 00:52:44,729
Yes.

1058
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:50,535
Due to the breakdown in the negotiation
between the labour union and the company,

1059
00:52:50,535 --> 00:52:54,172
"LUIC" and uploading videos
on our channel is temporarily suspended.

1060
00:52:54,172 --> 00:52:56,207
We will upload this announcement
on the forum.

1061
00:52:57,242 --> 00:52:58,443
No.

1062
00:52:58,443 --> 00:53:00,111
- The announcement is ready.
- No.

1063
00:53:00,111 --> 00:53:01,546
We will really upload it.

1064
00:53:01,546 --> 00:53:03,781
No.

1065
00:53:07,652 --> 00:53:08,686
What are you doing?

1066
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:10,522
Hold on. We should negotiate and...

1067
00:53:10,522 --> 00:53:11,589
- CEO Cho.
- What?

1068
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:13,658
You must stand firm at times like these.

1069
00:53:13,658 --> 00:53:15,760
Giving those workers a hearing is...

1070
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,829
the same as giving them the opportunity
to act arrogantly and impudently.

1071
00:53:17,829 --> 00:53:19,264
We will really upload it.

1072
00:53:19,264 --> 00:53:20,765
Wait. No.

1073
00:53:20,765 --> 00:53:22,333
Look me in the eye, CEO Cho.

1074
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:23,902
You have to stay strong, CEO Cho.

1075
00:53:23,902 --> 00:53:26,137
The moment we take a step back,

1076
00:53:26,137 --> 00:53:27,472
we lose.

1077
00:53:27,472 --> 00:53:28,673
You must stay tenacious.

1078
00:53:31,342 --> 00:53:34,379
- Those jerks.
- Drag him out!

1079
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,530
What we want is simple.

1080
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:53,665
Through an unjust promotion,

1081
00:53:53,665 --> 00:53:56,401
this shameless
Director No In Seong oppressed...

1082
00:53:56,401 --> 00:53:58,870
and persecuted good employees,

1083
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:00,805
so we propose his removal
from the position.

1084
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:02,740
Director No.

1085
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:04,742
Director No.

1086
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:13,251
Fine.

1087
00:54:14,018 --> 00:54:16,988
Let's talk.

1088
00:54:19,824 --> 00:54:20,658
Don't move.

1089
00:54:22,393 --> 00:54:23,528
Director No.

1090
00:54:25,063 --> 00:54:28,066
Lunchtime is less than an hour and a half.

1091
00:54:28,433 --> 00:54:30,134
Reply as quickly as you can.

1092
00:54:30,134 --> 00:54:31,069
Okay.

1093
00:54:31,269 --> 00:54:33,104
Abolish limited access to the pantry...

1094
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:36,541
and dividing working hours and breaks.

1095
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:37,575
- Good.
- Abolished.

1096
00:54:37,575 --> 00:54:39,777
We'll abolish them.

1097
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:43,014
Keep common courtesies toward each other.

1098
00:54:43,014 --> 00:54:46,551
When a similar dispute occurs,

1099
00:54:46,551 --> 00:54:51,422
decide on everything
through the flower of democracy, voting.

1100
00:54:51,422 --> 00:54:52,357
Good.

1101
00:54:52,357 --> 00:54:54,158
- Good.
- Perfect.

1102
00:54:54,158 --> 00:54:58,096
Representatives of the labor union
and the company, please come forward.

1103
00:55:00,331 --> 00:55:03,568
If you agree, shake hands.

1104
00:55:03,568 --> 00:55:04,402
Okay.

1105
00:55:19,884 --> 00:55:24,789
(2024.11.21 We declare democratization
in KICKKICKKICKKICK.)

1106
00:55:30,028 --> 00:55:34,365
I read an article...

1107
00:55:35,366 --> 00:55:39,337
about a family in Canada got trapped
in a camper van because of a bear...

1108
00:55:41,206 --> 00:55:45,143
and was found as mummies
a few years later.

1109
00:55:47,312 --> 00:55:49,614
Will that happen to us, too?

1110
00:55:51,182 --> 00:55:53,384
Don't be too pessimistic.

1111
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:57,822
I know you're also scared right now,
PD Tae Ho.

1112
00:56:00,325 --> 00:56:03,695
I'm not scared, but sad to lose things.

1113
00:56:08,132 --> 00:56:09,133
Of course.

1114
00:56:09,634 --> 00:56:13,805
Those muscles are too good
to become dried up.

1115
00:56:14,772 --> 00:56:15,607
What?

1116
00:56:17,442 --> 00:56:18,476
Nothing.

1117
00:56:21,212 --> 00:56:24,382
What are you sad to lose?

1118
00:56:26,117 --> 00:56:28,920
I'm telling you this
because I might die like this.

1119
00:56:30,555 --> 00:56:33,095
My dream is...

1120
00:56:33,096 --> 00:56:35,360
to become financially independent
and to retire early.

1121
00:56:37,795 --> 00:56:39,063
Really?

1122
00:56:39,931 --> 00:56:40,832
Yes.

1123
00:56:43,368 --> 00:56:47,572
My father used to say this
when I was a kid.

1124
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,943
"I'm going to retire
when I raise you children into grownups,"

1125
00:56:52,477 --> 00:56:55,647
"and enjoy the rest of my life traveling."

1126
00:56:58,016 --> 00:56:58,983
But...

1127
00:57:01,219 --> 00:57:03,688
just as I was about to fulfill
my filial duties...

1128
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:07,425
now that I became a producer
at a broadcasting station,

1129
00:57:12,764 --> 00:57:14,032
he passed away.

1130
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:21,873
On his way home after work,

1131
00:57:24,042 --> 00:57:26,010
he got hit by a drunk driver.

1132
00:57:36,621 --> 00:57:39,490
He never even got to go
on a domestic flight.

1133
00:57:40,358 --> 00:57:42,961
He worked all his life and passed away.

1134
00:57:44,162 --> 00:57:46,264
While looking at his portrait
at the funeral,

1135
00:57:57,542 --> 00:58:00,278
I made this resolution.

1136
00:58:00,945 --> 00:58:01,813
I will not marry.

1137
00:58:02,547 --> 00:58:05,283
I will work extremely hard until I'm 40...

1138
00:58:05,283 --> 00:58:07,452
and buy a small house
and collect one million dollars...

1139
00:58:07,452 --> 00:58:09,020
and boldly retire.

1140
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:16,127
Is that why you were acting so pathetic
every day...

1141
00:58:17,529 --> 00:58:19,964
asking me for one bite of my food?

1142
00:58:22,467 --> 00:58:23,234
Yes.

1143
00:58:24,135 --> 00:58:27,305
I didn't know
I'd face an unexpected death like this.

1144
00:58:28,072 --> 00:58:29,974
I should've just splurged.

1145
00:58:32,443 --> 00:58:33,745
If we survive,

1146
00:58:34,612 --> 00:58:36,814
I'll buy you a decent meal,
Scriptwriter Wang.

1147
00:58:42,787 --> 00:58:45,323
Okay. Promise.

1148
00:58:48,293 --> 00:58:49,260
To be honest,

1149
00:58:53,398 --> 00:58:54,966
I'm also sad about something.

1150
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:56,868
What is it?

1151
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:05,810
I think I'll be able to say it
after one more drink.

1152
00:59:07,612 --> 00:59:09,180
I'll bring it.

1153
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,882
- I'll bring another bottle.
- No, I'll bring it.

1154
00:59:20,592 --> 00:59:21,693
PD Kang.

1155
00:59:22,894 --> 00:59:24,529
What toner do you use?

1156
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:27,332
I mean...

1157
00:59:32,203 --> 00:59:34,339
what I'm sad about is...

1158
00:59:35,607 --> 00:59:36,441
What?

1159
00:59:40,712 --> 00:59:42,313
I haven't tried it yet.

1160
00:59:43,281 --> 00:59:44,782
Tried what yet?

1161
00:59:59,264 --> 01:00:00,465
Kissing.

1162
01:00:06,404 --> 01:00:07,639
And...

1163
01:01:00,959 --> 01:01:03,228
(KICKKICKKICKKICK)

1164
01:01:03,228 --> 01:01:05,997
We got an offer for a couple photoshoot
of CEO Ji and CEO Cho.

1165
01:01:05,997 --> 01:01:07,432
Bromance between two middle-aged men.

1166
01:01:07,432 --> 01:01:08,833
We're just doing business.

1167
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:10,468
Are you saying you want to scout me?

1168
01:01:10,468 --> 01:01:12,237
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

1169
01:01:12,237 --> 01:01:13,404
Do you like being a celebrity that much?

1170
01:01:13,404 --> 01:01:14,439
I'm not Ji Jin Hee.

1171
01:01:14,439 --> 01:01:16,374
Whenever I get in there with PD Kang,

1172
01:01:16,374 --> 01:01:18,142
I write without any trouble afterward.

1173
01:01:18,142 --> 01:01:19,944
You crossed the line first,
Scriptwriter Wang.

1174
01:01:19,944 --> 01:01:21,279
From the olden days,

1175
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:24,616
men have been sensitive
of the sound, smell, and view of that day.

1176
01:01:24,616 --> 01:01:26,518
He strangely makes me competitive.

1177
01:01:26,518 --> 01:01:28,286
Don't do that. You look beautiful.

1178
01:01:28,586 --> 01:01:31,789
- Where am I?
- Somewhere far away.

1179
01:01:34,659 --> 01:01:36,659
