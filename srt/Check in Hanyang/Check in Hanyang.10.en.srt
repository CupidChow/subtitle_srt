1
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,710
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,128
FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:10,403
Then, what is the brass key
Hong Deok-su has?

4
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,697
<i>It was my father's.</i>

5
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,950
It is the only item of his
that I have left.

6
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,584
I will know once I confirm it.

7
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:46,773
<i>Deok-su.</i>

8
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,401
Come with me
to the Summer Palace in the summer.

9
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,946
The Summer Palace?

10
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:53,947
Later.

11
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,950
I want to go there with you someday.

12
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,328
Deok-su, will you come with me?

13
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,805
Hong Deok-su is…

14
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,767
a woman?

15
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,420
Deok-su!

16
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,339
Hey.

17
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,968
Gu-sil, welcome.

18
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,764
What? Who are they?

19
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,018
I trained with them as apprentices.

20
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,394
My colleagues at Yongcheonru.

21
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,980
Cheon Jun-hwa

22
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,273
and Lee Eun-ho.

23
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:15,069
You can call me Gu-sil.

24
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,742
They are Joseon's finest men.
Look how handsome they are!

25
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,160
She…

26
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,914
- is my betrothed.
- What?

27
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,291
- Sure. Wait, what?
- What?

28
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,711
I said she was my betrothed.

29
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,216
Hong Deok-su, you have a betrothed?

30
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,804
We promised a long time ago to marry

31
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,390
after I became an official clerk
at Yongcheonru.

32
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,938
Right. I am…

33
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,858
Hong Deok-su's betrothed.

34
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:05,286
Oh, of course.
You must be friends of my betrothed.

35
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,959
Did you escort my mother here safely?

36
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,836
Of course, my love.

37
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,297
Your mother is at Geumok Hall.

38
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:22,178
My love, I missed you dearly!

39
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,848
Remember how we agreed
on a steamy night tonight?

40
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,269
You cannot say that in front of them.

41
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,648
- Let us hurry.
- Sure.

42
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,734
Sorry, but I must bolt first.

43
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,319
See you around.

44
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,363
Right, I hear you.

45
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,408
I have also been counting the days.

46
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,793
Deok-su, did you get caught?

47
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,003
What? Of course not.

48
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:58,631
Really? Then what was
with those handsome lads?

49
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,592
There is no way I got caught.

50
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,594
I wonder why.

51
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,766
What if you end up getting kicked out?

52
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,685
What? No way.

53
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:14,230
Anyway, you saved me, Gu-sil.

54
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,819
We have been in cahoots for so long
that our teamwork was on point.

55
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,407
Hey, why are you changing the subject?

56
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,410
I did not do such a thing. Come on.

57
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,788
- What was that odd mood I sensed?
- What?

58
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,375
Why were the handsomest men in Joseon
acting like rivals

59
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,252
with you between them?

60
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,880
Not with me, but with you of all people.

61
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,215
Cut the nonsense and get going.

62
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:47,430
You turned a maiden into a taken woman.

63
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,307
For that, I deserve an explanation.

64
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,729
I do not get to see fine men every day.

65
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,815
Gu-sil, what is this?

66
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,693
You used to pester me
to marry you, remember?

67
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,696
Do not be ridiculous!

68
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,074
Wait for me.

69
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,950
Hurry up, then.

70
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,660
Link yours with mine.

71
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:10,953
Yes, my love.

72
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,791
- I cannot wait to see Mother.
- Come on.

73
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,768
We meet again.

74
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,399
Consider it consolation money
for Hong Deok-su.

75
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,784
Are you the one who invited us?

76
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,537
I have no business with you.

77
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,913
It is still not too late

78
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,249
to leave with Hong Deok-su.

79
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:02,046
Is that why you showed up out of nowhere
and gave me money?

80
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,841
You must get far away
from Yongcheonru as soon as possible.

81
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,309
What exactly…

82
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,105
are you saying?

83
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,159
What are you doing?

84
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,585
I will be waiting.

85
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,255
- Pardon?
- Why would you wait for my mother?

86
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,549
Then…

87
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,569
Deok-su.

88
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,363
I almost forgot.
I made reservations at Dohwa Hall.

89
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,784
Goodness me. Dohwa Hall?

90
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,328
The place that transforms anyone

91
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,247
into Joseon's greatest beauty
Park Chun-hui?

92
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,958
Yes. That Dohwa Hall.

93
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,669
I made reservations for you.

94
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,547
Be pampered with Mother.
I will pick you up afterwards.

95
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,758
You heard him, Mother. Let's go.

96
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,385
Yes, Mother. Go on.

97
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:34,764
Come on.
Your hands will be soft and smooth again.

98
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,808
Goodness me.

99
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,394
- Try these.
- Sure.

100
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,652
Hong Deok-su is betrothed.

101
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,363
What a shocking revelation.

102
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,864
Tell me about it.

103
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,367
I was extremely shocked.

104
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,706
Jun-hwa, did you not say you had feelings

105
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,167
for a woman?

106
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,253
Right. What?

107
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,798
That I did. Yes.

108
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:13,302
- But the confession earlier--
- I was practicing.

109
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,266
I was testing out
that line you recommended

110
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,726
on Hong Deok-su.

111
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,270
You were practicing?

112
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,356
She is more likely to say yes
the more I practice.

113
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,943
Right, of course.

114
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,789
Has your family
not been pressuring you to wed?

115
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,918
In my case,

116
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,964
my elders will someday
settle on a wife for me.

117
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,554
Goodness. I feel bad for you.

118
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:02,101
My father also micromanages me
in every aspect of my life.

119
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,478
If only I could date someone
of my choosing.

120
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:09,150
Then do you plan on marrying
this woman you like?

121
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,073
If I could, I would.

122
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:17,867
Cheon Jun-hwa.

123
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,661
Come to me if you ever need my help.

124
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,663
I will help you the best I can.

125
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,749
Thank you, Eun-ho.

126
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,671
If we had met
under different circumstances,

127
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:34,634
we would have become the best of friends.

128
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,804
I thought we were already good friends.

129
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,100
Was I the only one being sincere
all this time?

130
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,815
You are right. We are friends.

131
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,824
True men do not pat each other
on the back.

132
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,088
<i>He is an envoy from Qing.</i>

133
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,595
The Qing envoy is here
to celebrate Prince Seonyang's birthday.

134
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,680
Without telling me,

135
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,017
he invited an envoy for Prince Seonyang?

136
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,823
Go ahead and drink that up.

137
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,960
My lady.

138
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,922
Pack me the herbs of this drink.

139
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,842
Who would you gift
these expensive herbs to?

140
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,345
An envoy arrived from Qing.

141
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,306
For the crown prince appointment ceremony?

142
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,476
Something is off.

143
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,521
Even Prince Muyeong is nowhere to be seen.

144
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,192
I need it as an excuse
to visit Yongcheonru.

145
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,653
- Yongcheonru?
- Yes.

146
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,655
Just pack me the herbs.

147
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:22,825
And also the fine wine
we recently received.

148
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,120
Then take me with you.

149
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,348
HI-MO
DOUBLE THE HAIR

150
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,730
They have been falling out
like leaves in the fall.

151
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,983
You are the big tree of Yongcheonru.

152
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,486
It is only natural
for that many leaves to fall.

153
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,406
What good does being
the big tree of Yongcheonru do

154
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,950
when I am close to losing
the hair on the lid?

155
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,785
Allow me to inspect.

156
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,665
Why you…

157
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,085
Darn.

158
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,962
Do not fret.

159
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:21,884
I will present a magnificent hairpiece
just for you, Lord Cho.

160
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,470
Let me see.

161
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,598
Get me a geun and a half of hair.

162
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:31,018
And a ja and a chi long.

163
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,646
As for color, dark brown number two.

164
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,233
Now, all you have to do is wait.

165
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,780
You are the only one who understands
the pain of those going bald.

166
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,255
Mother, it tastes like honey.

167
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,929
Right. It is honey and adlay.

168
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:10,182
This is next-level bullshit.

169
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,560
We have on our faces
what is a luxury to consume.

170
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,980
Who cares when it is free?

171
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,481
Just enjoy it.

172
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:24,655
Now I know why noblewomen
have clear skin that glows.

173
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,589
No one could tell.

174
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:45,509
Right. It looks like my own hair.

175
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,595
This is the me I remember.

176
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:51,515
The big tree of Yongcheonru!

177
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,101
I am impressed.

178
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,311
Thank you.

179
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,230
Thank you. Goodness.

180
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,457
Keep up the good work.

181
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,260
- My lady, we were not expecting you--
- You have a free bed, no?

182
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,846
- Well…
- Unbelievable.

183
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,808
Dohwa Hall is not how it used to be.

184
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:38,896
It is now frequented
by all kinds of riffraff

185
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:42,149
and is no longer luxurious or posh.

186
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,202
<i>Deok-su,</i>

187
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,787
will you come with me?

188
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,170
Hong Deok-su is…

189
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,506
a woman?

190
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,260
No way.

191
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,932
There is no way.

192
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,059
They could not have found out.

193
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,106
What on earth?

194
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,609
What are you doing here?

195
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,987
I had something to ask.

196
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,451
Let go first.

197
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:35,828
What is it?

198
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,122
Do you perhaps…

199
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,001
have a female…

200
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,549
relative?

201
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,719
No, I do not.

202
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,932
It is just me and my mother.
Why do you ask?

203
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,976
I saw a woman who looked like you.

204
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,394
That being said…

205
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,106
Clerk Hong Deok-su.

206
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,735
Yes, Grand Proprietor Cheon.

207
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:17,244
So, has your mother arrived?

208
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,997
Yes, she is currently at Dohwa Hall.

209
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,836
I wanted to greet her in person,
but I guess I was late.

210
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,798
And why are you also here?

211
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,468
No reason, Lord Cheon.

212
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,770
I will head inside to escort my mother.

213
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,731
Sure. I will come by
to greet her tomorrow.

214
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:46,774
Yes, my lord.

215
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,408
Who could you be looking for?

216
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,749
I heard you were looking for a woman.

217
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,710
Shall I look into it for you?

218
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,171
It is none of your business.

219
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:15,052
You are also at the age to be wed,

220
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,805
which must have prompted
your interest in women.

221
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:56,218
You. Go find out where the Qing envoy
is staying. Be quick!

222
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,636
Yes, my lord.

223
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,330
What?

224
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,002
Wait, Eun-ho!

225
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,254
No two men should do that.

226
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:03,053
Why are you playing hide and seek
with the Minister of War?

227
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,597
It is not your concern.

228
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:09,268
Unbelievable. You have a weird way
of thanking someone.

229
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,980
Thank you.

230
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,733
Just so you know,
I would have hidden just fine on my own.

231
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:23,615
Either way, all this mischief
keeps me entertained.

232
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,326
Get away from me, will you?

233
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,829
Hush, or he will hear us.

234
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,083
Seriously?

235
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,134
Halt.

236
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,066
My lord.

237
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,737
You. It is you from before.

238
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:05,949
Please spare my life!

239
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,454
I could let you keep your life

240
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,290
if you do as I say.

241
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,252
Lead the way.

242
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,968
Give me that.

243
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,429
Open the door.

244
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,686
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

245
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,492
Fine wine.

246
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,870
One that is exquisite.

247
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,177
Did you confirm it?

248
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,180
I must look for another way.

249
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:22,442
Look for Kim Du-pal
whose name is on this poster.

250
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,655
I must meet him in person.

251
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,282
Yes, I will, Your Highness.

252
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:40,043
GEUMUI CHAMBER

253
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,675
My Deok-su.

254
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:50,679
You are the smartest in all of Hanyang.

255
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:59,729
If you are drunk, Gu-sil,
just quietly go to bed.

256
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,858
Hong Deok-su.

257
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:07,529
As if you know what it is to be in love.

258
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:13,577
The fluttering of the heart.

259
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:18,957
Do you know how it feels
to have your heart tickled with love?

260
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:28,008
You should live as a woman now.

261
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,927
Life is too short.

262
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,105
Gu-sil.

263
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:50,322
When your heart is tickled
and it flutters at the thought of someone…

264
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,408
is that love?

265
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,379
But you see…

266
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:13,553
I do not have the luxury
to harbor romantic feelings for another.

267
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,272
YONGCHEONRU

268
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,032
Did your talk with Deok-su go well?

269
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,159
What? Oh, right.

270
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,746
You said you would be talking to Deok-su.

271
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,042
It flopped miserably.

272
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:46,670
What?

273
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,672
Was flopping even an option?

274
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,716
Confessing something
is harder than I thought.

275
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,097
Hold on.

276
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,725
- Did you confess your feelings to Deok-su?
- Yes.

277
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:06,940
Eun-ho taught me a line
that has worked on countless women.

278
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,321
It was in the wrong order.

279
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,990
What? What order?

280
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:19,035
You should have told her
you knew she was a woman first.

281
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,871
She is living as a man for some reason,

282
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,957
but you outright
confessed your feelings for her.

283
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,750
No one would accept that.

284
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,176
Then, have I not been rejected yet?

285
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,389
Of course!

286
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,601
Su-ra, have you confessed your love
to someone before?

287
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:47,063
Eun-ho gave me some pointers,
but I need a new strategy.

288
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,565
That right there is the issue.

289
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,651
Strategizing how to get the girl?

290
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,197
How should I go about it then?

291
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,075
- What should I do?
- The world is a mess.

292
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,285
Tell me.

293
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,329
Good morning, fellas.

294
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:05,206
Here comes another strategist.

295
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,667
Have at it together.

296
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:12,464
Did Deok-su sleep
at Geumok Hall last night?

297
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,840
How would I know?

298
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:16,009
But he is your roommate.

299
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:20,180
He must be enjoying himself
since his betrothed is visiting.

300
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,767
A steamy night when they have not wedded?

301
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,102
What has this world come to?

302
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,857
Goodness.

303
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:33,860
Sorry about that.

304
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:37,405
I said something inappropriate
to an innocent young man.

305
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:38,740
"Innocent"?

306
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,076
Roar!

307
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,704
Call me a beast.

308
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,290
As in a tiger?

309
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:54,547
Where did it all go wrong with you two?

310
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,390
Su-ra, you must help me out.

311
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,682
Forget it.

312
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,285
I was almost late.

313
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,121
You're here.

314
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,167
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

315
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,002
Right, I see.

316
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:37,799
Running late when you are
a rookie clerk? Unbelievable.

317
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,218
He is a disgrace
to us clerks at Yongcheonru.

318
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,515
- Are you coming from Geumok Hall?
- What?

319
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:49,519
Yes, Gu-sil and I
enjoyed some wine last night.

320
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,564
Your betrothed that they talked about?

321
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,903
What has the world come to?

322
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:03,700
I mean, how come
you have a betrothed, Deok-su?

323
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,285
Stop it.

324
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:09,497
The manly Hong Deok-su.
It calls for a celebration.

325
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,790
What?

326
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:15,128
What? Oh, right. Yes, of course!

327
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,922
I am the manly Hong Deok-su.

328
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:22,594
Performing the duties of a man last night
left me exhausted.

329
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:25,096
- Oh, is that so?
- Whatever.

330
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,390
You must be worn out.

331
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,641
That is enough.

332
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,315
DAILY ASSIGNMENTS

333
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:38,359
Kim Myeong-ho, Maeng Seok-sam,
and Min Du-sik to Chinyeongrae.

334
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:42,238
Hong Deok-su, Lee Eun-ho, Ko Su-ra,
and Cheon Jun-hwa to Jeongju Hall.

335
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,450
A guest at Geumok Hall
has dismissed breakfast thrice already.

336
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,996
Now, get to your stations.

337
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,331
- Yes, my lady.
- Yes, my lady.

338
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,097
This is not it!

339
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:16,189
I will serve another soup.

340
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,537
Where is Deok-su?

341
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,081
He went to work ages ago.

342
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,295
How much wine did you two have last night?

343
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:45,718
A bowl of your soup and rice
would sort my stomach right out.

344
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,430
Of course.

345
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:53,434
I should make some for Deok-su
before I leave.

346
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,687
Please make some.

347
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,605
Please?

348
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,113
Where do I remember him from?

349
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,366
I have definitely seen him before.

350
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,077
What are you mumbling about?

351
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,162
Wait.

352
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:15,874
Let me think.

353
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,127
Who was he again?

354
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,046
I must enter the palace,
so have my attire ready.

355
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,632
What for?

356
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,176
Prince Seonyang's appointment ceremony.

357
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,471
Did you think I would be going there
to play board games with His Majesty?

358
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:34,309
Now that I have entertained
the Qing envoys,

359
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,060
he cannot delay it any longer.

360
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,689
There is a limit to using Prince Muyeong
as an excuse.

361
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,652
Him! It was Prince Muyeong!

362
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,070
My goodness!

363
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,949
It finally came to me.

364
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,536
What the… What about Prince Muyeong?

365
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:58,249
Guess who I saw at Yongcheonru yesterday?

366
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,469
Prince Muyeong was there.

367
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:10,720
What?

368
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:14,807
But I wonder why he was dressed
in a clerk's uniform.

369
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:18,895
No wonder I could not
put two and two together.

370
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,160
I knew it.

371
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:39,499
Those cunning rascals.

372
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,383
May I?

373
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,514
My gosh! Damn it.

374
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:59,102
This smells incredible.

375
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,312
What could be your secret?

376
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,690
All I do is boil everything.

377
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:08,444
If I had brought enough ingredients,
I would have offered some to everyone.

378
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,654
Well…

379
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:13,992
I cannot believe
I forgot the radish water kimchi.

380
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,368
- Move.
- But…

381
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:18,371
Mother, where are you going?
You do not even know your way!

382
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,041
Goodness gracious.

383
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,960
Are you kidding me?

384
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:27,338
He does not want soup with meat
or one with clams.

385
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,466
I know he is a guest from a foreign land,
but I can only do so much!

386
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,760
The dried radish greens
kept their original scent.

387
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,721
Its richness is divine.

388
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,562
- You startled me!
- Likewise!

389
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,398
Hold on. What is this?

390
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:48,943
Some random woman was making it.

391
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,865
Why? What is it?

392
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,888
This reminds me

393
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,598
of my mother in Qing.

394
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,893
It is delicious.

395
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:32,320
Who stole the soup I made for my son?

396
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,326
Damn it.

397
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,582
Do not look at me like that.

398
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,251
I do not know anything. It was not me.

399
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,798
That gaze is wrong.

400
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:52,715
Mother?

401
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,342
Goodness, Deok-su.

402
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:57,887
You must be his mother.

403
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,139
Hello, I am Cheon Jun-hwa.

404
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,432
Hello, madam.

405
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,351
Are you Deok-su's friends?

406
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,691
What are you doing in Jeongju Hall though?

407
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:15,238
Right! Before I had to go home,

408
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:18,658
I made a bowl of soup for you to enjoy,

409
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,828
but some rascal stole it
without saying anything.

410
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,413
What is with the ruckus?

411
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:28,417
This is the one you want.
He stole your soup.

412
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,890
An order for not one extra bowl
but 100 more?

413
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,517
Forget it. No way.

414
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:49,564
Of course. Why work
when you are here to rest?

415
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,690
Decline.

416
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,861
Hong Deok-su, hey.

417
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,279
Help me out this once.

418
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,032
How dare you keep calling
my son like that?

419
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:05,121
He is not just anyone
but the Director of Hospitality.

420
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:06,414
He is of high rank here.

421
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,349
Team Meat, to your posts!

422
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,228
Team Vegetable, to your posts!

423
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,940
All right. Let us begin!

424
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,602
Smells incredible!

425
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,659
Mother, you only had to ask.

426
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:25,618
Here you go.

427
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:28,454
You are of good use being tall and all.

428
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,958
I am also strong.

429
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:37,463
Mother, sit tight
and just order me around.

430
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,468
Thank you for being
a good friend to Deok-su.

431
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,345
Nonsense.

432
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,556
I am Deok-su's closest friend
in Yongcheonru.

433
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,310
And it will stay that way,
so put your faith in me.

434
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,853
Do not be cheeky, Jun-hwa.

435
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:05,992
Damn that man.
He ate every drop of the soup.

436
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,328
What did she say?

437
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,289
She said, "Damn"…

438
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,333
She said it was a special soup and rice.

439
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,546
Mother.

440
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,091
This sorted me right out.

441
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,346
He was not able to eat well
being away from home,

442
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,015
but he thoroughly enjoyed this.

443
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,351
He has a sophisticated palate.

444
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,485
GEUMUI CHAMBER

445
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:56,000
You all did a good job. Please enjoy.

446
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,586
You are the one who worked the hardest.

447
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,297
This reminds me of home, Mother.

448
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,090
Is that so?

449
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,051
Swing by whenever you want more.

450
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,804
I can gladly offer
Deok-su's friends a bowl.

451
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,144
Goodness.

452
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:19,023
Stop nibbling like a squirrel
and eat huge mouthfuls.

453
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,492
Goodness. Are you all right?

454
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:30,576
Water.

455
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,871
Goodness me. Here you go.

456
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,004
Thank you.

457
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,218
Mother.

458
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:52,723
Mother, dig in. You worked hard all day.

459
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,352
Watching you all eat
is enough to satisfy me.

460
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,234
I only hope you continue
to be good friends.

461
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,529
Do not worry, Mother.

462
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,243
Of course. Once a friend, always a friend.

463
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,918
Please help Deok-su

464
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,712
when he is in need.

465
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:30,845
Of course, Mother. I am the man to trust.

466
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,724
Cut it out and dig in already.

467
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,518
That temper of yours.

468
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,146
My love,

469
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,982
listen to your mother.

470
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,986
Your love?

471
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,157
You are all awfully talkative today.

472
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,450
Dig in.

473
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,702
Go ahead.

474
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,829
Him and that temper of his.

475
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:03,502
Please do not make a big deal when
his temper happens to lead to mistakes.

476
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,504
We are well aware of that.

477
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,341
Hey. As if you know how sour I can be.

478
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:15,306
Underneath all that is a delicate soul.

479
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,434
We are aware of that as well.

480
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:29,361
I am truly relieved to know that Deok-su

481
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,989
has great friends looking out for him.

482
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,053
You dug yourself a cave here

483
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,305
to play king, I see.

484
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,351
It is only a mere painting.

485
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,521
Maybe I should send one to your residence.

486
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:07,191
How sly and cheeky of you.

487
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:11,111
This is none other than treason.

488
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:13,489
That it is.

489
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:17,493
If I recall, you stood beside me.

490
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:20,871
You are not even bothering
to hide your transgressions.

491
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,166
Are you reckless or just that stupid?

492
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:29,255
So, what brings you by today?

493
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,435
Prince Muyeong is at Yongcheonru,
is he not?

494
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,690
I know all about it.

495
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:54,405
I figured you knew.
Are you saying you did not?

496
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,864
What?

497
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:58,701
You dare to trick me
after keeping mum all this time?

498
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,080
This is fine tea. Please enjoy.

499
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,833
I did not come here to idly have tea.

500
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,460
To enjoy fine tea,

501
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:11,797
one must wait for it to infuse.

502
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,341
As is the case with everything in life.

503
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,221
Do not change the subject!

504
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,018
Have Prince Muyeong
and Lady Do-gyeong's engagement

505
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,394
held at Yongcheonru.

506
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:27,229
What?

507
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,481
Is that not what you wanted?

508
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,696
Once Prince Muyeong marries
into your family,

509
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,824
no one will be able to challenge you.

510
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:43,329
The royal family
will be under your own roof.

511
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:54,757
It will be the event of the century,
so do not worry.

512
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,641
How could I agree to that
when he is of the royal family?

513
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,351
There is an order to things.

514
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:09,021
His Majesty must approve of it first.

515
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:14,109
The order of things
can easily be shifted around yourself.

516
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:22,242
I believe you still have the sword
found at the murder scene.

517
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,212
Your Majesty,

518
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,676
I apologize for my negligence.

519
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,010
Please forgive me.

520
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:46,433
I was too engrossed in Prince Seonyang
becoming crown prince and his birthday

521
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,561
to properly notice your concern.

522
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:55,484
All of that is negligence on my part.

523
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:01,990
What are you so elaborately prefacing?

524
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,746
Prince Muyeong is at the age
to take a wife.

525
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,916
He must wed soon

526
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,794
to further stabilize the royal line.

527
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:17,047
I will call for candidates
when it is time.

528
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,384
Of course you could,

529
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:24,012
but it is the trend
among youngsters these days

530
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:28,934
to date and wed those they meet
in casual settings.

531
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:35,190
I will summon my niece from Onyang.

532
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:43,031
Who are you to interfere
with the duty of the Internal Court?

533
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,825
The palace law shall not be ignored.

534
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:58,839
Bring it in.

535
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:46,553
If Prince Muyeong gets investigated
as a suspect of a murder…

536
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:53,685
it will surely ruin the reputation
and authority of the royal family.

537
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:57,773
Murder? I warn you to watch your words.

538
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,694
This is hardly easy on my part.

539
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:07,032
However, since the evidence
speaks for itself,

540
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:09,159
we must find a way.

541
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,705
Times like this call for a distraction.

542
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,374
By a distraction,

543
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:19,044
you mean his wedding?

544
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,932
Should Prince Muyeong become family,

545
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:34,977
I will have to take action.

546
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:36,937
I…

547
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,858
will surely find a way.

548
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,447
Minister…

549
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,992
With your approval,

550
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:55,414
I will first proceed
with their engagement.

551
00:47:56,748 --> 00:48:00,836
The ceremony will be held at Yongcheonru.

552
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:24,901
Your Highness.

553
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:30,032
Is the one who put up the poster in there?

554
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:32,492
Yes. Shall we?

555
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,007
Lady Seol.

556
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:31,385
Did you find Hong Jae-on?

557
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,012
Why are you--

558
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,264
I asked if you knew where Hong Jae-on was.

559
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:42,604
Did Grand Proprietor Cheon
have you put up the poster?

560
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,649
Where on earth is Hong Jae-on?

561
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:49,152
Is it not the brass key
that you actually seek?

562
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:54,449
What happened 12 years ago?

563
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:55,534
Please tell me.

564
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,628
Because of the one
who chased the brass key,

565
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,298
a family was ruined.

566
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,388
As in Hong Min-sik's family?

567
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:22,018
What significance does the key have
that it led to a family being ruined?

568
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,480
You yourself are looking for it as well.

569
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:31,611
So tell me.

570
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,406
Will you make the same choice

571
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:37,033
to obtain the brass key?

572
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:44,875
The brass key may be of great value,

573
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,169
but it cannot outweigh a human life.

574
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:52,424
I am only in search of it
to set everything straight.

575
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,514
To set everything straight?

576
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,986
Does His Majesty share your sentiment,
Your Highness?

577
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,956
Your Highness Prince Muyeong.

578
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:34,716
How long have you known?

579
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,719
Please forgive me

580
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:41,056
for putting your intentions to the test.

581
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,016
What do you mean, you tested me?

582
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,727
I am the one who sent

583
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,563
the drawing of the key to the palace.

584
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,317
What is your true intention?

585
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:58,323
There is someone precious to me
that I must protect.

586
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,661
Were you somehow involved
with that family?

587
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:07,749
Look into the incident from 12 years ago
involving the brass key.

588
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,544
That is the priority.

589
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:39,364
I invited you here to be pampered,

590
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:41,575
but you spent the day working.

591
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:47,998
As long as I am with you,
I am happy whatever I do.

592
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,252
Likewise.

593
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,011
I must ask, though.

594
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:02,262
Mother.

595
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,388
Yes?

596
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:09,895
Tell me it will be all right.
It has been a while since I heard it.

597
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:13,732
You know what.

598
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:17,360
When I used to wake up at night crying,

599
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:22,574
you would tell me that I was safe
and that it would be all right.

600
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:30,957
Mother.

601
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,253
It will all be all right.

602
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:41,176
So do not worry too much.

603
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:49,017
Your child Hong Deok-su
will make sure of it.

604
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,022
Sure.

605
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:04,950
It will be all right.

606
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:09,955
You will be all right.

607
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,348
Help me.

608
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:31,267
Please, help me.

609
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:35,855
Find Hong Min-sik's daughter, Hong Jae-on!

610
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,068
Little one.

611
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,238
It will be all right.

612
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:45,115
I will protect you.

613
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,952
You will be all right.

614
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,544
Plague patients!

615
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:07,095
I heard it was mayhem last night.

616
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,388
What happened?

617
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,890
Hong's family in Namchon was annihilated.

618
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,476
Annihilated? By whom?

619
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,978
As if anyone could know.

620
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:18,773
No one saw the assailants,
for they hid behind masks.

621
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,525
- What a scary world this is.
- I know.

622
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,677
Those who survived must carry on.

623
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:51,097
It will be all right.

624
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,433
You will be fine.

625
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:58,104
It will be all right.

626
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:09,908
Absolutely.

627
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,619
It will be all right.

628
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:24,047
It will be all right.

629
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,937
<i>It is still not too late</i>
<i>to leave with Hong Deok-su.</i>

630
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,856
You must get far away
from Yongcheonru as soon as possible.

631
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:44,192
I will be waiting.

632
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:51,658
Mother, let us visit Dohwa Hall once more.

633
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,618
Was the adlay facial
not an absolute treat?

634
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:59,707
Mother, where are you going?

635
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:10,969
Halt.

636
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,401
Is your mother leaving today?

637
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:30,113
Yes. I appreciate the invitation.

638
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:35,577
I heard she had to make
100 portions of soup and rice yesterday.

639
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:40,081
So tell me.
How should I pay for her trouble?

640
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,753
Ten nyang per portion will do.

641
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:49,174
I did not know a bowl of soup and rice
was that pricey.

642
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,594
Her soup at the market is only five jeon,

643
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:55,054
but one served at Yongcheonru
should be of higher value.

644
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:01,478
Is it because it will never
be served here again?

645
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:06,065
Humans are wired to desire
what is considered pricey.

646
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:09,861
Especially within Yongcheonru.

647
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,448
You sure are a cheeky one.

648
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,757
You wanted to tell me

649
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,344
who is after my Deok-su.

650
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,388
Can you tell me now?

651
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:49,442
I have horses ready for you
at the back gate.

652
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:52,654
Bring Hong Deok-su with you
as fast as possible.

653
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:55,949
If you do not act quickly, Deok-su…

654
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,619
I mean, Jae-on will die.

655
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,224
Deok-su!

656
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,350
Deok-su.

657
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:24,269
Deok-su…

658
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,938
Are you Hong Deok-su's mother?

659
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:43,705
I should have greeted you sooner,
but I am only now getting the chance.

660
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:48,501
I am the proprietor here at Yongcheonru.

661
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:53,506
Plague patients!

662
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,966
You cannot enter.

663
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:04,642
Did you find the girl?

664
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:06,519
Forgive me.

665
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:27,749
Goodness. Are you not feeling well?

666
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,294
No, I am fine.

667
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:34,130
Do not work yourself too hard.

668
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:39,177
Yongcheonru is in huge debt to you
for the soup you made.

669
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:44,265
Right.

670
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:48,561
It is sad to hear
you will be leaving today.

671
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:50,813
We will meet again.

672
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:10,500
Gu-sil!

673
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,960
Gu-sil!

674
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:16,964
Mother, what is it? What happened?

675
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:20,385
Bring Deok-su here this instant!

676
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:21,886
What for?

677
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:26,057
- It is him. Him!
- What?

678
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:29,143
Get going already!

679
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:30,728
All right, Mother.

680
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,118
I told you to get Deok-su…

681
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:49,580
Why are you in such a rush?

682
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,716
Could there be an urgent matter?

683
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:04,429
Of course not.

684
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:08,099
What brings you to this room?

685
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:09,434
Well…

686
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:15,523
There is something
I forgot to tell you earlier.

687
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:18,568
What could that be?

688
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:28,244
You raised your son
to be a fine young man.

689
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:31,205
He is a talent I wish to keep at my side.

690
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:35,126
You are too kind.

691
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:41,674
You have done
the greatest deed imaginable.

692
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:45,803
You even saved him from the plague.

693
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:51,267
It must not have been easy…

694
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:55,188
to raise a girl as a boy.

695
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,626
The second piece of this brass key.

696
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:20,379
Is it in Hong Deok-su's possession?

697
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:32,725
It was you.

698
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,354
You hid Hong Jae-on 12 years ago

699
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:40,316
and nursed her back to health.

700
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:48,908
Do not lay a finger on my baby.

701
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,212
Do you know how much blood

702
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:04,507
has been painted
on these hands because of you?

703
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:09,220
The sky will punish you for this!

704
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:12,181
The sky will punish me?

705
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:17,311
The sky and I are one and the same.

706
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:38,207
Deok-su!

707
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:41,168
Hong Deok-su!

708
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:56,017
I ran all the way here
after hearing you urgently needed me.

709
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:59,353
But earlier,
she was urgently looking for you.

710
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:02,356
Mother, are you asleep?

711
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,900
Unbelievable.

712
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:12,491
Mother.

713
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:27,006
Mother.

714
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:29,675
Mother, wake up.

715
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:34,764
Mother?

716
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,894
Mother, open your eyes. Mother?

717
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,732
What is it, Deok-su?

718
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:51,739
Gu-sil, get me the physician! Hurry.

719
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:55,409
- What? Right.
- Mother, open your eyes.

720
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:57,995
Mother. Oh, no.

721
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,081
Mother, Deok-su's here. Open your eyes.

722
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:02,333
Mother, come on.

723
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,628
Mother, no.

724
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:08,798
Mother?

725
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,759
Mother, you must stay awake.

726
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:13,761
Gu-sil went to fetch the physician.

727
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:16,055
Deok-su.

728
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:17,014
Yes.

729
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:23,270
Him.

730
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:26,315
It was him.

731
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,651
Him as in who?

732
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:32,738
The one who chased you to kill you.

733
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:36,742
It is the grand proprietor of Yongcheonru.

734
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:42,123
You must get to safety.

735
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:15,823
Mother.

736
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:19,035
Mother, wake up.

737
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:24,623
Mother…

738
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:28,085
Mother.

739
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:29,670
Mother!

740
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,175
Mother, no!

741
01:07:34,258 --> 01:07:36,552
Mother, what is wrong?

742
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:39,430
<i>Open your eyes, Mother.</i>

743
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:44,268
<i>Mother, please!</i>

744
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:47,772
<i>Mother…</i>

745
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:12,088
Well, I hope you gave your mother
a proper send-off.

746
01:08:13,714 --> 01:08:18,094
Maybe you should rest longer
to recuperate from the wearing funeral.

747
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:21,639
It is all right.

748
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:26,435
I feel terrible.

749
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:29,897
One would never expect a healthy lady
to meet a sudden death.

750
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:37,321
I wish to get revenge.

751
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:40,116
Revenge?

752
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:44,120
My mother…

753
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:48,082
was murdered.

754
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:49,500
Murdered?

755
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:51,877
By whom?

756
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:56,132
Someone

757
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:59,301
stabbed my father to death 12 years ago.

758
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:05,474
And now my foster mother.

759
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:09,645
Someone stabbed your father to death?

760
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:11,772
Who--

761
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:12,982
Seol Mae-hwa.

762
01:09:17,611 --> 01:09:19,196
It was Lady Seol Mae-hwa.

763
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:28,205
That means your father is…

764
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:34,670
Min-sik of the Hong family.

765
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:39,550
He was my father.

766
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:42,303
Are you his--

767
01:09:42,386 --> 01:09:44,555
Yes, I am…

768
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:04,867
Hong Jae-on.

769
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:43,322
<i>This vengeance is mine.</i>

770
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:45,783
I will serve you in every possible way.

771
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:48,535
<i>I heard there would be</i>
<i>a royal engagement banquet at Yongcheonru.</i>

772
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:50,955
<i>That day, I will obtain what I desire.</i>

773
01:10:51,538 --> 01:10:54,875
<i>This revenge of mine</i>
<i>will garner everyone's attention.</i>

774
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:56,168
Hong Jae-on.

775
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:59,296
<i>The more I see you,</i>
<i>the more I see myself in you.</i>

776
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:01,674
<i>Mae-hwa, come on in.</i>

777
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:03,676
<i>Are you still feigning ignorance?</i>

778
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:06,470
<i>Why did you not tell me that Hong Deok-su</i>

779
01:11:06,553 --> 01:11:08,264
is Hong Min-sik's daughter?

780
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:11,725
The Minister of War demanded
that you be betrothed.

781
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:14,728
Let him proceed
with the engagement banquet.

782
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:16,939
<i>The Minister of War is a sly wolf.</i>

783
01:11:17,022 --> 01:11:20,985
<i>A clash between Prince Muyeong</i>
<i>and the Minister of War…</i>

784
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:23,279
From beginning to end.
My engagement banquet must be grand.

785
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:25,990
<i>I would not mind</i>
<i>one of them suffering a fatal blow.</i>

786
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:26,907
What is with him?

787
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:28,450
You asked to see me?

788
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:29,910
Where do you stand?

789
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:31,620
Choose to stand behind me instead.

790
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:35,374
<i>Listen to me carefully.</i>
<i>There is a lot to be done.</i>

791
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:36,667
<i>My revenge…</i>

792
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:39,628
<i>has just begun.</i>

793
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:43,716
