1
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,793
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,128
FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,518
This is bad.

4
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,165
What do we do now?

5
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,301
Are you all dressed?

6
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:34,844
Yes, I am almost done.

7
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,679
You should have just let me help you.

8
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:37,764
We must hurry.

9
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:42,143
How could I when I am a man
and you are a woman?

10
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,979
You must hurry.
The guest will be here soon.

11
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:46,815
Okay.

12
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,105
Cut across the garden
to reach the front gate.

13
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:30,150
As soon as you do, run.
Do not ever look back.

14
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,410
This stone step is loose. Secure it.

15
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,660
Hong Deok-su…

16
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,933
Where are you going?

17
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,610
Is there anything wrong?

18
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,615
The guest is inside.
Where on earth are you going?

19
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,665
Forgive me. This is a gift for the guest.

20
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,626
That is not the right way. Follow me.

21
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,627
Yes, ma'am.

22
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,325
"A gift for the guest"?

23
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,369
Did she just refer to Deok-su as a gift?

24
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,454
I heard that as well.

25
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:52,125
Excuse me. I must get back.
Our guest does not like to wait.

26
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,591
Reinforce security here.

27
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,722
Eun-ho.

28
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,931
Eun-ho, where are you going?

29
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,809
Eun-ho.

30
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,276
Both the innkeeper
and the grand proprietor are here.

31
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,488
I have hit the jackpot now!

32
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,243
Please excuse me.

33
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,663
I should go and deal
with the commotion inside.

34
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,334
Hong Deok-su…

35
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,461
Where are you?

36
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,547
Elementary Room,

37
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,550
I will send you all home this time.

38
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,433
- What are you doing?
- Stop it.

39
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,852
Are you apprentices from Gyohwa Hall?

40
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,487
Bow.

41
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,324
Someone was dragged inside.
Do not stop me. We have no time to waste.

42
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,410
Are you saying you rascals
plan to just walk in there?

43
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,620
What did you say?

44
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,706
- Watch it, Eun-ho.
- Stop it.

45
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,087
Do you not know
that everyone at Yongcheonru must be

46
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,423
ready to give up anything
if the guest desires it?

47
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:27,011
I get you are a sly merchant,
but how could you sell off a person?

48
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,471
"A sly merchant"?

49
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,266
Forgive us, my lord.

50
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,353
We have held you up for too long
when you must be quite busy.

51
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:45,029
Have you already forgotten
why you are here?

52
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,866
If you have,

53
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,494
ask yourself to be reminded

54
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,539
of why you came to Yongcheonru.

55
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,935
Lady Seol, the guest…

56
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:21,274
I believe it would be better to offer
my greetings after the gift is presented.

57
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,192
Yes, ma'am.

58
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,281
My lord, allow Yongcheonru
to present its gift for you.

59
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,825
Would you like to see it now?

60
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,456
Let us go inside.

61
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,336
Just do as you are told.

62
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,978
Once we climb over this wall,

63
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,439
we will be responsible
for what happens next.

64
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,524
But we cannot give Deok-su up

65
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,276
to the lecherous geezer.

66
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,613
We should be fine, right?

67
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,115
Even the grand proprietor is here.

68
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,497
That is why I must go as well.

69
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,709
After all, we are
the manly Elementary Room.

70
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,127
Right.

71
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,046
Let us go.

72
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,050
Now?

73
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,294
Take off the cloak and set it down.

74
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,151
Hey. Hello?

75
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,611
Gosh.

76
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,823
So much for "manly." Goodness, be careful.

77
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,558
Lift up your skirt and spin once.

78
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,655
Lift it higher.

79
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,723
Take off your socks.

80
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,642
Pardon?

81
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,868
Next, show off the undershirt.

82
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,078
What?

83
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,080
Do not make me repeat myself.

84
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,373
Take it off.

85
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,241
Take it off this second!

86
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,092
You cannot do this.

87
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,220
- Even if you are a guest…
- What?

88
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,906
Stop this instant!

89
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,034
Who are you?

90
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,168
Jun-hwa? Su-ra?

91
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,672
And who are you two?

92
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,883
Do you all have a death wish?

93
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,096
How dare you set foot here.

94
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,725
It seems we have committed a great sin
against the esteemed guest.

95
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,898
How shall I proceed?

96
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,568
Shall I go to the lady of the household
and inform her of our wrongdoing?

97
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,153
What?

98
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,865
She strictly forbade all male presence
in her vicinity before marriage.

99
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,077
Unfortunately, we failed to prevent
no less than three from entering.

100
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,913
It seems you and I need
to offer up our necks.

101
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,165
Lady Seol…

102
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,129
The guest?

103
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,470
Get rid of it.

104
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,972
These garments were to be mine,

105
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,808
but you have sullied them

106
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,810
and caused such a commotion.

107
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,228
They are now worthless.

108
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,816
You should not be out here.
Please go back inside.

109
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,609
You cannot reveal your face--

110
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,324
It was not some old geezer?

111
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:43,340
Leave us now.

112
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,228
Do you know what you just ruined?

113
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,149
She is Yongcheonru's most esteemed guest.

114
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,068
You all just ruined a showing
of our special garment for her.

115
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,321
Our apologies, Lady Seol.

116
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,824
We heard of a noble who threw
a fit at the sight of male clerks.

117
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,326
So?

118
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,663
Did you think you could save Hong Deok-su
by climbing over a wall and eavesdropping?

119
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,751
Did it not occur to you that
your foolishness could cause more harm?

120
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,589
Even the most esteemed guest should not be

121
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,799
allowed to physically assault
another person.

122
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,473
To change the ways of Yongcheonru,

123
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,268
become its proprietor.

124
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:42,608
I am sure you all came here
with your own aspirations.

125
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,653
First, grow your influence.

126
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,574
There is nothing more useless
than rage without clout.

127
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:10,803
Hong Deok-su.

128
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:14,306
Lady Seol saved both of us today.

129
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,519
No, not just us.
She saved everyone in the Elementary Room.

130
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,481
Yes, ma'am.

131
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,860
Be thankful. Remember her mercy.

132
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:30,823
Yes, ma'am.

133
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:37,162
I hear Do-gyeong went
to Yongcheonru again.

134
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:41,208
She should just quietly stay home
and receive her bridal lessons.

135
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,169
As if she is a moth
and Yongcheonru is the flame…

136
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:48,465
You need to let her run free sometimes
if you want her to be obedient later.

137
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:52,344
She cannot even leave
the grounds of Yongcheonru anyway.

138
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:56,098
And what if she meets
a man at Yongcheonru?

139
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,642
No. There is no need for concern.

140
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,479
She has a strict chaperone
always by her side

141
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,399
who keeps away any and all men.

142
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:10,029
That fiery temper of hers
will get her in trouble and some more.

143
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,699
As if she would ever be some little lamb.

144
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,869
You are…

145
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,164
just too kind.

146
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:24,710
You are helplessly soft.

147
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,963
Do you know how big a fortune

148
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,799
Do-gyeong inherited
after my brother passed?

149
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,595
I should at least pretend
to treat her well

150
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,305
until that money becomes mine.

151
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,224
That young thing is
burning through the money.

152
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,226
There will be nothing left for us.

153
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,482
Maybe we should

154
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,859
get her married quickly.

155
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,155
We cannot keep waiting for Prince Muyeong

156
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,907
to return from Onyang.

157
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,950
- Should we do it immediately?
- What?

158
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,538
Wait… That is a great idea.

159
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,253
If we marry her off to Prince Muyeong,

160
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,547
the big obstacle standing in the way

161
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,217
of Prince Seonyang's appointment
will be gone.

162
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,221
Goodness me. You are the best.

163
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:22,518
How can you be so clever?

164
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,565
You have no idea how ingenious I am.

165
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,821
There is a reason
why I am sitting here today.

166
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,871
ELEMENTARY ROOM

167
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:58,470
She strictly forbade all male presence
in her vicinity before marriage.

168
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,557
Unfortunately, we failed to prevent
no less than three from entering.

169
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,309
It seems you and I need
to offer up our necks.

170
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:08,021
Lady Seol saved both of us today.

171
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,031
Goodness me… You even got to see me

172
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,909
prancing around in a skirt today.

173
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,452
Gosh.

174
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,497
About earlier… Thank you, Eun-ho.

175
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,041
I told you to not be so reckless.

176
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,378
Now, you even cause havoc
in women's clothes.

177
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,464
That is why you got slapped
in that ugly face of yours.

178
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,092
Darn it. What did you say?

179
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,679
What?

180
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,108
Rubbing it on your cheek should help.

181
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,112
Ice is known to help with bruising.

182
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,563
I am off to take a stroll.

183
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,648
Where are you going?

184
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:36,235
Wait, I hear icing helps with bruising…

185
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,244
He should do it before this melts.

186
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,875
What is going on between you and Deok-su?

187
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,754
Nothing is going on.

188
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,883
You were ready to kill
each other on day one.

189
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,762
The two of you fight like cats and dogs
whenever you two cross paths.

190
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,306
But when you heard he was in danger,

191
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,934
you hopped over a wall
and charged in straightaway.

192
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,103
That is not nothing.

193
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,815
I was only trying
to protect what I had to.

194
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:15,857
Right.

195
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,652
What exactly were you protecting?

196
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,867
Probably the same thing
you were trying to protect today.

197
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,752
That is nice.

198
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,757
Kim Myeong-ho.
You did that on purpose, did you not?

199
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:41,675
What?

200
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:44,094
We ended up in this mess
because you lied to Deok-su.

201
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:48,265
Why? Did something happen in there?

202
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,352
It sounds like I missed quite a spectacle.

203
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,940
If I catch you messing around again,

204
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,901
I will not let it slide.

205
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,992
How dare he slam this down…

206
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,706
Now…

207
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,584
That is nice.

208
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,800
He really is something else.

209
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,392
Yes, sir?

210
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,936
Is Apprentice Lee Eun-ho inside?

211
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,573
<i>The grand proprietor is asking for you.</i>
<i>Go and see him.</i>

212
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,161
Welcome, Prince Muyeong.

213
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,122
No…

214
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:38,625
Maybe I should address you
as Apprentice Number 28?

215
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,502
What is all this?

216
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,463
How dare you!

217
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,758
Who do you think you are?

218
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,471
They say even foxes act
like kings of their burrows.

219
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:55,100
Yongcheonru is my home,
so I am the king here.

220
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,309
Such insolence!

221
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,359
Forgive me, Your Highness.

222
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,787
I did not even properly welcome you

223
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,540
after bringing you to my shabby home.

224
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:23,545
So I prepared a feast like the one
you must have had in the palace.

225
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,797
Please have a seat.

226
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,138
Since you have so graciously prepared it,

227
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,849
I shall accept it.

228
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,155
So, have you achieved your goal here?

229
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,243
Well…

230
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,871
I am halfway there.

231
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,627
I should be able
to complete it soon enough.

232
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:10,008
You have achieved so much
during your stay in Gyohwa Hall.

233
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:12,010
How commendable.

234
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:13,637
Then,

235
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:17,140
when do you expect
to accomplish the remaining half?

236
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,518
For the remaining half…

237
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,481
Grand Proprietor Cheon, I seek your aid.

238
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:27,609
You do not need to ask.
Just say the word, Your Highness.

239
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,069
I have plenty of resources.

240
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:36,326
I have learned so much
since coming to Yongcheonru.

241
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,953
My goodness.

242
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:42,082
I am beyond touched to hear
that it has been of service to you.

243
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,128
At this rate,

244
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,423
you will have no issue
becoming an official clerk.

245
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,013
I hear the last exam is coming up soon.

246
00:25:57,097 --> 00:26:02,143
I am sure you are not concerned
in the slightest about passing it.

247
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,106
Of course.

248
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,692
I shall make sure to pass it

249
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,777
and achieve my goal.

250
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:15,532
His Majesty must feel
so reassured to have you.

251
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,220
There was an incident at Jakyakjae?

252
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,977
But that clerk never messes up.

253
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,439
My apologies, Lady Seol.

254
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,610
We cannot always stop the troublemakers
before they strike.

255
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:56,614
Is it those Elementary punks again?

256
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:58,867
My goodness.

257
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:03,330
We have upset
the Minister of War's favorite niece.

258
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,707
What are we to do?

259
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,882
To calm down a hissy cat,

260
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,010
you must throw it a new plaything.

261
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,973
Hospitality is to hold
the last exam, is it not?

262
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:23,725
Pardon?

263
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:31,274
Finally, this is the last group exam.

264
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,486
Introducing the flower of Yongcheonru,
Director Yu Su-in.

265
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,910
Hospitality's exam is the last exam

266
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,370
for a good reason.

267
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,375
Ta-da. What do you think?

268
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,461
Is it not amazing?

269
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:52,629
CLERK EXAM CERTIFICATE

270
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:59,511
If you pass this exam,
you will officially become clerks.

271
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,139
However, this certificate
will only be given

272
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:07,185
to the group that graciously displays
the utmost hospitality until the very end,

273
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,687
and it shall be rewarded
by the guest you serve.

274
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,733
You must do whatever it takes

275
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,485
to charm our esteemed guest.

276
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,447
Now, here are
our esteemed guest's requirements.

277
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:31,251
First, you may never directly look
at the guest's face.

278
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:35,547
Second, only one from each group
may serve our guest at a time.

279
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,091
- Third, you must run over…
- Who do you think it is?

280
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,676
An esteemed guest. Are you deaf?

281
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:40,677
Shut up.

282
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,304
Fourth,

283
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,224
you may never refuse
any of our guest's requests.

284
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:48,643
Fifth…

285
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,772
Thank you for agreeing to take on

286
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,275
the troublesome task
of evaluating this exam.

287
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:59,779
Perhaps, you can take this chance
to teach them all a tough lesson.

288
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,657
"A tough lesson…"

289
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,785
This will be fun, thanks to you.

290
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:10,790
All the apprentices are male.

291
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,751
If His Excellency finds out…

292
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,628
This is a personal request
from the innkeeper of Yongcheonru.

293
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,472
I must give it my all
if it is the innkeeper's request.

294
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,725
They will arrive shortly, right?

295
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,237
We are done for.

296
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,824
Of all people,
it is the guest from yesterday.

297
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,596
The water should be heated up for an hour

298
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,431
and cooled off for 15 minutes.

299
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,560
This is our last exam.
We cannot give up now.

300
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,728
Of course.

301
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,814
We are the Elementary Room, after all.

302
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,985
Watch your spit.

303
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,740
We have heated it up for an hour
and let it cool for 15 minutes.

304
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,158
This should be good now.

305
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,243
Yes.

306
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,036
Well done, Su-ra.

307
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,621
But who should carry it in?

308
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,211
- I shall give it a try.
- No.

309
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,880
- Why not?
- Your tone, for one.

310
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,049
What is wrong with my tone?

311
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,552
I speak in the same tone as all of you…

312
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,095
Do I not?

313
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,890
And considering yesterday's incident…

314
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,811
I can do it.

315
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,527
I shall take it in.

316
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,071
We need to pass this exam.

317
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:23,840
Chin up, Su-ra.

318
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:25,758
- You got this!
- Chin up!

319
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:44,861
This water is too cold.

320
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,738
Do you want me to freeze to death?

321
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,453
This water is too hot.

322
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,079
Do you want me to get a burn?

323
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,344
Who said to sprinkle sesame seeds?

324
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,932
<i>My parrot is a picky eater.</i>

325
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,309
<i>You may only feed it freshly picked fruit.</i>

326
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,772
Hey, parrot.

327
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,638
Expert Room, you pass.

328
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,521
What is wrong with this bedding?

329
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,982
This pillow is simply too high.

330
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:37,140
Will we ever get a pass from her?

331
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,268
There is no hope for us.

332
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:47,817
Eat it.

333
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:00,955
He is right. Let us eat first.

334
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,915
We shall eat up and go back to battle!

335
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,877
Here. Go on.

336
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:20,767
What exactly happened yesterday
when you went to fetch that snack?

337
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,734
Walk away while you still can.

338
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:31,861
Hong Deok-su.

339
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,865
We are all suffering right now
because of you.

340
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,954
Kim Myeong-ho. You really are garbage.

341
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,041
Who is the liar here?

342
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:48,127
What? You are the idiot
for falling for it.

343
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,964
What? Hey!

344
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,817
Hold on.

345
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,029
Did you return late yesterday because…

346
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,366
Tell me.

347
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,119
Now.

348
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,036
Tell me now!

349
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,246
What are you doing?

350
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,462
What are you so curious about?

351
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,679
I can explain it all to you.

352
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:44,892
Forget it.

353
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,021
Let go of my hand.

354
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,571
Fine.

355
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,324
I will hear the details another time.

356
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:29,896
Ko Su-ra.

357
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,984
You must be so happy
about your first-ever friends.

358
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,986
Your face is just glowing.

359
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,487
Hey, Kim Myeong-ho.

360
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,199
I assume you are scheming again.

361
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,034
Just leave our Elementary Room alone.

362
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,827
"Our Elementary Room"?

363
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,708
I just cannot wrap my head around it.

364
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,836
How did you all manage
to safely walk out of Jakyakjae yesterday

365
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,963
after you hopped over that wall?

366
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,591
Are you just outright confessing
to lying now?

367
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,343
How suspicious.

368
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:03,554
You all must be hiding some secret.

369
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:07,391
Why? Are you curious?

370
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:12,772
A friendless brat like you
will never know.

371
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,861
Could that secret possibly be…

372
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:21,864
Hong Deok-su?

373
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:23,950
What about him?

374
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,118
What? Is it not?

375
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:29,372
It is just that there are
so many suspicious things about him.

376
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,916
Ko Su-ra.

377
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,462
Think carefully.

378
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,272
Parrot,

379
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:58,192
I hope your owner can forgive me.

380
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:05,574
Our Elementary Room really needs
to pass this exam.

381
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,871
Take some pity on me.

382
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,585
You were born a bird but never get to fly.

383
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,921
Your life is just as tragic.

384
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,340
Move aside.

385
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:24,885
What is the matter, ma'am?

386
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,887
You cannot do anything right.

387
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,265
What is with this fruit?

388
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,100
Go and fetch fresher ones.

389
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:35,521
Yes, ma'am.

390
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,844
His Excellency
has been informed that you are here,

391
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,429
and he is displeased.

392
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,890
Let me take care of that.

393
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,503
What…

394
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,840
Where did your parrot go?

395
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,926
It seemed happy to fly away.

396
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:48,594
Pardon?

397
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,723
By chance, did you…

398
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:54,767
No, right?

399
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,146
You go and find it.

400
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,439
Ma'am!

401
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,733
Why are you taking things so far?

402
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,778
If you cannot,
Yongcheonru will be held responsible.

403
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,571
- But--
- You may leave.

404
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:22,211
- Parrot!
- Parrot!

405
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,922
Parrot!

406
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:27,716
Parrot!

407
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,884
Darn it.

408
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,013
This is ridiculous.

409
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,225
She freed it.
How are we supposed to find it?

410
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:39,061
- Parrot!
- Parrot!

411
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,938
Parrot!

412
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:44,483
Darn it… Where on earth is it?
How will we find it?

413
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,278
Are you tired already, Deok-su?

414
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:51,031
What do you mean? I am not.

415
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,908
Let us continue pushing forward!

416
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:58,247
If you think about it,
it is a good thing for the parrot.

417
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,502
It can make some new bird friends.

418
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,426
After being locked up in that cage,

419
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:14,013
it must be nice to finally be free
to fly across the sky.

420
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:04,605
A sword with a dragon engraving…

421
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:08,359
It must be a sword
that is only given to princes.

422
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,841
How are you faring with your cold?

423
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:37,054
What brings you all the way here,
Minister of War?

424
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:45,312
You should toss out the medicine
Lord Cheon brought you.

425
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,649
This is wild ginseng from Taebaek.

426
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,403
You should see signs of recovery
if you take this.

427
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,991
Thank you for looking out for me.

428
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,953
Who else would look after you,
Your Highness?

429
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,463
Are you looking for something?

430
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:14,925
No, Your Highness.

431
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:20,806
Have you been practicing
your swordsmanship recently?

432
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:25,144
I have been unable to
without anyone to sharpen my blade.

433
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:26,186
Pardon?

434
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:28,606
I see.

435
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,402
Shall I sharpen it for you?

436
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,794
Then,

437
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,173
I shall leave it to you.

438
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:09,897
If you ever find the time,
I would also enjoy a sparring lesson.

439
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:11,607
Sure.

440
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,817
Of course, Your Highness.

441
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,328
The Minister of War

442
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:27,915
keeps getting more and more disgraceful.

443
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:33,796
Should Prince Muyeong marry
the Minister of War's niece,

444
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:36,465
Prince Seonyang will be
the next crown prince.

445
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,134
Do you believe so?

446
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:44,056
Is that why you sent him that gold?

447
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:52,689
I should have enough foresight
to serve you properly

448
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,858
without you spelling everything out for me

449
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,194
if I wish to remain worthy of this seat.

450
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,242
Be cautious at all times.

451
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:05,869
Not making an enemy
out of anyone is the trick

452
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,872
to navigating and climbing up in politics.

453
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:14,169
The Minister of War will not wait.

454
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:18,173
He will do what he must
to find Prince Muyeong.

455
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:24,430
They may seem like they are
doing whatever and whenever they wish…

456
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:29,518
but they are all still
in the palm of my hand.

457
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,167
Is this supposed to be my parrot?

458
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,127
I will find your parrot,

459
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,213
even if it takes me all night.

460
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,383
It is just a comforting placeholder.

461
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:26,116
I thought it would be less lonely
if it had a friend.

462
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:41,757
Ma'am.

463
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,259
May I show you something amazing?

464
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,264
Here we go.

465
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,060
These are dice.

466
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,230
Ma'am.

467
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:00,400
Would you like to wager a bet with me?

468
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:03,111
A bet?

469
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,114
The loser has to grant the winner a wish.

470
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,535
Are you scheming to pass the exam?

471
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:12,663
Gosh… It would be nice
if you gave us a pass.

472
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:14,540
However,

473
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,041
that is not my wish.

474
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,378
If I win,

475
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:23,090
please go on a night stroll with me.
What do you say?

476
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,426
Why would I go on a stroll with you?

477
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:30,430
Going on a stroll might help us
cross paths with your parrot,

478
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,307
who is busy exploring the world.

479
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:40,607
If you do not wish to do that,
you just need to win.

480
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,033
Two nyang.

481
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,369
I see your two and raise you four.

482
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:54,997
Are you kidding me?

483
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:57,666
I am out.

484
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,260
Hey.

485
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,304
- Yes, sir?
- Sir?

486
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,351
Has anyone seen Hong Deok-su take a bath?

487
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,980
We wash up here, so we do not know.

488
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,025
And you, Sang-u?

489
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:27,112
I do not think I have…

490
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:33,869
Even during the game, he adamantly
refused to take his shirt off.

491
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,039
That is right.

492
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,968
So that maiden was indeed…

493
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,772
Yes, it was definitely Hong Deok-su.

494
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,946
We will know
once we check for ourselves. Right?

495
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:30,717
Here I go.

496
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:39,893
No. That was a practice round.

497
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:41,353
That is quite amazing.

498
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:43,855
Who taught you such a skill?

499
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,276
Ma'am, it is Seol Mae-hwa.

500
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:57,994
What brings you by at this late hour?

501
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:03,583
I overheard your laughter outside.
It has been so long since I have heard it.

502
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,002
It seems you were enjoying
some sort of fun game.

503
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,170
Do you want to try?

504
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,132
This boy is quite talented.

505
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,844
Were you entertaining her?

506
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,806
Yes, ma'am.

507
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:20,100
It is fine.
Come here and throw them once more.

508
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:32,988
Dice-rolling.

509
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,953
Do you know this game as well?

510
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,080
Of course.

511
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,540
A long time ago, I…

512
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,382
Go on and throw them again.

513
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:54,885
Yes, ma'am.

514
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,193
Brace yourself, ma'am.

515
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:15,697
I will win, no matter what.

516
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,826
I will win, no matter what.

517
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:39,679
Since I won,
you must now grant me my wish.

518
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,395
You seem to be enjoying yourself.

519
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:52,108
I shall keep this a secret
because today is your last day.

520
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,401
What do you mean?

521
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,487
His Excellency sent someone.

522
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:59,115
You are to travel to Onyang
tomorrow morning.

523
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,368
Onyang? Why would I go there?

524
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,662
That is where Prince Muyeong is.

525
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:06,998
His Excellency would like you
to go there and meet him.

526
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:15,423
I understand. You may leave now.

527
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:41,950
I will win, no matter what.

528
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:44,327
To make a wager
that will guarantee your victory,

529
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,999
switch to a game you are better at.

530
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,341
<i>Like this?</i>

531
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,307
It cannot be.

532
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,151
Hong Deok-su.

533
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:21,323
Since you won,
I shall grant you your wish tonight.

534
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,373
ELEMENTARY ROOM

535
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,960
Now, is everyone ready?

536
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,559
My lady?

537
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:58,401
First, we will split up into three.

538
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:18,588
My lady! Please stop!

539
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,053
Stop!

540
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,977
<i>Su-ra, you will be the distraction.</i>

541
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,603
Must I dress up as a maiden?

542
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,565
My apologies. I mistook
your palanquin for someone else's.

543
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:57,919
<i>While her chaperone chases after</i>
<i>Su-ra's palanquin,</i>

544
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:01,006
we shall climb over the wall
and head to the lake.

545
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:25,113
<i>Eun-ho, you must prepare</i>
<i>the perfect setting for an outing</i>

546
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:27,323
<i>before Her Ladyship arrives.</i>

547
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:33,580
Does everyone understand?

548
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,419
Move it. Just move aside.

549
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:40,378
Move.

550
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:45,383
Those punks are
finally going to blow it up.

551
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:48,845
Patiently keeping
an eye on them has paid off.

552
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:51,222
Should I report them to Lord Cho now?

553
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:55,894
Do that.
I shall share this news with Seong-jin.

554
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:02,525
Elementary Room. You are all finished.

555
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:07,989
Who goes there?

556
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,123
Go. I will try to distract them.

557
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,584
We are of similar stature.
I would be a better decoy.

558
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:23,171
Make sure to safely escort
Her Ladyship to the lake.

559
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:28,927
Over there!

560
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:30,428
Here I am!

561
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,266
Let us go.

562
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,998
What is taking them so long?

563
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,503
Hey, Eun-ho!

564
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:47,505
What the?

565
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,050
Are they not here yet?

566
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:52,969
What are you talking about?

567
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:55,388
Were you not escorting her here
with Jun-hwa?

568
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:59,100
Well… We got caught
as we were climbing the wall.

569
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,188
We split up there to avoid getting caught.

570
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,522
That was exhausting.

571
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,150
I barely got away.

572
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,705
But why are they not here yet?
They should be here by now.

573
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:30,798
I guess I am a bit hungry
because I just ran too fast.

574
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,223
Pumpkin taffy.

575
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:41,309
Impressive, Lee Eun-ho…

576
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:42,936
How did you know I like it?

577
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,613
I guess I am really hungry.

578
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:55,907
My hand is shaking, gosh.

579
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,619
It is fine. I have more.

580
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,913
Here.

581
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,418
Thanks.

582
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:18,429
Gosh.

583
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:21,432
It is really nice here.

584
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:45,665
The stars are pretty,
and so are the fireflies.

585
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,793
Just wait quietly.

586
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:56,884
Hey.

587
00:59:57,802 --> 01:00:00,096
Why do we not catch
some fireflies for the lantern?

588
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,264
Her Ladyship would like that.

589
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:03,266
That is too much hassle.

590
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:13,192
How should we catch them…

591
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,301
Hey, look!

592
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:43,598
Here is one…

593
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:03,660
We got it.

594
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:05,787
Yes.

595
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:25,640
Well…

596
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:36,651
Hey.

597
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,362
Look.

598
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,584
Lady Seol, it is Seong-jin.

599
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,753
Come in.

600
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:05,555
Ma'am, we have a serious issue.

601
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,599
You are needed at Jakyakjae right now.

602
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:23,364
What a beautiful place.

603
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:25,867
Will I ever see it again?

604
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:36,377
Just one step out,
and it is a whole new world.

605
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:42,550
The gates are open now.

606
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:44,969
You should choose
a new path for yourself, my lady.

607
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:50,725
And where does your path lead to?

608
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:59,817
I hope it leads you
to the world you desire.

609
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,404
Thank you, my lady.

610
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:11,078
And…

611
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:14,624
you can stop looking for my parrot now.

612
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:17,418
I already got rid of its cage.

613
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:20,963
And what about you?

614
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:24,967
Let us head back now.

615
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,402
I shall now escort you, my lady.

616
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,253
What a mess…

617
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,631
If the Minister of War
finds out about this,

618
01:04:04,423 --> 01:04:06,133
I am as good as dead.

619
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:08,594
Do not worry.

620
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:11,514
Our Director of Management has found her.

621
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:13,307
They should be here shortly.

622
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:16,769
You just need to safely escort her
to Onyang tomorrow morning.

623
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:31,742
My lady!

624
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:34,954
What happened?

625
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:35,997
What in the world?

626
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,666
- And what are you wearing?
- Move aside.

627
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:53,848
You should go inside.

628
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:56,267
Stay back. I shall walk in on my own.

629
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:58,603
My apologies, Lord Cho.

630
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:01,981
You have suffered greatly
because of my apprentices.

631
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:05,860
I am really getting sick
and tired of you, Elementary Room.

632
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:09,030
Do you even realize what you have done?

633
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:11,908
What should we do about them?

634
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:19,540
Hong Deok-su. It is you once again.

635
01:05:20,374 --> 01:05:23,461
Tell me. Why did you do this?

636
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:34,639
It is…

637
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:39,018
all my fault.

638
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:41,395
It was my order.

639
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:46,484
You told me to pass those
who satisfied me with good hospitality,

640
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,320
so I tested them.

641
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:54,325
I shall now make my final decision.

642
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:59,246
Before you make such a decision,

643
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:00,957
you should punish Elementary Room

644
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:03,709
for breaking the rules, my lady.

645
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,711
They only carried out my order.

646
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:09,507
Do not punish them, Lady Seol.

647
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:16,472
I shall honor your wishes.

648
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:21,352
I have been quite unreasonable.

649
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:24,438
All of you are commendable clerks
for going above and beyond.

650
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:28,442
Expert Room shall pass
for excellent hospitality.

651
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:34,240
And Elementary Room shall also pass
for figuring out what my heart desires.

652
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:38,869
I choose both Expert and Elementary

653
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:40,246
to pass.

654
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:53,759
Elementary Room cannot pass!

655
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:04,895
They do not even have
the right to be tested.

656
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,065
Therefore, their passing is also invalid.

657
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,903
Kim Myeong-ho!
What do you think you are doing?

658
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:14,113
Hong Deok-su!

659
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:19,744
He is a girl.

660
01:07:35,676 --> 01:07:36,761
This wench dared

661
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:39,638
to deceive Yongcheonru!

662
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:43,726
And she dared to take the apprentice exam.

663
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:53,402
She deserves the harshest of punishments.

664
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:56,113
Kim Myeong-ho. Shut that mouth of yours.

665
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:57,782
Hong Deok-su.

666
01:07:59,116 --> 01:08:01,202
Confess in front of everyone now!

667
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:56,066
<i>Flowers!</i>

668
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:09,622
<i>From now on,</i>

669
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:12,208
<i>you shall live as a boy.</i>

670
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:15,211
No one can know you are Hong Jae-on

671
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:17,421
or that you are a girl.

672
01:10:17,504 --> 01:10:18,631
Do you understand?

673
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:37,042
<i>We just need evidence</i>
<i>that proves he is a girl.</i>

674
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:39,670
<i>- Irrefutable evidence!</i>
<i>- Kim Myeong-ho…</i>

675
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:42,047
<i>We need to get our revenge on them.</i>

676
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:44,341
Did it not go according to your plan?

677
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:47,219
<i>We must trap her and catch her red-handed.</i>

678
01:11:47,886 --> 01:11:49,972
<i>It is not over yet.</i>

679
01:11:50,055 --> 01:11:51,390
Trip.

680
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:52,516
- Trip.
- Trip.

681
01:11:52,599 --> 01:11:54,101
<i>Trip…</i>

682
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:56,020
Darn it.

683
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:58,230
It does not look like
she is going to bathe.

684
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,732
Dirty bastard.

685
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:03,485
Wash up already. You are dirty.

686
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:05,321
I am off to bathe. Do you want to join?

687
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:10,367
- <i>There is something I have not told you.</i>
- What?

688
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:12,119
What is wrong with you?

689
01:12:12,202 --> 01:12:15,664
<i>This is unlike you.</i>
<i>You were overly worked up.</i>

690
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:20,878
<i>Hong Deok-su.</i>

691
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:26,175
<i>I told you that a scar is not something</i>
<i>a man should be embarrassed about.</i>

692
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:30,679
<i>You do not need to go</i>
<i>out of your way to hide it.</i>

693
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:35,351
