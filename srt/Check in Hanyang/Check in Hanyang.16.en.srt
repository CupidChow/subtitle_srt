1
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,793
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,128
FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,556
Hong Deok-su!

4
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,271
Is anyone out there?

5
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,192
Where is the ledger?

6
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,864
This is all your doing.

7
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,576
If you had handed over the ledger,

8
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,080
Prince Muyeong would not
have defied me, his father.

9
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,375
Now, do tell.

10
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,669
Where is the ledger?

11
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,550
Are you still choosing to stay silent?

12
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,893
Royal Swordsman, begin.

13
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,272
Halt!

14
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,779
You cannot, Father.

15
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,031
Is this about the ledger?

16
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,658
- Eun-ho.
- Father.

17
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,161
You cannot cover up your mistake
with another wrongdoing.

18
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,413
Prince Muyeong!

19
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,499
Please.

20
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,919
Please. You must stop.

21
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,298
Step down from the throne, apologize…

22
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,510
and correct your wrongdoings.

23
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,725
Apologize?

24
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,480
Did you

25
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,192
just tell your father to kneel?

26
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:21,988
Step aside.

27
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,326
Are you truly choosing to defy me?

28
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,410
I…

29
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,665
cannot step aside.

30
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,882
Do not just stand there.

31
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,259
Remove my undutiful son this instant!

32
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,886
- Yes, Your Majesty!
- No, Father.

33
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,889
Father, please. You cannot. Father!

34
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,058
Father, you cannot. Please.

35
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,642
- Father!
- Eun-ho!

36
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,269
- You cannot, Father.
- Question her.

37
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,437
Father!

38
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,232
Tell me where the ledger is.

39
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,041
No!

40
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,218
She is my person.

41
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,097
I will

42
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,516
leave with her.

43
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,313
Please approve…

44
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,400
your son's

45
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,820
last request.

46
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,979
Since you are like family to Deok-su,

47
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,231
let me ask you a favor.

48
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,404
Leave the capital as soon as she awakens

49
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,615
and hide her someplace
as far away from here as possible.

50
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,216
I offered to take her in

51
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,677
so that she could rule the world,

52
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,472
but she repaid me by backstabbing me.

53
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:04,478
Like your father, you are sending yourself
to an early grave, Hong Deok-su.

54
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,984
<i>Cheon Mak-dong, your father,</i>

55
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,986
killed Hong Jae-on's father.

56
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,532
Do you wish to sever your precious ties
with that same sword?

57
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,703
Do you believe
Hong Deok-su was behind this?

58
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,510
Your father almost died
from poisonous centipedes.

59
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,644
Tell me what you know.

60
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,068
Seol Mae-hwa is back.

61
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,155
Seol Mae-hwa returned?

62
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,712
Why are you back?

63
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,050
Now that my father is
also after Deok-su's blood,

64
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,718
this is the only way

65
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,513
to protect her.

66
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:25,684
Are you saying
you only had Deok-su get to safety?

67
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,815
You yourself are no longer safe
at Yongcheonru anymore.

68
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,443
There is something I must do.

69
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,874
A major event will soon take place.

70
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,715
What you have been planning…

71
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:02,054
is it Prince Eunseong usurping the throne?

72
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,392
The plan has been in motion for a while.

73
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,770
Uiju Guild agreed to support us.

74
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,939
- In a few days--
- Let me…

75
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,319
be the justification of the coup.

76
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,409
Our intent

77
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,163
is to depose His Majesty.

78
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,833
My father and Grand Proprietor Cheon.

79
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,003
It is time to end their reign.

80
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:35,838
And I should do it.

81
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,551
That is the only way

82
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,262
to protect Deok-su.

83
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,274
Your Highness Prince Muyeong.

84
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:58,360
I did not expect to see you here.

85
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,076
It is a pleasure to see you, Mae-hwa.

86
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,832
You should have reported your return.

87
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:37,733
Jun-hwa.

88
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,198
I heard…

89
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,536
my father slayed his friend
with this sword

90
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,746
and obtained what we desired.

91
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:51,830
What?

92
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,333
What are you talking about?

93
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,383
Could I…

94
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,387
win Deok-su that way as well?

95
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,642
Get a grip on yourself!

96
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,353
Do not even speak
of what you could not do.

97
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,437
Why not?

98
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,983
Like father, like son, is it not?

99
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:25,072
Who says I cannot be like my father?

100
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,156
Do you mean that?

101
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,576
Would you slay your own friend?

102
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,705
Su-ra.

103
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,374
Do you also…

104
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,335
hate me?

105
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:52,391
Prince Muyeong,
seeing you with Seol Mae-hwa

106
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,685
sure comes as a surprise.

107
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:02,401
Was there something
you had to secretly discuss?

108
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,412
Where is Hong Deok-su?

109
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,750
I thought you had her by your side.

110
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,339
The poisonous centipedes she let loose

111
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,341
ended Director Cho's life.

112
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,637
Hong Deok-su and you, Seol Mae-hwa.

113
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,265
Did you think I would not know
about you scheming in my own house?

114
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,768
Seol Mae-hwa has been following my order.

115
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,313
She has been gathering members
of the royal court

116
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,273
to request my appointment as crown prince.

117
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,568
As crown prince?

118
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,612
This is me informing you…

119
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,575
that I will be the future king.

120
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,789
It will be done faster
now that you are here.

121
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:02,878
You said you would have Yongcheonru host
the crown prince appointment ceremony.

122
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,672
I guess it was not a joke.

123
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,132
A joke?

124
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,594
That position
has always been mine to fill.

125
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,265
May I assume you are telling me this

126
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,061
because you need the assistance
of the Cheon family?

127
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,775
No, this is me giving you an order.

128
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,451
It will be announced
to the ministers of the royal court.

129
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,203
That I, Prince Muyeong,

130
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,916
will become crown prince
and restore the order of the nation.

131
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,925
Of course, Your Highness.

132
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,179
The Cheon family will make preparations

133
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,306
and support your every move.

134
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,999
Find Hong Deok-su.
She must be outside Yongcheonru.

135
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,877
Capture her before she runs farther away.

136
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,961
Yes, my lord.

137
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,930
GEUMUI CHAMBER

138
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:43,103
Here. Eat up, will you?

139
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,648
For goodness' sake.
My bruises are yet to be healed, Mom.

140
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,944
How do you expect
to take over Yongcheonru being this weak?

141
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,072
Take over Yongcheonru?

142
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:54,823
Me?

143
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:56,867
What about Cheon Jun-hwa?

144
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,536
I came all the way to Hanyang

145
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,747
to place Yongcheonru in your hands.

146
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,915
But how?

147
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,878
We will get a new owner
of this world soon.

148
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,675
For offering the influence and riches
of our Uiju Guild,

149
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,178
we deserve to be given Yongcheonru.

150
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,681
Although, it still does not compensate
for you getting beaten up.

151
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,100
You are the best!

152
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,644
So stuff yourself with meat.

153
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:24,728
Guildmaster!

154
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,563
Guildmaster!

155
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,359
Goodness me.

156
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,736
Director Cho Seung-ryang is dead.

157
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,404
What?

158
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,616
He died from being bitten
by a poisonous centipede.

159
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:41,495
My gosh. He was not one
to meet such a futile death.

160
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,458
When our grand scheme
is about to be executed?

161
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,795
Where is Seol Mae-hwa?

162
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,802
Let us go.

163
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,649
Deok-su!

164
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:13,986
Eun-ho…

165
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,866
I really thought
something had happened to you!

166
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,244
Hey, Gu-sil.

167
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,831
Where is Eun-ho?

168
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,710
He left.

169
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,176
He left? Where to?

170
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:42,556
He told us to leave the capital
once you woke up.

171
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,266
Can you get up?

172
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,069
No way.

173
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,698
Is he at Yongcheonru?

174
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:02,826
Come on.

175
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,037
I have already packed our stuff.

176
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:09,041
Before that vile Grand Proprietor Cheon
finds you, we--

177
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,292
No.

178
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,753
Eun-ho cannot go alone.

179
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,173
He insisted

180
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,092
that I should hide you.

181
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,263
All that matters to him is your safety.

182
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:25,974
So do as he says.

183
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,271
Gu-sil.

184
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,067
I must go.

185
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,991
What do you mean?

186
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,203
I must protect him.

187
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,600
Deok-su.

188
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,728
Return in one piece.

189
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,813
What?

190
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,116
Did you not hear
how this place is haunted?

191
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,833
Oh, mighty spirit!

192
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,772
Goodness.

193
00:21:57,024 --> 00:22:00,068
You must be looking for someone.

194
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,960
Step aside, Jun-hwa.

195
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,339
You will become the crown prince?

196
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,723
It was you who said
Deok-su would be in danger by my side.

197
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,101
This is the only way to protect her.

198
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,519
With what power?

199
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,357
No matter how much
you wish to be crown prince,

200
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,027
you will fail
if the meritorious subjects object.

201
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,653
I am aware of that.

202
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,115
I cannot become the crown prince

203
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,078
nor should I ever ascend the throne.

204
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,245
What?

205
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,164
Then, why…

206
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,375
Because I wish to save her life.

207
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,671
Because I hope
this could atone for our sins.

208
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,175
Cheon Jun-hwa.

209
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,262
I do not know how we ended up this way,

210
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,597
but we both wish

211
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:15,185
to save someone
and atone for our fathers' sins.

212
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,275
For that alone,
I am risking everything I have.

213
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,070
If this fails,

214
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,031
I will have to pay with my life. However…

215
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,160
even if I do not succeed…

216
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,790
I trust that you will not harm Deok-su.

217
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,417
Jun-hwa.

218
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,878
Can you promise that?

219
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,386
I…

220
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,098
cannot.

221
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,433
I…

222
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,521
Forget it.

223
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,745
Prince Muyeong will hold a banquet?

224
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:17,956
Yes.

225
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,251
Could you be trying to double-cross me?

226
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,670
Of course not, Guildmaster.

227
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:27,757
We risked our lives
coming to Hanyang from Uiju.

228
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:30,177
The grand scheme cannot fail.

229
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:35,432
Prince Muyeong will only assist
our grand plan of action.

230
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:36,516
Forget it.

231
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:40,979
I will nip
any potential hurdles in the bud.

232
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,523
Do not worry.

233
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:47,319
I have gathered scholar-officials who are
hostile towards Grand Proprietor Cheon.

234
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,656
I have also had the troops
guarding the king and palace on board.

235
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,241
TROOPS GUARDING
THE KING AND THE PALACE

236
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,243
Good. But make haste.

237
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:59,164
We must have
every last one of them join our side.

238
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,253
As for Prince Muyeong…

239
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:09,758
Never mind.

240
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,594
You are dismissed.

241
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,353
Ko Su-ra.

242
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,443
The guest at Geumui Chamber
is asking for you.

243
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:29,527
Head over there.

244
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,133
I heard you asked for me.

245
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,515
Lady Seol!

246
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:11,236
I called you here
to ask for an important favor.

247
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,488
Do tell.

248
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,824
Even though
you will be helping your friends,

249
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,367
it will be risky.

250
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,537
It may even cost you your life.

251
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,124
May I ask this of you?

252
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,183
Listen, Director Jang.

253
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,603
What could you be hiding?

254
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,983
You have the wrong person.

255
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,406
What on earth?

256
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,159
Grand Proprietor Cheon.

257
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,831
Lord Jang!

258
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,335
What on earth is going on?

259
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,631
Please spare his life.

260
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,384
I do not know anything, Lord Cheon.

261
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,261
Please spare our lives.

262
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:23,224
What is Seol Mae-hwa scheming

263
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,143
with Uiju Guild in her corner?

264
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,066
You people from Uiju

265
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,985
dare to covet my Yongcheonru?

266
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,908
A coup!

267
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,915
They are planning a coup.

268
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,542
A coup?

269
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,547
A coup is being planned?

270
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,342
By Seol Mae-hwa?

271
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,512
I only did what I was told.

272
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,763
When will it take place?

273
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,099
That I truly do not know.

274
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,518
Please spare my life, Lord Cheon.

275
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,148
A coup?

276
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:17,153
The six ministries and their leaders
are in the palm of my hand,

277
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,696
but a coup?

278
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:27,247
I should have just killed her
a long time ago.

279
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,667
Would eliminating her…

280
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,255
solve your problem?

281
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,431
Director Cho is gone.

282
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:49,769
And if you lose me and Director Yu here,

283
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:55,775
how will you manage by yourself?

284
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,947
Grand Proprietor Cheon!

285
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,409
Do you actually believe

286
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:08,872
that Yongcheonru is being operated
all by yourself?

287
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,960
The three directors are the pillars,

288
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:19,257
and every one of the clerks is its tile.

289
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,969
If you kill us all,

290
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:29,392
who will run Yongcheonru?

291
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,788
Grand Proprietor Cheon
survived the poisonous centipedes.

292
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,041
Keep your eyes on him.

293
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,167
Yes, my lady.

294
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,547
- And Prince Muyeong?
- An assassin has been sent.

295
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,996
What do you think you are doing?

296
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,003
<i>Spare Prince Muyeong's life?</i>

297
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:40,797
Yes.

298
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,384
He has nothing to do
with what you are planning.

299
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,135
Yes, he does.

300
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,556
There cannot be two princes
when we are replacing the king.

301
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,640
One of them must die.

302
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:53,393
No, Prince Muyeong
is not interested in the throne.

303
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:54,477
Shut it.

304
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,146
I already gave you a chance
to leave with him.

305
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,358
You ruined it by coming back.

306
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,659
You are here to take Yongcheonru.

307
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,457
What did you just say?

308
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,127
I can give it to you.

309
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,213
How could you possibly
give me Yongcheonru?

310
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,300
Because its rightful owner

311
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,720
is me, Hong Jae-on.

312
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,020
You are the Hong family's
missing daughter?

313
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:39,939
Yes.

314
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,568
I have lived my life as a man

315
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,737
dreaming of my revenge.

316
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,825
I will take Yongcheonru back

317
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:54,037
and gladly hand it over to you.
In return…

318
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,039
Spare Prince Muyeong's life?

319
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:02,420
How can you prove
you are Hong Min-sik's daughter?

320
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,422
Guildmaster…

321
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:35,870
Wait.

322
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,873
Move.

323
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,334
It is the guildmaster's order!

324
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,844
Are you all right?

325
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,563
GANGNYEONGJEON

326
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,120
<i>She is my person.</i>

327
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:21,874
<i>I will leave with her.</i>

328
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,544
Please approve…

329
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,839
your son's

330
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,259
last request.

331
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,851
Grand Proprietor Cheon
requests an audience.

332
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,827
There will be a coup.

333
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,621
A coup?

334
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,834
Were you not aware
of the traitors within the palace?

335
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,337
Within the palace?

336
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,007
Who on earth…

337
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,677
Prince Eunseong is scheming
to take the throne.

338
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,392
Prince Eunseong?

339
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:25,563
This is why he should
have been eliminated 12 years ago.

340
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:30,860
I, Cheon Mak-dong,
will handle it on your behalf.

341
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,742
Come to Yongcheonru tomorrow
with the Royal Swordsman.

342
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,495
You…

343
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,831
What are you trying to do?

344
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,625
Please vacate the palace.

345
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,503
That way, you will not arouse suspicion.

346
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,548
I doubt you want to be known as the king

347
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:56,302
who killed his brother
and that brother's son.

348
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:03,851
I, Cheon Mak-dong,
will have blood on my hands for you,

349
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,270
so take my hand

350
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,107
while I am offering it to you.

351
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,495
Grand Proprietor Cheon.

352
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:26,707
Let us…

353
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,461
stop here.

354
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,388
You will relinquish the throne?

355
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,687
After everything I did to put you on it?

356
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,400
You cannot.

357
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:56,863
You heard me. I will not allow it.

358
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:47,205
Why did you come back?

359
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,586
What about you?

360
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,427
You cannot give up Yongcheonru.

361
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,308
It is your father's legacy he left you.

362
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:13,105
I was going to give it to you after taking
it back from Grand Proprietor Cheon,

363
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,191
- but for me--
- You also…

364
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,280
You also gave up the palace for me.

365
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,410
I…

366
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,873
promised to protect you.

367
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,084
Likewise.

368
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,213
I promised to protect you too.

369
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,953
SHARING DOUBLES YOUR JOY

370
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,375
One is…

371
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,504
useless without the other.

372
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,383
They must be together

373
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,094
for joy to double.

374
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,474
Eun-ho.

375
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,689
As long as I am with you…

376
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,485
I can endure anything.

377
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,535
Let us do that, then.

378
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:54,457
Whatever it is,
however dangerous it may be…

379
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,169
together…

380
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,797
we will overcome it.

381
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,990
Have you grown accustomed to the sword?

382
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,828
How long are you only going
to carry it around?

383
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,998
It is time to make up your mind.

384
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:47,968
At one point,
Hong Deok-su was your destiny.

385
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,053
However,

386
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,389
to have the world in your hands,

387
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,392
you must be willing to sever fates.

388
00:39:56,852 --> 00:40:00,106
We were once meant to be?

389
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,319
Hong Deok-su tried to kill me.

390
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,448
If we do not strike first,

391
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,492
she will harm us one day.

392
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,706
At times,

393
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:22,628
one must know when to abandon
what they wish to protect the most…

394
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:27,425
in order to gain in spades.

395
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,847
Abandon what I wish…

396
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,058
to protect the most?

397
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,362
Of course. I will do that.

398
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:56,662
Good.

399
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:59,957
I am glad to hear
you have made up your mind.

400
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,799
Finally, by tomorrow,

401
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,802
the entire world will realize

402
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,889
that I, Cheon Mak-dong,

403
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,975
was right.

404
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,204
So this is where you all were!

405
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:07,960
I heard it was Prince Muyeong
that had us gathered here today.

406
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,044
Is it true?

407
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,630
Could it mean that Grand Proprietor Cheon

408
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,216
chose him as the crown prince?

409
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,843
I am more curious

410
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,679
about why they are at Yongcheonru.

411
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,307
I am just as baffled.

412
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,560
They did not want to associate themselves
with the lowly Grand Proprietor Cheon.

413
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:27,771
Something about this does not feel right.

414
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:32,901
I am worried this is a foreshadowing
of some kind.

415
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,948
Is that not Lady Seol?

416
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:58,218
His Majesty the King has arrived!

417
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:05,267
His Majesty?

418
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,473
Thank you for accepting my invitation.

419
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,226
Today…

420
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:36,066
I gathered you here so that I may petition
for my crown prince appointment.

421
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:39,820
The crown prince?

422
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:40,946
What could he mean?

423
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,457
Prince Muyeong.

424
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,293
Have you finally decided?

425
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,093
Your Highness Prince Muyeong.

426
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:07,055
Before your major announcement,

427
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:10,434
allow me to present
the most precious gift I have

428
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:14,605
to you, who will ascend the throne,

429
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:20,027
which is the only son of this humble man,

430
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,778
Cheon Jun-hwa.

431
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:29,161
He will follow in my footsteps
and become Yongcheonru's proprietor.

432
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,246
The proprietor of Yongcheonru?

433
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,752
I must say I am baffled

434
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:40,797
since I also found
the true proprietor of Yongcheonru.

435
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:47,054
Father, it only seems right
that you and those of the royal court

436
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,640
draw a conclusion
after seeing her yourselves.

437
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,063
Let us decide…

438
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:01,026
who Yongcheonru truly belongs to.

439
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,028
Prince Muyeong,

440
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,489
that is enough.

441
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,868
Enter.

442
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:01,878
- Hong Deok-su.
- No.

443
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,382
My name is…

444
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,137
Hong Jae-on.

445
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,265
Cheon Mak-dong.

446
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:18,103
The friend
you brutally murdered 12 years ago…

447
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:23,775
I am Hong Min-sik's one and only daughter.

448
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,328
Did she say Hong Min-sik?

449
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,163
- Goodness.
- Hong Min-sik?

450
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,914
Gosh, that is what I heard too.

451
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,471
Father, today…

452
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:55,724
I will have to…

453
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,354
be gravely disloyal to you.

454
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,905
Twelve years ago,

455
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,324
a group of people

456
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:14,993
murdered the former king
to seize his crown.

457
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,580
- Prince Muyeong!
- I…

458
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,177
I am one of the traitors' son.

459
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,807
Goodness. Was it a murder?

460
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:39,476
He was a murderer?

461
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,898
To have my father take the throne,

462
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:48,276
this man poisoned the former king,
annihilated a family,

463
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,988
and killed an innocent mother. And now!

464
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,159
He is even trying
to eliminate the daughter.

465
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,749
Your Highness Prince Muyeong.

466
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,710
Before the heavens…

467
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:09,506
and all of the court officials
gathered here today…

468
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,510
I am accusing those guilty of treason.

469
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:22,728
Even after all the chances I gave you,

470
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:25,230
you will take it all the way?

471
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,232
Cheon Mak-dong.

472
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:32,362
Blinded by your greed,
you killed your own friend

473
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,905
and stole Yongcheonru.

474
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,701
You will now return it to Hong Jae-on.

475
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,207
You leave me with no choice.

476
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:46,918
Your Majesty.

477
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,172
Please give the order.

478
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:05,771
Your Majesty?

479
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:12,944
Royal Swordsman.

480
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:18,492
Royal Swordsman, arrest Prince Muyeong
for accusing His Majesty of treason!

481
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:24,998
Seize him!

482
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,135
That is enough.

483
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:46,812
Prince Muyeong.

484
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:53,109
I cannot afford to lose you too.

485
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:56,738
Father.

486
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,658
Rectify what you have done.

487
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:03,954
You could kill all the witnesses,
but you yourself still…

488
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:08,250
know the truth.

489
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:17,926
You put your trust

490
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:21,054
in the measly Prince Eunseong
to replace the king?

491
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,528
The one you wish to serve

492
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,864
no longer exists in this world.

493
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,213
Damn it!

494
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:57,716
Halt!

495
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:14,065
<i>It may even cost you your life.</i>

496
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,693
Does it involve
going against Grand Proprietor Cheon?

497
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:18,945
Yes.

498
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,074
If this requires me to risk my own life,

499
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:27,120
help Namhae Guild
regardless of the outcome.

500
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,667
I give you my word.

501
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,422
Also…

502
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:42,093
protect Jun-hwa and all of my friends.

503
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,270
Seize and arrest

504
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:54,189
- those impudent men.
- Yes, Your Highness.

505
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:01,863
The assassination
of Prince Eunseong failed.

506
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:06,576
What?

507
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:11,373
What did you do, you broad?

508
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,874
For 12 years,

509
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,503
ever since my mentor met a wrongful death,

510
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:19,214
I have never forgotten what you did.

511
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:23,051
I should have gotten rid of you
a long time ago.

512
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:24,803
Cheon Mak-dong.

513
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:27,889
Twelve years ago,

514
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,017
you murdered my father.

515
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,603
And you also killed my mother.

516
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,147
Pay for your sins with your life.

517
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:41,194
The Capital Defense shall arrest
all the traitors here!

518
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,626
My goodness. What do we do?

519
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:17,897
Royal Swordsman!

520
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,442
Stop!

521
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:25,655
Father.

522
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:29,617
Please…

523
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,747
consider my loyalty to you.

524
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,170
Your Majesty!

525
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,192
What…

526
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,076
Do not just stand there!

527
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,828
Slay them this instant!

528
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:14,913
Father.

529
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:24,631
Please stop.

530
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:26,716
Jun-hwa.

531
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:41,397
How can you prove
you are Hong Min-sik's daughter?

532
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,565
Guildmaster…

533
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,578
I will vouch for her identity.

534
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:56,704
Jun-hwa.

535
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:59,249
Grand Proprietor Cheon's son
will give me his word?

536
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:01,167
There is a ledger.

537
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:06,256
One that proves how my father
illegally obtained Yongcheonru.

538
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,760
Hong Min-sik's one and only daughter.

539
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:14,514
I am not the true heir to Yongcheonru.

540
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:17,767
It is Hong Jae-on
who sits in front of you.

541
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:25,859
Hong Jae-on.

542
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:29,320
I have something to ask.

543
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,699
Did my father…

544
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,454
kill your mother?

545
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:44,878
And also your father, 12 years ago?

546
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:04,606
I am sorry.

547
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:08,902
I am truly…

548
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:12,822
sorry.

549
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,384
For your crimes…

550
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:42,185
Apologize and beg for forgiveness.

551
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:47,190
- How dare you?
- I know the truth too.

552
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,819
Please stop this, Father.

553
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:06,251
You said fate depended
on my hand that holds this sword.

554
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,342
I choose to lay it down.

555
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,636
I will not live like you.

556
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:19,764
You will leave me?

557
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:24,269
Do you think you can manage

558
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:29,190
without my money
or the glory of Yongcheonru?

559
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:32,110
- Father.
- You worthless pushover.

560
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,996
Cheon Jun-hwa!

561
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,171
<i>Please.</i>

562
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,591
Please. You must stop.

563
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:57,927
Step down from the throne, apologize…

564
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:02,307
and correct your wrongdoings.

565
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,411
Your Majesty.

566
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:56,736
Fire!

567
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,446
- What?
- A fire?

568
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:00,073
There is a fire.

569
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:02,116
Goodness me.

570
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,077
Fire!

571
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,620
Oh, no.

572
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:13,711
- Careful.
- Get His Majesty to safety!

573
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,421
His Majesty…

574
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,382
His Majesty!

575
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:18,633
Get to safety!

576
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,844
Hurry out of here!

577
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:47,662
Move along.

578
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,351
<i>Look here, Cheon Mak-dong.</i>

579
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:14,105
<i>Cheon Mak-dong.</i>

580
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:22,905
<i>Are you Cheon Mak-dong?</i>

581
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:29,620
Yes, I am Cheon Mak-dong, my lord.

582
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:34,125
Everyone says you have a keen eye
for high-quality goods.

583
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,878
What do you say
to being my business partner?

584
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:37,962
Pardon?

585
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,339
What…

586
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,091
A nobleman like yourself

587
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,969
would go into business
with someone lowly like me?

588
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:50,266
Hey, money does not know class.

589
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:52,727
It is one's abilities
that make them money.

590
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:54,854
Here.

591
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:58,024
Let us make good money together.

592
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:09,577
<i>Listen, Hong Min-sik.</i>

593
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,872
I was not wrong.

594
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:14,540
No.

595
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,505
You were wrong from the start.

596
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:25,384
So, atone

597
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:28,888
for the deaths of my parents.

598
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:30,264
Atone?

599
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:38,356
Is atonement what you want
after coming all the way here?

600
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,069
How much is it?

601
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:47,448
How much is this atonement worth to you?

602
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,741
Shut it.

603
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:52,995
I replaced the king of this nation
with my money.

604
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:57,500
I abandoned my friend
and obtained Yongcheonru.

605
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:01,504
Who would not yield to the mighty power

606
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:03,464
that money possesses?

607
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:07,385
Hong Jae-on, you are no different.

608
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:12,223
Actually, you resemble me
more than anyone in this world.

609
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:14,851
Hardly.

610
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:17,687
You…

611
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:21,858
are wrong.

612
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:31,117
I will end you now.

613
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:49,719
I have been longing for this day.

614
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:53,472
You robbed the lives…

615
01:04:57,018 --> 01:05:00,438
of my father, my family,
and me at the age of ten.

616
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:03,983
I must slay you.

617
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,695
I must tear you to pieces.

618
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,532
I promised myself that every day.

619
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:14,785
Do it.

620
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:18,372
Kill me

621
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:20,583
and take over Yongcheonru.

622
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:29,008
Only you are worthy as my successor.

623
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,385
So stab me already.

624
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,846
Do it!

625
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,038
No.

626
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,085
You do not even deserve
to be slayed by me.

627
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,262
Because you and I…

628
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,309
are nothing alike.

629
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:28,651
How are we different?

630
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:32,321
Everyone in this world is the same!

631
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:36,409
Who does not wish to rise to the top?

632
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:38,744
Tell me how we are different.

633
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,454
Tell me!

634
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:36,093
This is my palace

635
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:38,888
that I built myself.

636
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:43,434
You say

637
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:47,646
that I, Cheon Mak-dong, am wrong?

638
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:06,123
Come on.

639
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,334
Cheon Jun-hwa!

640
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:12,421
Jun-hwa.

641
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,091
Jun-hwa!

642
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:16,509
Father!

643
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:17,760
Father!

644
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:19,970
Father…

645
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:23,974
Father…

646
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:26,685
Father…

647
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:29,438
Father…

648
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:57,526
I…

649
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:00,654
tried to frame you.

650
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:03,282
Brother.

651
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:04,992
I will not apologize, though.

652
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:08,287
I had no other choice.

653
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:12,416
Do not forgive me for that.

654
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:15,085
The throne…

655
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:17,755
is heartless.

656
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:24,261
I will let your father
reside in the palace.

657
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:27,890
Even though he could have killed me,

658
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:30,726
he spared my life.

659
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:33,020
And now I am repaying him.

660
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:36,273
Thank you.

661
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:39,401
What about you?

662
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:43,864
The palace does not seem
to be where I belong.

663
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:48,827
I am going to leave
to find my place in this world.

664
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:54,041
Once you leave…

665
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:58,712
I will erase everything from history.

666
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:03,175
The power of money
cannot challenge royal authority.

667
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:05,052
Yongcheonru,

668
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:07,137
the Grand Proprietor,

669
01:11:08,472 --> 01:11:11,850
and even you.

670
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:15,896
They will be forever gone
from this nation.

671
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:53,100
My Yongcheonru is in ruins.

672
01:11:54,226 --> 01:11:57,021
Mom, what now?

673
01:11:57,104 --> 01:11:59,315
I am sick to my stomach!

674
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:03,068
You said you would give me Yongcheonru,
so what now?

675
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:06,071
I heard

676
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:09,658
Grand Proprietor Cheon's body
was not found.

677
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:14,288
Alive and even in death,
the man stirs quite the fuss.

678
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:19,877
I am ashamed to face you
now that Yongcheonru has burned down.

679
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:26,008
It is the first loss I have suffered
since I became a merchant.

680
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:29,887
Hong Min-sik's daughter offered
to hand over Yongcheonru,

681
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:32,097
and I jumped at the chance.

682
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:34,016
But look at what it has become.

683
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:39,229
Still, our grand scheme was a success,

684
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:41,190
so what more can I say?

685
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:44,818
Hong Jae-on.

686
01:12:45,986 --> 01:12:47,905
She will make a name for herself.

687
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:52,034
I am sure she will repay us in the future.

688
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:54,912
I will make her pay every penny.

689
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:56,538
As you should.

690
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:17,935
How about I take
the clerks from here to Uiju?

691
01:13:19,436 --> 01:13:24,149
Yongcheonru was not the building itself
but the people who managed it.

692
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:27,027
It is the people who made it great.

693
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:28,987
I can open an inn

694
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:32,241
as big as Yongcheonru back in Uiju.

695
01:13:32,324 --> 01:13:36,286
The guildmaster of Uiju Guild
never suffers a loss.

696
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:37,496
Exactly.

697
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:39,081
Absolutely!

698
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:43,919
Let us go.

699
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:59,017
GANGNYEONGJEON

700
01:14:26,378 --> 01:14:30,257
I take it you will not come work for me
in the palace.

701
01:14:30,841 --> 01:14:33,552
A merchant should stay in the marketplace.

702
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:38,140
Please be a benevolent king

703
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:41,727
and lead us into a new world.

704
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:47,941
A new world, you say?

705
01:15:25,562 --> 01:15:29,191
1 YEAR LATER

706
01:15:35,155 --> 01:15:36,865
We should drink our hats off today.

707
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:37,950
That we should.

708
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:39,034
NAMHAE INN

709
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,370
This is the place. Namhae Inn.

710
01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:42,621
Yes, this is it.

711
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:44,456
Wait. What is written over there?

712
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:47,042
"The guest is the king."

713
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:48,669
- The king?
- What?

714
01:15:48,752 --> 01:15:51,463
- But that…
- That is treason.

715
01:15:55,133 --> 01:15:56,760
Welcome.

716
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,304
"The guest is the king!"

717
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:02,057
Welcome to Namhae Inn.

718
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:05,143
Please come on in.

719
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:07,229
What…

720
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:08,689
Come on in.

721
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:10,983
We have guests!

722
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:24,413
WE PROVIDE PREMIUM SERVICE
THE GUEST IS THE KING

723
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:31,378
NAMHAE INN
INTERVIEWING NEW CLERKS

724
01:16:32,337 --> 01:16:35,882
Are you the innkeeper of Namhae Inn?

725
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:37,426
But you look my age.

726
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:41,847
So,

727
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:44,600
why do you wish to work at this inn?

728
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:46,476
You see,

729
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,229
I have not worked at an inn before,

730
01:16:49,313 --> 01:16:51,189
but being an inn clerk sounded fun.

731
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:56,361
By the way,

732
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:59,781
my parents are strict,
so I cannot work late hours.

733
01:17:00,907 --> 01:17:03,827
You will not work at all, then. Leave.

734
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:06,246
I am to leave?

735
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:07,998
Bring in the next group!

736
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,294
I told you to be more open-minded.

737
01:17:12,377 --> 01:17:15,088
NAMHAE INN
INTERVIEW ASSESSMENT SHEET

738
01:17:15,172 --> 01:17:19,301
Declined. Declined. Declined once again.

739
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:27,059
Who will you hire
if you keep turning everyone down?

740
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:31,104
Youngsters these days.

741
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:34,149
None of them have the correct mind-set.

742
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:36,943
Back in our days as clerks,

743
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:40,530
we were as disciplined as we needed to be.

744
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:43,450
Sure, we were.

745
01:17:43,533 --> 01:17:45,994
We fought and gambled on the first day

746
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:47,621
and talked back all the time.

747
01:17:48,538 --> 01:17:50,582
How many demerit points
did we receive for that?

748
01:17:54,127 --> 01:17:57,923
Still, we passed the final test
with flying colors.

749
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:00,300
Whatever you say, Innkeeper Ko Su-ra.

750
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:07,683
Why am I putting myself through this?

751
01:18:10,143 --> 01:18:12,854
Look at my hands.
They are all dry and chapped.

752
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:26,034
Who…

753
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:28,954
ruined the hands
of the manly Hong Deok-su like this?

754
01:18:30,622 --> 01:18:31,832
Where were you, Eun-ho?

755
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:40,006
I bought this for you
while out grocery shopping.

756
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:43,093
Did I not tell you
to have me do the laundry?

757
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:46,638
I told you I would not let you
do any chores.

758
01:18:47,597 --> 01:18:50,058
Why does it seem like
I am the only one working around here?

759
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:53,895
Know that I have my eyes on you.

760
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:54,980
How scary.

761
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:04,781
- Does it hurt?
- It does not.

762
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:42,861
What the…

763
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:44,988
What are you doing
at our sacred workplace?

764
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,074
"No dating on the premises."

765
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:50,702
That is the first rule of our inn.

766
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:53,455
What do you mean, dating?

767
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:55,624
What is it, then?

768
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:58,752
You cheeky rats.

769
01:19:58,835 --> 01:20:00,545
They should be reprimanded, Lord Ko.

770
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:06,426
Hong Deok-su, Lee Eun-ho.

771
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:09,638
- Your monthly pay will be docked.
- Docked!

772
01:20:09,721 --> 01:20:12,682
- Why? But I worked this hard.
- Docked!

773
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:16,019
Such insolence! The former Prince Muyeong
will show you how scary he can be.

774
01:20:16,102 --> 01:20:17,521
- Such insolence.
- Put it down.

775
01:20:17,604 --> 01:20:19,397
- Put that down.
- Hold on!

776
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:20,899
- Do not do that.
- Stop it.

777
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:22,108
- Put it down.
- Come here!

778
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:25,278
- Get over here.
- Do not dare.

779
01:20:25,904 --> 01:20:27,656
- Come on.
- Bring it on!

780
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:40,877
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
CHECK IN HANYANG

781
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:45,632
STAY TUNED
FOR POST-CREDIT SCENES

782
01:21:39,311 --> 01:21:40,687
Welcome.

783
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:43,899
This is Namhae Inn
where guests are treated like kings.

784
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:50,280
I would like a room.

785
01:22:03,877 --> 01:22:04,878
Of course.

786
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:33,073
