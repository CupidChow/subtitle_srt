1
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,710
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,128
FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:50,759
Now, all you pupae will swiftly
get changed and gather in the front yard.

4
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:51,926
Where do we…

5
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,684
- Hold on.
- I need to change.

6
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,315
- Wait.
- Hurry up.

7
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,818
SALT, BEEF, PORK

8
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,154
Have we begun accepting apprentices?

9
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,032
A total of 30 Red Certificates were issued
for the selection

10
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,909
of Gyohwa Hall male apprentices,

11
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,494
but two failed to make it.

12
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,206
That is why we will be welcoming
28 apprentices today.

13
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,752
Young Master Jun-hwa and Prince Muyeong
will be training together.

14
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,086
What a weird coincidence.

15
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,632
Jun-hwa had to learn
how to handle the royal family anyway.

16
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,050
So it is for the best.

17
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,888
He has never been
interested in Yongcheonru,

18
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,598
but it is time for him to learn.

19
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:43,895
It was I who had the current king crowned.

20
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,023
It should be Jun-hwa
who crowns the next one.

21
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,822
Then, are you considering Prince Muyeong

22
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,951
as the next crown prince
to ascend the throne?

23
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,872
That depends on Jun-hwa.

24
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:08,086
The good-hearted and wise Jun-hwa
will not disappoint you.

25
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,171
Good-hearted, you say?

26
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:16,261
You must not know
how being good-hearted makes one weak.

27
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,515
Money has no eyes.

28
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,977
Nor does it have ears or a mouth.

29
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,728
It does not even have friends.

30
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:30,400
One's social class is irrelevant
in the face of money.

31
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:34,821
Even the king
who exists above everyone else

32
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,575
is rendered useless
in matters involving money.

33
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,454
You know that better than anyone.

34
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,169
- Do not do this here!
- Let go.

35
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,671
That is my uniform.

36
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:52,797
Why, you…

37
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,424
Look, that is my uniform.

38
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,802
Let go of me.

39
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,597
If you are to interfere,
take off your clothes first.

40
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,724
- What?
- What are you scoundrels doing?

41
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,935
Demerit points for all you scoundrels!

42
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,739
I apologize, Lady Seol.

43
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,553
You have your work cut out for you.

44
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,935
Lady Seol…

45
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,105
I have been wanting to meet you.

46
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,740
I have always wanted
to meet you, Lady Seol.

47
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,580
What… What on earth are you doing?

48
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,374
To Lady Seol? How dare you.

49
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,793
My greatest apologies.

50
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,128
They still have a lot to learn.

51
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,881
I have high hopes
for this class of apprentices.

52
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,133
Teach them well.

53
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,387
Of course. I will not disappoint you.

54
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,640
I will dismiss stupid pupae like these

55
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,600
and select only bright ones…

56
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:32,480
Oh, dear… I am doomed.

57
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,405
Line up!

58
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,839
I can already sense it.

59
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,008
You four have no chance of making it.

60
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,426
Demerits for all you four!

61
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,886
State your number one by one.

62
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,263
But, Master,

63
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,973
I am a victim in all of this.

64
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:09,684
He came at me first.

65
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,311
I also find it unfair.

66
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,148
I was only late
because he had taken my clothes.

67
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,901
Goodness. No wonder
they were so uncomfortable.

68
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,611
I apologize.

69
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,410
What about you? What is your excuse?

70
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:31,622
My number…

71
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,168
- is 28.
- Did you just cuss?

72
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,671
Why, you…

73
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,467
Number 28. Fine.

74
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,303
Order! You imbeciles.

75
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,971
Get in line in the back!

76
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,016
Yes, Master.

77
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,225
Get going.

78
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,061
Make haste!

79
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:58,900
Unbelievable. Anyway, I congratulate you
on your admissions.

80
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:03,279
However, not everyone
who trains at Gyohwa Hall will pass.

81
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,365
I do not know if all will make it…

82
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,035
- Move it.
- …but I wish… You damn imbeciles!

83
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,329
Focus!

84
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:17,460
What you must keep in mind
from here on out is silence!

85
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:24,634
The second you make a sound
even if it is a whisper,

86
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,968
you will receive a demerit.

87
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,597
Even if you trip and fall, do not scream.

88
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,432
Just keep your mouth shut.

89
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,478
Should you choke on your food,
do not cough.

90
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,647
Press down on your throat!

91
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:41,692
Do not even think about sighing
while relieving yourself!

92
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,903
Keep your mouth shut.

93
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,780
Now answer this.

94
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,366
"Come hither. Is anyone here?"

95
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,785
One of the guests is calling you.

96
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:51,911
What should you do?

97
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,038
Pardon?

98
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,414
"Yes?"

99
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,292
Incorrect. Your number?

100
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,504
I am number 29.

101
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,756
Number 29. You receive a demerit.

102
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,967
- However…
- Hush. Silence!

103
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,052
DEMERITS

104
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,973
Why would you attend to guests?

105
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,724
Do not even make eye contact!

106
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,812
Remember this. Silence!

107
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,939
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Master!

108
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,942
Demerits for those who peeped.

109
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,444
State your numbers.

110
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,696
- I am number 19.
- Number 19.

111
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,698
- I am number 22.
- Number 22.

112
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,824
DEMERITS

113
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:34,454
All right. Today, you will be given a tour
of the great Yongcheonru.

114
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:41,586
YONGCHEONRU

115
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:06,235
The basis of Yongcheonru, which matches
the size of His Majesty's palace,

116
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,862
is our premium service.

117
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:11,157
And it all begins at Chinyeongrae

118
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,951
which means the place
to welcome and serve.

119
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:19,040
Chinyeongrae is the face of Yongcheonru.

120
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:23,127
We must make a great first impression
with our warm welcome.

121
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,763
CHINYEONGRAE

122
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,227
YEONHWA HALL

123
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,494
And this is Yeonhwa Hall.

124
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:04,752
What is that?

125
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,464
At Yeonhwa Hall,
we provide the best food in Joseon

126
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,424
to guests who visit for refreshments

127
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,094
as well as those who stay at the inn.

128
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,019
- No way.
- That smell!

129
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,273
I am hungry now.

130
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,150
Is that pork or beef? How fascinating.

131
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,655
YEONHWA HALL

132
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,285
YEHWA HALL

133
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,496
Next, we are here in Yehwa Hall.

134
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,001
Yehwa Hall sees people
from all across the country

135
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,044
who are to be wed in Yongcheonru.

136
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,631
The groom and bride will bow.

137
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,409
YEHWA HALL, CHINYEONGRAE

138
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,624
YEONHWA HALL, DOHWA HALL

139
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,336
<i>You are now in Dohwa Hall.</i>

140
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,300
<i>It is the place</i>

141
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,762
<i>that will transform anyone into</i>
<i>Joseon's greatest beauty Park Chun-hui.</i>

142
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,144
And here.

143
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:48,606
This is Gyohwa Hall
where you are currently at.

144
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,070
Here are Sedab Hall, Jeongju Hall,

145
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,365
the quarters for clerks,
the study for department directors, and--

146
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,409
Then, where does the innkeeper stay?

147
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,788
As if that must be known
by a mere apprentice!

148
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,831
- That deserves a demerit.
- Pardon?

149
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,750
State your number.

150
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,543
Your number!

151
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,670
It is number 30.

152
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,254
Number 30.

153
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,714
Listen carefully.

154
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:19,345
You are not to go anywhere
without my permission. Do you hear me?

155
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,346
- Yes, Master.
- Yes, Master.

156
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,103
Next, I will present the rooms and suites
at Yongcheonru.

157
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:30,356
The standard rooms we have at Yongcheonru

158
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,399
<i>are in Hongui Chamber.</i>

159
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,109
HONGUI CHAMBER

160
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:38,280
<i>It is usually occupied for a night</i>
<i>by travelers on long journeys.</i>

161
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,494
HONGUI CHAMBER

162
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,205
<i>Rooms of a class higher</i>
<i>than those of Hongui Chamber</i>

163
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,207
<i>are in Cheongui Chamber.</i>

164
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,920
<i>Normally, they are occupied by merchants</i>

165
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,840
<i>who engage in trades during their stay.</i>

166
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,471
<i>Then there are the premium suites</i>
<i>of Geumui Chamber.</i>

167
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,308
<i>They are the best rooms</i>
<i>Yongcheonru has to offer.</i>

168
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,019
<i>Considering its price,</i>
<i>it is not a room for just anyone.</i>

169
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,398
<i>In Geumui Chamber, whatever a guest wants,</i>

170
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,108
<i>the guest gets.</i>

171
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,403
<i>Should the guest request it,</i>

172
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:20,072
<i>they may even be made king.</i>

173
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,784
Did you just speak of treason?

174
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,915
How dare you call anyone the king?
Do you all wish to die?

175
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,711
Treason is punished by annihilating
three generations of one's family.

176
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:37,798
Before anyone's family is annihilated,
you will lose your head first.

177
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:38,841
Keep at it.

178
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,135
You are making my day.

179
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,344
What?

180
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,973
- What was that?
- What is he going on about?

181
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,057
Just sit, will you?

182
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,601
Unbelievable.

183
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,228
- He is impossible.
- Let us steer clear of him.

184
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,023
You imbecile!

185
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,568
I called the guest a king of
Geumui Chamber, not the palace.

186
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,153
I warn you not to speak

187
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,113
of His Majesty in such a way!

188
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,867
He sure is a weird one.

189
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,869
I am staying clear of him.

190
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:10,372
It should not
be carelessly mentioned, Master.

191
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:14,126
Damn you, Number 28.
A demerit it is for you.

192
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,713
Was I wrong to speak up? How is that…

193
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,009
That was…

194
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,429
a thoughtless remark, Master.

195
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,598
A demerit will not do with you.

196
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,725
Did you talk down to me?

197
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,353
Did you?

198
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,688
Why not refer to me as your subject?

199
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,607
Goodness, Master.

200
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,527
How about we take a break?

201
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,489
Should we? We have been at it for a while.

202
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,825
Sure. That is it for today.

203
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,035
Head to your quarters.

204
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,247
- Yes, Master.
- Yes, Master.

205
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,549
- Sang-u.
- Yes?

206
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,720
One, two, three, up.

207
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,156
MAP OF GYOHWA HALL QUARTERS

208
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,170
ADVANCED

209
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,339
We are advanced!

210
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:47,469
LOW-INTERMEDIATE

211
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,596
TWENTY-NINE

212
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,515
GYOHWA HALL ROOM PLACEMENT

213
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,641
This is ludicrous.

214
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,520
Why was I placed in Elementary?

215
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:00,399
ELEMENTARY
27, 28, 29, 30

216
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,818
Darn it. I have to share a room with him?

217
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,409
I cannot believe I am to share a room
with the lowliest.

218
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,495
LOW-INTERMEDIATE,
LOW, ELEMENTARY

219
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,588
Myeong-ho, we have been placed in Expert.

220
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,715
Elementary?

221
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:27,676
We are experts.

222
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,971
This seems like fate.

223
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,640
Anyway, let us enter for now.

224
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,142
We have number tags to sew on.

225
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,313
Let us head inside.

226
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,773
Move.

227
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,945
Goodness me.

228
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,365
Come on.

229
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,492
- This is absurd.
- Not really.

230
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,453
Off we go.

231
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,580
ELEMENTARY

232
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,385
Yes, there we go.

233
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,596
That is it.

234
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,393
Sorry about that.

235
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,853
It is my first time
being in a room this small.

236
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,273
Although, this will bring us closer.

237
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,612
Since we have been placed together,
let us at least learn each other's names.

238
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,242
I am Cheon Jun-hwa.

239
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,124
This is not as easy as it looks.

240
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,668
I asked for your name.

241
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,211
All done.

242
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:47,047
No way. Are you done already?

243
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,428
Yes, you, Number 29. What is your name?

244
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,847
We have been placed in the same boat

245
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,391
and might as well
weather the storm together.

246
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,018
I, Ko Su-ra,

247
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,896
do not intend to share a boat with you.

248
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,399
I am Hong Deok-su,

249
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,695
and sharing a boat with you
is the last thing I want.

250
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,286
Fine!

251
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,164
My name is Lee Eun…

252
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,171
It is Lee Eun-ho.

253
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,672
- Lee Eun-ho?
- Yes.

254
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,761
Fighting before the first class

255
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,847
and talking back to our instructor
in class.

256
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,558
- I am innocent.
- Taking others' clothes.

257
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,103
I will elevate my status here

258
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,689
and break free from you three.

259
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,275
I will not flunk out.

260
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,696
What… Why are you so angry?

261
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,948
Goodness. Our friend has a temper.

262
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,412
All right.

263
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,123
Let us go and wash up too.

264
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,166
No.

265
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,251
What?

266
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,838
I mean, I am fine.

267
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,383
- Is that so?
- Yes.

268
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,970
A public washing area out in the open?

269
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,388
That sounds like fun.

270
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,183
- I will head there first.
- Go ahead.

271
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,477
All right. Oh, goodness.

272
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,487
You.

273
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,031
Lee Eun-ho, was it?

274
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,242
Watch yourself.

275
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,910
I am keeping my eyes on you.

276
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,704
How dare you? Such insolence!

277
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,872
Such insolence?

278
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,833
How insolent was I?

279
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:47,918
Why, you little…

280
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,003
What are you looking at?

281
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,590
Tiny Eyes.

282
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,060
TWENTY-EIGHT

283
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,228
As if this matters.

284
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,610
This feels nice.

285
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,199
Gosh, that feels good.

286
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,119
- Give it here.
- Thanks.

287
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,291
- Sorry about that.
- What was that?

288
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,255
BATHING ROOM

289
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,633
- There you go.
- That is cold.

290
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,310
One more.

291
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,611
Of course.

292
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,158
Here you go.

293
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,284
All right.

294
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,674
I, Innkeeper Seol Mae-hwa,
formally greet you.

295
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,594
Why are you here in Lord Cheon's stead?

296
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,554
My apologies.

297
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:26,225
I am afraid his knee was hurting
and he is seeing a physician.

298
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:31,313
Or maybe it is an excuse
to avoid showing us his face.

299
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,982
His face must be of dear value,

300
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,735
seeing how I have never gotten to see it.

301
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:43,033
He would not dare to do that
to the Minister of War.

302
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,284
What?

303
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,745
To express his apology for being absent,

304
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,206
he had these ordered himself.

305
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:51,875
Bring them in.

306
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:25,033
They are ginseng grown in Punggi
that were delivered to the palace.

307
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:35,877
Is this ginseng from Punggi
that only His Majesty consumes?

308
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,923
Come on. Someone more worthy of it
than His Majesty himself is here.

309
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,717
Even the king's royal meal
could be served.

310
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,262
- Do you not agree?
- Of course we do. Absolutely.

311
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,057
Out of all
that were delivered to the palace,

312
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,561
we set aside those of the highest quality.

313
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:58,317
Of course. Look at how marvelous it looks.

314
00:21:59,067 --> 00:21:59,943
Take a look.

315
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:04,239
It resembles you in the way
that it has the regalness of a monarch.

316
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,496
Drinking this 30-year-old
wild ginseng wine

317
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,791
is said to cure all illness
and promise longevity.

318
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,794
Of course. Go ahead and pour him a glass.

319
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,518
Wild ginseng wine?

320
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:47,449
Here. Let us empty our glasses.

321
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,201
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

322
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,461
Now, pour me a glass as well.

323
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:07,469
Goodness me. You are one fair lady.

324
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,055
Rather than running an inn,

325
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:13,141
you should be managing
a courtesan house instead. Here.

326
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,068
What is the matter?

327
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,666
This wine

328
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,046
is a masterpiece only meant
for the kingpin of this nation.

329
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,259
Are you gunning for that role?

330
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,886
The kingpin…

331
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,306
of this nation?

332
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,944
One cannot mask his lowly origins.

333
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,280
Relay my words.

334
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:12,284
Tell him that I know
he intercepted the gold bars

335
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,660
meant for me.

336
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,501
The wine dances on my tongue.

337
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,824
Then, where does the innkeeper stay?

338
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,243
FULL MAP OF YONGCHEONRU

339
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,392
- I saw the brass key.
- Pardon?

340
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,852
Have you already searched
Lord Cheon's room?

341
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,439
That is what puzzles me.

342
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,484
It was not Lord Cheon.
Someone else had it.

343
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,527
Someone else?

344
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,905
- Did you bring the drawing of the key?
- Yes.

345
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:22,622
What is this?

346
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,797
I must check once more.

347
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:34,884
Allow me to also stay here in disguise.

348
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,722
There is a more pressing matter.

349
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,725
Of course. Your wish is my command.

350
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,315
TWENTY-EIGHT

351
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,853
YEONHWA HALL

352
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,356
Who goes there?

353
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:14,818
LADIES ONLY
MEN NOT ALLOWED

354
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,578
I smell sweaty.

355
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,916
They will question me if I do not wash up.

356
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,297
That feels nice.

357
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,100
I am exhausted.

358
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,186
Me too. Let us hurry back with the water.

359
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,189
I heard we had a new batch of apprentices.

360
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,734
Would any of them sneak into
the girls' dorms?

361
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,403
I doubt it.
It results in immediate expulsion.

362
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,825
- Quiet.
- Really?

363
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,338
Stay still, will you?

364
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:00,799
You are one to talk.

365
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:02,675
You startled me.

366
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,648
Stop that. Hold it in.

367
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,150
Stop.

368
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:23,029
If you sneeze, we will both be expelled.
Hold it in.

369
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,289
Hey.

370
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,708
What is this?

371
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,003
- Shall we head back?
- Sure.

372
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,883
They are gone!

373
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,719
What the…

374
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,059
You are the loudest one here.

375
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,480
How dare you insult me?

376
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,452
I was only there to wash up.

377
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:15,582
I did not climb over the wall
for another reason.

378
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:16,875
Did I even ask?

379
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:19,752
What about you?

380
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,673
Why did you climb over the wall
into the yard of the girls' dorms?

381
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,300
Because I saw you climb over it.

382
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,426
Why, you…

383
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,181
Anyway, it is a fact
that we both climbed over the wall,

384
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,351
so we will keep it a secret
to save ourselves from expulsion.

385
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,644
Not me.

386
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,938
I only did it to stop you.

387
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:43,234
Seriously. Why are you on my case?

388
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,319
What is it?

389
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,239
Could there be something you are hiding?

390
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:54,954
Hong Deok-su. You cannot get expelled yet.

391
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,249
Are you voicing your concern for me?

392
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,834
As if.

393
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,045
I am telling you to behave.

394
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:12,347
ELEMENTARY

395
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,240
<i>There is a shadow ledger.</i>

396
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,080
The brass key.

397
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:41,709
That is the only key
to the safe which holds the shadow ledger.

398
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,588
Those two pieces must come together
to open the safe.

399
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,298
It cannot be opened by one alone.

400
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:52,637
<i>That despicable Cheon has hidden</i>
<i>one of them somewhere in Yongcheonru</i>

401
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,139
<i>and is looking for the other.</i>

402
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:17,120
<i>Who on earth could he be?</i>

403
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,180
<i>You just need to show me once.</i>
<i>It will be quick.</i>

404
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,057
What is this? Have you lost your mind?

405
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,559
I just need a moment.

406
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,854
Even if you do not get fired,
just make sure you do not get exposed.

407
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:50,486
No one can know you are Hong Jae-on
or that you are a girl.

408
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,696
Do you understand?

409
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,285
<i>Be more careful.</i>

410
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,829
<i>Watch yourself, Deok-su.</i>

411
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,282
What is that over there?

412
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,505
Is he dead?

413
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:51,464
It seems like it.

414
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,968
A man is dead!

415
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,138
There has been a murder.

416
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,267
A man is dead!

417
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,547
That is delicious.

418
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,717
- I cannot believe this.
- Look.

419
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:41,806
Let me try this.

420
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,432
Come here and try this.

421
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,371
Finally. That sorted me right out.

422
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,127
Eun-ho, why are you picking at your food?

423
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,380
A true man should easily empty his bowl.

424
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:18,342
Hong Deok-su, you…
You are a true macho man.

425
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,969
Of course I am.

426
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,220
Keep eating.

427
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,516
Damn, that is hot.

428
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,107
It is nice to be of expert status

429
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,194
since the room is spacious
as well as the bathroom.

430
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:40,239
I am having a hard time telling
if I am here to rest or to be trained.

431
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,782
Do you not agree, Myeong-ho?

432
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,535
Du-sik, Seok-sam.

433
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:50,082
All of that is a privilege
that is reserved for those of Uiju Guild.

434
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,460
Got it?

435
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:58,132
How did the lowliest of people
manage to secure a spot here?

436
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:01,135
Talk about muddying the water.

437
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,472
All they could secure
by selling their land

438
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,807
were numbers 27, 28, and 29,

439
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,976
which are absolutely useless.

440
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,022
Our numbers?

441
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,524
This was the number my family got me.

442
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:20,780
That number is equivalent
to the rank of your family's status.

443
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:25,201
In other words, your families
are among the lowliest.

444
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:31,374
Did you think
all Red Certificates were the same?

445
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:35,086
Actually, there are different statuses.

446
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:38,673
Our numbers say we are
of the highest status

447
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:42,343
while yours say you are below the lowest.

448
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,932
It was set in stone
right from the beginning.

449
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:53,896
Wait, were we not placed in Elementary
due to our demerits?

450
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,774
I guess I was given the wrong number.

451
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:59,443
All this yapping about mere numbers.

452
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,572
Bring it if you can.

453
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,034
Like men.

454
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,540
Myeong-ho!

455
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,504
All three department heads
will meet the apprentices today.

456
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:19,922
Is that so?

457
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,718
That is great news.

458
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:24,844
Eat up, boys.

459
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,554
Come on.

460
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,850
- Sit.
- Damn it.

461
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,109
- Lord Cho.
- Yes?

462
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:43,487
- How about I tell you a secret?
- A secret?

463
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,032
Among the apprentices
we will be meeting today,

464
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,783
there is one of special status.

465
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,285
One of special status?

466
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,954
The one to inherit Yongcheonru.

467
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:57,376
The only son of Lord Cheon
who was sent to Qing to study as a child.

468
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,294
You.

469
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,505
Watch that mouth of yours.

470
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:07,845
All I want to see are sturdy young men
who can pull their weight.

471
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:14,185
From what I hear,
he seems regal from head to toe.

472
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,687
He will be mine to keep.

473
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,024
Hurry!

474
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,471
Lord Jang.

475
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,938
What on earth?

476
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:07,071
Lord Jang, this is not the time for that
since the apprentices are waiting.

477
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,323
Did you develop something new?

478
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:13,744
Look, inhaling any more of that
will have you burst like a bubble.

479
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,789
Seung-ryang, take a whiff of this.

480
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:18,999
- It is so good.
- Really?

481
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,751
- Is it good?
- Go ahead.

482
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,294
Is it not the best?

483
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:26,465
Cut the crap. We need to leave.

484
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,175
Is it not good? Is it just me?

485
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,260
- Come on.
- Take a whiff.

486
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,011
How was it?

487
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,347
I hear you. Goodness.

488
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,351
Attention!

489
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:41,397
Today, you will learn about
the three departments of Yongcheonru.

490
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,109
They are directors
of those three departments. Applaud.

491
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:59,790
First, let me introduce the one
in charge of all the food here.

492
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,625
The head of the Department of Food.

493
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:12,178
I am sure you all know what golden ice is.

494
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:14,430
I am the one who invented that.

495
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,058
At the Department of Food,

496
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:23,189
you will get to see
the most fascinating food and ingredients.

497
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,025
Let me see.

498
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,612
Survive your training first.

499
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,490
Applaud!

500
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,911
Next is the Department of Management.

501
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,832
The name is Cho Seung-ryang.

502
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:45,878
My department is responsible
for the security of Yongcheonru

503
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,130
and the management of its supplies.

504
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,466
Due to the nature of our work,

505
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,510
fitness is required.

506
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:54,637
Us.

507
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,014
Sit back down.

508
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:02,061
- He is a true macho man.
- What the hell?

509
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:05,856
Only a true man can work
at the Department of Management.

510
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,941
Applaud!

511
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,113
Lastly, this is Director Yu Su-in
of the Department of Hospitality.

512
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:19,703
The Department of Hospitality
is the face of Yongcheonru.

513
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:24,875
We are at the front of the inn
welcoming party and overnight guests.

514
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,924
To join the Department of Hospitality…

515
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,804
you must have the looks for it

516
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,181
and be refined.

517
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,018
I have a question.

518
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,272
Is Yeonhwa Hall
under your department's purview?

519
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,233
That is correct.

520
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:52,319
But, Number 30,
why are you showing interest?

521
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,823
Everyone, applaud!

522
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,877
What? A Red Certificate was stolen?

523
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:18,637
Please capture the one
who killed my son Man-dol, my lord!

524
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:23,142
Why did your son have
Yongcheonru's Red Certificate on him?

525
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:27,730
He was only keeping it safe for someone.

526
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:30,399
The one who stole that Red Certificate

527
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:33,694
must be the killer!

528
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,240
My boy.

529
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:54,506
<i>Lord Cheon, it is Seol Mae-hwa.</i>

530
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,556
KIM BO-HYEON

531
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:10,522
What is this about?

532
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:13,484
The police bureau sent someone.

533
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,570
A Red Certificate of ours was involved

534
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,614
in a murder in Seochon.

535
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:24,828
Half of a certificate was found
next to a dead body.

536
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,373
And where is the other half?

537
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,374
It seems like

538
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,043
someone must have forged
the stolen Red Certificate

539
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:32,586
to join Gyohwa Hall.

540
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:40,969
My lord?

541
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:46,517
Yongcheonru's Red Certificate
lives up to its name.

542
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,728
Then find the killer

543
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,897
and hand him over to the police bureau.

544
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:57,653
One desired Yongcheonru so much
that he killed for a spot?

545
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:00,823
Preach it louder.

546
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:03,117
I will execute your command.

547
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,120
What should I do
with the Minister of War's gold?

548
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,249
It is still not the right time.
Be patient.

549
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:28,142
Goodness gracious.
Look at the colors of this silk.

550
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,769
They are beautiful, Mother.

551
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:34,064
It sure is a treat to have you here

552
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,316
since we can pick out this silk together.

553
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:42,865
Goodness. Is that
our precious Prince Seonyang?

554
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:49,246
Your grandfather missed you so much
that he almost came down with

555
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:51,582
a terrible illness.

556
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:56,128
Father, you are home.

557
00:45:56,211 --> 00:46:00,382
My gosh. Your Highness,
you are the queen of this nation.

558
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:05,095
And Prince Seonyang will soon
be appointed as crown prince.

559
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,139
Why would you bow down to me?

560
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,099
Assert your authority, Your Highness.

561
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:10,559
Yes, Father.

562
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:18,150
When in the world
will the appointment take place?

563
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,361
I will die of old age at this rate.

564
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,197
Unbelievable.

565
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,492
That is inappropriate to say
in front of Prince Seonyang.

566
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,368
Be mindful of your status.

567
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,537
I am not wrong though, am I?

568
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:33,624
Maybe you can rally up the ministers
and make a formal request.

569
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:36,210
The crown prince position
has been vacant for years.

570
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,756
She married His Majesty
in his latter years

571
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:45,886
but gave him a sweet prince nevertheless.

572
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,932
Should they be left
on the back burner like this?

573
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,184
Mother, I do not mind.

574
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,727
Well, I do.

575
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,022
Until my grandson, Prince Seonyang,

576
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,608
ascends the throne,

577
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,362
we will never be all right.
Do you understand?

578
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,740
Until then, have him
receive proper education

579
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:08,700
about the role of a crown prince.

580
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:11,161
I will take that to heart, Father.

581
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,457
Are things quiet at the palace?

582
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:20,796
I heard Prince Muyeong went to recuperate
far away in Onyang.

583
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:22,047
Is that true?

584
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:25,008
Yes, Father. I saw him leave the palace.

585
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:30,472
Why would you even worry
about Prince Muyeong anyway?

586
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:31,765
Unbelievable.

587
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:34,643
We must keep Prince Muyeong in check

588
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:37,688
in order for Prince Seonyang
to become the next crown prince.

589
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:49,366
A basic skill a clerk of Yongcheonru
must be trained in, is the bow.

590
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:50,284
One.

591
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,077
Two.

592
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,288
One.

593
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,082
Two.

594
00:47:58,584 --> 00:47:59,459
One.

595
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,462
Two.

596
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,465
One.

597
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:09,469
Two.

598
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,723
Keep your back flat

599
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:15,350
and lift up your chin. Your chin.

600
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,646
Both hands should be neatly gathered
on your belly button.

601
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,774
You fool.
Legs must be shoulder-width apart.

602
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:25,068
One.

603
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,325
Is that the lowest a true man can bow?

604
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,076
I am bowing down enough.

605
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,078
"I am bowing down enough."

606
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,497
The difference lies
in what cannot be seen.

607
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,249
Straighten those legs.

608
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,126
You should never frown.

609
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:42,919
Always look calm.

610
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:43,879
Two.

611
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,386
Demerit for you!

612
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,940
Here is your final task for the day.

613
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:06,401
The Yongcheonru Clerkship Chronicles.

614
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:11,406
The grand history of Yongcheonru
is written in detail.

615
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:13,992
Memorize it all.

616
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,912
- Down to the last word.
- What?

617
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,727
It is killing me. I cannot do it anymore.

618
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:50,028
Goodness. That is some fine handwriting.

619
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:54,950
I guess you owe it
to your fine, delicate hands.

620
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,291
This is how a true man studies.

621
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,670
I will eat and swallow every word I learn.

622
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:22,894
This is one thick book.

623
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,230
When will one memorize it all?

624
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,406
So tell me. Which guild are you from?

625
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:36,908
Namhae Guild.

626
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,786
Hence the number!

627
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,705
Did it not shut down?

628
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,167
You have no chance of making it,

629
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,502
so rest rather than trying so hard.

630
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:50,797
Do not concern yourself
with his gibberish.

631
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,966
It is his fault
for being born into such a family.

632
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:55,302
What? It is my fault
for being born into my family?

633
00:50:56,344 --> 00:51:01,224
Then which family must one be born into
for one not to be at fault?

634
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:03,226
The one that owns Yongcheonru?

635
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,190
At least not one of your families.

636
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,362
Expert apprentices.

637
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:20,118
If you consider yourselves superior,
why not indulge in a wager with us?

638
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:23,830
Do not do that for my sake.

639
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:24,998
Count me in.

640
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:26,625
That sounds like fun.

641
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,004
Hong Deok-su, you too.

642
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:32,297
Be a true man.

643
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:38,178
Of course!

644
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,890
A true man never backs down
from a challenge.

645
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,478
Tonight, we will wager our rooms

646
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,815
on a game of dice-rolling.

647
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:50,857
What?

648
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:54,110
The winners will take
the rooms for expert apprentices.

649
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:58,406
Hey.

650
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:04,079
You must think
we at Uiju Guild are morons.

651
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:08,041
Even if you lose, you will lose nothing

652
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,877
while we gain nothing.

653
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:11,878
- Exactly.
- Right.

654
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,421
Absolutely.

655
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,799
The elementary apprentices

656
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,884
- will leave Gyohwa Hall.
- Hey.

657
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,219
- What?
- Nice.

658
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,223
You said a true man never backs down.

659
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:27,853
Hong Deok-su, I will be with you on this.

660
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,480
But I cannot afford to leave this place.

661
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:33,066
Fine. I will join you
as a true man should.

662
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,445
Are you too scared to accept the wager?

663
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:43,076
Fine, bring it on.

664
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:49,249
I will have it so that you are
all dismissed from Gyohwa Hall.

665
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,168
Damn it.

666
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:53,628
Hong Deok-su.

667
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,299
The game is tonight. We must win.

668
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,677
- Come on.
- After you, Myeong-ho.

669
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,318
How do you win at this game?

670
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,696
Having the lowest number
or the highest number?

671
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:20,947
Come on.

672
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:24,618
Are you telling me
you have never played dice before?

673
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:25,952
- Yes.
- Dice?

674
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:35,921
First…

675
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:41,801
For now, just learn how to roll the dice.

676
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:45,138
I will make sure we win no matter what.

677
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:48,058
No matter what? Are you going to cheat?

678
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:51,853
Do not fret.

679
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:56,441
Hong Deok-su here
will guarantee our victory.

680
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,693
Am I right?

681
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,740
Yes, of course!

682
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:06,576
Trust this young man,
that is Hong Deok-su!

683
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:10,205
All right, fine.
Just explain the game to us.

684
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:12,374
How does one roll these?

685
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:14,376
Like this?

686
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,006
Here.

687
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:23,718
As you can see, a die has six sides.

688
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:27,514
Look. Each side has dots on them.

689
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,473
Right.

690
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:30,725
You roll a pair of them,

691
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,311
and the one with the larger number wins.

692
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,688
However,

693
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:36,690
roll a matching pair,

694
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:41,820
and you will win no matter
how big your opponent's number is.

695
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,196
What if we both roll pairs?

696
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,241
The one with the highest number will win.

697
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,451
Normally, only one round is played,

698
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:52,831
but we must win
three out of five rounds tonight.

699
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:58,420
Is it even possible
to roll a matching pair?

700
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:03,174
Give me a number, and I will show you.

701
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:07,262
A pair of fives.

702
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:10,515
A pair of fives. That is easy.

703
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:14,477
Let me see. A pair of fives.

704
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:21,568
See?

705
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,987
Where did you learn such tricks?

706
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,698
I have not seen such a skill before,
even in Qing.

707
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:28,283
Stop it.

708
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:30,452
Could you be a hustler?

709
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,455
Come on. Of course not.

710
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:35,040
This is just…

711
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:51,389
This is just a trick I learned
from someone I knew as a boy.

712
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:54,267
All right. Now, try it yourselves.

713
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,936
A picture is worth
a thousand words, right?

714
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:58,605
Who will try it?

715
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,613
- Me!
- Me!

716
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:09,199
- Me!
- I will go first.

717
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:11,034
Sure. Go ahead.

718
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:14,037
- Why, you…
- Give me that.

719
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,914
What is up with you two? Take turns.

720
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:19,292
Would I not be better at this?

721
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:21,294
Give it a try.

722
00:56:21,377 --> 00:56:23,129
All right. Go!

723
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,633
But that was not a pair of fives.

724
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,551
Like this.

725
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,888
- One rolled off.
- I would like to try.

726
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:33,473
- But it is my turn.
- Right.

727
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,105
- Let me.
- Sure, let him.

728
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,815
Get rid of that beef jerky.

729
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,776
Show respect at the table. Go ahead.

730
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,487
Look at you being a clown.

731
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,575
Try again. Go on. Again.

732
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:57,997
Again!

733
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:11,928
Are you kidding me?

734
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:15,056
It is late in the night, so hurry.

735
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:19,018
Would it kill you
to announce yourself first?

736
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:22,856
What is it? Are you worried
I might kill you without a warning?

737
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,817
You and your dreadful remarks.

738
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,278
How will you authenticate
the Red Certificates?

739
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:35,118
Every year, the process was done
by me alone, Lady Seol.

740
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:39,539
It is not like I need any help.

741
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,291
I know that,

742
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,543
but there is an issue this year.

743
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:48,256
What issue is it
that you came here in person?

744
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,684
- A murder.
- My goodness!

745
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:04,105
A man was killed for his Red Certificate.

746
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:07,525
The police bureau ordered
the arrest of the killer.

747
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:08,902
The police bureau?

748
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:14,115
If one of the Red Certificates
is a forgery…

749
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:19,245
We will have found the killer.

750
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:59,786
EXPERT

751
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,247
Come on.

752
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:34,862
Regardless of our numbers

753
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:39,117
and our families,
we will compete fair and square.

754
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,034
Cheating…

755
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:43,621
will not be tolerated.

756
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:45,999
Do you hear me?

757
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:50,211
For some reason, you address us
like we are beneath you,

758
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:51,588
which is quite annoying.

759
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:57,427
If you lose, you will
hand over your rooms without complaining.

760
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:04,309
Fine.

761
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:11,024
Should you four lose, you will voluntarily
leave Gyohwa Hall. Are we clear?

762
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:14,193
One more thing.

763
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,112
Apologize to Su-ra.

764
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:21,075
Nicely said, Deok-su.
Those are the words of a true man.

765
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:25,163
Hey. Save the cheekiness
for after you win.

766
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,418
I see you are all talk.

767
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:34,088
Once the table is set,
speak only through these rune stones.

768
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:40,094
Now…

769
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:43,640
who will go first?

770
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:49,145
I played my fair share of dice
back in the day.

771
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:53,024
We will swap our dice.

772
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,817
Who are you trying to fool?

773
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:14,379
Number 29. Number 30.

774
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:20,718
I have been looking at them closely,

775
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:23,513
but none of them look like a forgery.

776
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:27,433
Lord Jang, is there a way
to determine which was forged?

777
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:31,854
Lady Seol, are you displaying
your distrust in my abilities?

778
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:39,946
These Red Certificates
that I personally made?

779
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,034
<i>The secret does not lie in the paper</i>

780
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,869
<i>but the ink.</i>

781
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:50,081
The ink?

782
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:55,878
<i>I added honey to it.</i>

783
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:01,926
Honey?

784
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:05,888
You mixed honey with the ink? So?

785
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,516
Are you going to lick every certificate?

786
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:11,185
- No, not me.
- What is that?

787
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:15,148
They will find the forgery for us.

788
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,404
Goodness gracious!

789
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:27,744
Get to work, little ones.

790
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:29,495
There you go. Right there.

791
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,332
Yes. Keep going.

792
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:37,462
Look at them eat. That one too.

793
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:39,881
That is it. Good job, boys.

794
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:42,049
- There you go.
- Hold on.

795
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:43,634
Enjoy.

796
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:45,052
That is it.

797
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:08,242
Do not fret. It is all right.

798
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,789
It is fine. We are still winning.

799
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:15,792
Do well.

800
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,560
That was not too bad.

801
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,813
The game is not over yet. Go ahead.

802
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:51,702
We are tied!

803
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:04,841
If you roll a matching pair,
that will lead us to victory!

804
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:07,927
There is no way he would
also roll a matching pair.

805
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,470
No way.

806
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,106
Hold it!

807
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:25,403
What is it?
Are you now lacking the confidence?

808
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:27,822
There are no backsies at a gambling table.

809
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:31,993
Take off that shirt of yours.
Something is not right.

810
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:35,121
Maybe you have something hidden
under there.

811
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:48,509
What the…

812
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:51,846
Lee Eun-ho, is this absolutely necessary?

813
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:52,972
Look at that.

814
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:56,309
I admit that is a sight.

815
01:04:57,768 --> 01:04:59,604
Take off your shirt and roll the dice.

816
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,481
Why should they strip?

817
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:05,651
Do not mind him, and keep it on.

818
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:12,074
You are grasping at straws
now that you are cornered.

819
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:15,161
Fine. I will strip.

820
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:18,623
Let us all strip.

821
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:21,959
It will not be pure dice-rolling
if I keep my clothes on.

822
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:24,086
- Let us strip!
- No, it is fine.

823
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,254
- Yes, let us strip.
- No.

824
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:27,673
- Hold on.
- Strip!

825
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:28,716
No, stop that.

826
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:32,345
- Stop it.
- Strip, boys!

827
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,848
Let us bare it all.

828
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:38,434
- That is not necessary.
- Strip.

829
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:51,739
All right. Here I go.

830
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:54,951
- Go, Myeong-ho!
- Go, Myeong-ho!

831
01:05:55,034 --> 01:06:00,456
- Myeong-ho!
- Myeong-ho!

832
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:12,718
He rolled two threes!

833
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:15,721
Yes!

834
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:21,811
Do not make a big fuss.

835
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,522
All right. Bring it!

836
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:27,525
It is your turn.

837
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:33,614
Why are you not stripping?

838
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:40,871
Remove your shirt already.

839
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:42,748
Why, you…

840
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:48,129
I found the culprit!

841
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:50,923
It is…

842
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:54,051
He is the killer.

843
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:59,682
THIRTY

844
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:01,934
You need to roll the dice.

845
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:04,520
Why are you hesitating? That is not manly.

846
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:07,273
Take it off and roll them fair and square.

847
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:11,485
It is not like you are
hiding something under there.

848
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:13,029
Let go! Damn it.

849
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:35,426
If you are chickening out,
stop and beg for our mercy.

850
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:36,719
Or maybe

851
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:41,348
you would all like to leave Gyohwa Hall.

852
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:45,019
What? Leave the training program?

853
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:48,606
You. Just roll them.

854
01:07:48,689 --> 01:07:50,733
- Strip and roll the dice.
- I cannot.

855
01:07:50,816 --> 01:07:52,693
Calm down, boys.

856
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:54,945
Things are getting interesting here.

857
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,157
Remove your shirt and roll the dice.

858
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:09,293
Grab him!

859
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:12,505
What the… How dare you?

860
01:08:14,632 --> 01:08:15,966
Grab him.

861
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:18,552
Get back here.

862
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:25,643
What is the meaning of this?

863
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:51,544
THIRTY

864
01:08:54,338 --> 01:08:56,715
THIRTY

865
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:00,177
Number 30.

866
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,348
Hong Deok-su.

867
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:26,495
Find it.

868
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:27,663
12 YEARS AGO

869
01:09:32,751 --> 01:09:34,670
Now, pick one.

870
01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:37,464
This one…

871
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:39,842
No, wait.

872
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:45,931
Your daughter

873
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:48,184
picks this one.

874
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,311
This one?

875
01:09:57,776 --> 01:10:00,487
- There.
- What? I got it wrong.

876
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:05,284
- Were you only looking for the ring?
- Yes, Father.

877
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:16,754
Finding the jade ring
is not the only way to happiness.

878
01:10:16,837 --> 01:10:17,713
One of them…

879
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:20,758
had a flower under it.

880
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:23,802
And one of them hid the jade ring.

881
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:26,430
They were all yours
no matter what you chose.

882
01:10:27,348 --> 01:10:28,724
- Really?
- Of course.

883
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:32,061
Just remember to be content
with whatever you get.

884
01:10:35,981 --> 01:10:40,152
Still, the joy cannot be greater
than that of winning the better prize.

885
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:47,743
Did you lose the wager yet again?

886
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:51,413
Why are you invested in the game
when you always lose?

887
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:54,124
I will someday win at this game.

888
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:02,633
Your stubbornness is equal
to that of my master's.

889
01:11:05,844 --> 01:11:08,013
Do you wish to beat your father that much?

890
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:08,931
Yes.

891
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:12,101
Should I teach you how?

892
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:15,604
Really? Yes, please teach me.

893
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:19,149
Why, Seol Mae-hwa,
are you willing to pass on your talents?

894
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:23,696
To make a wager
that will guarantee your victory,

895
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:27,992
switch to a game you are better at.

896
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:58,814
Like this?

897
01:11:58,897 --> 01:11:59,940
Yes.

898
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:40,898
<i>I found the Red Certificate forger.</i>

899
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:42,441
<i>A young man named Hong Deok-su.</i>

900
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,026
Hong Deok-su…

901
01:12:44,109 --> 01:12:45,819
<i>You are after Lord Cheon's position?</i>

902
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:48,155
<i>No, that of Lady Seol's.</i>

903
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:51,241
Lady Seol, is this also not
how you do business?

904
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:54,119
<i>Number 30, Hong Deok-su…</i>

905
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:58,332
A sword with a dragon engraving
was found at the murder scene.

906
01:12:58,415 --> 01:12:59,750
One belonging to the royal family?

907
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:02,252
<i>Should the Minister of War</i>
<i>get his hands on the sword,</i>

908
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:05,255
<i>there is no telling what he will do.</i>

909
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:07,883
<i>Who are you really?</i>
<i>Your speech is unlike the rest.</i>

910
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:10,094
<i>It will put you two in a fix</i>
<i>if someone finds out.</i>

911
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:12,304
<i>You are being more suspicious</i>
<i>if you ask me.</i>

912
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:14,473
Do you think you are
a royal prince or something?

913
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:16,934
<i>As ordered by Lady Seol,</i>

914
01:13:17,017 --> 01:13:20,562
<i>you will be evaluated in groups</i>
<i>which consist of your roommates.</i>

915
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:24,191
<i>I will get rid of</i>
<i>every elementary apprentice.</i>

916
01:13:24,274 --> 01:13:26,902
<i>A mistake or error by one of you</i>
<i>will result</i>

917
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:28,987
<i>in the expulsion of your roommates.</i>

918
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,322
<i>Is this what they mean</i>

919
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:32,533
- <i>by being in the same boat?</i>
- <i>Absolutely.</i>

920
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:35,619
<i>My friend, you should not be that obvious.</i>

921
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:38,914
<i>Do you like Deok-su?</i>

922
01:13:38,997 --> 01:13:41,959
