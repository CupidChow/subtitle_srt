1
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,793
ALL CHARACTERS
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,128
FILMING FOR CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,339
Get your taffy!

4
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,301
Since when do you like snacks?

5
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,594
Hello.

6
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:55,013
My wife developed a sweet tooth
after conceiving.

7
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,139
What about your wife?

8
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,309
Get her proper ones rather than this junk.

9
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,435
Goodness, my lord.

10
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,355
I have not sold a single taffy
since yesterday.

11
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,401
Is that so?
Then, I will buy all this pumpkin taffy.

12
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,653
Pardon? All of it?

13
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,697
Goodness, my lord!

14
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:17,494
My lord, I must say
I bear a humble talent.

15
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,162
I tell fortune with taffy sticks.

16
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,999
Should I tell yours?

17
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,544
Fortune-telling taffy sticks?
Sounds like fun.

18
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,466
- Here. Do tell mine.
- Yes, my lord.

19
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,221
Goodness.

20
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,891
I see your wife
carrying a clever little girl.

21
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:44,062
The name should be…

22
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,489
JAE-HWA

23
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,456
"Jae" as in wealth
and "hwa" as in fortune.

24
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,084
Your child will accumulate
the utmost wealth.

25
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,380
"Jae-hwa"?

26
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,298
It is a name too grand.

27
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:16,386
Anyway, thank you.

28
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,764
But all I want is
for my child to be healthy.

29
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,059
Then, let me have it.

30
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,561
No, my lord.

31
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,397
The name was already bought for a price.

32
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,024
It will not hold the same power
for someone else.

33
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,904
But it might be a different story
should you take one character each.

34
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,364
I will give you one.

35
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:40,201
That is the least I can do for a friend.

36
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,079
Take the character "hwa."

37
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,297
HWA

38
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,143
I will earn money for you.

39
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,520
Money?

40
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,648
Is that all you can offer?

41
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:15,361
I already am the richest man in Joseon.

42
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,822
Hence my offer.

43
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,202
Where there is wealth,
there is hidden greed.

44
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,290
You can use this opportunity
to see what pests flock your way.

45
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,461
Who are you to run your mouth like that?

46
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,548
Maybe you can decide
after you hear my proposal.

47
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,473
Put the dismissal on hold.

48
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:48,186
My lord, what will the other clerks think…

49
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,938
It will set an example.

50
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:54,317
It will show how much Yongcheonru cares
for its members.

51
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,574
As you have suggested,
you shall prove yourself on your own.

52
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,077
Yes, I shall, my lord.

53
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,002
You shall officially be reinstated
after you achieve

54
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,921
what was promised.

55
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,632
That should be good enough.

56
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,105
You should have never returned
to Yongcheonru.

57
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,026
Why not?

58
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,490
I worked very hard to get here.

59
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,162
You seem to have a lot to say about me.

60
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,872
No matter what anyone says,

61
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,500
I made it here on my own merits.

62
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,837
Nothing is out of reach for me now.

63
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,215
I even made it back safely from prison.

64
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,259
Hong Deok-su. You are--

65
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,220
I know who tipped off the police bureau

66
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,222
to frame me for murder.

67
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,022
I will never…

68
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,028
run away like a coward.

69
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,562
What are you doing out here, Eun-ho?

70
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,022
You brat!

71
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,232
You should have come straight back
after being released.

72
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,027
Where have you been all this time?

73
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,783
Were you worried about me?

74
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,827
When I am the manly Hong Deok-su?

75
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,792
That is not our room.

76
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,126
What?

77
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,336
Follow me.

78
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,007
Did we move?

79
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,510
Make haste.

80
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,396
- Hurry inside.
- But…

81
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,692
- Where are we?
- He is here. Grab him!

82
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,569
- What?
- Grab him!

83
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,905
- What are you doing?
- Open up.

84
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,492
What is this, Su-ra?

85
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,744
Something one must eat
after time in prison.

86
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,871
- Good, is it not?
- It is.

87
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,255
By the way,
how did you know I would be back?

88
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,506
I am Cheon Jun-hwa.

89
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,675
I am aware of everything about you.

90
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,887
Jun-hwa prepared all this for you.

91
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:15,476
One needs a little pick-me-up
after the hard time in prison.

92
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,436
As in what, you ask?

93
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,104
Pork.

94
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,817
All right. Sure.

95
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,572
How is it? Does it not taste elegant?

96
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,698
It does.

97
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,201
It is delicious, Jun-hwa. Thanks.

98
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,954
I feel a sudden surge of energy.

99
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:41,586
Here. This white rice cake is from me.

100
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:51,262
However, if it had not been
for me, Ko Su-ra,

101
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,348
who covered for you while you were absent,

102
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,476
would you have been able to return safely?

103
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,315
Right, Su-ra. You are the best.

104
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,318
I lucked out with friends. Here you go.

105
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,697
The Elementary apprentices are the best.

106
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,035
Now, Jun-hwa.

107
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,555
Let us eat.

108
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,519
- It is good.
- Yes, it is.

109
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:43,105
It truly is delicious. Dig in.

110
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,575
Why do you remain at Yongcheonru?

111
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,827
I am not done.

112
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,997
I need more time.

113
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,125
Grand Proprietor Cheon will soon know
that the brass key is missing.

114
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,753
You must make your move first.

115
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,424
Hong Deok-su only just returned.

116
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,093
Pardon?

117
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:16,013
I must see if the two pieces match.

118
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,724
But for that reason,
you went to the Minister of War

119
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,519
to have Hong Deok-su released.
Why have you not--

120
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,105
Nothing comes
before the safety of a person.

121
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,901
He just came back
after undergoing hardship.

122
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,028
It would be wrong
to prioritize the brass key.

123
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,656
I may be out of line, but--

124
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,782
I am also well aware

125
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:40,705
of why I chose to come here
under an alias.

126
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,006
Do not worry, Beom-ho.

127
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,883
It will soon be over.

128
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,898
- You like Deok-su, do you not?
- What?

129
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,318
No.

130
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,740
- No?
- Do not get the wrong idea.

131
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:19,535
Why would I like Deok-su when he--

132
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,370
You know she is actually a woman.

133
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,584
It seems you found out before I did.

134
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,586
When was it?

135
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:38,471
When Deok-su fell into the stream
while washing the cloths.

136
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,350
You have known for that long?

137
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:47,897
I was about to change
her wet clothes when…

138
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,525
No!

139
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,277
You cannot go in.

140
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,491
I see. That is why
you forbade me to enter.

141
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:02,453
Right. So when did you find out
that Deok-su is a woman?

142
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,248
When Myeong-ho was suspecting it,

143
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,583
I found out while helping her.

144
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,085
Goodness.

145
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,797
If people find out one by one like this,

146
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,799
everyone will discover the truth soon.

147
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:18,719
I know. There is also Eun-ho
who has to sleep in the same room as her.

148
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,931
Should we tell him in advance?

149
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,307
No.

150
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,810
We should keep it a secret
until she reveals it first.

151
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,479
Do you think so?

152
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,291
<i>Once I combine the pieces,</i>
<i>it will be over.</i>

153
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,893
Deok-su, why are you not
in a clerk's uniform?

154
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,396
Get changed already.
We are expected at work.

155
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,064
Oh, about that…

156
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,317
There is a situation.

157
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:28,951
What could be the problem
when the police bureau released you?

158
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,954
Were you not reinstated as a clerk?

159
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:34,790
Well…

160
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,001
It has not been approved.

161
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:40,880
Not approved?

162
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,341
Whose approval do you need?

163
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,011
Well…

164
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,766
You see…

165
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,269
Do not make me frustrated
and just tell us.

166
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,068
YONGCHEONRU

167
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,949
NORTHERN ANNEX

168
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,088
A gambling den? Deok-su.

169
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,258
Was that truly the only way?

170
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,640
So, let me hear your proposal.

171
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,684
Every kind of business in Joseon
is in Yongcheonru

172
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,312
except for just one.

173
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:41,065
Something Yongcheonru does not have?

174
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,483
That is…

175
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,154
a gambling den.

176
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,076
You want Yongcheonru
to open a gambling den

177
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,244
which is against national law?

178
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,123
Is this audacity or recklessness?

179
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,586
The higher the stakes,
the greater the profit.

180
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,672
Do you not agree?

181
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,219
That will get me reinstated.

182
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,472
Lord Cheon promised to reinstate me

183
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,307
if the gambling den is successful.

184
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,227
Are you saying he made that deal himself?

185
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,312
Right. Hear me out.

186
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,315
The greatest entertainment facility
in Joseon

187
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,193
and the cherry on top at Yongcheonru.

188
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:42,042
I will create a space
that brings joy to its patrons.

189
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,628
So your solution
is to open a gambling den?

190
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,090
It is illegal. I cannot approve it.

191
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,550
I am also against illegal businesses.

192
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,886
This will not be a gambling den
that opens illegally at the marketplace.

193
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:57,558
Proper procedure will be followed,
and only special guests will be invited.

194
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:00,644
What on earth
is Grand Proprietor Cheon thinking?

195
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,188
You should be reinstated
since you were released from prison.

196
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,650
Deok-su.

197
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:10,946
I am well aware of how determined you are
to make it at Yongcheonru.

198
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,034
But this is wrong.

199
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,118
For me…

200
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,040
This is my last chance.

201
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,878
This gambling den must be a success.

202
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,510
Look, Su-ra, we are a team.

203
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,346
Together, we have muddled through
all hardships so far.

204
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,891
Right?

205
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:43,103
Oh, I will not ask for your assistance.

206
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:51,320
This matter is my responsibility,
and my problem to solve.

207
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,585
Goodness, Su-ra.

208
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,880
He will soon come around
despite his harsh words.

209
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,967
If you are arrested for this,

210
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,137
you will not be let go easily.

211
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,473
Deok-su,

212
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,558
find another way.

213
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,656
Holding off on his reinstatement
was not what you promised.

214
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,493
Father.

215
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:44,289
You knelt down right there
referring to me as the grand proprietor

216
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,959
only to soon return to your childish self.

217
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,046
You will reinstate him anyway.

218
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,298
That is why you met
with the Minister of War.

219
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,468
I did not have Hong Deok-su released.

220
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,386
Pardon?

221
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,180
What are you talking about?

222
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,725
How could he have been released
if it had not been for you?

223
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:12,234
How much do you know
about the Elementary kids

224
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,611
that you call "friends"?

225
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,407
I know my friends well.

226
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,494
Then,

227
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:26,373
are you aware that one of them is
His Majesty's son Prince Muyeong?

228
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:36,884
And that Prince Muyeong was the one
who had Hong Deok-su released from prison?

229
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,017
Cheon Jun-hwa.

230
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,770
Did you say you know your friends well?

231
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:56,778
No, you know nothing.

232
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,158
<i>He is not the culprit.</i>

233
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,994
Go back without me.
I need to stop by somewhere.

234
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,330
Eun-ho!

235
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,625
If you are arrested for this,

236
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,128
you will not be let go easily.

237
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,010
Lee Eun-ho…

238
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,180
is Prince Muyeong?

239
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,686
If you do not know
who your so-called friends truly are,

240
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,439
you will allow others
to beat you to the punch.

241
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,025
Will you let this continue?

242
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,782
To obtain what you want,

243
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,784
you must strike first.

244
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,955
Think about what you should do.

245
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,350
What Hong Deok-su proposed.

246
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,228
Allow me to take point.

247
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,534
I will ask you bluntly.

248
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,953
Grand Proprietor Cheon

249
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:33,166
sent me a piece of paper
with the character "cheon" written on it.

250
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,460
Enlighten me.

251
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,297
Am I right to understand
that it is worth more than a fortune?

252
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,217
Did Grand Proprietor Cheon
send it to you as a gift?

253
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,678
Darn.

254
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,641
I let that sly fox get the better of me.

255
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,185
He came to me with it

256
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,731
and requested that I release
the Red Certificate thief Hong Deok-su.

257
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,652
Is that why you had him released?

258
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,322
No, that was not the reason.

259
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,991
As I promised you,

260
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,535
I was going to let you take him.

261
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,164
But who knew that Prince Muyeong
would request his release?

262
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,375
Either way, I apologize.

263
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,628
But all is good
since he was safely released.

264
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,800
Anyway, about that Hong Deok-su…

265
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,178
There is something about him.

266
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,681
He is nothing but a mere thief
who stole a Red Certificate.

267
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,893
I doubt that.

268
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:37,189
You of all people,
who know about everything in this world,

269
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,273
would surely know.

270
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,901
Something is off.

271
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:44,362
Would I dare to keep it a secret
if I knew?

272
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:52,454
You must not think
it is the right time to tell me.

273
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,747
I hear you.

274
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,833
I will put my trust in you and wait.

275
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,220
Let me start by cleaning up.

276
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,693
GEUMUI CHAMBER

277
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,278
Thank you.

278
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,289
May I have your name?

279
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,125
Go on and carry his luggage.

280
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,964
You are staying for four days.
The Cheongui Chamber…

281
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,800
What use is he to anyone
when he is that slow?

282
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,762
I hated it when the Elementary brats
were always together,

283
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,932
so it puts me in a good mood
to see him by himself.

284
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,688
- By the way,
- What the…

285
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,065
I heard that Hong Deok-su was back.

286
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,406
But he was expelled
without actually being appointed.

287
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,699
How could he be back?

288
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,326
He even slept
at the clerks' quarters last night.

289
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,555
Where is Jun-hwa?

290
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:35,599
I do not know.

291
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,269
How is the work at Cheongui Chamber?

292
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:41,897
I am not sure.

293
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,816
The work is probably the same.

294
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,199
Eun-ho.

295
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,911
Should we not talk Deok-su out of it?

296
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,413
It is obviously too dangerous.

297
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:07,214
Ten tables, forty chairs, ten piles of silk,

298
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,841
and Korean pine wood for a plaque.

299
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,968
Ordinary pine wood would also do.

300
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,720
Sure. I can get you these.

301
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,264
Thank you, my lord.

302
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,225
- Right. Here.
- Sure.

303
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,104
- Pay up.
- Pardon?

304
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:30,111
But those are
for a business at Yongcheonru.

305
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,281
That is why you must pay for the supplies.

306
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,617
What? But…

307
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,911
Lord Cho!

308
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,623
Stay back.

309
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,585
I have something to tell you.

310
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:47,754
No.

311
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,799
Every clerk is to follow
a designated schedule.

312
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,051
Maybe I could do it on my days off.

313
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:57,138
How could I help you with a matter
that goes against Lady Seol's wishes?

314
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,723
I cannot.

315
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:00,433
However,

316
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,727
this is Yongcheonru's business.

317
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,563
Lady Seol is my direct supervisor,

318
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,399
so how could I possibly…

319
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,693
Forget it.

320
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,860
Just leave.

321
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,530
That being said,

322
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:17,617
I would like you to make a dessert
that one would crave like golden ice.

323
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,788
It is a chance to boast
your talent as a chef.

324
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:26,042
But my talent is already well-known.

325
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,295
Please. Just help me out this once.

326
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,796
For free?

327
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,172
- Well…
- Move!

328
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,217
I will peel onions for you.

329
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,177
- Or I could work the millstone--
- Hey!

330
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,222
My time is worth a small fortune.

331
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:42,809
Do you have any idea
what they pay me here at Yongcheonru?

332
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,943
If it becomes a success,
you will be credited.

333
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,862
- If it becomes a success?
- Yes.

334
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,196
- If you succeed?
- Yes!

335
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,032
Come find me once you do.

336
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,995
Lord Jang, please.

337
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:05,290
Come to me with an offer
once your business succeeds.

338
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,334
Lord Jang, please.

339
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,265
Jun-hwa, what are you doing?

340
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,726
I told you, you do not have to help me.

341
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:30,315
Come on, friend.
I am helping during my lunch hour.

342
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:34,027
I thought about it,
and I believe it will be a huge hit.

343
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,028
Let me in on it.

344
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,404
Forget it.

345
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,699
This is something I must do myself.

346
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:43,203
What? Never did I think
you were this selfish.

347
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,164
Let me in on it.

348
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,291
What? Stop it.

349
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,668
You never take me seriously,
do you, Jun-hwa?

350
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,088
The answer is no.

351
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:56,508
Now, go.

352
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:02,555
If I were in that situation,
would you turn your back on me?

353
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,682
Would you not help me?

354
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,605
Are we not friends, Deok-su?

355
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,237
What… Goodness.

356
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:21,950
Mind you, I will still
take my share of the profit.

357
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,160
Fifty percent.

358
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,164
Follow me, then.

359
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,958
Right, off we go.

360
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,755
All right.

361
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:38,717
Watch your step.

362
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,135
- Put it here.
- Here?

363
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,976
No, stay seated.

364
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,228
- I told you to stay seated.
- Come on.

365
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,107
Stop it.

366
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,986
Wait for me.

367
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,583
How dare you trespass?

368
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,383
What is the matter, Master Bang?

369
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,969
Hong Deok-su was not expelled.

370
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,931
I heard your expulsion
had been put on hold,

371
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:30,602
but since you are not an official clerk
of Yongcheonru,

372
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,645
you are not allowed in its chambers.

373
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,023
But I will soon be reinstated.

374
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:38,026
Who says that it is a given?

375
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:42,363
You ruined the appointment ceremony
and were dragged off by the police bureau.

376
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,616
You have got some nerve,
showing your face here.

377
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,660
Kick him out of here, Master Bang!

378
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,204
Quiet, you brats!

379
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,666
Your sacks have been packed,
so hurry on out.

380
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,793
But that is…

381
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,005
How could you kick someone out overnight?

382
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:01,090
Master Bang, please give him some time.

383
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,884
Rules are rules.

384
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:06,054
You may stay here
when you have been reinstated.

385
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,890
Also, leave the apprentice uniform here.

386
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,809
There is no need to be this harsh.

387
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:11,976
Jun-hwa, that is enough.

388
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,694
Run along, then.

389
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,166
It is all right.

390
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,293
I am fine.

391
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,756
The commute has been terrible
for me anyway.

392
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,300
It might be better to just bunk there.

393
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,723
I will be fine. See you.

394
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,401
Deok-su.

395
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,303
I see you are back.

396
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,014
I wonder why.

397
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,020
This is worth ten nyang of silver.

398
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,563
Wait, these are…

399
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,858
This is worth five nyang of gold.

400
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,068
Look here. This is a pawnshop.

401
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:47,322
I needed to profit in some way. Goodness.

402
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,406
Even so,

403
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,993
just a nugget of silver for all of these?

404
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,245
Goodness.

405
00:31:56,164 --> 00:32:00,293
Today, I will pay double for your items.

406
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,128
Before,

407
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,881
despite Yongcheonru
banning your transactions,

408
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,134
you cheated me out of a decent price.

409
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:10,929
And you said

410
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,515
you were daringly
letting me pawn these in secret.

411
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,810
That is only because
you seemed desperate--

412
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,395
Take a look.

413
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:23,483
As if whatever it says on here
would make a difference.

414
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,321
The Cheon family?

415
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:32,241
Are you not aware of the Cheon family
when you do business in the marketplace?

416
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,494
I must say, that is fearless of you.

417
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,415
It is not like you are the son

418
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,751
of Yongcheonru's Grand Proprietor Cheon.

419
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,923
Are you really?

420
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,342
Yes.

421
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:52,345
So tell me. Would the pricing
be on point this time?

422
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,808
Please take this back first.

423
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,977
Of course. Absolutely.

424
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,440
I appreciate you granting me
this opportunity.

425
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:09,404
Actually, from the moment I met you,
I knew you were someone extraordinary.

426
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:14,158
Just so you know,
my calculations and pricing are always…

427
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,912
on point.

428
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,871
It is ash wood.

429
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:04,208
It is firm enough to be used
to make flogging sticks.

430
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,545
- Are you up?
- Yes.

431
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:14,802
However, it is also pliable enough
to make these pieces for <i>tujeon</i>.

432
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,847
I picked this wood to save money,
but it is better than expected.

433
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,855
So you are adamant
about opening a gambling den.

434
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,608
I must.

435
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,571
After all I did to get this far?

436
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,783
I have come too far to stop.

437
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:42,038
Was succeeding at Yongcheonru

438
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,249
the final request of your late father?

439
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:51,923
Is that why you have come this far
with that item he left on you?

440
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,136
Why would you ask about that?

441
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,890
I doubt it is something
you should be interested in.

442
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,561
Grand Proprietor Cheon will soon know
that the brass key is missing.

443
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,271
Do not worry, Beom-ho.

444
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,191
It will soon be over.

445
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,321
Let me help you.

446
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,406
What?

447
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,491
In return,

448
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:23,329
you will do something for me
once this is over.

449
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,456
- Eun-ho.
- Will you

450
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,875
accept my terms?

451
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,672
Stop acting suspicious and leave.

452
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,757
I already told you.

453
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:39,053
This is for me to handle.

454
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:07,748
<i>Are you aware that one of them is</i>
<i>His Majesty's son Prince Muyeong?</i>

455
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:11,794
If you do not know
who your so-called friends truly are,

456
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,881
you will allow others
to beat you to the punch.

457
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,383
Will you let this continue?

458
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:31,731
You seem highly interested for someone
who was against the gambling den.

459
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,777
If the business can be profitable,

460
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,821
I have a reason to change my mind.

461
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,367
Let us talk. Have a seat.

462
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,921
I am exhausted from running here and there

463
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:58,049
trying to raise the money we need.

464
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,675
Do you still need a lot more?

465
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:02,762
I handled it.

466
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,099
By the way, Eun-ho, where are you from?

467
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,770
We barely know anything about each other.

468
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,315
Ask whatever it is you want.

469
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,571
When we all went to the police bureau,

470
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:25,409
you did not return
to your chamber that night.

471
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,911
Where were you?

472
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,751
Did I not return? My memory is fuzzy.

473
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,884
I cashed in everything I had
to rescue Deok-su

474
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,678
only to fail.

475
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,556
It turns out that someone else
had him released first.

476
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:53,104
Whoever it was,
we should be glad he was released.

477
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,731
His release was a relief,

478
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:59,026
but my ego took a punch.

479
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:06,492
That is why
there is something I now wish to do.

480
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:07,910
Which is?

481
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,999
Becoming the grand proprietor
of Yongcheonru.

482
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,004
That is unexpected.

483
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:20,673
What? Don't you think I can do it?

484
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:25,720
Out of everyone I have seen, you are
the most relaxed and free-spirited.

485
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,181
Who knew you had such an ambition?

486
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,518
Is that how you saw me?

487
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,022
But I now have a goal.

488
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,486
This time around, I will strike first.

489
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,704
Let us try our best.

490
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,474
These are from Yongcheonru, Your Majesty.

491
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,900
How should they prepare for the guests?

492
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,529
Let Grand Proprietor Cheon take the reins.

493
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,084
Have you finally found it?

494
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,878
This piece was found
in Grand Proprietor Cheon's residence,

495
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,381
but I cannot help but be skeptical.

496
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:28,801
You have doubts?

497
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:32,304
It was kept in a place
that was easy to find as if he knew

498
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,973
someone would come for it.

499
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:38,144
Grand Proprietor Cheon set a bait
by placing a decoy for someone to find?

500
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:43,441
I would not put that past him
being the cunning man he is.

501
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:48,863
Father.

502
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,615
Who made this brass key?

503
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,998
Why would you ask that?

504
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,543
It is of a unique design
as two pieces are needed.

505
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:08,591
It made me wonder
if there was another story behind it.

506
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:13,929
What story would there be?

507
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,265
No.

508
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,267
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

509
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,560
I said no!

510
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,112
Forgive me.

511
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,951
The crown prince will soon be appointed.

512
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,870
You must hurry.

513
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,374
You must find the brass key

514
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,294
and return to the palace.

515
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:50,007
I will do everything in my power
to unveil Lord Cheon's secret.

516
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,096
Prince Muyeong,

517
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:01,894
you are my eldest son
and the future crown prince

518
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,854
who will serve
the royal family and the nation.

519
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,317
Keep that in mind.

520
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,072
Yes, Father.

521
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,132
That troublemaker from before.

522
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,719
Hong Deok-su who was arrested
in Yongcheonru.

523
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:39,807
The one you had released
for lack of suspicion?

524
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:40,724
Yes.

525
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,689
Why is he wanted by Seol Mae-hwa?

526
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,525
Even Prince Muyeong advocated
for his release.

527
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:54,363
And why is Lord Cheon
also interested in him?

528
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:56,073
I cannot help but wonder.

529
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:00,077
Find out everything you can about him.

530
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,203
Yes, Minister.

531
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,513
It is important to have the right name.

532
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,915
Look further into Hong Deok-su's father.

533
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,210
And into his connection
to Grand Proprietor Cheon.

534
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,589
Recruit more people if you must
and hurry back with information.

535
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:54,882
Yes, Your Highness.

536
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,175
Also…

537
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,472
I await your order, Your Highness.

538
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:02,640
Beom-ho.

539
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,684
Do you have some money?

540
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:06,685
Pardon?

541
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:18,364
Strangely, for most of the days
Geumok Hall has not been booked.

542
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,075
Yes, I am aware of it.

543
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:27,289
It is for Lord Cheon's guest,
so I will handle it myself.

544
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:28,374
Just leave it be.

545
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,416
Yes, Lady Seol.

546
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:46,100
Will the VIP guest of Geumok Hall
arrive tonight?

547
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,187
Is there anything I should prepare?

548
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,606
Leave it be.

549
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:56,693
Until when will you busy yourself
with frivolous details?

550
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,614
A gambling den sounds risky.

551
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:02,950
It is banned by national law.

552
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:08,580
My money trumps the law.

553
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:09,957
So what is there to fear?

554
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:15,087
All will be well as long as
word does not travel outside these walls.

555
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:17,923
But Young Master Jun-hwa is also--

556
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:20,426
It is the perfect test for him.

557
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:24,680
Why are you giving Hong Deok-su a chance?

558
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,934
That Hong Deok-su.

559
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,895
He has a way of raising the stakes.

560
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,941
I must admit
he is an amusing one to observe.

561
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:40,279
Jun-hwa will have to
learn the ropes anyway,

562
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:43,115
so for it to be fun is icing on the cake.

563
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,377
Which one do you prefer?

564
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,422
I prefer the purple one.

565
00:45:58,505 --> 00:45:59,715
Allow me to serve your tea.

566
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:04,261
This will make the skirt,
and this the shirt…

567
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:10,184
My word! Do you know
how expensive this silk is?

568
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,226
I expect compensation!

569
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,561
I am terribly sorry.

570
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:16,607
Ko Su-ra, apologize to them properly.
Is this the best you can do?

571
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,984
Bring me the one in charge!

572
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:21,111
How dare you touch it?

573
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,697
I will wash it clean for you.

574
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,491
How could you be so careless?

575
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,451
- I apologize.
- Shut it!

576
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:48,805
That silk is from Qing
and costs quite a small fortune.

577
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:49,890
What are you going to do?

578
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,934
The price can be deducted from my salary.

579
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:54,603
Then how will your family
back home manage?

580
00:46:56,188 --> 00:47:01,443
Just swallow your pride
and join the pack under me, huh?

581
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:05,489
Fraternizing with your roommates will only
put you on the bad side of our seniors.

582
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,826
Grasp the opportunity
when I give it to you.

583
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,498
Ko Su-ra!

584
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:16,917
What is it?

585
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:19,836
What is with him?

586
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,213
I would have taken his offer.

587
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,509
Come on.

588
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:42,025
With this money,
you will pay for the guest's silk

589
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,860
in Ko Su-ra's stead?

590
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:47,489
But you were to pay for the supplies.

591
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,285
I will soon come up
with the money for them.

592
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,998
You must be richer than I thought.

593
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,750
I will await the payment,

594
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,877
but you must hurry.
There is not much time.

595
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,130
Yes, my lord.

596
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:06,883
Please do not tell Su-ra about this.

597
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,011
Sure.

598
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:17,311
<i>What?</i>

599
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,563
You spent all that money?

600
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:22,149
Well, you see…

601
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,404
I apologize.

602
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:31,283
It may have been a loan,
but I should have discussed it with you.

603
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:35,203
I spent it on something good.
On something meaningful.

604
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:37,956
What on earth did you spend it on?

605
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,626
You were going to buy new chairs.

606
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:44,212
Now that they are all fixed up,
they are as good as new.

607
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:50,677
Hong Deok-su. There should be
no secrets between business partners.

608
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,599
Could you have…

609
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,482
"If I were in that situation,
would you turn your back on me?"

610
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,194
"Would you not help me?"

611
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,614
"Are we not friends?"

612
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,368
Those were your words.

613
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:23,919
Right. You made the right choice.

614
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:28,674
Darn. What am I supposed to sell next?

615
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,677
- What?
- That will not be necessary.

616
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:10,716
So this man right here
is your older brother?

617
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:14,010
He is not my brother by blood,

618
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,430
but a distant cousin of mine.

619
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:23,228
Wait. Are you not the one I met…

620
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:26,064
The taffy.

621
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,443
Goodness. It sure is nice
to see you again.

622
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:32,446
He is that guy I met at the marketplace.

623
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:37,909
He is one of the wealthiest whales
in all of Hanyang.

624
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,119
Goodness.

625
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:44,666
Right. I heard from him that there was
a solid investment to be made.

626
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,627
He has more than enough money,
so do not hesitate to accept it.

627
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,463
Sure thing.

628
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,134
This seems off. Are they really related?

629
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:55,719
They do not look alike.

630
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:59,139
I guess you can say
I was granted the looks in the family.

631
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,975
You said this was urgent.

632
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:03,435
Come to a decision quickly.

633
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:07,439
He is right. Accept the investment
and double the money for him.

634
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:09,816
What? What if he is a fraud?

635
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,736
Look here. I can hear you, you know.

636
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:18,492
Eun-ho, you said so yourself.

637
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,285
No one is generous for no reason.

638
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,578
Did I?

639
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,832
If you are not interested,
I will be on my way.

640
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,584
- Wait.
- Hold on.

641
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,921
I said I would vouch for this.

642
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:36,426
It will be for a minimum interest,
so accept the loan.

643
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,053
A minimum interest?

644
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:41,807
A minimum interest it is.

645
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:48,647
No.

646
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,191
The interest will be at market price.

647
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,487
Then it seems that we have a deal.

648
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:00,075
Cheers.

649
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:05,455
Goodness, how sweet is that?

650
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:08,041
The aroma is to die for.

651
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,222
Hey.

652
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,140
Did you pay for the silk I ruined?

653
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:25,767
Oh, that?

654
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,686
When did I ask for your help?

655
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:29,813
Who are you to pay off my debt for me?

656
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:33,608
I had taken out a loan
and happened to receive it that day.

657
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:36,361
- Your gambling den must be a success.
- Still…

658
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,614
You are just as important.

659
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:46,037
We promised to make it here together.

660
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:57,716
Here? How about here?

661
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:59,092
- Is this good?
- Hold on. Let me help.

662
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:00,468
Hurry.

663
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,262
Come on. Keep moving.

664
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,299
All right.

665
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:42,594
Pull. There you go.

666
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,629
I am not done eating.

667
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,094
Hurry.

668
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,856
Are you dense or carefree?

669
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,359
Look at you sleeping just anywhere.

670
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,571
Hong Deok-su, wake up.
Your face will freeze off.

671
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:27,092
Have I been working too hard lately?

672
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:31,012
I guess that is plausible.

673
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:01,042
I should have the royal physician
pay me a visit.

674
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:19,561
Hong Deok-su, wake up. Hey!

675
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,980
Right.

676
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:26,651
Hey, you are back.

677
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:29,737
You cannot fall asleep outdoors like this.

678
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,742
Why are you flushed?
Are you not feeling well?

679
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,290
That is bad for the opening.

680
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:46,171
Are you more worried
about the den than me?

681
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:48,631
Of course.

682
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,636
I am sick, so check if I have a fever.

683
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,555
You are fine and will not die over this.

684
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,350
I have a fever. Thoroughly confirm.

685
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,436
What…

686
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:22,707
I should tidy up the board.

687
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,213
Oh, right.

688
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:44,729
Here.

689
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:50,109
You win if this points to your number.

690
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:53,154
All right. One, two, three.

691
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:55,448
Three.

692
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:01,454
Lee Eun-ho! Gosh, congratulations.

693
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:06,376
- What on earth could they be up to?
- One more!

694
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:08,419
This is clearly a gambling den.

695
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:11,589
When it is banned by national law?

696
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,426
- Dong-gyu.
- Yes?

697
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:19,264
What if our Uiju Guild
swallowed Yongcheonru as a whole?

698
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,933
Yes!

699
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:22,850
What?

700
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:25,770
Congratulations!

701
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:30,400
No, not like that.
Only take what is on the board.

702
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,815
It is all right. You are fine, Deok-su.

703
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:14,068
It will be over soon.

704
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:06,079
BULLAKHO

705
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:17,632
"Bullakho."

706
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,594
Meaning "how is it not joyful?"

707
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,513
BULLAKHO - HOW IS IT NOT JOYFUL

708
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:26,057
Naming a gambling den
by quoting the <i>Analects of Confucius</i>?

709
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,642
How cheeky of you.

710
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:33,106
It is a place for all to have fun
as if they have met an old friend.

711
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:34,732
You mean well,

712
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:40,154
but we will see
if the joy and pleasure can continue.

713
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:50,873
Map of Life and Death was designed to
mimic our lives.

714
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:57,880
Your move can grant you
the fortunes of this world

715
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,509
while you may die
by being hunted by Death.

716
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,594
Would you like to play?

717
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:05,763
I am good.

718
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:09,058
The owner only observes.

719
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:10,727
A gambling den

720
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:13,896
cannot profit if the patrons
only play against one another.

721
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:17,024
That is why the den needs a host.

722
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,568
A host?

723
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:23,239
Yes. Fortunately,
I know just the right person.

724
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,533
You summoned me?

725
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:36,294
Someone gifted enough
to bewilder the patrons…

726
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,925
who also plays her cards
terrifyingly close to the vest.

727
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,313
Lady Seol, how about you be the host?

728
01:02:57,815 --> 01:03:02,278
Now that I think about it,
you were gifted at dice-rolling.

729
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,280
That was a long time ago.

730
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:08,409
One's talents never fade. Give it a try.

731
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,419
Roll your dice first.

732
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:20,338
And I will chase you as Death.

733
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:23,966
Today, I will host the game.

734
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,642
Do you believe
that you will be able to catch me?

735
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,022
Yes.

736
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,234
I will hunt you down no matter what.

737
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:46,405
So be careful.

738
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:25,194
You acquired golden treasure, Lady Seol.

739
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:29,574
It is now my turn.

740
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:36,998
Death…

741
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:40,001
is right behind you, Lady Seol.

742
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:49,886
<i>Welcome.</i>

743
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:48,486
Oh, dear.

744
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:52,031
Your pawn…

745
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,620
has been caught by mine and died.

746
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:03,250
Even having all the gold of the world…

747
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:09,674
would be useless in the face of death.

748
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:14,720
Right.

749
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:17,807
You won.

750
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:28,734
A game where one lives or dies.

751
01:06:29,443 --> 01:06:30,611
How amusing.

752
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:34,615
We also have cards and a fortune wheel.

753
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:38,494
Oh, right.
If you are to be the host of the house,

754
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:40,121
you ought to practice with me.

755
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:47,712
Take it easy, my child. Take it easy.

756
01:06:56,595 --> 01:06:58,305
Did you enjoy the game?

757
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:01,267
You should stop here.

758
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:13,487
You are the one…

759
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:18,451
who backed me into this corner.

760
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:26,208
Are you not excited for tomorrow?

761
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,593
Bullakho, is it?

762
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:40,264
Did you engrave the name
on the plaque yourself?

763
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:46,854
I see you are crafty.

764
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:14,173
Have you been working your people well?

765
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:17,510
He even made a plaque. Bullakho, is it?

766
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:21,972
Yes. Our combined efforts
are making it a lot easier.

767
01:08:27,728 --> 01:08:28,979
Check.

768
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:34,026
I will defend.

769
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:49,583
I lost.

770
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:56,507
By not giving up your pawns,
you ended up losing your king.

771
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,011
Who do you see yourself as?

772
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:06,058
You are not a cannon

773
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,269
nor are you a chariot.

774
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:11,063
You are not even the king.

775
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:17,111
You must be the one designing the game.

776
01:09:19,071 --> 01:09:21,532
Do not be the pieces on the board.

777
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:24,702
Be the one moving them!

778
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:30,958
You must own the game.

779
01:09:45,389 --> 01:09:48,601
<i>I came across something peculiar</i>
<i>while looking into Grand Proprietor Cheon.</i>

780
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:52,938
<i>It involves the missing person poster</i>
<i>from the marketplace.</i>

781
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:05,409
<i>Lord Cheon had a business partner</i>
<i>who died a long time ago.</i>

782
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:07,953
<i>And he put up the poster</i>
<i>to find the missing daughter.</i>

783
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:09,288
<i>I wonder why he is looking for her.</i>

784
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:11,123
It was my father's.

785
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:14,293
It is the only item of his
that I have left.

786
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:17,630
It is also the reason
I must find success at Yongcheonru.

787
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,217
<i>Whatever it is, you can tell me.</i>

788
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:45,532
It is still being investigated,

789
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:47,368
but I took this from the marketplace.

790
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:55,834
The contact information
belongs to someone at Yongcheonru.

791
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:12,726
Fortunately, I know just the right person.

792
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,062
You summoned me?

793
01:11:16,563 --> 01:11:19,817
Someone gifted enough
to bewilder the patrons…

794
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:23,696
who also plays her cards
terrifyingly close to the vest.

795
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:36,000
How could that boy know about that?

796
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:00,232
<i>Leave.</i>

797
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:14,496
Seol Mae-hwa.

798
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:35,934
<i>If you want your sword back,</i>

799
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:38,187
<i>meet me where you taught me dice-rolling.</i>

800
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:01,585
You taught me a long time ago

801
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,421
that to win,

802
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:08,092
one should switch to a game
they are better at.

803
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:21,730
Today, I finally realized what you meant.

804
01:13:30,197 --> 01:13:31,031
Jae-on.

805
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:01,246
We will now open.

806
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:04,082
<i>Congratulations on your reinstatement,</i>
<i>"the manly Hong Deok-su."</i>

807
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,251
<i>For my immature Jun-hwa…</i>

808
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,420
<i>I was after Prince Muyeong,</i>

809
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:12,090
<i>but it seems I have ensnared</i>
<i>a far superior catch.</i>

810
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,592
- Hong Deok-su.
- Yes, my lord.

811
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:15,552
<i>You possess the boldness of a great hero.</i>

812
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:18,555
The more I look at you,
the more familiar you seem.

813
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,558
<i>Grand Proprietor Cheon</i>

814
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:24,436
<i>is searching for the daughter</i>
<i>of his late business partner.</i>

815
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:28,065
<i>I looked for her my whole life</i>
<i>for the sake of Jun-hwa.</i>

816
01:15:28,148 --> 01:15:31,318
Deok-su. I have something to say.
Can you spare me some time?

817
01:15:31,401 --> 01:15:33,320
What? You will confess your love?

818
01:15:33,403 --> 01:15:36,823
Have you lost your mind?
Why would you confess your feelings?

819
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:38,951
I have never felt this way
about anyone before.

820
01:15:39,743 --> 01:15:43,455
<i>Above all else,</i>
<i>I found her smile the sweetest.</i>

821
01:15:44,748 --> 01:15:45,999
Get a grip on yourself, Eun.

822
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:47,876
<i>He is nothing but the holder</i>
<i>of the brass key.</i>

823
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,128
<i>What is the brass key</i>
<i>that Hong Deok-su has?</i>

824
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,755
<i>Hong Jae-on…</i>

825
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,715
<i>Hong Deok-su…</i>

826
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:56,343
A woman you fell in love with
at first sight?

827
01:15:56,426 --> 01:15:58,679
Help me figure out
how to confess my feelings.

828
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:03,767
