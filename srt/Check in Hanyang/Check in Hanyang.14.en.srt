1
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,710
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,128
FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,341
12 YEARS AGO

4
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,594
Did you keep the royal physician quiet?

5
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,055
If word gets out,

6
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,432
we will go down together.

7
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,394
There is no mouth
that cannot be silenced with gold.

8
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,065
Could it be…

9
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:10,028
that you recorded the bribe
you offered the physician?

10
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,531
Of course not.

11
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:18,119
Your obsession with recording everything
in writing is pathological.

12
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:21,790
In the end, that will come to bite you.

13
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,001
Your concern is unnecessary.

14
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,755
This is no childish prank we are planning!

15
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,468
It is to replace
the sovereign of this nation.

16
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,935
It has already been disposed of.

17
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,520
You need not worry.

18
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,451
Goodness. Greetings, Your Majesty.

19
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:03,164
That is how you will be referred to
as of tomorrow, after all.

20
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,844
Have you received the abdication edict?

21
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,720
ABDICATION EDICT: DOCUMENT
WHERE THE KING ANNOUNCES

22
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,888
HIS ABDICATION FROM THE THRONE

23
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,099
Everything is going as planned,

24
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,350
so do not fret.

25
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:28,314
You offered to secure
a residence for my brother to stay in

26
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,109
after leaving the palace,
Proprietor Cheon.

27
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,569
Yes.

28
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,739
I have secured a place
where he can reside in peace.

29
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,583
This is the will of the heavens.

30
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,960
We are past the point of return.

31
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:21,576
It is time for you to make a decision
for the sake of this nation

32
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,621
and Prince Eunseong.

33
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,921
No one will benefit
from you dragging this out.

34
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,013
And Prince Eunseong?

35
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,891
I will serve him well.

36
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,036
Heed me!

37
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,330
His Majesty has collapsed!

38
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,457
Is anyone out there?

39
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,962
Your Majesty!

40
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:02,051
GANGNYEONGJEON

41
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,194
You said you would have him
abdicate the throne.

42
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:24,824
But you poisoned him?

43
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,163
The outcome is the same, is it not?

44
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,169
Your Majesty.

45
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,715
You must only think of the nation now.

46
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,163
Is there still no word
from the Royal Swordsman?

47
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,456
I am afraid not.

48
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,299
<i>Bow down and show respect.</i>

49
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:39,982
Lift your head.

50
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,496
Jun-hwa.

51
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,165
Leave with Deok-su.

52
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,173
Eun-ho.

53
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,177
You are…

54
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:10,930
Prince Muyeong?

55
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,527
We will return to the palace.

56
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,740
Escort His Highness.

57
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,769
<i>Do you not realize that Deok-su could be</i>

58
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,731
put in danger if you stay by her side?

59
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,483
Just…

60
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,402
leave now.

61
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,495
You were ordered to kill everyone here?

62
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,833
"Never attack anyone
untrained in swordsmanship."

63
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,210
As my tutor…

64
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,214
that is what you taught me.

65
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,635
I am only following His Majesty's order.

66
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,452
We should head back, Deok-su.

67
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,564
Deok-su.

68
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,239
Deok-su.

69
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,244
Yes?

70
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,006
It is nothing.

71
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:51,799
Let us head inside.

72
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,176
We should get you treated.

73
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,706
Does it hurt a lot?

74
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,335
I am fine as long as you are safe.

75
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,588
As if.

76
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,886
How did you know to be there?

77
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,396
What about you?

78
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,900
What were you
and Prince Muyeong doing there?

79
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:55,988
Were you aware…

80
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,576
that Eun-ho was in fact

81
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,037
Prince Muyeong?

82
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:05,915
Yes.

83
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,339
How?

84
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,802
How is that even possible?

85
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,930
He lives in a different world
than the rest of us.

86
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,101
You are bound to be hurt

87
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,312
if you stay by his side.

88
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,273
End things with him.
That is the right thing to do.

89
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,571
He is the sworn enemy of Eun-ho's family.

90
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,368
Just like how my father
died a wrongful death,

91
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,703
Eun-ho said his family…

92
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,834
was also victimized
by Grand Proprietor Cheon.

93
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,420
Eun-ho said he must get his revenge.

94
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,218
What about Grand Proprietor Cheon?

95
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,678
That is why he and I…

96
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,311
No, forget it.

97
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,189
It has nothing to do with you.

98
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,745
A military official sent from the palace?

99
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:27,788
Yes.

100
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,332
He may not have been dressed
in formal attire,

101
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,501
but his swordsmanship spoke for itself.

102
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,465
It must have been the Royal Swordsman.

103
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:43,179
The fact that he had the Royal Swordsman
leave the shadows

104
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,514
shows how the king is
backed into a corner.

105
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,142
Of course.

106
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,396
A fight is only entertaining
when one punches back.

107
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,565
And the ledger?

108
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,360
They were already fighting
when we arrived,

109
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,904
so we could not secure it.

110
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,910
Where is Hong Deok-su at the moment?

111
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,460
I heard you are injured.

112
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,338
It is nothing serious.

113
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,554
Hong Deok-su…

114
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:12,142
I mean, Hong Jae-on's late father
was your old friend, right?

115
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,979
He was my one and only friend.

116
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:19,900
How did he pass away?

117
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,738
Why would you be asking that?

118
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,992
You said Hong Jae-on and I
were meant to be.

119
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,495
It is only natural for me
to be curious about her parent.

120
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:44,925
Hong Jae-on's father, Hong Min-sik was…

121
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,471
Was it…

122
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,641
Was it really you?

123
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,271
He died at the hands of Seol Mae-hwa.

124
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,274
What?

125
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,612
Lady Seol Mae-hwa?

126
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,906
Twelve years ago,

127
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,700
after the incident,

128
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,954
many complications followed.

129
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,082
Hong Jae-on is well aware of the details.

130
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:22,463
She witnessed Seol Mae-hwa
stabbing her father.

131
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:27,968
By the time I arrived
at his house to save him,

132
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,930
he was already long gone.

133
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,391
I was too late.

134
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,104
Then why did you keep Seol Mae-hwa
at Yongcheonru

135
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,191
when you knew she was the murderer?

136
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,319
I had no idea until Jae-on told me.

137
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,654
However,

138
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,949
after learning the truth,

139
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,827
I could not let it slide.

140
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,667
That is why…

141
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,296
you got rid of Lady Seol Mae-hwa.

142
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,553
Grant me your support.

143
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:16,892
I will protect Hong Jae-on
from here on out.

144
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,771
Sure.

145
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,649
What do you need?

146
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,613
Your Majesty.

147
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,214
You are late.

148
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,218
And the ledger? Did you find it?

149
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,769
Do tell.

150
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,149
What have you been…

151
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,527
hiding from me?

152
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,363
Why…

153
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,659
is your name in the ledger?

154
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,376
Present the ledger.

155
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,670
There is something I must confirm.

156
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,839
What is there to confirm?

157
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,676
The fact that the former king

158
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,347
did not die of a chronic illness
twelve years ago

159
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,269
but was poisoned to death?

160
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:47,983
In the ledger were the names of
the former king's physician and court lady

161
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,444
and the receipt
for the purchase of poison!

162
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,881
I will explain everything in detail…

163
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,510
so hand me the ledger.

164
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,391
You are well aware

165
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,353
of how cunning Lord Cheon
and the Minister of War can be.

166
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:28,941
Could it be…

167
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,362
that you were involved…

168
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,993
in the death of the former king
along with the Minister of War?

169
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,916
Tell me it is not true.

170
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,545
Father, please.

171
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,097
That is not true.

172
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,058
That was never my intention.

173
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,312
The plan was to persuade my brother

174
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,481
into abdicating the throne.

175
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,193
I had no idea those rats

176
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,237
would poison him.

177
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,321
Back then!

178
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,993
You should have stopped them.

179
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,959
I was going to stop them
from mocking the royal family ever again

180
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:34,464
once my brother
abdicated the throne to me.

181
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,599
So…

182
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,146
you joined forces
with those vile men?

183
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,191
You have no idea how it is to be

184
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,151
a powerless sovereign.

185
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:57,613
There is nothing you can do yourself.

186
00:19:58,822 --> 00:19:59,823
Father.

187
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,492
But that will all change now.

188
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,412
Now that we have the ledger,

189
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,624
we can finally have
the Minister of War removed.

190
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,420
A family was ruined
because of that ledger.

191
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,093
What do you mean?

192
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,931
Do you mean Hong Min-sik's?

193
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:27,392
Do you know what kind of life
his daughter has had to live?

194
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:33,941
To avenge the unfair death of her father,
she spent her whole life in agony!

195
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,541
All you see

196
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,795
is her agony

197
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,547
and not mine?

198
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,759
Father.

199
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,511
Give me the ledger now.

200
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,515
I will take care of the rest.

201
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,184
The ledger…

202
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,854
I do not have it.

203
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,234
What?

204
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,194
Many innocent lives were lost

205
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,364
because of that ledger.

206
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,367
How could I bring it to you knowing that?

207
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,286
- Prince Muyeong!
- Father!

208
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,666
Father.

209
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,422
You cannot cover up your mistake
with another wrongdoing.

210
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,931
I have been receiving reports
of your indiscretions…

211
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,685
but never did I think

212
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,272
you would ruin our grand plan
for a mere girl.

213
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,190
How…

214
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,819
How could you not bring the ledger?

215
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,655
Our grand plan, you say?

216
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,201
Maybe you have been fooling yourself
with such pretext.

217
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,619
As if you know anything!

218
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:18,211
Do you think this was to only save myself?

219
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,297
You ungrateful thing.

220
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,928
You, Prince Eunseong,
and the entire royal family!

221
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,141
I will restore all of us
to our rightful places.

222
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,480
By choosing a path
that is different from yours,

223
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,983
I will prove myself.

224
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,120
Royal Swordsman!

225
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,253
Lock him up in his chamber.

226
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,590
Do not let him set a foot
outside his chamber!

227
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:05,801
Father.

228
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,344
Lock him up

229
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,596
and head to Yongcheonru.

230
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,681
Bring me the ledger.

231
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:18,396
Whoever holds it,
whoever stands in your way!

232
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,523
Kill them.

233
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,442
Your word is my command.

234
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,652
No, Father.

235
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,571
- Your Highness.
- You cannot.

236
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,241
- Father.
- Heed me!

237
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,701
You must stop this, Father.

238
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,370
Father!

239
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:36,081
You must stop this, Father!

240
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,125
Father!

241
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,352
<i>I promise you.</i>

242
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,441
<i>I will protect you</i>

243
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:49,154
<i>no matter what.</i>

244
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,620
<i>Whether you are Hong Deok-su</i>
<i>or Hong Jae-on…</i>

245
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,539
Whoever you are,

246
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,584
you are…

247
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,631
the only one I will hold in my heart.

248
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,717
<i>You were right.</i>

249
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,846
It feels much better
to lean on each other.

250
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,606
<i>I have never lived as a woman before,</i>

251
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:29,277
<i>so it will be hard</i>
<i>and I will fall short sometimes,</i>

252
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,073
<i>but I will still try my best, Eun-ho.</i>

253
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:27,460
UIJU GUILD

254
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,804
Open the gate!

255
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,270
Relay word that Seol Mae-hwa,

256
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:48,023
the innkeeper of Yongcheonru, is here.

257
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,024
I am…

258
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,987
Seol Mae-hwa
from Yongcheonru in Hanyang.

259
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,085
I know.

260
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,215
And this is…

261
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,468
where you will die.

262
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,307
Grant me an audience
with your guildmaster.

263
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,280
What is this? Are you hurt?

264
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,615
I am all right.

265
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,994
What happened?

266
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,955
You went to get Deok-su. Why are you hurt?

267
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:27,872
Su-ra.

268
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,627
I must know what Deok-su does,
whom she meets,

269
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,547
and what is going through her head.

270
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,967
That seems to be

271
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,594
the only way to protect Deok-su.

272
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,347
- What?
- You.

273
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,225
You said you would assist me.

274
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,813
Report to me daily
regarding Deok-su's activities.

275
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,028
Jun-hwa.

276
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,865
You are just like your father.

277
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,160
What?

278
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,745
What on earth happened today?

279
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,371
Also, where is Eun-ho?

280
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,834
That man returned to his rightful place.
That is all.

281
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,043
That man?

282
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,131
- Are you abandoning your friendship?
- Lee Eun-ho is…

283
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,134
Prince Muyeong.

284
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,637
He was never our friend to begin with.

285
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,015
He is a royal.

286
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,562
Now that he has returned to his place,

287
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,689
all will be sorted.

288
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,026
- But Jun-hwa--
- Please do as I ask.

289
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:40,862
Please.

290
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,807
To the northern back gate,
Your Highness.

291
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,087
Brother.

292
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,588
Leave this way.

293
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,215
How--

294
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:44,300
I removed the guards but only briefly.

295
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,011
Follow the path you have decided to take.

296
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,097
Brother…

297
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,682
There is not much time.

298
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,393
We will talk later. Go now.

299
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,903
<i>Bring me the ledger.</i>

300
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,949
Whoever holds it,
whoever stands in your way!

301
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,367
Kill them.

302
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,169
That was it?

303
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,057
This was all…

304
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:58,935
for that ledger?

305
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,440
No.

306
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:05,984
This--

307
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,403
You should have
just asked me to hand it over.

308
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,613
How…

309
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,453
My father has deployed an assassin.

310
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,330
Having this ledger will endanger you.

311
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,251
Do not be concerned,

312
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,087
for this is my business.

313
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,846
I do not ever want to see you again,

314
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,557
Your Highness Prince Muyeong.

315
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,354
You should leave.

316
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,611
Then, let me join you.

317
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,321
It is too dangerous for you alone.

318
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,784
Whatever you intend to do,
let me assist you.

319
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,578
- Lee Eun-ho--
- Never…

320
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,292
Never will I leave you behind again.

321
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,221
I will not give up

322
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,058
nor stop.

323
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,395
Do you know what I am implying?

324
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,316
My sword might aim at your father.

325
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,235
But you will still aid me?

326
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,408
Only then will I be able to stop him.

327
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,788
Assisting you

328
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:48,002
is the only way to stop my father

329
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,421
from committing more sins.

330
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,015
Is that so?

331
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,269
Are you willing to be the bait

332
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,939
for the trap I set?

333
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,460
A newly appointed innkeeper, my gosh.

334
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,256
What are you so happy about?

335
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,842
The innkeeper position is vacant,

336
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,635
and it is finally time.

337
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,221
Lord Yu, could you be…

338
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,933
Would I not be appointed
given the talent I possess?

339
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,813
What should my first order of business be?

340
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:51,065
Maybe I should gather my people from Uiju.

341
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,276
Lord Cho, what say you?

342
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,320
- Lord Cho.
- What?

343
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,866
What are you thinking about
that you are in such a daze?

344
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,828
You have been busy lately,
going out at night.

345
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,790
What are you talking about? Goodness.

346
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,212
Well, duty calls.

347
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,380
Excuse me.

348
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,092
Goodness me.

349
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,928
He has been suspicious lately.

350
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:25,766
Could he also be seeking
the innkeeper position?

351
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,976
Goodness.

352
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:33,024
There has been no word from Seol Mae-hwa.

353
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:35,735
Could something have happened to her?

354
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:38,404
My goodness.

355
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:50,708
So, how was your visit
to your father's old house?

356
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,670
Did you find the safe?

357
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,798
What…

358
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,344
Why are you so surprised?

359
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,475
Forgive me.

360
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:12,230
Last night, I found the ledger
and was going to bring it to you,

361
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,941
but I had to leave it behind.

362
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,744
Lead the way.

363
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,539
We should go and get it now.

364
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:17,962
This is where it was.

365
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:22,508
I cannot believe I missed this spot. Move.

366
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,380
What…

367
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,718
It was definitely here.

368
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:12,141
Did you open this
with Prince Muyeong last night?

369
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,520
Yes.

370
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,982
Cho Seung-ryang, locate Prince Muyeong.

371
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:23,486
He took the ledger.

372
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:24,695
Yes, my lord.

373
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,114
Go.

374
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,020
The three men who were responsible

375
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,814
for my father's death 12 years ago

376
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,565
are all after this ledger.

377
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,236
I will make them destroy themselves
while fighting one another.

378
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:10,157
Eun-ho, you will serve as bait
and spread word

379
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,368
that this is in the minister's hands.

380
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:16,080
I will make either His Majesty's assassin
or Grand Proprietor Cheon

381
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,166
suspect the Minister of War.

382
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:54,243
Our relationship is not amicable enough
for us to sit here together face-to-face.

383
00:40:56,454 --> 00:41:00,374
It will be different today
as I have brought you a gift.

384
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,460
A gift?

385
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,004
For me?

386
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,857
What could this be?

387
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,676
BRIBE PAID TO OH YEONG-RAK,
LEE HYEON-WI

388
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,179
Wait. This ledger…

389
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:59,558
SLUSH FUND TO COURT LADY JEONG,
ROYAL PHYSICIAN LEE

390
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,771
Where did you get this?

391
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,359
Why…

392
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,110
Why did you

393
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,947
bring this to me?

394
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,950
I need to get rid of…

395
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:19,870
the Grand Proprietor.

396
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,205
Pardon?

397
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:24,500
I must protect my father
and the royal family.

398
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,919
Your grandson,

399
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:29,463
Prince Seonyang, is also a royal.

400
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,720
So…

401
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:43,561
you want to wield me as the sword
to kill Grand Proprietor Cheon?

402
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,940
At a time like this,
noble relatives must join forces.

403
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:50,276
You should never have
pursued any scheme

404
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,403
with someone of lowly blood such as him.

405
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,239
He repaid you by keeping such a ledger.

406
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:01,870
You have a point.

407
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,501
If you promise
to get rid of Grand Proprietor Cheon…

408
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,839
I will hand this ledger over to you.

409
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,398
You have a deal.

410
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,069
Now that we have hard evidence,

411
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:36,655
it is only right

412
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,908
to arrest the traitor
and restore the nation's order.

413
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,593
Since many are after the ledger,

414
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,512
you must keep it safe.

415
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,482
Your father and I

416
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:57,403
were friends
from even before you were born.

417
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,572
At one point,

418
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:06,245
we believed we could
have the whole world in our hands.

419
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,793
Jae-on.

420
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,630
Hong Jae-on.

421
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:26,181
You had better not think
about doing anything stupid with it.

422
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:30,144
After all, you are the only family

423
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,979
my friend Min-sik left behind.

424
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:39,653
The ledger is dangerous.

425
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,865
Wanting it for yourself

426
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,533
will result in death.

427
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:49,538
That is why I sent Jun-hwa
to you last night.

428
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:52,124
To protect you, Jae-on.

429
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:54,793
Cheon Jun-hwa?

430
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,173
Yes.

431
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,176
Cheon Jun-hwa…

432
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,095
is my son.

433
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,148
Jun-hwa is…

434
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,403
Jun-hwa is…

435
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,864
your son?

436
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:33,207
Your father shared one of the letters
meant for your name with him.

437
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,959
Jun-hwa and Jae-on.

438
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:41,048
I believe you two are meant to be one.

439
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:46,011
Your father and I failed
to live out our dream together,

440
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,223
but I believe it will be different
for you two.

441
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:53,519
Jae-on.

442
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:59,441
Will you make that dream come true?

443
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,163
Deok-su.

444
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:19,586
We are to gather at Chinyeongrae.
Let us go.

445
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:21,838
Sure.

446
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,383
Where did you go this time?

447
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:31,181
From here on out,
do not roam around recklessly.

448
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,933
You will have a lot to do from now on.

449
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:38,855
Is that an order?

450
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,234
Can you not see I am looking out for you?

451
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,903
Do as I say.

452
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,697
That is best for your sake.

453
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,912
It is too early in the morning for this.

454
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:56,540
Come on. Hurry along.

455
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,256
Hey! The notice is here!

456
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:07,342
Innkeeper Yu,
it will finally be announced!

457
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,387
Welcome.

458
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,014
Congratulations.

459
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,350
Why are you all here?

460
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,060
Seong-jin.

461
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:21,315
The Uiju people
should organize a gathering

462
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:24,359
to celebrate Lord Yu's appointment
as the new innkeeper!

463
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:27,779
It will be the feast of the century.

464
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,239
Oh, please.

465
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:31,033
- Shall we?
- Yes!

466
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,206
I cannot watch this.

467
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:41,293
Lord Yu, let me be excused.

468
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:42,919
Enjoy yourself.

469
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,005
Where are you going?

470
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,008
Once Lord Yu is appointed as innkeeper,

471
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:51,595
I will first have those Elementary jerks
all thrown out.

472
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:55,223
They should all be thrown out
of here, Myeong-ho!

473
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:57,934
Says who?

474
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:04,983
Darn.

475
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:08,278
You will be kicked out first
if you babble on like that, Kim Myeong-ho.

476
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:11,531
Goodness, you Elementary fools.

477
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:16,078
You are still yapping on
like a bunch of clueless monkeys.

478
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,288
Just wait and see, you morons.

479
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:27,631
Finally! The newly appointed innkeeper

480
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:30,759
is Lord Yu… Wait.

481
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:32,177
ANNOUNCEMENT
INNKEEPER CHEON JUN-HWA

482
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,261
Cheon Jun-hwa?

483
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,684
INNKEEPER CHEON JUN-HWA

484
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,561
Innkeeper's assistants

485
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,398
Hong Deok-su and Ko Su-ra?

486
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:48,735
What?

487
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,258
Everyone, show respect to him.

488
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:15,053
He is the only son of the grand proprietor
and our new innkeeper.

489
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,098
After studying in Qing,

490
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:22,060
he took the clerks' exam
to learn the ropes at Yongcheonru.

491
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:25,772
But as of this moment, you will serve
and respect him as the innkeeper.

492
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:37,909
My word. Unbelievable!

493
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,495
Darn it.

494
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,945
I was hoping to tell you in advance.

495
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,071
Are you shocked?

496
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,828
As the newly appointed innkeeper,

497
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,914
I will make choices that are best for you.

498
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,338
You, Cheon Jun-hwa?

499
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,929
Cheon Jun-hwa, the Grand Proprietor's son?

500
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:44,309
You…

501
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,646
You are mistaken about my father, Deok-su.

502
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:04,704
Ko Su-ra.

503
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:08,708
You knew all along, didn't you?

504
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:12,796
You fawned over him
knowing who he was all along.

505
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:14,381
You cunning bastard.

506
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:16,758
Get out of my way.

507
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:17,843
What?

508
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:22,055
Was it easier to crawl
between his legs than mine?

509
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:23,598
Kim Myeong-ho!

510
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,600
- Myeong-ho!
- Are you all right?

511
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:27,811
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

512
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,398
Ko Su-ra, how dare you!

513
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,774
- Myeong-ho…
- Move!

514
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:45,120
A clerk dared to punch the innkeeper?

515
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,039
Have you lost your mind?

516
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,960
Well, it was Ko Su-ra
who threw the first punch.

517
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,378
Exactly!

518
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:02,888
I mean, that is what happened, Lord Cheon.

519
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:07,976
Crawl.

520
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,941
Crawl between Ko Su-ra's legs,

521
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:19,654
and I will let you three keep your jobs.

522
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,950
What… What did you say?

523
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,368
Goodness, Lord Cheon.

524
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,620
Lord Cheon.

525
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:27,871
Do you not want to?

526
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,796
Du-sik, do it on my behalf.

527
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,714
Pardon?

528
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:41,259
Should I crawl, then?

529
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:48,516
That is enough, Jun-hwa.

530
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,145
You imbecile!

531
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:55,273
How dare you call the innkeeper
by his name!

532
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:56,858
Exactly.

533
00:53:56,942 --> 00:54:00,695
How dare you call our new innkeeper
by his first name?

534
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:04,199
Just go, will you?

535
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:13,625
I will not be lenient to those
who mistreat my assistants.

536
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,631
Dismiss yourselves.

537
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,263
- Myeong-ho, let us go.
- Come on.

538
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:28,807
Let go of me.

539
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:43,405
We should have seen them
crawl between your legs.

540
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,365
I will have them pay

541
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,910
for what they did to us
in the exact same way.

542
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:50,829
In the same way?

543
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,749
You think what you did was fair?

544
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:59,129
Why are you getting worked up?
I was looking out for you--

545
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:00,505
That was for me, you say?

546
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,551
How are you any different from Myeong-ho?

547
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,429
You two are the same.

548
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:12,851
You think I am like Kim Myeong-ho?

549
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:15,687
Is bringing the powerless to their knees
your idea of justice?

550
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,153
You asked for daily reports on Deok-su.

551
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,240
Sure. I will do that.

552
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:29,951
Just know that it will cost you.

553
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,703
I need money, you see.

554
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:36,708
Justifications and agonizing
over friendship and love.

555
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:41,129
That is only reserved
for the privileged.

556
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,216
I do not have that luxury.

557
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,053
That is your position as an innkeeper,

558
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,847
while this is mine as your assistant.

559
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:56,311
Su-ra!

560
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:10,241
Those filthy rats.

561
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,912
I would not be Kim Myeong-ho of Uiju
if I let them get away with this.

562
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,795
I will kill them all.

563
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:25,423
Myeong-ho!

564
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:33,264
Prince Muyeong gave the ledger
to the Minister of War?

565
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:36,017
We had the three swordsmen
from his residence followed,

566
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,894
but their ledgers were blank.

567
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:38,937
Forgive me.

568
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,731
What exactly are they up to?

569
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,651
Your Majesty, it is the Minister of War.

570
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,910
I did not allow you to enter.

571
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,496
How dare you barge in here?

572
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:02,043
It is an urgent matter,

573
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:04,879
so I could not wait, Your Majesty.

574
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:09,050
Minister…

575
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:13,555
You have such a loyal son, Your Majesty.

576
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:20,270
Prince Muyeong came to me in person

577
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:24,274
to drop off
Grand Proprietor Cheon's ledger.

578
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,195
The ledger that proves

579
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,239
how the former king was poisoned.

580
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:37,328
Grand Proprietor Cheon kept
a detailed record of all transactions.

581
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:40,331
And?

582
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,668
What exactly are you getting at?

583
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:48,506
Now that we can prove
Grand Proprietor Cheon's act of treason,

584
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:51,801
I will have him beheaded.

585
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:53,595
But first…

586
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:59,809
you must announce
that you are abdicating the throne

587
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,853
to Prince Seonyang.

588
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:03,104
Such insolence!

589
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,523
Announce my abdication?

590
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:08,276
Royal Swordsman!

591
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:16,367
Your Majesty.

592
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,373
If you kill me now…

593
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:27,712
the ledger I have safely tucked away

594
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:31,424
will be distributed
on the streets of Hanyang.

595
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:46,606
If you do not announce
your abdication tomorrow,

596
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,234
you, not Grand Proprietor Cheon,

597
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,780
will be forced out of your position

598
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,533
for poisoning the former king.

599
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:52,755
Minister, what brought you
to His Majesty's chamber at this hour?

600
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:59,596
It must have been because I had
a pressing matter to discuss with him.

601
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:04,851
Oh, right.

602
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:10,481
Tomorrow, a shocking revelation
will come to light.

603
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:12,400
Do not be too shocked by it.

604
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:14,569
I am telling you in advance

605
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:19,324
since it could burden your mind and body

606
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:22,368
which are already feeble.

607
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:29,167
You must stay healthy.

608
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,504
If you live long enough,

609
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:37,925
you might be granted
some good days yourself.

610
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:23,304
MEET ME IMMEDIATELY
IN THE VIP ROOM

611
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:25,014
TO DISCUSS OUR NEXT MOVE,
LEE EUN-HO

612
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:47,954
Eun-ho.

613
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,998
You actually came.

614
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:54,836
Oh, dear.

615
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:58,589
What is this?

616
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:00,758
Where is Eun-ho?

617
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:04,804
Look at you running over here
at the mention of his name.

618
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:08,933
Who are you to each other?

619
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:15,857
You have been joined at the hip
like lovers.

620
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,235
You both…

621
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:23,573
- must be into men.
- Damn it. Kim Myeong-ho.

622
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:27,368
Do not do anything you will regret.

623
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,495
Or maybe, Hong Deok-su, you…

624
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,297
Maybe you are a girl.

625
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:41,507
Stop it.

626
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:43,968
Tell me, then.

627
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:48,556
Hold on.

628
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:51,517
I can actually see for myself.

629
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:54,896
Why bother waiting for an answer?

630
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:02,111
How did you fool me back then
at Jakyakjae?

631
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:05,281
I will reveal who you really are,
Hong Deok-su!

632
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:06,491
Get off me!

633
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:12,413
You have been chummy with Lee Eun-ho,

634
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:15,416
but you jumped ship
now that Cheon Jun-hwa is the innkeeper!

635
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,542
Kim Myeong-ho!

636
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:23,591
Cheon Jun-hwa…

637
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:24,509
Let go.

638
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:28,179
I will kill you.

639
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:36,270
Cheon Jun-hwa, enough.

640
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:39,273
How dare you!

641
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:42,026
Hong Deok-su has been fooling you!

642
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:52,578
Cheon Jun-hwa, you are being fooled.

643
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,248
Do you know who he has been with?

644
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:56,582
Shut it, Kim Myeong-ho!

645
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:57,875
Lee Eun-ho!

646
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:01,879
That broad has already
given herself to Lee Eun-ho.

647
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,339
I saw it!

648
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,675
Shut it!

649
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:11,806
Die!

650
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:31,928
Unbelievable.

651
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:38,809
So much for not associating
with lowly blood.

652
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:43,272
I guess the invite from Yongcheonru
was too sweet to decline.

653
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:45,191
Speak for yourself.

654
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,861
You said we should discard Cheon Mak-dong.

655
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:50,988
Did you change your mind overnight?

656
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:56,243
By the way,
is the Minister of War not here?

657
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,620
I am not sure.

658
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,514
And who might you be?

659
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:37,118
I am the new innkeeper,
Cheon Jun-hwa.

660
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,247
Cheon Jun-hwa?

661
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:44,458
My lord. If he is of the Cheon family…

662
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:51,549
We have secured meat of fine quality,

663
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:53,676
so I invited you here
to officially greet you.

664
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:59,598
Have your fill
and take home the gifts I have prepared.

665
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:29,211
What on earth is this?

666
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:32,339
What is the matter?

667
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:35,134
Do you not enjoy cow tongue?

668
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:36,510
Cow tongue?

669
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:41,307
Do you expect us to eat cow tongue?

670
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:42,516
Why not?

671
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:46,812
Procuring these was not an easy feat.

672
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:47,897
How dare you?

673
01:07:48,522 --> 01:07:51,650
You must be too young
to understand how rude this is.

674
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,075
Cheon…

675
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:01,327
Mak…

676
01:08:03,704 --> 01:08:04,538
dong.

677
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:10,044
The sly tongues from your mouths
that speak out of order.

678
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,172
Maybe they

679
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:16,884
should be served on plates instead.

680
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:21,514
This is such an expensive delicacy.
Will you still not have it?

681
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:23,099
Oh, right.

682
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:26,602
I have yet to reveal your gifts.

683
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:30,606
Take a look.

684
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:59,426
It is divine.

685
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,184
How could it not be?

686
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:08,477
What a delight.

687
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:15,609
I advise you
to watch your tongues, my lords.

688
01:09:17,611 --> 01:09:18,821
I sincerely

689
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:23,742
ask that of you.

690
01:09:56,066 --> 01:09:58,068
JULY 17TH - PAID TO OH YEONG-RAK
LEE HYEON-WI

691
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:13,125
I am almost there.

692
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:16,045
Finally, tomorrow,

693
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:19,173
my flesh and blood

694
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:22,218
will ascend the throne!

695
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:10,117
Where is the ledger?

696
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:13,287
Oh Yeong-rak!

697
01:13:18,685 --> 01:13:21,105
I welcome you to Yongcheonru,

698
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:23,232
Guildmaster of Uiju Guild.

699
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:35,702
Is this the famous Yongcheonru?

700
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:40,374
It is shiny
but with nothing else to show for it.

701
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:45,963
Where is my boy Myeong-ho?

702
01:13:47,297 --> 01:13:51,051
It has been a while,
and I would love to see his handsome face.

703
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:53,429
Let us go in.

704
01:14:42,227 --> 01:14:46,398
<i>Ultimately, everything ended up</i>
<i>in Grand Proprietor Cheon's hands.</i>

705
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,442
<i>First, the minister.</i>
<i>Next, Grand Proprietor Cheon.</i>

706
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:51,737
Deok-su, do not dirty your hands
with any more blood.

707
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:52,821
<i>I already made up my mind.</i>

708
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:54,740
Marry my son.

709
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:58,827
Use me, Deok-su. Marry me.

710
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:02,372
Stop playing with her heart.

711
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:06,877
<i>I am prepared to give up</i>
<i>everything I have.</i>

712
01:15:08,378 --> 01:15:10,130
Do you love Jae-on?

713
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:12,299
Yes. I love Hong Deok-su.

714
01:15:12,966 --> 01:15:14,968
<i>The unimaginable will soon take place.</i>

715
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:16,887
<i>"The unimaginable"?</i>

716
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:21,016
<i>The king will be replaced.</i>

717
01:15:21,975 --> 01:15:23,560
<i>Let us wipe this slate clean</i>

718
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:25,687
and create a new world.

719
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:27,606
<i>War must be prevented.</i>

720
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:29,107
Bring me the girl.

721
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:30,817
<i>All preparations have been made.</i>

722
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:32,444
<i>Now,</i>

723
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:35,322
<i>all I need to do…</i>

724
01:15:37,407 --> 01:15:38,575
<i>is witness his demise.</i>
