1
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,710
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,128
FILMING FOR CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:56,097
Here. If you roll a matching pair,
that will lead us to victory!

4
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,601
There is no way he would
also roll a matching pair.

5
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:00,977
No way.

6
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:06,608
Hold it!

7
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,488
What is it?
Are you now lacking the confidence?

8
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,324
There are no backsies at a gambling table.

9
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,493
Take off that shirt of yours.

10
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,746
Something is not right.

11
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,749
Maybe you have something hidden
under there.

12
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,178
What the…

13
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,348
Lee Eun-ho, is this absolutely necessary?

14
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,474
Look at that.

15
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,811
I admit that is a sight.

16
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,105
Take off your shirt and roll the dice.

17
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,983
Why should they strip?

18
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,153
Do not mind him, and keep it on.

19
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,951
You are grasping at straws
now that you are cornered.

20
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,663
Fine. I will strip.

21
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,083
Let us all strip.

22
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,294
It will not be pure dice-rolling
if I keep my clothes on.

23
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,588
- Let us strip!
- No, it is fine.

24
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,881
- Yes, let us strip.
- No.

25
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,925
- Hold on.
- Strip!

26
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,218
- Strip!
- No, stop that.

27
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,137
No, stop that.

28
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,847
- Stop it.
- Strip, boys!

29
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,350
Let us bare it all.

30
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,936
- That is not necessary.
- Strip.

31
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:37,448
All right. Here I go.

32
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:41,119
- Go, Myeong-ho!
- Go, Myeong-ho!

33
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,204
- Myeong-ho!
- Myeong-ho!

34
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,210
He rolled two threes!

35
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:52,797
Yes!

36
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,845
All right. It is your turn.

37
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,599
Why are you not stripping?

38
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,772
Remove your shirt already.

39
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,861
You need to roll the dice.

40
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,738
Why, you…

41
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,407
<i>I found the culprit!</i>

42
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,409
THIRTY

43
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,581
I have never seen
such immaculate craftsmanship in my life.

44
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,334
I would love to snatch this boy up

45
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,252
and lock him up in my workshop

46
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,339
so that we may work together!

47
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,222
Number 30?

48
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,433
THIRTY

49
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,020
Grab him!

50
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,232
- What the… How dare you?
- Grab him!

51
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,360
Grab him.

52
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,325
Get back here.

53
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,869
What is the meaning of this?

54
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,303
THIRTY

55
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,287
This is all due to my negligence.

56
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,621
You scoundrels.

57
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,249
If you wanted to play a game,
you should have kept it quiet.

58
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,167
You were just beyond rowdy.

59
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,878
I am sure it echoed through
every hall of Yongcheonru.

60
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,715
Who was it? Which scoundrel started it?

61
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,050
It was certainly not us.

62
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,803
That is right.
Those Elementary rascals started it.

63
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,013
I am responsible.

64
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,187
He foolishly claimed
our numbers represented our ranking

65
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:18,026
and that members of the Uiju Guild were
the only ones privy to the Expert ranking.

66
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,695
I suggested we see if they were
worthy of such a ranking.

67
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:22,530
That is correct.

68
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,615
Number 28 provoked us first.

69
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:30,204
So, are you saying you were
solely responsible for this whole mess?

70
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,292
Goodness me.

71
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:38,212
I agreed to participate,
so I share some blame as well.

72
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,965
I also rolled the dice with my hand.

73
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,800
I shall also bear some responsibility.

74
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,556
Did you Elementary rascals think
we would commend and praise you

75
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,684
for your loyalty in banding together
to commit mischief?

76
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,227
Demerit points for you all.

77
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,437
But…

78
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,650
But it was an honorable match.

79
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,571
"An honorable match"? Honorable?

80
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,239
Yes.

81
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,162
We may have played dice,
but it was not gambling--

82
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,955
A match between Elementary and Expert.

83
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,624
It was an honorable deal.

84
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,877
Yes.

85
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,506
Both parties consented to the match.

86
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,885
You better stop talking, you scoundrels.

87
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,846
My deepest apologies for all this ruckus.

88
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,225
Expert claims they were wrongfully misled,

89
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,603
yet Elementary argues
that it was an honorable deal…

90
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,316
Apprentice Number 30.

91
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,443
Yes?

92
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,487
I am Number 30, Hong Deok-su.

93
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,826
You claim it was not mere gambling
but an honorable deal.

94
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,496
- Yes.
- On what grounds do you claim so?

95
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,380
First…

96
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,135
there was no coercion.

97
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:08,803
Second,

98
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:13,266
both parties agreed to the terms.

99
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,853
Third, it was
a reasonable exchange of services.

100
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,983
Lady Seol, is this also not
how you do business?

101
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,075
Hong Deok-su, how dare you talk back!

102
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,036
You mere apprentices gambled
in your quarters, and you dare to argue

103
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,371
your behavior was just?

104
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,750
Have you all lost your minds?
Do you all have death wishes?

105
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:41,502
How crass.

106
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,174
Lady Seol, you should just expel them all.

107
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:50,094
It would be a bit of a waste
to just toss them out now.

108
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,306
Perhaps, you could just let it slide
this one time.

109
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,517
No, we have heard enough.
They must be expelled.

110
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,394
- Come on now…
- Wait, Lady Seol.

111
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,856
We cannot be expelled.

112
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,441
We are from the Uiju Guild.

113
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,693
And does the Expert Room belong to them?

114
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,780
For generations,

115
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,533
it was occupied by us Uiju Guild members…

116
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,703
And it is Yongcheonru
that gave you that privilege.

117
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,001
Number 30.

118
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,505
Did you have anything else to add?

119
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,106
We are all here…

120
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,820
to learn as apprentices of Gyohwa Hall.

121
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,614
I beseech you…

122
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,576
to reconsider our expulsion.

123
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,010
Lady Seol.

124
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,347
We implore you to be magnanimous.

125
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,609
Fine.

126
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:34,282
I shall overlook tonight as it seems
everyone learned a valuable lesson.

127
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,118
Keep in mind what you have learned today

128
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,370
as you become proper Yongcheonru clerks.

129
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,729
Lady Seol.

130
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,566
Can I ask why you did not apprehend
the Red Certificate forger immediately?

131
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,820
Just be patient. I have a plan in mind.

132
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,741
It has been so long

133
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:19,243
since I have encountered
a boy with such potential.

134
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,914
Kids nowadays are too clever and shrew
for their own good.

135
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,544
Mere apprentices are left
to freely and shamelessly talk back.

136
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,088
Bang Sa-seon's incompetence
knows no bounds.

137
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,632
Come on now. Take it easy.

138
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:37,136
Number 30, Hong Deok-su…

139
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,223
ELEMENTARY

140
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,103
Deok-su, if you had gone through
with that last round,

141
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,688
we definitely would have won.

142
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,232
Such a wasted opportunity…

143
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,818
Indeed.

144
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,321
What a terrible waste.

145
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:57,823
Waste, my foot.

146
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,244
We were all just
on the verge of expulsion.

147
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,417
Deok-su, cheer up.

148
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,294
We survived. That is what matters.

149
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,255
Thanks.

150
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:15,966
Deok-su, I know

151
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,220
you did not play that game
to win that room.

152
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:25,226
And Eun-ho, thank you
for going out of your way

153
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,853
to antagonize them
after they looked down on my family.

154
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,399
That was not my only reason for doing so.

155
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:36,904
What about me?

156
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,282
You also offered to share the blame.

157
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:45,496
When the opportunity arises, I, too,
will lend my support and stand by you all.

158
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,003
Gosh, Su-ra, after refusing
to get in the same boat as us,

159
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,673
this is how you profess
your love for us? This guy--

160
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,632
Jeez.

161
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,801
I am simply offering

162
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,929
to pay back a debt as a proper merchant.

163
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,222
Ko Su-ra!

164
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,682
Let go of me.

165
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:05,808
Be careful.

166
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,894
We are officially
in the same Elementary boat together.

167
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:13,315
- The same… We are in the same boat now.
- You better keep your distance.

168
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,733
I told you to stop.

169
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,915
What do you have up your sleeve?

170
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,129
Su-ra might have fallen for it,
but not me.

171
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,884
You provoked them on purpose
into that wager, did you not?

172
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,218
Such insolence.

173
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,345
Do you imply I had a hidden motive?

174
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,806
Am I wrong? To take off my…

175
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,270
Perhaps,

176
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,189
you are the one hiding something…

177
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,235
What do I have to hide?
I am not hiding anything.

178
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:03,365
Hey. You are being
more suspicious if you ask me.

179
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,366
What do you mean?

180
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,577
The way you speak. "Insolence"?

181
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,538
Everything is insolent in your eyes.

182
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,916
Do you think you are
a royal prince or something?

183
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,927
Should we not go and memorize
the Yongcheonru Clerkship Chronicles…

184
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:26,972
Shall we go do that?

185
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,373
I found the Red Certificate forger.

186
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,376
Number 30. A young man named Hong Deok-su.

187
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,629
Is that so?

188
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,925
He also shares a room
with Young Master Jun-hwa.

189
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,845
Hong Deok-su…

190
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,308
Prince Muyeong is in that room
as well, is he not?

191
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,477
Shall I have him arrested?

192
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,231
Just let him be.

193
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,694
The ripped certificate

194
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,280
was not the only thing
found at the murder scene.

195
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:28,325
I have received intel that a sword
with a dragon engraving was also present.

196
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,371
A sword with a dragon engraving…

197
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,207
One belonging to the royal family?

198
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,211
Should the Minister of War
get his hands on the sword,

199
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,172
there is no telling what he will do.

200
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:52,474
Where did you say
this sword was discovered again?

201
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,686
On the body of the gambler
who had his Red Certificate stolen.

202
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,105
Are you saying…

203
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,903
that man was murdered
for the Red Certificate?

204
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,404
Yes, my lord.

205
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,499
I brought it here because you commanded
to be informed of all developments.

206
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,713
Yongcheonru…

207
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,028
ROYAL PALACE

208
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:12,012
Prince Seonyang's tenth birthday
is fast approaching.

209
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,558
Even if we start now,
we will have barely enough time to prepare

210
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,394
for his Crown Prince appointment.

211
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:25,734
Her Majesty is greatly concerned about it.

212
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:46,255
Your Majesty, we cannot continue to leave
the seat of the Crown Prince empty.

213
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,842
Prince Muyeong is in Onyang to recuperate,

214
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,511
and you suggest I appoint a Crown Prince?

215
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:59,268
Prince Muyeong can not even be considered
because he was not birthed by the Queen?

216
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,771
The nation finds itself beset
by famine and plague.

217
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,023
More so than ever,

218
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:10,529
now is the time you must fortify
the pillars of state and royal authority.

219
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,825
At this juncture, I implore you
for a royal command.

220
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:24,835
I am still not sure if I should divulge
this matter to you, Your Majesty.

221
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,129
And what matter might that be?

222
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,808
Well… There was a heinous murder

223
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,311
in Seochon, not too long ago.

224
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,439
This has yet to be confirmed,

225
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,941
but it seems a royal artifact

226
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,944
has been found at the murder scene.

227
00:17:56,033 --> 00:18:00,245
On the day of the crime,
Prince Muyeong was in Onyang,

228
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,331
so he can not be implicated in any way.

229
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:12,216
It seems someone looking
to slander the royal throne

230
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,967
was behind such a scheme.

231
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,470
I will be sure to carry out
a thorough investigation

232
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,264
to ensure it does not become
your burden, Your Majesty.

233
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,261
It is barely morning
and vermin have entered the palace

234
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,680
not through a rat hole in the back,
but the front gates.

235
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,849
The nation is showing signs of ruin.

236
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,976
How dare you show your face here

237
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,520
ostentatiously in a palanquin?

238
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,814
My apologies, my lord.

239
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,943
Please forgive me, my lord,
for my legs are weak

240
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,904
and I find it challenging
to stay on my feet.

241
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,074
His Majesty is too distressed
to see you today. Turn back.

242
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,326
No, that is not it.

243
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,829
I am here on other business today.

244
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,038
Other business?

245
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,550
What business could you have
with Prince Eunseong?

246
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,429
I heard that he had been suffering
from a terrible cold recently,

247
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,515
so I am here
with a few sachets of medicinal herbs.

248
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,394
If you have good herbs, you should be
serving them to Prince Seonyang.

249
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,981
You are only in this predicament

250
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,610
because you lost the ledger 12 years ago.

251
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,867
Do you plan on tiptoeing
around Prince Eunseong forever?

252
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,162
Step down already.

253
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,332
How dare you sit when I stand.

254
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,626
Did His Majesty say

255
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:14,171
he will appoint Prince Seonyang
as the Crown Prince on his birthday?

256
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,217
Please let me know
if there are any goods you desire.

257
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,718
I will acquire them for you.

258
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:20,802
It is beyond two-faced.

259
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,181
You grease so many palms.

260
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:28,060
I suggest you soon declare
the master you serve.

261
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:31,396
My lord, you and I are
the ones responsible

262
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,315
for His Majesty's ascension.

263
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,319
We should continue that tradition
with the next ascension.

264
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,947
You are right about that.

265
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,658
It seems all that gold you have acquired

266
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,409
allows you to think clearly.

267
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,330
You better be on foot next time.

268
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,667
Yes, my lord. I certainly shall.

269
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,461
Let us go.

270
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,945
Gyohwa Hall has always evaluated

271
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:23,031
the apprentices based
on their individual points up until now.

272
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,868
However, Lady Seol has come up
with an innovative new method.

273
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,078
Lady Seol did?

274
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,955
As ordered by Lady Seol,

275
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:33,417
you will be evaluated in groups
which consist of your roommates.

276
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,837
All the demerit points
you have accumulated up until now--

277
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,754
Will they be removed?

278
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,799
Wrong. They shall all be combined.

279
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,851
Starting now, your roommates

280
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:54,354
shall share the merit
and demerit points you receive.

281
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,773
- However, Master--
- "However"! One demerit point.

282
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:57,774
However--

283
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,281
Elementary Room.

284
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,867
You have collected so many already.

285
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,747
Elementary Room,
you are really hanging on by a thread.

286
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,416
Is this what they mean
by being in the same boat?

287
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,917
That is correct.

288
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,294
First, we shall test

289
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:21,298
each group to see if they memorized
the Yongcheonru Clerkship Chronicles.

290
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,761
Starting now,
you vermin shall survive together

291
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,179
or die together.

292
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,222
A mistake or error by one of you

293
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,601
will result in the expulsion
of your roommates.

294
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,478
Do you all understand?

295
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,937
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

296
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:40,650
My goodness. This is so exciting.
So very exciting.

297
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:43,862
- Move it!
- My goodness.

298
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,697
- Move.
- What the heck?

299
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,616
Me?

300
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:49,910
I am sorry. I am.

301
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,579
We are in big trouble.

302
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,206
ELEMENTARY, ELEMENTARY ROOM

303
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,500
If we combine
all our demerit points we have…

304
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,461
Come on now.
Do not worry, my dear Deok-su.

305
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,338
We just need to earn more merit points.

306
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,090
I can't believe this…

307
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,677
I told you all…

308
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,474
that I would pay back
your kindness one day.

309
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,520
I shall make sure you all pass.

310
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,440
Just put your faith in me.
Everyone shall pass, no matter what.

311
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,150
I, Ko Su-ra, give you my word.

312
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,694
Ko Su-ra!

313
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,071
As if it was that easy…

314
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:32,911
If everyone who wanted to pass did,

315
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,789
then this would not be Yongcheonru.

316
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:38,291
My thoughts exactly, Myeong-ho.

317
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,670
You should know your place,
even when it comes to dreams.

318
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,423
Just let them be, Du-sik.

319
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,676
Their days are numbered anyway.

320
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,053
With nothing to lose, they might as well

321
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,179
enjoy their fantasy.

322
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,143
Let us go.

323
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,274
- Hey, hey. Why, you little…
- Stop, Deok-su.

324
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:06,987
Reckless will not get you anywhere.
Stop wasting time and start memorizing.

325
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,239
Worry about yourself.

326
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,323
Lee Eun-ho.

327
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,536
Our fates are intertwined now.

328
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,625
Wait for me.

329
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,003
Hey, come this way.

330
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,964
If it was not for that darn brass key…

331
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,861
WANTED
REPORT TO KIM DU-PAL

332
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,377
Flowers!

333
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:53,343
- Father.
- Hello there. Jae-on.

334
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,684
Just look at all the falling petals!

335
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,234
Welcome.

336
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,115
<i>Come on!</i>

337
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,012
Gosh. I was not expecting you
to come by today.

338
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,691
It has been 12 years already.

339
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,195
Has it been that long already?

340
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:59,826
And no one has come by?

341
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:03,038
Dozens of people died here.

342
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,831
Who would dare to visit this place?

343
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:09,461
I have only been here because
you ordered me to take care of it.

344
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,212
On some nights,

345
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,425
even I find myself terrified
that ghosts might come to haunt me.

346
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,387
This place used to contain
all the warmth in the world.

347
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,891
Why would you be scared of ghosts

348
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,935
when nothing is scarier than time?

349
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,438
Lady Seol…

350
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:36,279
I will have to head back
to my hometown this fall.

351
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,948
I need to marry my daughter off and…

352
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,370
Of course. You have done
more than enough for 12 years.

353
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:47,332
I shall add an extra five months' worth
of salary in your final payment.

354
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,459
No, that will not be necessary, my lady.

355
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,336
I shall pay you what you deserve.

356
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,592
Lady Seol…

357
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,390
perhaps, you should stop
waiting for her now.

358
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,404
- That is a new notice.
- No.

359
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,905
It is not a new one.

360
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:22,367
- Does it not look familiar?
- I have definitely seen it.

361
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,911
It is not a new one.

362
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,704
- I have seen it.
- Yes.

363
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,248
Get away!

364
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,500
Do not loiter in front of my house. Go.

365
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,377
Move it!

366
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,671
- Let us just go! Goodness.
- How rude.

367
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,518
Mother!

368
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,064
My goodness. Why would you run like that?

369
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:57,277
I have so much plaguing my mind already
and you fussing is just making it worse.

370
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,362
Mother, did you hear the news?

371
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,407
There was a murder in Seochon!

372
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,324
Murder?

373
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:05,160
Who died?

374
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,579
He was a gambler who hung around Seochon.

375
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,289
Kim Man-dol.

376
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:14,377
I hear the Police Bureau is arresting
all the gamblers he has ever played with.

377
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,465
What is the world coming to?
Gambling and murder…

378
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,258
The world is falling apart.

379
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:24,012
But you know, that man gambled every day,
had all that debt with loan sharks,

380
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,055
and used to swing his sword at anyone.

381
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:29,058
He was asking for trouble.
Even last time when Deok-su rolled…

382
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,562
- They rolled dice?
- No.

383
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:34,939
No, not dice. They rolled…

384
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,901
They rolled out various herbs
for <i>ssanghwa</i> tea, I heard.

385
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,820
Gu-sil, you better be straight with me.

386
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,281
Did Deok-su play dice with that man?

387
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:46,659
Mother, I know nothing.
I really do not know anything.

388
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,620
I know nothing!

389
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,339
Something still feels off…

390
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,299
Definitely.

391
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:15,104
GRAND PROPRIETOR
INNKEEPER

392
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,774
Everyone is studying so hard.

393
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,151
It is so hot.

394
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,738
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask me.

395
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,624
What are you so focused on, Deok-su?

396
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,878
Wait. You are after Lord Cheon's position?

397
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,256
No.

398
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:43,925
No, that of Lady Seol's.

399
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,177
That is my goal.

400
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,807
Well then… You would be right under me.

401
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,268
You should really get
your head checked out.

402
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:58,064
Hey, Eun-ho.
We already learned all that last time.

403
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:04,612
And you two, did you memorize
the official Yongcheonru greeting?

404
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,906
No need.

405
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,117
I have full faith in you, Su-ra.

406
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,120
Me too.

407
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:19,586
Let us go.

408
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,173
Off to battle.

409
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,429
The first chapter
of Yongcheonru Clerkship Chronicles

410
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:32,473
outlines the welcome greeting
you must perform at Chinyeongrae.

411
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,934
You shall execute
that greeting to the letter.

412
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,355
Start.

413
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,065
Do you feel welcomed?

414
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,609
Wrong. Next.

415
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,152
Welcome to Yongcheonru.

416
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,446
- Wrong.
- Hello you.

417
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:49,032
- Wrong.
- Hello there, you--

418
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,283
Wrong.

419
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,702
Go back to your seats.

420
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,414
Expert Room. I have high hopes.

421
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,208
Start.

422
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,962
Are you doing… well?

423
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,673
Wrong. I am feeling
the farthest from well.

424
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,217
You need to bow down. Next.

425
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,639
Hello there.

426
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,308
Welcome to Yongcheonru.

427
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,477
Wrong!

428
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,188
Your tone is not welcoming at all.

429
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,023
Next.

430
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,160
Hello there. Welcome to Yongcheonru.

431
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:36,829
May I see your ID tablet?
Let me show you to your room.

432
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,457
Will you please follow me?
I will carry your luggage for you.

433
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,042
- Breakfast will be served--
- Wrong.

434
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,712
Your left hand needs to be on top.

435
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:45,880
Next.

436
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,009
- Hello there!
- Wrong! Next.

437
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,177
Return to your seats.

438
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,762
Next.

439
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,099
Elementary Room, are you ready?

440
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,433
Yes, my lord.

441
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,982
Start.

442
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,027
- Hey there.
- Wrong.

443
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,195
- Hey there?
- Wrong. Next.

444
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:11,406
- Hey there. Hey there.
- Wrong. Wrong.

445
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,366
- Wrong. Wrong.
- Hey there. Hey--

446
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,451
You scoundrel! That is enough.

447
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:18,788
Next.

448
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,749
Hello there.

449
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,878
You went down too low. Next.

450
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,214
- But--
- Wrong! Wrong.

451
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,428
The rising star
of Elementary Room, Ko Su-ra.

452
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,430
Start.

453
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:38,933
I…

454
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:45,982
Hi…

455
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,193
- Hello…
- What is wrong with you?

456
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,987
Time is up. Wrong.

457
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,867
Next.

458
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:11,924
Hello there. Welcome to Yongcheonru.

459
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,677
May I see your ID tablet?

460
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:19,682
Let me show you to your room.
Will you please follow me?

461
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:24,062
I will carry your luggage for you.

462
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:27,648
We will serve breakfast in Yeonhwa Hall
and dinner in Yehwa Hall.

463
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,525
Please enjoy them at your leisure.

464
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,903
Shall I make you a reservation?

465
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,544
Elementary Room. Pass.

466
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,879
- Pass!
- Pass?

467
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,297
Ten points.

468
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,466
Pass!

469
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,969
He was born gifted.

470
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,764
- Eun-ho, you saved us!
- Eun-ho! Thank you!

471
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,933
- Thank you so much.
- It is all thanks to you.

472
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,186
- You saved us all.
- Thank you.

473
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,854
Thank you.

474
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,607
Next is chapter two.

475
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,567
INTERMEDIATE

476
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,111
EXPELLED

477
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,954
This makes no sense.

478
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,956
Elementary survived.

479
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:29,627
That was a close call for us as well.

480
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:35,633
Those fearing expulsion will have
a chance to deduct demerit points.

481
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,553
Three demerit points, no less.

482
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,515
First come, first served.

483
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,186
Me!

484
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,149
Elementary Room, you got it!

485
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:52,900
Thank you!

486
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,634
This must have come from the West.

487
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:25,057
Look at this.
It is so white and round. So pretty.

488
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,685
This is what they call an "onion."

489
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,395
I hear it tastes quite good.

490
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,063
I see… "Onion"?

491
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,274
- Yes, onion.
- Onion…

492
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:36,819
Go on.

493
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,362
Have a taste.

494
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,073
You see, these are very pricy,

495
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,785
but I will make an exception
and give you permission. All right?

496
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,162
Open up.

497
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,715
Go on. Have another bite.

498
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:58,799
SENNESSY

499
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,970
What is taking them so long?

500
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,431
Amazing. We get to enjoy the Orchid Suite

501
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,391
on our day off, all thanks to Myeong-ho.

502
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,687
Even the air is different here.

503
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:14,106
Surely, this is not your first time here.

504
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,567
Calm down.

505
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,528
He is not even officially
a clerk here yet.

506
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,030
This must be it.

507
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,034
The Orchid Suite…

508
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,082
Goodness, Myeong-ho!
Our dearest colleague!

509
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,961
It is so good to see you.

510
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:42,176
Welcome, Seong-jin.
I, a mere junior in the Uiju Guild,

511
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,930
have been dying to treat you,
my esteemed senior colleague, to a drink.

512
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,226
No, no.

513
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,936
Please sit at the head of the table.

514
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:58,276
Please allow me to pour you
the first drink, Seong-jin.

515
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:03,489
There is no one in Yongcheonru
I wanted to meet more than you.

516
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:07,076
And why did you want to see me, sir?

517
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:11,122
Come on now. There is no need
for such formalities with your junior.

518
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,418
"Junior"?

519
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:22,216
I will soon become your junior colleague
when I officially become a clerk.

520
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,969
I thought I would give it a go
to see how it sounds,

521
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,262
Senior Seong-jin.

522
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:30,016
I am not here today for drinks.

523
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:33,686
You will become the proprietor
of our guild someday.

524
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:36,480
I simply came as a show of respect.

525
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,316
Exactly.

526
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:42,528
I, the future proprietor, wanted
to show my seniors just how much

527
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,822
I respected them today.

528
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,533
That is why I brought
this fine 30-year-old liquor

529
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:48,909
all the way from Uiju.

530
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,162
- Let me pour you a drink.
- No, thank you.

531
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,166
Oh, no. What should I do?

532
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,294
I already opened the bottle.

533
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,545
Should I just toss it?

534
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,548
Or just one for you, Dong-gyu?

535
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,594
It would be a waste to toss it.

536
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,679
Excellent.

537
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,061
Why, this is…

538
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,105
Myeong-ho, you must let me
pour you one too.

539
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,440
Thank you.

540
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:22,943
It has such a beautiful hue.

541
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,658
It tastes so sweet.

542
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,247
You should have one. Just one.

543
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,582
Come on now.

544
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,310
Deok-su…

545
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,979
I can not see anything through my tears.

546
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,777
I can not stop crying
even with a scallion in my mouth.

547
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,861
This feels wrong.

548
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,447
We need to hang in there
and peel all of these.

549
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,783
We need to peel all of them

550
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:13,744
if we want our demerit points deducted.

551
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,958
We are almost done.

552
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,419
Let us push through and finish.

553
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,506
Here. Earn some more merit points.

554
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:32,430
You all must become official clerks

555
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,224
and come work for my department.

556
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,518
I will be back with more onions.

557
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,454
ORCHID SUITE

558
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,297
The funny thing about this is

559
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,009
that you do not feel drunk
no matter how much you drink.

560
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,928
Please have some more.

561
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,557
It must be exhausting
to serve Lady Seol every day.

562
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,854
Then again, it is not just her.

563
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:24,523
All three directors always ask
for only me.

564
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:28,277
There is simply not enough
of me to go around.

565
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,445
Exactly.

566
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:32,031
Now, we should take this chance

567
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:34,992
to unite as one for the Uiju Guild.

568
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,536
- Yes, right.
- Yes.

569
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:40,498
- U!
- Unite with loyalty!

570
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:43,375
- J!
- Just guzzle it down!

571
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,808
- Myeong-ho!
- Myeong-ho!

572
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,357
Did everything go well?

573
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,027
Du-sik, surviving
in the workplace is no joke.

574
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:19,328
Myeong-ho, it tears me up inside
to see you suffering like this.

575
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,413
HANGOVER REMEDY

576
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:24,833
Then we should pass tomorrow's test
with flying colors, right?

577
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,126
Of course!

578
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:32,049
I am Kim Myeong-ho of the Uiju Guild.

579
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,681
Come tomorrow, I will get rid

580
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,643
of every Elementary apprentice.

581
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,412
Have you been well, sire?

582
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,582
I am doing very well.

583
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,418
Today, I peeled these things
from the West called "onions."

584
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:10,671
Are you sure you are doing all right?

585
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,172
This scent is stinging my nose.

586
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,467
Thanks to me,
our room was saved from expulsion.

587
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:16,927
"Our"?

588
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,685
Update me on the situation.

589
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:29,565
His Majesty urged for you
to stay alert and on guard.

590
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,818
Did something happen in the palace?

591
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,362
Why did Father send such a message?

592
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,906
He called for me after meeting
with the Minister of War

593
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,576
and asked me to swiftly pass this along.

594
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,079
I should make haste.

595
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,791
I should be able to find some sort of lead

596
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,835
in the Management Department tomorrow.

597
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,977
I am displeased with all of it.

598
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:13,275
I mean, Prince Seonyang must be
appointed as the Crown Prince

599
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,903
on his birthday.

600
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,657
Yet His Majesty refuses to appoint him
because Prince Muyeong

601
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,742
went off to recuperate in Onyang.

602
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:25,037
Citing some lame excuse
about it not being the right time.

603
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,374
Did you say Prince Muyeong was in Onyang?

604
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,210
I cannot believe this.

605
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:33,879
Do not tell me you are
less in the know than me.

606
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:37,424
I heard he went to Onyang to recuperate.
Who knows when he will be back?

607
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,094
How could I not be upset?

608
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,472
Do not worry about it too much.

609
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,393
When Prince Muyeong returns,

610
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,604
His Majesty will set
an appointment date soon.

611
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,190
Even with all this going on,

612
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:56,652
Lord Cheon is busy
meeting with Prince Eunseong.

613
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,696
What is he thinking?

614
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,784
You must know what he has up his sleeve.

615
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,702
I am afraid I do not understand.

616
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:11,083
Do not play dumb with me.
Just get on with it and tell me.

617
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:14,795
You are the only one
in all of Joseon who knows

618
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,672
what is going on in his head.

619
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,009
How could I know everything on his mind?

620
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:28,725
By the way,
where are the gold bars I was promised?

621
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,938
I had them delivered to your home already.

622
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,022
Really?

623
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,820
As expected,

624
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:44,825
you just know me all too well.

625
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:50,247
How I would love for you to work for me…

626
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:03,760
Let us go. Before the sun comes up!

627
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:11,393
GRAND PROPRIETOR
INNKEEPER

628
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,238
What are you reading with such fervor now?

629
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:30,579
What? You are still looking at that?

630
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,500
You must really want that position.

631
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:39,129
What? Do you think I will not be able to?

632
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,841
Then, I have no other choice.

633
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,427
If Hong Deok-su, a true man,
become the innkeeper,

634
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,513
I shall become the grand proprietor.

635
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:53,310
We need to become official clerks first.

636
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,064
You better not mess up.

637
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,398
Of course.

638
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,944
I hope we can cross
the finish line in this boat.

639
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,028
Sounds good.

640
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,698
Here you go again. Seriously.

641
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:07,783
Hey, Eun-ho.

642
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,634
Deok-su, are you once again

643
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,054
skipping the bathhouse tonight?

644
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,393
This room reeks of pungently stale onions.

645
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,144
Are you not disgusted?

646
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:42,109
We should wash up together as roommates.

647
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:45,862
He is right. We can not sleep here
in this state. Let us go bathe.

648
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,786
You two, go on ahead.

649
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:56,873
I will take my time and make my way
when the bathhouse is less crowded.

650
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,625
That is nice.

651
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:12,389
At least, take off your shirt.
I can smell you from here.

652
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,726
I could say the same for you.

653
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,770
You stink as much as I do.

654
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:24,109
Must you rub all that stink on the floor?

655
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,778
What an irritating man you are.

656
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:33,619
- Get up. We need to wash up.
- Stop it.

657
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:34,911
I can take care of myself.

658
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,210
Wash yourself or your clothes or whatever.

659
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,463
Just leave me alone. I want to rest.

660
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:52,846
Unbelievable.

661
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,647
It is not like something is hidden.

662
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,898
Let go! Damn it.

663
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,403
Hey, Eun-ho.

664
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,573
Can you help me up?

665
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,338
Why do you keep doing that?

666
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,507
Me?

667
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,342
What did I do?

668
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,056
I noticed

669
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:40,060
that you keep stealing glances at Deok-su.

670
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:42,771
It was more than a few times.

671
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:45,899
By chance, do you…

672
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,445
No, never mind.

673
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,114
No, what am I thinking?

674
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,075
No, right?

675
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,035
What are you talking about?

676
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:02,124
I mean, sure, one can feel like that.

677
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,458
No, one cannot!

678
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,254
You cannot. You do not, right?

679
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,007
No.

680
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,552
You are making no sense.

681
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,480
Such insolence!

682
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:26,648
Look here!

683
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:29,276
That is not true.

684
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:39,745
DEMERIT, MERIT
FAIL, PASS

685
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:44,124
From today, you will be tested
by the three departments,

686
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,334
Hospitality, Management, and Food.

687
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:49,588
Each director will carry out
their own exams.

688
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,926
First, we have
Director Cho Seung-ryang from Management.

689
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,303
A round of applause.

690
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,642
The Department of Management

691
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:06,396
is in charge of safety
and all facilities at Yongcheonru.

692
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,356
Then, will we have

693
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:12,277
access to all facilities
if we join your department?

694
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,948
Why, I ought to…

695
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:23,121
My department…

696
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:30,420
<i>is in charge of providing every amenity</i>

697
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,548
<i>a guest may require during their stay</i>
<i>as well.</i>

698
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:35,425
<i>There is one amenity that is crucial.</i>

699
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,054
<i>Bedding.</i>

700
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:44,518
<i>We use the highest-quality cotton</i>
<i>to make our bedding.</i>

701
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,687
Some of our distinguished guests
even purchase them to take home.

702
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:52,234
<i>Even Joseon's greatest beauty, Chun-hui…</i>

703
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,867
<i>became intoxicated</i>

704
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,912
<i>by its soft texture</i>
<i>and feather-like weight.</i>

705
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:06,289
<i>She could not bear to leave.</i>

706
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:10,252
<i>The phrase "beauty sleep" originated</i>

707
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:11,962
<i>from Yongcheonru.</i>

708
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,506
<i>It remains popular to this day</i>

709
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:17,467
<i>and our best seller.</i>

710
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,136
<i>If we lined up everyone who bought a set,</i>

711
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,849
<i>they would be able to circle</i>
<i>the capital a dozen times.</i>

712
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,229
Therefore,

713
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,065
today's exam will be…

714
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:34,818
laundry.

715
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,365
By tomorrow morning,

716
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:43,410
each group must
spotlessly launder 20 sets of sheets

717
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,954
and submit them

718
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:48,582
after drying them stiff
and ironing out every little wrinkle

719
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,167
to create the sharpest of corners.

720
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:55,589
Proceed.

721
00:52:58,675 --> 00:52:59,509
Yes, my lord.

722
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:10,312
Twenty sets will take forever.

723
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:27,996
Here.

724
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,332
Take this. Go on.

725
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:59,027
Myeong-ho, those Elementary jerks are
moving really fast. What should we do?

726
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,947
Do not worry.

727
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:10,163
Salt and buckwheat flour.

728
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:12,832
We should be able to launder them
at lightning speed.

729
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:15,210
You are the best!

730
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:18,004
I never lost faith in you.

731
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,394
Hey.

732
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:37,232
Do these not look dirtier than the rest?

733
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:40,860
Maybe?

734
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,490
This is not going to work. Bring them.

735
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,075
Okay.

736
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,286
- Put them all in?
- Yes.

737
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,543
So refreshing.

738
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,264
Just join him. You know you want to.

739
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:11,516
What?

740
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:13,810
No.

741
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,396
We should all join him.

742
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,064
Su-ra, you too.

743
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,108
- Yes, come on in.
- Come on.

744
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:22,652
Come on now.

745
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:25,697
Now…

746
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,866
Really stomp down.

747
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,827
- Hurry up.
- Here I come!

748
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:33,913
Stop that!

749
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,165
Slow down!

750
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:37,000
- Make some room.
- Okay.

751
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,503
- What is wrong with you?
- You pip-squeak.

752
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,385
Stop that.

753
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,474
This is so fun!

754
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:55,018
Way to go, Deok-su!

755
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:57,479
You guys are too tall.

756
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,717
One, two, three.

757
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,181
Who are you really?

758
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,725
Your speech is unlike the rest.

759
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:40,522
Do you like Deok-su?

760
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,651
That is enough already.

761
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:49,572
My friend, you should not be that obvious.

762
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:53,868
Your eyes remain glued on him all day
and everyone can see that.

763
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,912
When he goes right, you turn right.

764
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,539
When he goes left, you turn left.

765
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,166
Jeez.

766
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:07,590
I have never witnessed
such desperately longing eyes before.

767
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:11,553
Your feelings are genuine.
I acknowledge them. I do.

768
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:13,596
However,

769
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:18,810
since we are all still apprentices,
maybe consider

770
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,478
keeping them hidden for now.

771
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:23,481
It will put you two in a fix
if someone finds out.

772
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:26,067
The world is not as open-minded as I am.

773
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,695
How many times
must I tell you that is not true?

774
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:32,198
You do not need to worry.
My lips are sealed.

775
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,909
- We are friends, after all.
- Listen to me. That is not it!

776
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,912
Stop blabbing and hurry up!
We are the last group!

777
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,664
Hurry up.

778
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:44,794
<i>Your eyes are glued on him now</i>
<i>Even now, they are glued</i>

779
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:46,463
You bring that.

780
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,633
Are we too late?

781
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:53,261
We can use that one.

782
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:54,345
Great.

783
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:56,181
Where are you going?

784
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:03,021
Unfortunately, these lines are
for our sheets.

785
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:10,361
Spreading them across two lines

786
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:13,364
allows them to dry much quicker.

787
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:18,203
You scoundrels. If you take both lines,

788
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,246
where will we hang our sheets?

789
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:24,918
How would I know?

790
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,795
Eun-ho, do not bother.

791
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:31,966
These jerks are
picking a fight on purpose.

792
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,801
- Just let it go.
- Why let it go?

793
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,094
Let us fight!

794
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,514
Fine, let us fight.
As if it was not hot enough…

795
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:41,434
What is the matter?

796
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:45,647
They act unreasonably after being late.

797
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:46,898
What?

798
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:49,943
But, Clerk Dong-gyu,

799
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,654
this facility is to be shared
by all the apprentices.

800
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:54,739
It is unjust for one group to hog it.

801
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:01,037
You were late. Deal with it.

802
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,373
- Pardon?
- Wait, but…

803
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:05,250
I will take you to another spot.

804
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,501
There is another spot?

805
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,211
Follow me.

806
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,171
Yes, my lord.

807
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:15,385
Pay them no mind.

808
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:17,220
Goodbye, Elementary.

809
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,149
Here. Take this.

810
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:37,782
Make sure it is straight.

811
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,659
That is good.

812
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,411
Finally, we are all done.

813
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:46,124
Gosh, with this nice breeze,
they should dry in no time.

814
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,503
We have finally finished it.

815
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:00,597
Thank goodness.

816
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,810
They will definitely dry
before dinnertime.

817
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:08,396
If we iron them in the evening,

818
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:11,899
we will finish with time to spare.

819
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:14,527
Management oversees laundry…

820
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:18,489
We will pass, right?

821
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:20,950
Of course.

822
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,828
Come on now. This is what youth is about.

823
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:26,289
Let us enjoy our youth!

824
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:35,173
With the blue skies
and bright white sheets above us…

825
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,805
I have not felt
such peace in a long while.

826
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:04,178
What happened?

827
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,805
Damn it.

828
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,534
Myeong-ho!

829
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:31,456
Hey, Sang-u. Did you see it happen?

830
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:34,459
Yes. They are beyond screwed.

831
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:36,377
Everything is on the ground.

832
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,797
What did I tell you, dear Myeong-ho?

833
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:42,592
You are good. So good.

834
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:04,781
My mother used to do this sometimes
with our duvets.

835
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:08,117
We do not need to hit or stomp
to get them clean

836
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:11,037
if we wash them in the river
by a fast current.

837
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,872
They will be done in no time.

838
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,380
But that looks dangerous.

839
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:23,883
Must we go so far for laundry?

840
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:27,011
We must do what we can to pass.

841
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:30,348
Let us do it quickly before we get caught.

842
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:34,101
Yes. I, too, must become
an official clerk of Yongcheonru.

843
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:38,147
We said we would all pass together.

844
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,441
Me too!

845
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:44,028
We know.

846
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,032
Now, follow me!

847
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,036
- Be careful.
- Okay.

848
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:55,122
- Hey.
- No.

849
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:58,334
I never fall.

850
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:02,839
Wait for me, Deok-su.

851
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:04,257
Okay.

852
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:09,846
Seriously?

853
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:14,892
But…

854
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:17,895
Are you not coming in?

855
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:25,111
I mean… Why do they go this far?

856
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:56,809
Hold on to it tightly
so it is not swept away.

857
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,978
- Okay.
- Apply some lye water

858
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:02,148
and rinse it in the water like this.

859
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:04,150
Then, you are done. Super quick, right?

860
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:05,234
This is really…

861
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:09,697
Wait, hold on.

862
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:12,283
Watch it.

863
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,792
Deok-su!

864
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:26,297
Deok-su!

865
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:35,139
Deok-su!

866
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:39,894
Deok-su!

867
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:43,773
Where is he? Deok-su!

868
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:01,637
<i>Do not even think about going anywhere</i>
<i>until you pay me back.</i>

869
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:02,930
Yesterday, you…

870
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:04,807
You can not leave my side

871
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:06,809
until your debt is paid off.

872
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:08,936
<i>What is so great about Deok-su?</i>

873
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:11,689
<i>What has suddenly gotten</i>
<i>into you, Jun-hwa?</i>

874
01:09:11,772 --> 01:09:13,274
<i>By chance, did you…</i>

875
01:09:13,357 --> 01:09:15,776
<i>Has Jun-hwa come to his senses?</i>

876
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,279
<i>He gets along well with his roommates.</i>

877
01:09:18,362 --> 01:09:19,822
<i>I am seeing a new side of him.</i>

878
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:23,284
<i>I am sure he will act</i>
<i>more like a proper successor,</i>

879
01:09:23,367 --> 01:09:25,578
<i>once he gets a taste of power.</i>

880
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:27,705
How would you like to make a deal with me?

881
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:30,583
<i>What happened to his daughter?</i>

882
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,918
We should continue searching for her.

883
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:33,836
<i>I shall go.</i>

884
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:36,380
I shall join you this time.

885
01:09:36,463 --> 01:09:38,007
What is taking Deok-su so long?

886
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:41,093
Time is almost up.
Those jerks are finished.

887
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:43,470
Deok-su is in trouble.

888
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:44,805
- Deok-su is?
- Deok-su is?

889
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:46,724
Is she gone or not?

890
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:48,934
