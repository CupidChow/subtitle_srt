00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,793
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,128
FILMING FOR CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,615
Hold onto it tightly
so it is not swept away.

4
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:14,616
Okay.

5
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,245
- Super quick, right?
- Yes. This is really…

6
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,125
Wait, hold on.

7
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,669
Watch it.

8
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,805
Deok-su!

9
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:40,725
Deok-su!

10
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,526
Deok-su!

11
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,239
Deok-su!

12
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,428
<i>Hong Deok-su.</i>

13
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,848
Hong Deok-su, wake up.

14
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:28,935
He is awake.

15
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,193
Are you all right?

16
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,490
He is back.

17
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,201
What a relief.

18
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,621
We must move him
before his temperature drops.

19
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,664
Place him on my back.

20
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,750
- What about you?
- I am fine.

21
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,503
I will collect the cloths.
Take Deok-su inside.

22
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,176
Careful.

23
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,567
- Su-ra, can you help?
- Sure.

24
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:20,903
Careful.

25
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,247
Should we change his clothes?

26
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,375
Su-ra, bring me more dry cloths.
We must pat him dry.

27
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,501
I will be right back.

28
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,606
Hong Deok-su…

29
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,160
No…

30
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:12,455
No. There is no way.

31
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,166
My eyes must have deceived me.

32
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,231
Why are you outside? How is Deok-su?

33
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,359
No!

34
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,569
You cannot go in.

35
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,196
Why not?

36
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,324
There is something he urgently needs.

37
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:49,242
Which is?

38
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:57,333
A brazier to give him warmth.
It is over there.

39
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,710
- Right. Can you get this to him?
- Sure.

40
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,599
TWO MAKES ONE

41
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,101
The cloths!

42
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:58,436
Our cloths.

43
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,454
Where did it go?

44
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,000
Deok-su.

45
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,754
- Where are you going?
- To the stream.

46
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,048
- I must get to the stream.
- What?

47
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,760
- Deok-su.
- What? This is urgent.

48
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:37,225
You just woke up
from having nearly drowned.

49
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,768
The assignment should not matter.

50
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,147
It is worth risking my life.

51
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,149
You are in no shape to go anywhere.

52
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,569
Cheon Jun-hwa, I am perfectly fine.

53
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,613
I am Hong Deok-su, the man.

54
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,740
I mean…

55
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,035
Hey! Hong Deok-su!

56
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,331
A man, you say?

57
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,171
What was that? Is Deok-su awake?

58
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,841
Is Yongcheonru worth
risking your life over?

59
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,552
What do you mean?

60
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,471
He went to the stream
to collect the cloths in that state.

61
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,099
As if the task matters that much.

62
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,896
His family's future depends on it.

63
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,984
I worked my whole life
to be successful at Yongcheonru.

64
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,404
I am sure it is the same for him.

65
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,574
He is trying to make it
even though he almost drowned.

66
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,575
He is that desperate.

67
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,538
Jun-hwa, do you not have
any goals in life?

68
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,721
TWO MAKES ONE

69
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,098
<i>The brass key.</i>

70
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:03,060
That is the only key
to the safe which holds the shadow ledger.

71
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,979
Those two pieces must come together
to open it.

72
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,273
It cannot be opened by one alone.

73
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:12,320
That despicable Cheon has hidden
one of them somewhere in Yongcheonru

74
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,864
<i>and is looking for the other.</i>

75
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,009
Hong Deok-su is a woman?

76
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,580
Deok-su.

77
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,418
Oh… Hey, Eun-ho.

78
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,754
You seem to be fine, thankfully.

79
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,340
They did not fold themselves, you know.

80
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,510
It is not that.

81
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,305
I warned you about being reckless,

82
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,641
but you fell into the water
and ruined our cloths.

83
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,437
Eun-ho, did you happen to…

84
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,855
What?

85
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,274
Did you lose something of value?

86
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,820
You must have found it.

87
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,002
Tell me what this is.

88
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,213
What could this be
that had you run down here

89
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,132
the second you gained consciousness?

90
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,262
Give it back, Eun-ho.

91
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,888
I wonder what it is.

92
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,517
It is no ornament.

93
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,188
What is it used for?

94
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,860
It was my father's.

95
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,699
Your father's?

96
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,284
Yes.

97
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,538
It is the only item of his
that I have left.

98
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,377
It is also the reason
I must find success at Yongcheonru.

99
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,378
Now, give it back.

100
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:41,719
Hong Deok-su.

101
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,598
You only got it back because I found it.

102
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,393
Do not forget you are indebted to me.

103
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,729
Do not even think about going anywhere

104
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,315
until you pay me back.

105
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,110
What?

106
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:02,698
Deok-su.

107
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,202
Hey.

108
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:38,025
Is it not lights-out at Gyohwa Hall?

109
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,277
You say that
like I am not allowed to be here.

110
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,324
Well, I thought I would thank you for
looking past our previous transgression.

111
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,828
Anyway, you are working
late into the night.

112
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,375
It is a task you must soon learn to do

113
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,921
Lord Cheon has high hopes for you.

114
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,550
Why should I worry when there
already is a competent innkeeper?

115
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,181
Tell me what it is you want.

116
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,022
How would you like to make a deal with me?

117
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,359
A merchant would never turn down
a good deal.

118
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,779
Let me first hear what I have to gain.

119
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,699
The future grand proprietor
will be in debt to you.

120
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,910
That alone must be worth a great deal.

121
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,120
So?

122
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,956
I need 20 of the cotton cloths
used in Geumui Chamber.

123
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,751
Of course.
I will get you 20 cotton cloths.

124
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,629
I will have them delivered
to your quarters immediately.

125
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,508
I almost forgot.

126
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,804
This is a secret between you and me.
All right?

127
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,746
Cheon Jun-hwa, did you stay up all night
waiting for us?

128
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,549
The weight of these wet cloths

129
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,801
almost brought me to my knees.

130
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,431
Hold on.

131
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,268
You washed these all night?

132
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,394
The three of you?

133
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,940
Yes. Luckily, we found all 20.
Isn't that great?

134
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,067
It is.

135
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,736
All right. Let us move out.

136
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,449
They only need to be dried now. Come on.

137
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,660
- Can we rest a bit?
- Hurry up.

138
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,036
Sure. Let us go.

139
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,123
Here. Let me carry those.

140
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,166
Darn.

141
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,385
Hey, wait for me.

142
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:45,295
Those Elementary apprentices
will definitely get the boot today.

143
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:49,633
Seeing that they are still not here,
I guess they are digging somewhere.

144
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,017
What on earth?

145
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,688
I am tired.

146
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,939
Attention!

147
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:16,201
Today, you will be graded
on your assignments from Director Cho.

148
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,620
Let me see them.

149
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:26,253
You fool. Why is your jaw hanging?

150
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,337
- Pardon?
- Are you dazed

151
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,048
from all the washing and ironing?

152
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,009
No, master.

153
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:35,262
Expert apprentices, let me see your work.

154
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:42,895
Clean.

155
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,235
And also neatly pressed.

156
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,905
- Pass.
- Yes!

157
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,531
Myeong-ho!

158
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,369
What…

159
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:01,872
Fail!

160
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,923
Clean and neatly pressed…

161
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,841
They are not!

162
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,219
Fail.

163
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,012
Next.

164
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,099
Elementary apprentices, let me see.

165
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,028
They are clean.

166
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,496
Hold on. These are still damp.

167
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,083
But the clothesline
we were assigned to snapped.

168
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,294
Of course. I was wondering
when you would voice your excuses.

169
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,504
But…

170
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:58,262
We rewashed them all night
and did not have time to fully dry them.

171
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,057
And you? Add on to that already.

172
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,684
What is your excuse?

173
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,227
We do give you excuses, but--

174
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,646
Enough!

175
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,773
You four with your excuses.

176
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,869
At least today, you passed.

177
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,078
- Sorry?
- Pardon?

178
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,167
How can they pass when they failed
to complete the assignment?

179
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,502
Last night…

180
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:37,634
someone came by the management office
and bought 20 pieces of cotton cloths.

181
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,180
I had my doubts

182
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,600
and would have expelled anyone
who brought new sheets for inspection.

183
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,229
Every year, there have been those
who tried to buy their spots here.

184
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:53,692
I am giving you a pass
since I value their night-long commitment.

185
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,904
Do you understand?

186
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,447
- Yes.
- Of course.

187
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,740
Yes, master.

188
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,219
We passed!

189
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,268
LOW-INTERMEDIATE

190
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,647
EXPELLED

191
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,982
How could you
give the Elementary brats a pass?

192
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,985
- Take your yapping elsewhere.
- This is wrong!

193
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,363
Apprentice Number One.

194
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,371
How about some advice?

195
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,165
What if

196
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:54,086
someone had ruined your cloths
by snapping your clothesline last night?

197
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,465
What would you have done?

198
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,554
Well…

199
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,017
I am also of the Uiju Guild.

200
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,271
As one of its members,
I expect you to play fair.

201
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,601
A penny for your thoughts?

202
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,693
Do you feel guilty
for not helping us with the wash?

203
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,197
We are in the same boat anyway.

204
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,617
Hong Deok-su.

205
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,161
What? Come here.

206
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:15,042
All right. Allow these fists
of a true man to loosen your shoulders.

207
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:20,130
What is there to loosen
with the fists of a man?

208
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,757
Get back here.

209
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,051
I ought to thank you
for saving me yesterday.

210
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,678
How is it? I bet it feels good.

211
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,431
Goodness me. You…

212
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,560
My stomach. It must suddenly be upset.

213
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,479
- What?
- I will catch you later.

214
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:40,859
But…

215
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:44,362
You should not be running
on an upset stomach.

216
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:52,996
What?

217
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,334
What do you mean?

218
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:01,004
Loosen my shoulders
with those true man's fists of yours.

219
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,380
I see.

220
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,850
Such insolence! How dare you?

221
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,729
What did I say about being reckless?

222
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,357
When was I reckless?

223
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,723
You! Yesterday, you…

224
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,892
Cause trouble again
and you will get an earful.

225
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,564
Damn it.

226
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,902
My gosh! My stomach is killing me.

227
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,072
My stomach. It is killing me.

228
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,995
Those fists are not that manly.

229
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,129
Is that the best you can do?

230
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,180
GYOHWA HALL
RULES AND REGULATIONS

231
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,861
Finally, it looks better.

232
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,409
I applaud you all for making it this far.

233
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,745
Feast and rest up today.

234
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,123
What have you been served?

235
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:03,168
Yongcheonru's special meal for VIP guests.

236
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,586
It is the Dragon Feast!

237
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,302
Applaud!

238
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:14,012
Also, you will be allowed

239
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:15,847
to have drinks.

240
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,727
Do not drink too much,
but have a good time with your classmates.

241
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,728
Actually, no.

242
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:24,356
Have the time of your lives!

243
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,733
- Yes!
- All right! Thank you, master.

244
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,949
Let me see. What should I eat first?

245
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,992
Right. This one.

246
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,412
Jun-hwa, you have an upset stomach.
Take it easy.

247
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,039
What upset stomach…

248
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,416
Right. That is true.

249
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:51,091
Hong Deok-su,
you should also watch yourself.

250
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,842
You also have a severe stomachache.

251
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,306
Move over, will you?
There is more than enough space.

252
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,647
You can not leave my side

253
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,650
until your debt is paid off.

254
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,529
The food is delicious.

255
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,201
Good. Drink and eat up.

256
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,703
- We will enjoy this.
- Sure.

257
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,336
Something is off.

258
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,299
There is a motive
behind every generous act.

259
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,259
Drink up. There you go.

260
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,136
Expert apprentices.

261
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:41,099
We are allowed to drink the wine.
Pass me that.

262
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,393
Su-ra, pass me a glass.

263
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,439
But…

264
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:48,565
Hold on.

265
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,859
Does this not seem suspicious at all?

266
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,948
Leftovers could mean demerits.

267
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:00,785
Absolutely!

268
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,330
Eat up already.

269
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,540
Elementary apprentices,

270
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,002
why are you not drinking the wine?

271
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,588
Do you not know what kind of wine this is?

272
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,506
For 100 years…

273
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,717
No, this is 200-year-old liquor.

274
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,137
This rare wine can only be enjoyed
in Yongcheonru. Have a glass.

275
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,348
Of course.

276
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,100
There you go.

277
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,273
What the…

278
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,151
You cannot get drunk.

279
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,862
Why not? I am

280
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,614
Hong Deok-su, the true man.

281
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,617
Right. The Hong Deok-su, the true man.
Have another drink.

282
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,701
Yes, master.

283
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,288
Drink up!

284
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,040
Give it here, Deok-su.

285
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,712
What is up with you two?

286
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:58,093
You four with the excuses sure are tight.

287
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:01,721
It is a good day today,
so drink as much as you want.

288
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:02,972
- Sure.
- Yes, master.

289
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,480
What the…

290
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:11,773
What?

291
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,027
What is your problem?

292
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:19,030
Alcohol seems to be calling my name today.

293
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,543
- No.
- Not again.

294
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,002
What? Hold on.

295
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,592
Have you two always been fond of drinking?

296
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,890
Pour me some more. Let us party.

297
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,143
Sure. Drink as much as you want.

298
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,979
Seriously? What is up with you two?

299
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,277
Hey. Are you drunk?

300
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,863
- More.
- More.

301
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,824
What a good day this is.

302
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,869
The bottle's empty.

303
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,954
There is more wine here.

304
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:11,916
Here you go.

305
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:17,547
Come on!

306
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,883
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

307
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:28,850
Get a grip on yourselves.

308
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,690
What?

309
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,029
- Are you all right?
- Give me that.

310
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,533
Get a grip on yourself.

311
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,956
I am relieved that Eun-ho is not as drunk.

312
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,502
I beat Cheon Jun-hwa.

313
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:01,591
Are you all right? Hey, Lee Eun-ho.

314
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,387
Hey, Cheon Jun-hwa.

315
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,890
Hong Deok-su.

316
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,059
Red rice cakes and water.

317
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,895
- What is he saying?
- Ko Su-ra.

318
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,980
- Are you seriously laughing?
- Yes.

319
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:24,572
- Me?
- Yes, you. Kim Myeong-ho.

320
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,285
Myeong-ho.

321
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:33,957
You see, I am three years older than you.

322
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:40,964
That means I have had at least 3,285
more meals than you,

323
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,048
you brat.

324
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,510
You adorable little thing.

325
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:56,855
Have you lost your mind?

326
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,148
Du-sik, Seok-sam,

327
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,150
you should also speak up.

328
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,779
Quit kissing his ass
while talking shit behind his back.

329
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,531
Do you not agree, Myeong-ho?

330
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:07,866
When did I ever--

331
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,159
Hit him.

332
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,663
Not that hard!

333
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,591
Attention!

334
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:34,225
- Right. Did you enjoy your meal?
- Yes, master.

335
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:37,270
Good. Now that you have enjoyed it,
the test will begin!

336
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,354
What?

337
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,356
- However--
- Quiet.

338
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:46,487
Lord Jang of the Department of Food
will give the test in person.

339
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,572
Applaud.

340
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,536
- Over there. Wake up that log.
- Of course.

341
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,206
A clerk of Yongcheonru should know
how to nurse his drink.

342
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,500
That darn fool.

343
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,713
As your assignment…

344
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,634
you shall serve a meal.

345
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:12,597
All you have to do is recreate
and serve the meal you consumed today.

346
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,308
Every single bowl and plate

347
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:18,144
as well as the garnish
must be exactly the same.

348
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:23,024
Head Clerk Ji Yeon-hui will evaluate you.

349
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:29,238
You will be evaluated based on how perfect
your table setting is.

350
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,950
We hear you.

351
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,242
Shut it.

352
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,120
Get a grip on yourself.

353
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,542
Begin.

354
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,295
Hey, take this with you.

355
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,316
Are we supposed to go that way?

356
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,734
No, it is to the left.

357
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,990
- Why you…
- Wait for me!

358
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,786
Two more.

359
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,171
Move!

360
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:28,798
It is hot!

361
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,847
- Deok-su.
- Here, put it down.

362
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,392
The abalones…

363
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,602
A second round of drinks!

364
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,271
We are friends, right?

365
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,023
Yes, we are friends.

366
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,483
One more drink!

367
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,111
Grilled short rib patties…

368
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,657
Gujeolpan was placed in the middle.

369
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,995
- I am starving.
- I have not eaten all day.

370
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,372
Hurry up, will you?

371
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,041
- Of course.
- The braised short ribs?

372
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,250
To the back.

373
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:06,794
- These?
- By the rim.

374
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,717
I remember up to seven dishes.

375
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,718
This seems correct.

376
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:19,932
Braised abalones.

377
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,311
Braised abalones to the right.

378
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,273
- Here?
- No, not there!

379
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,151
To the east of the royal hot pot.

380
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:33,488
Here?

381
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:37,742
The grilled short rib patties.

382
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,411
These?

383
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,080
South of the royal hot pot.

384
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,456
Under it?

385
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,458
Not like that.

386
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,251
South, like this?

387
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,963
Well, this is surprising.

388
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,885
Eun-ho, are you sober?

389
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,731
I miss you, my father, the king.

390
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,652
- Who is there?
- Goodness me.

391
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,989
I think we got it close enough.

392
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:20,201
Right. Can we trust him though?

393
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,293
Hold on.

394
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,587
- Where are you going?
- Just a second.

395
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,552
Where is our youngest?

396
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,141
- Where is Deok-su?
- Get a grip on yourself.

397
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,354
When will Deok-su be back?

398
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,027
Where do you think one of them went?

399
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:58,406
It is over for them now that time is up.

400
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,079
Move. Make way.

401
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,582
Hong Deok-su.

402
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,833
Damn it.

403
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,013
The evaluations will commence.

404
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,441
This could never be served.

405
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,401
Fail.

406
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:44,785
Where are the sesame seeds
and the garnish?

407
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,287
And why are you missing lids?

408
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,497
Fail.

409
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,520
This is perfect.
You are the first ones to pass.

410
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,024
- Thank you.
- Myeong-ho!

411
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,150
You are the best.

412
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,360
Stop that.

413
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,452
Serve the pork.

414
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:56,232
Who placed this soup?

415
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,361
I did.

416
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,325
Number 30, Hong Deok-su.
Is there a reason behind this?

417
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,079
Well…

418
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:16,252
I wanted to serve the guest hot soup.

419
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:20,298
The food we were served was warm, you see.

420
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:24,927
Pass.

421
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:28,139
- Pass.
- We passed!

422
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:31,017
We passed!

423
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,897
The Expert apprentices
completed the assignment,

424
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,941
but the Elementary apprentices
served a guest.

425
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,362
Remembering to serve our meals hot
and in warm dishware

426
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,781
is the right attitude
for clerks at Yongcheonru.

427
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:53,080
- But Myeong-ho, we did as you said--
- Shut it.

428
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,166
Welcome to Yongcheonru.

429
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,587
EXPELLED, ADVANCED
EXPELLED, UPPER-INTERMEDIATE

430
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,714
EXPERT, ELEMENTARY

431
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,467
Can you please…

432
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,820
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

433
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,531
Goodness, you are heavy.

434
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,409
You sure are heavy.

435
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,370
I almost died.

436
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,123
That hurts.

437
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,003
I will drink it instead.

438
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,296
No, I will drink it.

439
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,051
No, let me.

440
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:56,435
The Gyohwa Hall apprentices
only have one task left.

441
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,732
Has Jun-hwa come to his senses?

442
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:05,236
He gets along well with his roommates.

443
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,780
I am seeing a new side of him.

444
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,825
I am sure he will act
more like a proper successor,

445
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,452
once he gets a taste of power.

446
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,455
What about Prince Muyeong?

447
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,335
There is nothing
out of the ordinary with him.

448
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,881
Are you going to support him?

449
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,927
I will see his compatibility
with my Jun-hwa.

450
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:34,432
If the two make better partners…

451
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,979
I will have no need
for the Minister of War.

452
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:50,114
What? You returned the brass key?

453
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,912
Did you have a drink?

454
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:05,421
Cheon's brass key is a set of two.

455
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,925
But I only saw one of them last night.

456
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,427
But why did you give it back?

457
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:17,600
He must not be suspicious of me
if I am to find out where he obtained it.

458
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:22,396
Beom-ho, I have a task for you.

459
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:23,814
Of course.

460
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,318
Find out about Hong Deok-su.

461
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:31,322
Who his father was
as well as where and how he grew up.

462
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:32,823
Look into him in detail.

463
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,074
Yes, Your Highness.

464
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,351
Eun-ho, have you sobered up?

465
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,269
I was hardly drunk.

466
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,984
Do you know where Deok-su is?

467
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,112
Oh, Deok-su?

468
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,573
Why do you ask?

469
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:18,536
Well, he went to bathe a while ago,
but he is not back yet.

470
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,871
I will go and look for him.

471
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,831
No, it is fine.

472
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:25,376
Let me look for him. You may stay back.

473
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,669
No, I will look for him.

474
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,837
No, you should rest.

475
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:32,800
What has suddenly gotten into you,
Jun-hwa?

476
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:41,892
By chance, did you…

477
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,315
Gosh, no.

478
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,942
I was only…

479
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,153
I respect it.

480
00:42:58,867 --> 00:42:59,994
What do you respect?

481
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,205
Are you two still drunk?

482
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:06,375
Goodness. What an exhausting day.

483
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:12,464
All that hard work today
has got me aching all over.

484
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:18,637
But since we passed today's test
and I am in a good mood,

485
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:19,888
I will let this slide.

486
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,560
Gosh, my body needs rest.

487
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,272
Goodness.

488
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:39,199
Deok-su, you should lie down
more carefully, okay?

489
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:42,786
Unbelievable. Do you have any idea
how exhausting it was

490
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,997
for me and Su-ra
to carry you two back here?

491
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:53,922
Lee Eun-ho.

492
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,676
I paid you back
for saving me the other day.

493
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,352
I should also rest.

494
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,066
This is nice.

495
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:51,563
You seem to be in a good mood today,
Minister of War.

496
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,945
Getting a glimpse of you
has been quite the challenge.

497
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,406
To what do I owe this pleasure?

498
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,951
Has your visit to Prince Eunseong

499
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:08,372
cured whatever has been
bothering your knees?

500
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:16,463
The innkeeper served you well in my stead.

501
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,548
What?

502
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:19,758
Right.

503
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,136
That she did.

504
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:27,349
Thanks to the gold bars
you had her deliver,

505
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,353
the appointment is being planned
without a hitch.

506
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,272
I appreciate it.

507
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,776
What should I do
with the Minister of War's gold?

508
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,113
It is still not the right time.
Be patient.

509
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:54,418
I am pleased to hear it was of help.

510
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:02,885
It will not be long before Prince Seonyang
is installed as crown prince.

511
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:06,430
I must say I am excited
for the appointment ceremony.

512
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:08,140
One cannot be sure.

513
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:11,226
Would His Majesty give that order

514
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,687
while Prince Muyeong
recuperates in Onyang?

515
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,441
He will.

516
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:22,529
I already have a plan in motion.

517
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:31,997
It seems a royal artifact
has been found at the murder scene.

518
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,427
You must have something else planned.

519
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,889
I see you are completely clueless.

520
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:52,976
Everything will eventually go my way.

521
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:56,480
I advise

522
00:46:56,563 --> 00:47:00,943
that you stop weighing your options
between Prince Muyeong and Prince Eunseong

523
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,570
and choose your side.

524
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,547
- Coming!
- What a treat this is.

525
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,048
What took you so long?

526
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:26,301
Sorry about that,
but you can see we are busy.

527
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:29,846
- Goodness. Welcome!
- Right.

528
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,099
Is this where Hong Deok-su lives?

529
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,894
He was born and raised here.

530
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,566
His late father was a gambler.

531
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,485
He died leaving a pile of debt,
and his wife raised their son.

532
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,413
Here you go.

533
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:58,208
Please enjoy.

534
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,419
- Are you kidding me with this?
- Please enjoy.

535
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:02,921
I hear you. I will give you more.

536
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,173
- Take your time.
- This is a treat.

537
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,220
- That was amazing.
- Is that so?

538
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,722
- Did you enjoy your food?
- I did.

539
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:14,141
- I will be back.
- Sure thing.

540
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,476
- Can I have more radish kimchi?
- What?

541
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,229
Excuse me, a plate of meat, please.

542
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,606
Of course, my lord.

543
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:29,323
Here you go.

544
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:32,451
Is it not too busy to manage on your own?

545
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:36,121
Goodness. My son used to help out,

546
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:38,081
but he went somewhere far away

547
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,958
to make life better for me.

548
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,128
- You must feel reassured.
- I sure do.

549
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:44,963
Please enjoy.

550
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:49,259
- Excuse me.
- Yes? Goodness me.

551
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:52,179
So he lived here with only his mother.

552
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,365
Why are you still here
when we were granted our first leave?

553
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:14,993
Cheon Jun-hwa, go ahead and have fun.

554
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,248
Head Clerk Ji Yeon-hui

555
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:24,628
is one of the people
closest to Lady Seol Mae-hwa, right?

556
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:27,506
Do you also wish to be a head clerk?

557
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,258
Darn, that fruit fly.

558
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,053
Well, then, I am off.

559
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:36,306
Sure. Enjoy your day.

560
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,683
Have a good one.

561
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:40,352
That reminds me!

562
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,398
Get us some pumpkin taffy.

563
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,410
Su-ra, are you not going out?

564
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,289
Well, I do not have anywhere to go

565
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:02,624
or any money.

566
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:05,544
Likewise.

567
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,923
I became the head of my family
following my father's death.

568
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:18,515
No way. My father also died young.

569
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:23,478
We need to be successful for sure.
Right, Su-ra?

570
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,482
Right. We will do that.

571
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:29,359
We will.

572
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,738
- Anyway, let us continue.
- Right.

573
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:34,239
- It--
- Are you the only ones left?

574
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:40,370
Yes, master. It is only us two
from the Elementary apprentices.

575
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,205
That is good.

576
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,791
How would you like to do some work?

577
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,251
- Sorry?
- Sorry?

578
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,464
- Work? That--
- It is worth merits.

579
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,007
- I am in.
- I am in.

580
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,054
JEONGJU HALL
COOKING AREA IN YONGCHEONRU

581
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:05,228
What kind of guests are they serving
that they needed our help?

582
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,521
Beats me.

583
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:12,527
The others will be thrilled
about the points we scored.

584
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:13,612
What?

585
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,572
Whatever.

586
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:20,285
All this hard work
will have us come out on top, right?

587
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,538
We should.

588
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:26,792
Of course.

589
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,210
Are you angry?

590
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:41,014
Get your taffy! Taffy!

591
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:53,318
That reminds me!
Get us some pumpkin taffy.

592
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:57,405
Darn. As if I should
do Deok-su any favors.

593
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,328
Did you not bring anything?

594
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:06,498
Goodness. I am too starved to even walk.

595
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:10,168
WANTED
REWARD 100 NYANG

596
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,175
I will have a geun of pumpkin taffy.

597
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,302
A geun?

598
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:23,974
Of course. A geun of pumpkin taffy
and a little extra.

599
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:30,313
Goodness! I see you were
able to recognize the five-color candy

600
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:33,108
that is most popular
among the ladies in Hanyang.

601
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,776
Would you like some?

602
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,694
What?

603
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:40,156
Give it to your lady as a gift,

604
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,952
and her heart will melt.

605
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:47,372
No! My lady, did you say?
There is no one like that.

606
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,001
But you are tall and handsome.

607
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:53,336
I wonder what the problem is.

608
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,629
Goodness.

609
00:52:57,632 --> 00:53:00,719
Then how about
I read your fortune with the taffy?

610
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,848
Cut the nonsense
and hurry up with my taffy.

611
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:07,934
Sure.

612
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:26,244
Here. What does this mean? Look.

613
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:30,081
Goodness gracious!

614
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:33,793
It is obvious
that your fates are entwined,

615
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:35,837
but there is a blockage.

616
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,632
Goodness. I told you I would not do it.

617
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:46,598
What? Lee Eun-ho?

618
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,187
Who is this?

619
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:58,860
He is an older friend.

620
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,196
Someone I am close to.

621
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,031
Yes, I am older.

622
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,076
He is younger.

623
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,705
Friend, would you like some taffy?

624
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:15,752
You gobbled the meat soup by yourself
and have no room for dessert.

625
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:24,344
I will enjoy these.

626
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,687
Should I also tell your fortune
with taffy sticks?

627
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,150
Do not do it. He is a quack.

628
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:43,655
You are on a lucky streak!

629
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:47,409
Whatever you are looking for
is in your vicinity.

630
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,036
However,

631
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,790
you should make haste
since many others are after it.

632
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,920
What a fraud.

633
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,672
You said I had a blockage.

634
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:05,593
In your case, all you have to do
is get rid of that blockage.

635
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,931
Besides, relationships
have endless possibilities.

636
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:21,776
Eun-ho, it must feel nice
to know you are on a lucky streak.

637
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:25,822
Meanwhile, should I just start over?

638
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,240
There is a blockage everywhere.

639
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:29,993
Are you trusting the words
of a taffy vendor?

640
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:32,787
Do not be rigid.

641
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,373
What harm does it do to heed his words?

642
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,834
Why did you buy so many of them?

643
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,336
These?

644
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,547
Deok-su asked me to pick up pumpkin taffy.

645
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:44,507
Want some?

646
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:49,137
Are you

647
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,306
and Deok-su very close?

648
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,483
Listen. I…

649
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,778
- About Hong Deok-su…
- What about him?

650
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,576
Well, I…

651
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,954
I was wondering
what he and Su-ra were up to.

652
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:19,125
We are always a group of four,
so it feels like something is missing.

653
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,427
Wait for me.

654
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:39,145
Look here, Hong Deok-su and Ko Su-ra.

655
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:44,984
- What is it?
- Master Bang asked for snacks.

656
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:49,948
Get them to him yourself then.
Why tell us to do it?

657
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:52,492
He told me to tell you.
Take it up with him.

658
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,537
Come on. Let us get this over with.

659
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,582
One should peel the onions.

660
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:00,625
The onions?

661
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,631
Are they also worth merits?

662
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,091
Probably.

663
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,679
Hong Deok-su, hurry on over.

664
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:17,308
- I will deliver them.
- Sure. See you later.

665
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,920
JAKYAKJAE:
AN ANNEX SUITE IN YONGCHEONRU

666
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,093
Place the candlestick here.

667
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,023
Bo-bae.

668
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:07,275
Yes?

669
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:11,404
Did you place the clothes and accessories
for our guest in the dressing room?

670
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,489
Yes.

671
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:15,658
Male clerks cannot be seen
in the vicinity of Jakyakjae.

672
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,660
This is an important guest of Lady Seol's.

673
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:18,953
I will keep that in mind.

674
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:24,417
He asked for snacks
from Jakyakjae's kitchen.

675
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:28,129
Also, at the sight of guests,
we are to drop to our knees,

676
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:30,298
bow, and welcome them loudly.

677
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,261
Where are you headed?

678
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,930
To get snacks.

679
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,933
As if that is a task for two people.

680
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:42,393
Get the snacks on your own.

681
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,687
You will head back to peel onions.

682
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:47,106
Right, of course.

683
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:25,520
Who are you?

684
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:29,023
I am an apprentice from Gyohwa Hall
and here to get snacks--

685
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:30,400
Quiet!

686
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:32,569
The guest has arrived.

687
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,530
What…

688
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:37,073
Where are you taking me?

689
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,367
- Get in!
- What?

690
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:59,721
Will Myeong-ho forgive us
if we receive merits for peeling these?

691
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,685
But why should we peel so many?
Who would eat these tangy things?

692
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:08,688
Sang-u, did you not get the memo?

693
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,861
We have a guest at Jakyakjae today.

694
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:19,282
That old geezer
only has the female clerks…

695
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,368
tend to him.

696
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:26,998
He has a fit at the sight of men
and only claims girls.

697
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:29,208
Hornier than a rabbit, that one.

698
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,879
- What the…
- What?

699
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:36,299
A lecher who punishes men on sight…

700
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:39,594
is at Jakyakjae?

701
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,097
What? There is a man inside Jakyakjae?

702
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:48,603
Who? Who let him in here?

703
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:51,105
I hid him in the dressing room for now.

704
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:52,940
Nothing gets past that man.

705
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:55,485
If he gets whiff of this,
we will pay with our lives.

706
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:56,778
Please forgive me.

707
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:07,246
Why the urgent steps? Where is our guest?

708
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,582
He was escorted inside.

709
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,085
Has his bed and bath
been prepared to perfection?

710
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:14,754
There is no question about it.

711
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:18,716
I must check for myself
if it has been properly prepared.

712
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:21,427
Lead the way.

713
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:22,720
Pardon?

714
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,229
Who is this guest

715
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:34,399
that I have to hide here?

716
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,418
The floor is slippery.

717
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,837
- Polish it harder.
- Of course.

718
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:04,929
What is in here?

719
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:20,653
Deok-su is in trouble.

720
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:21,821
- Deok-su?
- Deok-su?

721
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:24,991
The lecherous geezer at Jakyakjae will…

722
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:26,993
Make sense, will you?

723
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,619
Deok-su went where?

724
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:32,165
The guest staying there
punishes men on sight,

725
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,083
but Deok-su went in there.

726
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,299
A lecherous geezer? Damn it.

727
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:48,973
It is the room
for clothes and accessories.

728
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:50,892
There is no need to check--

729
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:09,285
He especially prefers the clothes
to be light pink.

730
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:12,497
Of course. We are well aware of his taste.

731
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,584
What about his taste?

732
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:17,752
Is there a problem?

733
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:20,087
Of course not.

734
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:22,381
Nothing is impossible at Yongcheonru.

735
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:39,398
This!

736
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:43,361
It is the only figured silk
that was delivered from Hanyang.

737
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:45,988
Not even the queen
was able to obtain it yet.

738
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,991
An artisan embroidered these
with gold thread--

739
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:51,327
Fine, I hear you. Bring that to him later.

740
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:08,678
Is she gone

741
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:11,347
or not?

742
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,976
Anyway, why should I even hide?

743
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:18,104
Is she gone or not?

744
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:00,771
What should we do now?

745
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:05,276
WEOLBAEKJEONG

746
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:21,459
The deed to Hong Min-sik's house?

747
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:25,129
I am having the property mediator sell it.

748
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:26,839
JIBJUREUM, REAL ESTATE AGENT

749
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:41,896
But you went as far as killing that man
for this house, so why?

750
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:46,984
It has been more than a decade.
I should let it go.

751
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,867
What happened to his daughter?

752
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:57,703
Hong Jae-on…

753
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:00,957
must have died back then.

754
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,461
The child who was swept down to Mapo Dock

755
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:07,380
must have been her.

756
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:12,677
Still, we should continue
searching for her.

757
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,182
Anyway,

758
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,644
I hear our guest is arriving today.

759
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:27,108
I was on my way to Jakyakjae
to greet him just now. I shall go.

760
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:31,612
Wait.

761
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,242
I shall join you this time.

762
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,538
Since he does not take a liking to men,

763
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:42,540
you have never come with me to greet him.

764
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:47,962
I doubt he will dismiss
the Grand Proprietor of Yongcheonru.

765
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:52,341
I will prepare your sedan chair.

766
01:06:57,888 --> 01:06:58,723
<i>Hong Deok-su?</i>

767
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:08,733
How dare you step foot in here?

768
01:07:09,483 --> 01:07:10,901
I was told to bring snacks--

769
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:12,737
Shut it.

770
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,781
If the guest finds out
that a man entered this place,

771
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:18,034
we will not live to tell the tale.

772
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:19,243
What?

773
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:21,412
We must figure out a way.

774
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,432
That foot stone is not grounded.
Secure it.

775
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:46,080
Hong Deok-su…

776
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:17,653
WANTED
REWARD 100 NYANG

777
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:20,531
They searched for her
and stopped five years ago,

778
01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:22,449
and someone is looking for her again.

779
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:26,245
Not even the government rewards you
this much for finding a person.

780
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:28,455
The reward is 100 nyang.

781
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:32,209
Who could she be
that they are offering such a huge reward?

782
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,503
<i>Where on earth are you going?</i>

783
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:18,172
<i>She is a gift for our guest.</i>

784
01:10:18,255 --> 01:10:19,590
<i>Just do as you are told.</i>

785
01:10:19,673 --> 01:10:21,759
<i>Did she just refer to Deok-su as a gift?</i>

786
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:25,471
<i>Once we climb over this wall, we will</i>
<i>be responsible for what happens next.</i>

787
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:29,475
<i>We cannot give Deok-su up</i>
<i>to the lecherous geezer.</i>

788
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,268
<i>Eun-ho, where are you going?</i>

789
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:34,438
<i>Did you think you could save Hong Deok-su</i>

790
01:10:34,521 --> 01:10:36,482
<i>by climbing over the wall</i>
<i>and eavesdropping?</i>

791
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:39,735
Did it not occur to you that
your foolishness could cause more harm?

792
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:41,570
<i>To change the ways of Yongcheonru,</i>

793
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,239
<i>become its proprietor.</i>

794
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:45,532
Grand Proprietor Cheon, I seek your aid.

795
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:47,076
You do not need to ask.

796
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:50,704
<i>Should Prince Muyeong marry</i>
<i>the Minister of War's niece,</i>

797
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:53,040
<i>Prince Seonyang will be</i>
<i>the next crown prince.</i>

798
01:10:53,123 --> 01:10:55,042
What is going on between you and Deok-su?

799
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:56,877
I was only trying to protect
what I had to.

800
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:58,504
What exactly were you protecting?

801
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:02,049
Probably the same thing
you were trying to protect.

802
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:05,386
<i>Has anyone seen Hong Deok-su take a bath?</i>

803
01:11:05,469 --> 01:11:09,390
Even during the game, he adamantly
refused to take his shirt off.

804
01:11:09,473 --> 01:11:10,307
It cannot be.

805
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:13,269
<i>My lord, allow Yongcheonru</i>
<i>to present its gift for you.</i>

806
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:14,478
<i>- Take it off.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

807
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:17,189
<i>Take it off this second!</i>

808
01:11:18,732 --> 01:11:23,612
