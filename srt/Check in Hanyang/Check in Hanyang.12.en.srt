1
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,710
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,128
FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,336
Trip to Uiju? That is out of the blue.

4
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:31,049
Once you become the grand proprietor,

5
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,636
will things be different at Yongcheonru?

6
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,765
Did something occur
between you and Father?

7
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,476
"The disagreeable quartet", was it?

8
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,395
The nickname for you and your friends
at Gyohwa Hall.

9
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,525
- Lady Seol--
- You have an admirable friendship.

10
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,653
Know that good friends must be valued.

11
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,950
You sound like someone
who will never return.

12
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:06,376
You are not like Grand Proprietor Cheon.

13
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,544
I know that.

14
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,219
I have a favor to ask.

15
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,392
I believe you know
Hong Deok-su is a woman.

16
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:27,313
If something happens while I am gone,

17
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,693
please keep her safe on my behalf.

18
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,781
Get them.

19
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,909
I will not accept failure.

20
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,244
Yes, my lord.

21
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,170
There are two of them. Find them!

22
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,052
Eun-ho.

23
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,888
What are you doing here?

24
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:43,723
Find them!

25
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:53,691
Over there.

26
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,738
Get them!

27
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,634
Run.

28
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:57,630
Come on.

29
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,062
Damn it.

30
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,651
Should we halt the banquet
and start searching?

31
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,612
This is a royal event.
Keep it as quiet as possible.

32
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,324
- Go that way.
- Yes, my lord.

33
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:36,919
Come on.

34
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,160
Who are you really?

35
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,581
Find them quickly!

36
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,038
Deok-su…

37
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,206
- What are you doing?
- Stay still.

38
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,932
Let's go.

39
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,318
Let's go.

40
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,472
You were a woman.

41
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:26,107
Have you been hiding
your identity as a woman?

42
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:33,322
Hong Deok-su, how could you of all people…

43
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,392
Why?

44
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,021
Why, after all this time?

45
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,985
I am sorry I kept it from you.

46
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,739
All this time, I…

47
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,248
I wish you had stayed a man.

48
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,378
So what?

49
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,922
It changes nothing.
I am still Hong Deok-su.

50
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:32,840
No.

51
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,259
You are Hong Jae-on.

52
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:41,891
What?

53
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,853
How do you know my name?

54
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,993
Give me the brass key.

55
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,537
- We do not have time for this.
- No.

56
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,373
That was originally mine.

57
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,583
I also need the brass key.

58
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,137
You…

59
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,766
- What--
- You just need to show me once.

60
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,017
Why are you on my case?

61
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,102
What is it?

62
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,437
Could there be something you are hiding?

63
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,939
Tell me what this is.

64
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,274
What could this be
that had you run down here

65
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,110
the second you gained consciousness?

66
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,157
So that is why you approached me.

67
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,537
Your father's safe
that can only be opened with this key…

68
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,874
I need the ledger from that safe.

69
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,383
Who are you?

70
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,177
Grand Proprietor Cheon
has my family on a leash.

71
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,643
How is your family connected
to Lord Cheon?

72
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:08,978
That…

73
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,150
I cannot disclose that at this moment.

74
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,029
You have approached me
because of the brass key.

75
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,283
You were also going to steal mine, right?

76
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,743
You had to pretend to be a man
for a reason.

77
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,078
I, also,

78
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,622
have my reasons.

79
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,917
Once I locate the safe
and secure the ledger,

80
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,546
I will tell you everything.

81
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,064
Su-ra, have you seen Deok-su?

82
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,441
Deok-su?

83
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,193
I think I did earlier.

84
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,279
He and Eun-ho
were urgently going somewhere.

85
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,615
With Eun-ho?

86
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,201
Well, I only saw them in passing.

87
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,414
Where could he have gone?

88
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,464
We would like to switch masks.

89
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,674
To which ones?

90
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:34,146
Eun-ho, do you mean what you said?

91
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,818
I do.

92
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,782
What about you, Deok-su?

93
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,957
Do you not desperately want the brass key?

94
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,263
Then, let us work together.

95
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,139
What?

96
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,685
Let us find the safe together.

97
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,235
Thank you.

98
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,990
First, hand me that piece.

99
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,958
Think wisely, Deok-su.

100
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,502
You will significantly benefit

101
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,090
from having me in your corner.

102
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,401
There you are.

103
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:11,076
The banquet is almost over.
We should head back down.

104
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,036
Right, of course.

105
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,372
I should go and clean up.

106
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,624
Deok-su, wait.

107
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,542
Yes?

108
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,673
What happened to your hair? Let me--

109
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,050
What…

110
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,802
What about my hair?

111
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,432
What did you do? Your hair is a mess.

112
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,603
I will take care of it.

113
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,357
He said you should leave it be.

114
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,159
Now that the banquet is over,
only the engagement ceremony remains.

115
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,954
Are you not excited for tomorrow?

116
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,958
I cannot say,
for today is still yet to be over.

117
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,461
I will head back first.

118
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:53,470
I am afraid this will not work.

119
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,057
Pardon? I do not follow, my lady.

120
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,144
Tonight, you will be Prince Muyeong.

121
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,064
I mean, what do you mean?

122
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,109
Go and tell your master…

123
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,824
that I will not marry a coward
who sent his servant to meet me

124
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,284
in his stead.

125
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,613
Forgive me, my lord.

126
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,365
Too many people were
in similar masks tonight.

127
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,422
Deok-su.

128
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,424
Where have you been?

129
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,053
Well, I…

130
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,389
These are yours, no?

131
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,226
I found them on the ground.

132
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,770
- Thanks.
- Gosh.

133
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,606
What have you been up to
that you are being so clumsy?

134
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,067
Tell me about it.

135
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,527
I should go. Night, Su-ra.

136
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:51,088
I cannot say,
for today is still yet to be over.

137
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,188
Forgive me.

138
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,608
Finally, it is the actual you.

139
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,153
Tomorrow,

140
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,781
our engagement will not happen.

141
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,660
How could I make up for your troubles?

142
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:28,125
This will humiliate my uncle and aunt,

143
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,210
so I am practically compensated already.

144
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:35,424
However, will you be able
to handle the repercussions?

145
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:42,347
I will handle the Minister of War
since I am responsible for this.

146
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,599
You…

147
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,227
may go wherever you please.

148
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:57,404
I will not express my gratitude.

149
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,367
Take care.

150
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,532
<i>Yeo, hui, hyang, wi,</i> and <i>bae</i>.

151
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,995
<i>Yeo, hyang, bae</i>.

152
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,124
<i>Hui, and wi</i>.

153
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,131
So there were five letters in total.

154
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,766
<i>The fake brass key</i>
<i>did not have any engraved letters.</i>

155
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,436
What could this mean, though?

156
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,984
They were engraved by your father.

157
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,568
Does nothing come to mind?

158
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,325
<i>Hyang, wi, bae</i>?

159
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,668
All clerks, get out of your rooms.

160
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,961
Assemble!

161
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,427
Lord Cheon is making his move.

162
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,346
Stay here. I will run interference.

163
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,597
No.

164
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,058
Let me go instead.

165
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,645
Fan out and search every room.

166
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,147
- Yes, my lord!
- Yes, my lord!

167
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,442
Search!

168
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,193
- Out.
- Leave the room.

169
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,070
- Get out!
- What?

170
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,534
- Move it!
- Stand over there.

171
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,537
Search thoroughly!

172
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,628
Should we be subjected to this mayhem
at this late hour?

173
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,506
My gosh. This is bad.

174
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,485
Attention.

175
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,738
The most unfortunate incident

176
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:48,283
took place
while guests were enjoying the banquet.

177
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,330
Yongcheonru was robbed by thieves.

178
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,249
Thieves? What were they after?

179
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,170
You will all cooperate
with tonight's random inspection.

180
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,518
Goodness, no. These are valuable books.

181
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,394
They are extremely rare.

182
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:22,025
Have you been reading these by yourself
without telling me?

183
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,443
You pervert.

184
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,153
You read them too, Myeong-ho--

185
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,912
I found a mask!

186
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,465
Everyone who attended the banquet
wore a mask.

187
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,219
Eun-ho, stop.

188
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,228
This is the place, so search thoroughly.

189
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,604
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

190
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,026
What on earth…

191
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,987
It was you, Hong Deok-su, was it not?

192
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,073
I do not follow.

193
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:13,451
The one in the mask who evaded the guards.

194
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,412
I am asking if it was you!

195
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,955
What…

196
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,373
What do you think you are doing?

197
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,584
Please let go of me.

198
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,393
Come with me, Hong Deok-su.

199
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,086
What is going on?
Why is Director Cho taking Hong Deok-su?

200
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,881
Eun-ho, do you know what is going on?

201
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,594
Nothing will happen to him.

202
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,894
Grand Proprietor Cheon knows
that I am Hong Jae-on.

203
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,480
What?

204
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:27,901
I am pretty sure he also knows
I possess a piece of the brass key.

205
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,406
It will be wiser for me
to make the first move.

206
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,701
This is the only way
to secure the brass key.

207
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,947
What is this about, Lord Cheon?

208
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,492
I have been robbed.

209
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,035
Pardon?

210
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,957
So that is why Director Cho…

211
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:34,551
That is the only item of my father's
that I have left.

212
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,222
I know.

213
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:43,768
Jae-on.

214
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,232
I have wronged you.

215
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,985
What do you mean?

216
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,532
This brass key, in fact,

217
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:00,368
is made up of two pieces
that combine to become one.

218
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:04,372
Your father entrusted me with one of them

219
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,250
and gave you the other piece
when you were a little girl.

220
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,337
But the thief who robbed me earlier

221
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,756
took the piece that I had.

222
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,549
I am sorry.

223
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,384
Pardon?

224
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,138
It was my intention to keep it safe

225
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,807
until I was able
to return it to you someday.

226
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:27,479
But unfortunately, I lost it
as soon as I was reunited with you.

227
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:33,151
I promise to apprehend this thief

228
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:35,236
and return it to you safely.

229
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,785
Do you have any idea
as to who the thief could be?

230
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,332
Who else could be after
what your father once possessed?

231
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,919
Of course, it must be Seol Mae-hwa.

232
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:57,258
You told me that yourself, Jae-on.

233
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:02,931
There is no need for you to worry.
I will take care of it.

234
00:28:58,611 --> 00:28:59,946
You out there.

235
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,072
Halt.

236
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,325
Yes, Lady Seol?

237
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:10,331
Rather than Muak Pass,
let's cross Ssari Pass.

238
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,834
Over Muak Pass
is the shortest way to Uiju.

239
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:19,966
I do not wish to pass roads
bustling with people.

240
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,509
As you wish, Lady Seol.

241
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,929
Make a turn. We will cross Ssari Pass.

242
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,982
Your Majesty, it is your bodyguard.

243
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,253
The engagement has been canceled?

244
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:01,174
Prince Muyeong canceled it himself?

245
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:04,260
The details are in the report,
Your Majesty.

246
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,894
Is there any other news?

247
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:16,439
Last night, a thief broke into
Grand Proprietor Cheon's residence.

248
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,236
- A thief?
- He must have lost something of value,

249
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,738
given Yongcheonru was searched all night.

250
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,699
However, he failed to apprehend the thief.

251
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,702
Is that so?

252
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,626
Prince Muyeong…

253
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,184
What on earth? Why is it so quiet?

254
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:57,772
Is it not the engagement today?

255
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:02,318
I mean, where are the flowers,
lanterns, and whatnot?

256
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,112
I am just as baffled.

257
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,866
Is Grand Proprietor Cheon being stingy?

258
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:12,871
This is all because
you are mellow and lack charisma.

259
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,706
My gosh.

260
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,417
I guess I am like that.

261
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,254
Should I assert my authority?

262
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:24,299
I am off to Dohwa Hall for a facial.

263
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:29,178
Make sure Do-gyeong
does not act out today.

264
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,722
Goodness me.

265
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,695
Do-gyeong.

266
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,575
She is not here.

267
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:51,826
What?

268
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,038
Lady Do-gyeong is gone,

269
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,582
and Prince Muyeong helped her run.

270
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,418
Prince Muyeong?

271
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,046
That brat.

272
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:08,176
It would have benefited us all
had they ended up married.

273
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,061
Is His Majesty also aware of this?

274
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:23,483
I am sure they secretly wanted
this marriage to be called off.

275
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,738
It will now be impossible

276
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:32,033
to stop Prince Muyeong
with such shortsighted schemes.

277
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,829
At this rate,

278
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:41,417
he will be the biggest obstacle
standing in Prince Seonyang's way.

279
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:49,050
He made an utter fool out of me.

280
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:54,347
Well, for that he will pay.

281
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,810
It was the same 12 years ago.

282
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:01,896
You put your foot down
for the sake of this nation.

283
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:07,735
It is time for you to make a decision
for the sake of this nation

284
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,863
and Prince Eunseong.

285
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:17,078
No one will benefit
from you dragging this out.

286
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:19,914
Your Majesty!

287
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,335
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

288
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,131
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

289
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,509
You already did it once.

290
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,845
Doing it again will not be a challenge.

291
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,349
In fact, it will be easier.

292
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:05,752
These are the clerks' quarters,
so it is off-limits.

293
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:08,504
If you are lost,
allow me to show you the way.

294
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,716
Are you Ko Su-ra?

295
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,010
Yes, that is me.

296
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:22,560
You have not paid the interest
since last month. We came to notify you.

297
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,732
Fail to pay it next month,

298
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,026
and he will pay a visit to Namhae.

299
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,030
Your mother and baby sister
are doing well, right?

300
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,865
Not them!

301
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,450
Of course they should stay safe.

302
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,120
Do you get my drift?

303
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,732
Su-ra, is something troubling you?

304
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,028
Of course not.

305
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,658
Prince Muyeong made us do
unnecessary work, that is all.

306
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:22,954
He had us throw a grand banquet
only to call off the engagement.

307
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:28,626
Tell me about it.
How will he handle the repercussions?

308
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:35,174
Nothing should be forced upon you
against your will.

309
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,843
Is Deok-su still not here?

310
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,178
He will be here soon.

311
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,764
Speak of the devil.

312
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:47,103
Are you all right? You seem pale.

313
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,481
What?

314
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,109
Well, I am all right.

315
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,694
Let us clean up.

316
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,608
Why do you keep following me around?

317
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,443
Clean up over there instead.

318
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,697
Are you suspecting me?

319
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,492
We are a pair, are we not? And roommates.

320
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,953
Anyway, pairs should stick together.

321
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,132
Tonight, we will search my old residence.

322
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,637
- The house you used to live in?
- Yes.

323
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:06,891
Now that we have the combined brass key,
we must find the safe.

324
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:08,684
No.

325
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,729
If the safe had been hidden there,

326
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,023
Lord Cheon would have found it already.

327
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,193
Even if it is not there,

328
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,695
we will at least find a clue.

329
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,449
We must always start
at where it all began.

330
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:27,995
Moving as a pair will only draw attention,
so meet me there at midnight.

331
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,249
Sure.

332
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,126
Now, get going.

333
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,304
You must have been a clerk for a year
to qualify for the loan.

334
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,601
Still, thank you for looking into it.

335
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:55,147
I will tell Grand Proprietor Cheon
and find another way.

336
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,024
It is all right.

337
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,413
An employee loan?

338
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:24,427
You must have money problems.

339
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,679
Why are your friends
not helping you with this?

340
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,475
Do not look glum.

341
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,895
You are not the only one
from a penniless family.

342
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:41,068
How much do you need?

343
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,161
Tell me.

344
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:53,581
I, Kim Myeong-ho, could give you a loan.

345
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,626
You could?

346
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,753
Of course.

347
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,342
Only if

348
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:08,512
you agree to crawl beneath me.

349
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,849
You want me to be one of your goons?

350
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,978
No, I meant it literally.

351
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,938
Crawl beneath me.

352
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:30,493
Crawl between my legs.

353
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,620
One nyang per lap.

354
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:35,831
What do you say?

355
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,584
You vile dog.

356
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:42,213
What? Did you just call me a dog?

357
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,470
Take care!

358
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,906
Did something happen
between you and Deok-su?

359
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:13,452
As in what?

360
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,204
You were together all day.

361
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:19,834
As you know, he is a friend
who requires attention.

362
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:23,963
"Friend"?

363
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,090
Maybe not "just a friend."

364
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:47,570
Did you break off your engagement
because of Hong Deok-su?

365
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,780
Your Highness?

366
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,452
Jun-hwa--

367
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,912
Yes, I have known all along.

368
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:03,586
How long are you going to stay
at Yongcheonru as someone else?

369
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,840
Is it not time
to return to your rightful position?

370
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:15,681
I, too, hid my identity
as Grand Proprietor Cheon's son…

371
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:22,271
so maybe we should call it even
and move on.

372
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,448
Nothing will change between us.

373
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,616
Then,

374
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,659
what about Hong Deok-su?

375
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,337
What is your reason for asking?

376
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,552
<i>I have feelings for this woman.</i>

377
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,055
I fell for her at first sight.

378
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:58,307
I have never felt this way
about anyone before.

379
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,187
The woman you harbor feelings for…

380
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,649
It is her.

381
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,570
Were you aware

382
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,406
that she was a woman?

383
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,576
Deok-su told me last night.

384
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:22,623
Deok-su told you herself?

385
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,675
So? Are you in love with her?

386
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,302
Why now, though?

387
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:40,224
You were not interested before,
but now that you know she is a woman…

388
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,478
you have developed feelings for her?

389
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,021
It is none of your business.

390
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,940
Does Deok-su know

391
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,901
that you are actually Prince Muyeong?

392
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:55,656
Return to your position
before she finds out.

393
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,825
- Enough.
- You live in a different world.

394
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,539
If you truly wish her happiness,

395
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:06,625
please let her go.

396
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:33,527
GEUMUI CHAMBER RESERVATION LOG

397
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,339
NAMHAE

398
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,820
Ko Su-ra of Namhae Guild.

399
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,199
Yes, my lord.

400
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,493
I heard about your family.

401
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:27,331
Namhae Guild,
known for its honesty and credibility,

402
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,293
cannot shut down like this.

403
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:38,592
I will help your guild.

404
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,263
Thank you, Lord Cheon.

405
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,224
In return, will you help me?

406
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:52,898
An unfortunate incident occurred
at Yongcheonru last night.

407
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:55,317
I heard the place was robbed.

408
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:58,487
Did you, by any chance,
see Hong Deok-su and Lee Eun-ho

409
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,657
on the night of the banquet?

410
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,761
Be as honest as I would expect
from one of the Namhae Guild.

411
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,703
You told me to be honest.

412
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,544
May I ask why you need my honesty?

413
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:40,422
Honesty?

414
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:44,885
Actually, I need the desperation of one
who was less fortunate growing up.

415
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,140
Do you not need money?

416
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,267
Desperately?

417
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:08,575
Jun-hwa was blessed
with the people in his life.

418
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:11,370
He befriended the right people.

419
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:18,043
Cheon Jun-hwa is my son.

420
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:24,424
He will one day own
and manage Yongcheonru,

421
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,469
but he is too softhearted.

422
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,017
Will you assist him by his side?

423
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:40,691
What makes him falter
and what makes him vulnerable.

424
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:45,237
All you have to do
is report everything to me in detail.

425
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,323
If I do,

426
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:52,411
will you pay me an amount
that will allow me

427
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,372
never to be humiliated again
for lacking money?

428
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,584
Yes.

429
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,794
I give you my word.

430
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:24,735
Even if you change course,
you cannot evade the blade.

431
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,324
Is it Grand Proprietor Cheon's order?

432
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:50,802
Kill her!

433
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:05,312
Did you know that Prince Muyeong
would call off the engagement?

434
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:09,816
There is no way
of reading everyone clearly.

435
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,236
All I did was put him to the test.

436
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,660
Stubborn and rigid.

437
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,455
It must be cut off.

438
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:30,921
See?

439
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,340
It is a masterpiece.

440
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:40,639
By trimming and tightening branches
that do not fall in line

441
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,850
and taking the time to tame them,

442
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:47,771
I have created a masterpiece
that is to my liking.

443
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,327
Would you like to try it?

444
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,666
Bigger trees are tough to control.

445
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,254
It is much easier

446
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,965
to tame

447
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:17,133
saplings.

448
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:22,722
His Majesty has a young son.

449
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:26,935
As in Prince Seonyang?

450
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,855
What about Prince Muyeong?

451
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,739
To make a new bonsai tree…

452
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:45,078
You must shatter the pot
it was originally in.

453
00:52:56,590 --> 00:53:00,802
That is how Prince Seonyang
will grow to be

454
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:04,389
your own little tree.

455
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,452
Prince Muyeong is not your friend.

456
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:27,287
Dump him.

457
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:58,652
Please allow me to have a few men, Father.

458
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,588
My goodness!

459
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:21,508
You and those facials.

460
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,010
Enough with them!

461
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,720
This is not the time for that.

462
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:29,474
What can I do
when they have already been done?

463
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:32,602
As if that is necessary
when the engagement has been canceled.

464
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:37,565
We should find Do-gyeong
and beat some sense into her!

465
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:40,068
My gosh, the humiliation!

466
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:43,530
Enough with that
and bring me my office robes.

467
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:44,906
Your office robes?

468
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:46,950
Are you heading to the palace?

469
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:51,204
I will go and grab the king by the collar

470
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,958
and get my answer.

471
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,211
A guest is waiting for you.

472
00:54:58,294 --> 00:55:00,672
- What? A guest?
- Yes, my lord.

473
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,842
Why are you here?

474
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:49,054
To see how we are doing
after the engagement was canceled?

475
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:53,266
I am to blame for everything.

476
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:58,313
Your niece did nothing wrong,
and I ask for your understanding.

477
00:55:58,396 --> 00:56:00,398
What are you playing at?

478
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:05,278
I will gather the meritorious subjects

479
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,739
and report this to His Majesty.

480
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:08,907
Minister!

481
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,745
Until when will you manipulate
the royal family?

482
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:17,248
Do not be disloyal
to His Majesty any further.

483
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,544
His Majesty had approved of
this engagement.

484
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,214
It started off as greed on your part.

485
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:26,007
Selling your niece out

486
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,009
for personal gain?

487
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:33,515
What… What has you acting this brazenly?

488
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:38,353
As my younger brother's
maternal grandfather,

489
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:40,730
I have tried to respect you.

490
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:41,856
However,

491
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:43,858
not anymore.

492
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:48,863
Have you lost your mind?

493
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:53,326
I will no longer overlook
your disloyalty and sins.

494
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:58,164
This is my warning,
so I suggest you heed my words.

495
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:02,961
I, Prince Muyeong,

496
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,296
shall be the next crown prince.

497
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,631
What?

498
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:10,760
Following my father's footsteps,
I will rectify the nation and royal court.

499
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:15,014
I order you to fall in line
as a loyal subject.

500
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,253
<i>Why now, though?</i>

501
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:49,424
<i>You were not interested before,</i>
<i>but now that you know she is a woman,</i>

502
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:51,217
you have developed feelings for her?

503
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,719
It is none of your business.

504
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,407
Flowers!

505
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,762
Is Eun-ho running late?

506
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:09,439
Who are you?

507
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,400
Who sent you?

508
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,588
<i>Yeo.</i>

509
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:35,882
<i>Hyang.</i>

510
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:38,259
<i>Bae.</i>

511
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,222
<i>Hui</i> and <i>wi</i> were on the other one.

512
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:50,480
<i>Yeo, hui, hyang, wi,</i> and <i>bae</i>.

513
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:56,944
What could that mean?

514
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:08,873
You lost track of him?

515
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:10,249
Forgive me, my lord.

516
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,972
Moving as a pair will only draw attention,

517
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:26,557
so meet me there at midnight.

518
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:21,404
These are…

519
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:30,747
Now, pick one.

520
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:11,788
Deok-su?

521
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:39,774
Deok-su…

522
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:44,862
No.

523
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:46,781
Deok-su.

524
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:48,783
No…

525
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:49,992
Eun-ho.

526
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:53,162
What took you so long?

527
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:57,083
- Deok-su!
- What…

528
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:58,751
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

529
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,670
What, this?

530
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:03,422
I am fine. It is only a minor cut.

531
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:07,301
Why is it…

532
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:11,472
that you drive me crazy like this?

533
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:18,020
I said I was fine.

534
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,814
What has your panties in a twist?

535
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:24,861
You are the one who made me worry
by running late.

536
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:37,582
Hey.

537
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,543
Eun-ho, are you all right?

538
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,379
Did something happen?

539
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:47,925
I am fine.

540
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:51,387
Nothing happened.

541
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,558
I do not buy that.

542
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:02,106
What is it? Did you think
I would run off with the brass key?

543
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:04,650
Do you think I am being like this
because of the key?

544
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:06,485
Then, why--

545
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,487
It is because of you, Hong Deok-su.

546
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,176
Eun-ho, watch out!

547
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:02,638
- <i>It will be over once we find the safe.</i>
- <i>It will all be over soon.</i>

548
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:04,557
I see you are quite strong, Deok-su.

549
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,809
I am the manly Hong Deok-su.

550
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:08,644
As if.

551
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:13,232
<i>Whether you are Hong Deok-su</i>
<i>or Hong Jae-on,</i>

552
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:16,610
<i>you are the only one</i>
<i>I will hold in my heart.</i>

553
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:17,820
Likewise.

554
01:09:17,903 --> 01:09:20,531
I will protect you no matter what.

555
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,867
I will not let him steal her from me.

556
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:25,494
<i>Hong Jae-on has always been meant</i>

557
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:26,871
to be yours, Jun-hwa.

558
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:28,664
Hong Jae-on. Let us go.

559
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:29,999
<i>I will get it back.</i>

560
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,626
You will…

561
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:33,794
approve!

562
01:09:35,045 --> 01:09:38,215
<i>He kicked a mad dog fixated</i>
<i>on making his grandson the crown prince.</i>

563
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:40,634
<i>All that is left is for him to be bitten.</i>

564
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:43,846
Deok-su!

565
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:46,724
Eun-ho, let go of that hand.

566
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:50,394
<i>Do you not realize</i>
<i>that this could endanger Deok-su?</i>

567
01:09:50,477 --> 01:09:51,770
<i>I shall protect my person.</i>

568
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:55,357
