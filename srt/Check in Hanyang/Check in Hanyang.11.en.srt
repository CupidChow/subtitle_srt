00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,840
TAVERN

5
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,266
We brought some medicinal herbs.

6
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,728
Thank you for all your help
these past few days.

7
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,690
Is he still in there?

8
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:35,864
Yes…

9
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,412
Hong Deok-su.
You should have some porridge, at least.

10
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,333
Wait. You should just let him be for now.

11
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,794
I will make sure he eats some later.

12
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,107
Get up.

13
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,778
Get up, Hong Deok-su.

14
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,370
Are you just going to give up?
Will you just wait for death to come?

15
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,960
It is my fault.

16
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,508
It is all my fault.

17
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,553
Beating yourself up
will not change anything.

18
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,806
Pull yourself together, Hong Deok-su!

19
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,309
Just…

20
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,312
Just let me be.

21
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,650
Just let me…

22
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,289
What are you doing?

23
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,377
Stop.

24
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,338
Don't…

25
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,097
Mother!

26
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,433
She is gone.

27
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,908
Deok-su.

28
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,829
You need to let her go now.

29
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,790
That is what she would want too.

30
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,691
Mother…

31
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,779
Mother!

32
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,050
<i>Whose son are you?</i>

33
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,301
<i>Mommy's!</i>

34
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,343
<i>That is right.</i>

35
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,704
Mother!

36
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,626
Will I be able to live without her?

37
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,298
What do I do now?

38
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,971
My mother is gone…

39
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,766
and I am all alone.

40
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,768
You are not alone.

41
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,691
You have us.

42
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,988
Everyone is waiting for you.

43
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,116
Come back now.

44
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:05,526
I am not who you need to get revenge on.

45
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,571
The one who chased you to kill you.

46
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,951
It is the Grand Proprietor of Yongcheonru.

47
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,646
My father…

48
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,609
How did he pass away?

49
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:54,283
This all started
with the Grand Proprietor's ledger.

50
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,207
12 YEARS AGO

51
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:11,717
OH YEONG-RAK TRIBUTE PAYMENTS
LEE HYEON-WI TRIBUTE PAYMENTS

52
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,682
It is an exorbitant amount of money.

53
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,937
I said power is no different from a blade.

54
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,940
Do not worry.

55
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:29,068
I promise you that the profits will be
100, even 1,000 times that.

56
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,362
I worry this may put you in danger too.

57
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,572
Min-sik.

58
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,367
I am the Cheon Mak-dong.
Do you not trust me?

59
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:41,998
Hold on.

60
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,793
Let us add this as well.

61
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:46,961
What is this?

62
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,339
That will be our lifeline.

63
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,635
I am doing all this for us--

64
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,972
What are you talking about?

65
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,266
Do you remember?

66
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,811
When everyone in the market
refused to do business with me,

67
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:06,606
you were the first to give me a chance.

68
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,443
Now, the time has come
for me to give you one.

69
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:17,908
I, Cheon Mak-dong, am your friend.
Have some faith in me.

70
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,661
Why are you doing this?

71
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,748
I am merely trying to trample
on those who looked down on me

72
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:29,253
and dismissed me for my lowly origins
to climb up that ladder.

73
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,426
The world will be turned
upside down tomorrow.

74
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,428
What in the world have you been up to?

75
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,348
Lord Hong.

76
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,477
We received all of the supplies
for this month.

77
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,103
How long have you been there?

78
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,481
My apologies.

79
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,234
Look.

80
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,614
We will talk later.

81
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,300
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

82
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,843
Your Majesty!

83
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,262
Brother!

84
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,766
His Majesty has passed away.

85
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,767
What?

86
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,353
The state funeral bureau
has already been established.

87
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,441
The world will be turned
upside down tomorrow.

88
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,789
Physician Lee Sang-yong.

89
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,917
Court Lady Jeong Seo-i.

90
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,680
OH YEONG-RAK TRIBUTE PAYMENTS
LEE HYEON-WI TRIBUTE PAYMENTS

91
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,100
Cheon Mak-dong…

92
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,147
The late king's death?

93
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:17,027
The ledger contains
not only a record of his tribute payments

94
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,238
but all the secrets
about the late king's death.

95
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:27,288
So my father died because of that ledger?

96
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:32,585
Your father's hidden chest
contains Lord Cheon's ledger.

97
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:39,800
And that chest can only be opened
with both halves of the brass key.

98
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,385
Nothing else.

99
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,441
This is a key…

100
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,777
to that chest?

101
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:07,536
One half of the key
ended up in Lord Cheon's hands that day,

102
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,124
and the other disappeared with you.

103
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:28,807
So, Lord Cheon is after this key, not me.

104
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,312
That ledger is their biggest weakness.

105
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,650
Once it sees the light of day,

106
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:42,196
it could be wielded to bring down
those who were behind the insurrection,

107
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,491
the Minister of War, Lord Cheon,
and even the sitting king.

108
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,202
It will be a dangerous weapon.

109
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:55,751
And the one who gets their hands
on the ledger will wield that power.

110
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:01,840
Lord Cheon already knows
that you are Hong Jae-on.

111
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,761
So you must flee while you still can.

112
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,265
No.

113
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,647
I cannot do that.

114
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:21,652
I will reclaim the other half
of this brass key from Lord Cheon.

115
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:25,656
Let the souls of the past
deal with the bygone vengeance.

116
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,992
My mother was wrongfully taken from me.

117
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,370
I must…

118
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,790
avenge her.

119
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,169
I will return to Yongcheonru.

120
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,431
<i>My revenge…</i>

121
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,143
<i>has just begun.</i>

122
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,356
My mother…

123
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,028
was murdered.

124
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,487
Murdered?

125
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:07,781
By whom?

126
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:16,832
Someone stabbed my father to death
12 years ago.

127
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,255
And now my foster mother.

128
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,592
Who…

129
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,053
Seol Mae-hwa.

130
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,182
It was Lady Seol Mae-hwa.

131
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,142
That means…

132
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,062
your father is…

133
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:42,983
Min-sik of the Hong family.

134
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,780
He was my father.

135
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,992
Are you his…

136
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,620
Yes, I am…

137
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,638
Hong Jae-on.

138
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,521
I cannot believe this…

139
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,172
I was…

140
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,801
your father's…

141
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,682
I was Hong Min-sik's closest friend.

142
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,228
Hong Jae-on.

143
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,152
After what happened 12 years ago,

144
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,115
I have been desperately looking for you.

145
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,368
Finally, everything has returned

146
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,204
to its rightful place.

147
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,973
Jae-on.

148
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,226
Let me help you now.

149
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:48,484
You must never forgive the enemy
who murdered your father.

150
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,210
Lord Cheon does not trust anyone.

151
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,337
He will attempt to test our relationship.

152
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,090
<i>I will make him trust me.</i>

153
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,092
<i>Without a shred of doubt.</i>

154
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,226
But…

155
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:29,024
how did you find out
that it was Seol Mae-hwa?

156
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,403
I witnessed it myself.

157
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,697
- You witnessed it?
- Yes.

158
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,202
After I saw her stab my father,

159
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:42,955
I ran away.

160
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,374
I see.

161
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,174
Seol Mae-hwa.

162
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,718
Seol Mae-hwa…

163
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,265
I will never forgive her.

164
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,936
I will…

165
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,692
make her pay, no matter what.

166
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,706
You went through a horrific ordeal
at such a young age.

167
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,209
If only you had come to me sooner…

168
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,467
By the time I heard
about what happened to you all,

169
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,137
it was already too late.

170
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,516
Having someone I can lean on
is more than enough for me.

171
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,645
Seol Mae-hwa could not have acted alone.
There must be someone else behind it.

172
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,984
Is there anything else you remember?

173
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,362
Perhaps, something he said
to you in passing

174
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,490
or an acquaintance of his?

175
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:07,748
My father only ever allowed
Seol Mae-hwa to enter our home.

176
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,210
I see.

177
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,630
Let us be patient
until we find the mastermind.

178
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,174
Jae-on.

179
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,385
I will share in your endeavors now.

180
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,348
You must discuss
all further pursuits with me first.

181
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,349
Do you understand?

182
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,227
Yes, my lord.

183
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,688
I am…

184
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,947
truly grateful.

185
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,724
Hong Min-sik!

186
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,946
Seol Mae-hwa, you wench!

187
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,948
How dare you betray me!

188
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,082
Where did you hide the safe chest?

189
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:38,922
Is that all you have to say
to your old friend?

190
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:42,926
Hand it over.

191
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,637
Hand it over right now!

192
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,140
What is this?
What does this inscription mean?

193
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,897
Do you think I will not be able to find it
if you do not tell me?

194
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,233
Hey, Cheon Mak-dong.

195
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,944
It is all over for you now.

196
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,362
You are wrong!

197
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,949
It is not over yet!

198
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:09,911
I, Cheon Mak-dong…

199
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:18,420
will climb up higher than the royal throne
with my gold

200
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:23,425
until my influence reaches the heavens!

201
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:37,689
Watch me from your grave
and see if I am wrong.

202
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:48,825
FOR JOY

203
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:54,581
Are you not curious
about what choice your daughter will make?

204
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,377
I am sure

205
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,464
she will prove me right.

206
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,043
Su-ra?

207
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,088
What is all this?

208
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,386
You are finally here.
The meat is about to grow cold.

209
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,428
Jun-hwa?

210
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,182
Jun-hwa made everything.

211
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,309
Come now. Sit down first.

212
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:03,233
Wait… You made all this?

213
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:07,195
It was only for one day,
but your mother taught me herself.

214
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,081
Now… Have a taste.

215
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,458
Although I am certain
I have a long way to go.

216
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,649
You should have taken more time off.
You did not need to rush back.

217
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,736
I…

218
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,281
I want to thank you for back then.

219
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,534
It was quite reassuring

220
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,872
to have you all there
as I laid my mother to rest.

221
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,999
Hey, that is what friends are for.

222
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:06,296
Ever since Elementary Room, we have been
the disagreeable quartet.

223
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:07,756
Right.

224
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,843
But where is Eun-ho?

225
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,555
I do not know.
I have not seen him all day.

226
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,099
Eat up.

227
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:22,145
Gosh. This just melts in your mouth.

228
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,190
This tastes superb. Well done, Jun-hwa.

229
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,025
What did I tell you?

230
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:30,487
There is nothing better
than Korea Pork for an energy boost.

231
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,744
It is really good.

232
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,998
It reminds me of my mother.

233
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,069
It is time for you to leave Yongcheonru.

234
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:17,701
But, Your Majesty,
I am close to achieving my objective.

235
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,494
If I could just have--

236
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:25,500
The Minister of War has requested
you become engaged to his niece.

237
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,753
Engaged?

238
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:32,132
Has he threatened you again?

239
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,553
He was not looking to threaten me.

240
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:40,348
He has your dragon-engraved sword
in his possession.

241
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,977
My sword…

242
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,897
<i>I shall see</i>
<i>the murder investigation through</i>

243
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,400
to catch the culprit.

244
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,778
He fabricated that incident
to spread slander.

245
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,989
Your Majesty is already aware of that.

246
00:26:56,072 --> 00:27:01,286
The truth is meaningless to them.

247
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:06,750
Even 12 years ago,
they shamelessly brought such a calamity.

248
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:15,633
What exactly happened 12 years ago?

249
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:21,473
Just what caused you
so much distress, Your Majesty?

250
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,314
The Minister and Grand Proprietor, Cheon…

251
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,986
assassinated the late king.

252
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,743
Are you saying…

253
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,081
they committed regicide?

254
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:52,837
Why did you not eradicate
such treasonous individuals immediately?

255
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,172
I could not.

256
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:58,426
I had no evidence of their treason.

257
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,431
Your Majesty!

258
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,851
Your Majesty!

259
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,022
Your Majesty!

260
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:16,319
Your Majesty!

261
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,405
Your Majesty!

262
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:24,577
Then… were you looking
for the brass key to prove…

263
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,290
The late king's assassination.

264
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:38,299
Before Hong Min-sik, the grand
proprietor's business partner,

265
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,676
was murdered,

266
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:43,138
he hid that ledger in his safe.

267
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,934
If I only had that back then…

268
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,688
So that is why Hong Min-sik was killed.

269
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,441
The Minister of War is a sly wolf.

270
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,903
He will do anything
to ensure Prince Seonyang

271
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:00,864
ascends to the throne.

272
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:01,948
Father--

273
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:04,784
With the Grand Proprietor by his side…

274
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,249
I cannot risk your safety as well.

275
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,425
I will…

276
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,929
bring all those traitors to justice.

277
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:31,144
Let him proceed
with the engagement banquet.

278
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:35,648
I will take care of the rest.

279
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,416
A royal engagement will soon be held
at Yehwa Hall.

280
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:58,213
Yongcheonru is to host a royal engagement?

281
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:02,884
The Minister of War's niece is
to be engaged to Prince Muyeong.

282
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,303
As in Lee Eun-ho?

283
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,432
Did he agree to it without objection?

284
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,894
A royal marriage is nothing but politics.

285
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:16,064
How he feels is of little importance.

286
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,447
I assume Prince Muyeong
will proceed accordingly.

287
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,324
I am not sure.

288
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,618
Let us see what he does.

289
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:34,541
If the battle between the Minister
and Prince Muyeong

290
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,502
leads to fatal wounds,
it will be even better for us.

291
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,088
It shall be an amusing spectacle.

292
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,507
Lord Cheon. It is Mae-hwa.

293
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,900
ACCOUNTING LEDGER

294
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,449
Is that you, Lady Seol?

295
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:51,970
I came to give you the budget report
for the Minister's royal engagement.

296
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:06,651
I have already asked the Director
of Hospitality to oversee that.

297
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,534
Hong Jae-on has returned.

298
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:16,828
Hong Jae-on?

299
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,127
Are you still feigning ignorance?

300
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,174
Why did you not tell me

301
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:33,386
that Hong Deok-su is
Hong Min-sik's daughter?

302
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:47,567
I chose not to because she remains
in the dark about that incident.

303
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:02,874
She told me that she witnessed
you killing her father.

304
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:12,008
She seems to believe I am
her father's friend and is relying on me.

305
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,678
It leaves me no choice but to help her.

306
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,351
The Uiju Guild has been
full of complaints recently.

307
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:26,064
Go and stay with them for the time being.

308
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:30,526
Surely, seeing Jae-on must be
uncomfortable for you as well.

309
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,163
Do you have something else to say?

310
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,618
You are doing well, Myeong-ho.

311
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,081
Myeong-ho, did you hear?

312
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:28,543
Yongcheonru is to host
a royal engagement ceremony

313
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:29,752
for the Minister of War.

314
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:36,134
How could I not know
when it involves the royal family?

315
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:40,096
I have already sent word to Uiju.

316
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,350
It is high time for Uiju
to make a royal connection.

317
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:45,768
He is right.

318
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,354
After the late king passed 12 years ago,

319
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,857
Yongcheonru swiftly made
that royal connection

320
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,400
to grow to what it is today.

321
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,530
Watch what you say.

322
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,659
<i>The late king's death?</i>

323
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:05,079
The ledger contains
not only a record of his tribute payments

324
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,624
but all the secrets
about the late king's death.

325
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,353
Hey…

326
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:33,441
You came back pretty late last night.
Are you heading out again?

327
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,944
I am taking time off
to deal with family matters.

328
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:44,493
Why are you back to work already?
You should have taken a few more days off.

329
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,163
I am back. What else would I be doing?

330
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,957
Oh, right. Hey, did you hear the news?

331
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,460
A prince is coming to Yongcheonru.

332
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,504
What?

333
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,507
Do you remember
the guest we dealt with at Jakyakjae?

334
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,176
We went to the lake with her.

335
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,930
She is to be engaged
to His Majesty's elder son

336
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,849
at Yehwa Hall.
Everyone is in a frenzy about it.

337
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:16,692
That royal engagement will not happen.

338
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,446
What do you mean?

339
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,699
Do you know something?

340
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,125
Well… I hear Prince Muyeong is

341
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,213
quite picky and a perfectionist.

342
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,674
Finding him a spouse will be difficult.
That is what I meant.

343
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,221
Hold on.

344
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,765
By chance…

345
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:51,560
Prince Muyeong…

346
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,941
Do you know him personally?

347
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,073
I also know him.

348
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,413
Did you not know?
I know His Majesty as well.

349
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,001
And so does everyone in the country.

350
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,550
I have only myself to blame
for taking you seriously.

351
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,011
Unbelievable.

352
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,097
Wait, Eun-ho.

353
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:29,932
What?

354
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:32,977
Earlier when you…

355
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,147
Thanks.

356
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:53,873
Should I go?

357
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,792
I should. I am off.

358
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,471
Prince Muyeong
and the Minister of War's niece are

359
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,972
to be engaged?

360
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:14,518
And you are to oversee the royal event?

361
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:23,778
The Grand Proprietor has
finally acknowledged my abilities.

362
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,614
Acknowledged your abilities?

363
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:31,035
It seems Lord Cheon is making a mistake.

364
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,915
I am sure he has his reasons.

365
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,459
He must have sent Lady Seol to Uiju
for a good reason.

366
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,711
Oh, that? That was a demotion.

367
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,841
I have an in with them.

368
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,804
When I asked the guild about it,
they thought she was already fired.

369
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,473
As long as this engagement goes well,

370
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,142
I will be the innkeeper.

371
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:03,109
When the moth gets too close to the flame,

372
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,403
it burns to death.

373
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,321
Keep a safe distance.

374
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,324
Do not get too close.

375
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,909
Rude…

376
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,389
I have decided to send
Seol Mae-hwa to Uiju.

377
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:35,683
Pardon?

378
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,978
You should not serve revenge in one go.

379
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:42,731
Rushing will only give them a pretext
and may lead to repercussions.

380
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:46,444
You must take your time
to drain your enemy's energy

381
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,155
and slowly suffocate them.

382
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:59,039
What is the matter?
Do you find my decision disagreeable?

383
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,668
No, my lord.

384
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,052
I will make him trust me.

385
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,555
Without a shred of doubt.

386
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,643
By his side,

387
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,856
I will bide my time,
waiting for a chance to take the key.

388
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:32,114
I heard there would be
a royal engagement banquet at Yongcheonru.

389
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:36,827
By chance, may I assist in any way?

390
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,748
It is the Minister and the royal family.

391
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:45,002
I am well aware
of what this means to you, my lord.

392
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,339
So?

393
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,260
Let me be of service to you, my lord.

394
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,934
Hong Jae-on.

395
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,605
The more I see you,
the more I see myself in you.

396
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:10,945
Before all that,

397
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,365
you should pay Seol Mae-hwa a visit.

398
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,744
Go and retrieve the seal from her.

399
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:23,249
That way, she will know
that you have my support.

400
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:26,961
Yes, my lord.

401
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,058
Follow him.

402
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,337
I am here for your seal.

403
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:18,721
Why are you here?
If anything, a director should be here.

404
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:25,185
Are you fleeing because of me?

405
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:31,317
You can look forward
to the royal engagement ceremony.

406
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:38,157
That day, I will obtain what I desire.

407
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,492
It will not take long.

408
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:49,209
I am sure you believe
everything will go your way now.

409
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,836
I was just as foolish in the past.

410
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,964
You should be aware of the dangers ahead.

411
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,633
Just hand over the seal!

412
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:34,672
My goodness.

413
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:40,094
To what do I owe this pleasant surprise?

414
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,012
Please come in.

415
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,431
I am here to confirm something.

416
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:49,770
You did not need to come all this way.
We will meet at Yongcheonru soon anyway.

417
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,568
<i>Listen to me carefully.</i>
<i>There is a lot to be done.</i>

418
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,363
You must find my royal sword
at the Minister's residence.

419
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:03,617
While I keep him distracted
and stall for time,

420
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,120
you shall search and retrieve the sword.

421
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,332
We should go inside
and continue this conversation.

422
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,628
Will you walk with me?

423
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,777
My engagement banquet must be grand.

424
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,282
You are a minister,
and this is a royal event.

425
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:47,453
Yes, I suppose so.

426
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,122
Since Lord Cheon is to fund it,

427
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:52,749
let him put on
an ostentatious display of wealth.

428
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:56,545
Yes, I understand. Why do we not
go inside and discuss further?

429
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,172
A celebration!

430
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,052
It must be a grand celebration.

431
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,430
It must be extraordinary.

432
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,102
I thought you appreciated modesty.

433
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:39,838
Squawk!

434
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:46,470
Bird. A parrot.

435
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,641
I hear the bride-to-be has a pet parrot.

436
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,059
Yes.

437
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:55,145
Let her know I will not condone
such frivolous hobbies.

438
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,235
Just now, you stated
you wanted an ostentatious display.

439
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,823
Do you not feel bad for that poor bird?

440
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,371
Sure…

441
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:13,956
I will make sure

442
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,917
that she observes all her duties.

443
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,545
Unaware of the Three Obediences?

444
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,463
How could I not?

445
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:24,633
As a child, you obey your father.

446
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,718
As an adult, you obey your husband…

447
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,095
That is right.

448
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:32,182
I will send a letter that outlines
the details to Yongcheonru.

449
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,894
When every requirement is satisfied…

450
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:52,286
Then, I shall happily go ahead
with the engagement ceremony.

451
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,456
That is all I have to say.
I shall now take my leave.

452
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:05,966
What is with him?

453
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,073
<i>It has been a while.</i>

454
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:33,410
You look to be enjoying yourself
in your official uniform.

455
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:35,078
You know that was all thanks to me.

456
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,205
Yes, my lady.

457
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:39,958
Did your Onyang trip go well?

458
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:44,046
After throwing a fit
and sending me all the way there,

459
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,423
my uncle managed
to finalize a royal engagement.

460
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:50,761
I will be serving you
until the royal engagement.

461
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:56,016
At least, I will be able to breathe now…

462
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:06,401
We are busy enough as it is,
but now there is even a festival?

463
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:11,490
The future monarch
should not abuse his powers so.

464
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:14,868
- Prince Muyeong?
- Yes. Him.

465
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,329
He seems to be unreasonably particular.

466
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:20,832
He gave strictest orders
not to let anyone near his room.

467
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,587
Maybe he does not wish to be engaged…

468
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:27,255
What?

469
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,176
Maybe he is just looking

470
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:33,845
for any excuse to run
because he is being forced into it?

471
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,226
We cannot let him do that.

472
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:02,499
You asked to see me?

473
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,920
I should at least offer you my praise

474
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,464
to thank you for all your hard work.

475
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:15,011
I am simply honored
to have this chance to serve you.

476
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,348
I was able to make
my decision thanks to you.

477
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,018
What would you say

478
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:25,355
to also hosting…

479
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,569
my crown prince appointment?

480
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,658
You and the Minister are not a good fit.

481
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:39,119
Choose to stand behind me instead.

482
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,043
My goodness.

483
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,422
I am deeply honored, Your Highness.

484
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,412
How will you proceed now?

485
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:27,834
Beom-ho,

486
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,587
you shall stay here as Prince Muyeong.

487
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,838
Pardon?

488
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,674
Until the engagement ceremony?

489
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:35,801
In the meantime…

490
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:39,888
I will search for Lord Cheon's brass key.

491
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,059
I will find it

492
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,978
and resolve this matter myself.

493
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:50,690
I will alleviate Father's suffering

494
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:53,777
and dispel the palace's concerns.

495
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,788
I am here with your refreshments.

496
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:11,962
What is he doing here?

497
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,547
Is that not Hong Deok-su?

498
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,217
You go. Hurry!

499
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,345
He knows my face.

500
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:21,930
- He does.
- Yes.

501
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:24,266
Then, what are we to do?

502
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:25,517
Figure it out!

503
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,977
May I come in?

504
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:40,407
You cannot open that door. Good luck.

505
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,411
How could you just abandon me like this?

506
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,127
How shall I proceed?

507
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,008
Leave it there and go.

508
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,761
The tea will grow cold.

509
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,722
What a nuisance you are!

510
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:06,433
Must I have you flogged for you to listen?

511
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:48,767
What the…

512
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:50,977
Prince Muyeong?

513
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:59,361
Where are you haphazardly rushing off to?

514
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,032
Did you…

515
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:06,952
Did you see Prince Muyeong?

516
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,121
Prince Muyeong?

517
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,548
Your hat is crooked. Let me fix it.

518
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:22,300
Do not touch me!

519
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:25,595
Good now?

520
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,057
What was that about?

521
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,396
Are you back to work now?

522
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:46,282
Jeez… Prince Muyeong is such a nuisance.

523
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:50,370
He is not a bad person.

524
00:54:58,503 --> 00:54:59,629
How would you know?

525
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,800
Why do you keep taking his side?

526
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:07,220
Everyone has their reasons
for what they do.

527
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:11,599
You should not assume and resort
to slander without knowing.

528
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:16,438
You have a point.

529
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:19,858
That is why I went over there earlier
to find out more.

530
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:21,151
But…

531
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:22,861
He refused to see me.

532
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,951
Maybe his face looks like…

533
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:38,168
a brick that fell out of the sky?

534
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:42,922
That is not true!
He is not half bad-looking. I hear.

535
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:45,300
No…

536
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:47,510
He must either be a reclusive eccentric

537
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,055
or possess a major character defect.

538
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:54,559
He just ran away
when I kept calling for him.

539
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:55,518
So…

540
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,313
Did you get to see his face?

541
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:01,649
Well, just a bit of his backside.

542
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,403
But you know… quite the physique.

543
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:07,489
Really?

544
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:09,324
But then,

545
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:13,161
that body was made
with swordsmanship training, after all.

546
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:19,167
I just pray that he stays put

547
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:22,378
until the engagement ceremony.

548
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:24,881
You know what?

549
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:28,843
I should keep my eyes peeled
and on him at all times.

550
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:33,973
Deok-su.

551
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:38,269
Why are you working so hard
to make this happen?

552
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,483
It is an important day.

553
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,445
That day is important to you as well?

554
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:54,077
I will make sure it is
the grandest celebration

555
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:57,038
that garners everyone's attention.

556
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,125
That day…

557
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,045
must be so.

558
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:19,936
The grandest day…

559
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,690
Too bad I will not be there.

560
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:27,902
Where will you be?

561
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:34,325
Unfortunately, I have to attend
to some important business that day.

562
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,623
Deok-su.

563
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:45,044
I hope your wishes come true.

564
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,314
BY THE END OF THIS MONTH…

565
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:09,736
My salary will not even
cover the interest payment.

566
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:13,448
You received a letter?

567
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,326
From home?

568
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:18,870
It is nothing.

569
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:26,669
You look terrible. Are you sick?

570
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:33,343
Su-ra, can you help me?

571
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:36,095
With Deok-su?

572
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,766
You are the only one I can trust.

573
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,353
- First…
- First?

574
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,397
Tell her you know she is a maiden.

575
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:50,652
Apologize for not telling her sooner.
That should happen first.

576
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:52,820
Okay. And then?

577
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:59,911
Jun-hwa, you really do have
feelings for her.

578
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:08,044
Then, you need to be ready
for rejection as well. Will you be okay?

579
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:12,423
I am prepared for as much.

580
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:23,685
Go on, Su-ra.

581
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:25,186
Slow down.

582
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,111
A masquerade?

583
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:35,697
He is just a nuisance all around.

584
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,826
I agree. He is quite an unusual character.

585
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:42,662
Do you not agree?

586
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,998
I am sure he has his reasons.

587
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:47,542
Let us hurry up.

588
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,669
- Hurry. Let us go.
- Okay.

589
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:53,923
Excuse us! Here are the masks!

590
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:56,634
Over there is fine.

591
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:57,802
Well done.

592
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:05,268
There.

593
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:06,936
My goodness…

594
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,479
Make your choice.

595
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:12,942
Do I look handsome?

596
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:28,625
What is this?

597
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,835
It is called the Knot of One Heart.

598
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:34,589
It is all the rage
with young lovers across Hanyang.

599
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:41,220
You tie it onto your lover's wrist.

600
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,165
Jun-hwa!

601
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:14,671
You asked for me?

602
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:17,507
What do you need to say?

603
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,884
Well…

604
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:23,680
I thought you could use a break
from all the event preparations.

605
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:25,556
Seriously?

606
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:30,520
Then, maybe a short break.

607
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,941
I was getting tired anyway.

608
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:38,069
Gosh.

609
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:48,871
Look. Eun-ho and Su-ra are coming as well.

610
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,540
Hey!

611
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,125
Hey.

612
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:57,588
Oh, no! I totally forgot.

613
01:01:57,672 --> 01:01:59,173
Did you leave something behind?

614
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:05,471
We should have checked
on the masks for the clerks.

615
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:06,556
What is going on?

616
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:08,891
Please help me.

617
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:16,357
Just help me out.

618
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,152
- But you can--
- Let us go.

619
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:22,530
Let us go.

620
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,908
Maybe they forgot something?
Why are they going back?

621
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:26,826
I almost forgot.

622
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:31,372
- This is for you.
- What?

623
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:33,791
What is this?

624
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:37,712
What?

625
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:40,673
Where did you get this pumpkin taffy from?

626
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:43,384
I was craving sweets.

627
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:48,222
That is so tasty.

628
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,145
Deok-su.

629
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:55,313
Yes?

630
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:59,692
Well… Deok-su…

631
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:01,652
What?

632
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:03,780
Go on.

633
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:12,246
I need to apologize to you for something.
You will forgive me, will you not?

634
01:03:13,664 --> 01:03:15,374
Do not be silly. We are friends.

635
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:23,257
I have known that you are a maiden.

636
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,678
For a long while now.

637
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,394
I am sorry for taking so long to tell you.

638
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:43,945
Since…

639
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:46,656
Since when?

640
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:49,450
How did you find out?

641
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:55,748
I do not know why you are hiding it,

642
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,836
but let me know if you need help.

643
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:06,092
Wait, is that why you…

644
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,430
It is called the Knot of One Heart.

645
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:17,228
They say it can even bring together
the earth and the heavens.

646
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:30,575
Can I stop being your friend
and become Cheon Jun-hwa, your man?

647
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:49,468
Jun-hwa, I am sorry, but…

648
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:54,724
You do not have to give me an answer now.

649
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,560
Just please think it over.

650
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:04,734
I will head back now.
You should rest some more.

651
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:39,560
Eyes on the prize, Hong Deok-su.

652
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:42,480
Today is the day.

653
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:30,820
Here you go.

654
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:33,990
As if things could not get worse…

655
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:36,117
Now, I have to attend a masquerade.

656
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:40,913
What a royal nuisance this prince is.

657
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,124
Why? You look great.

658
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:46,252
You are coming, right?

659
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:49,380
Come on now.
I cannot be by your side all night.

660
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,383
I will sneak off when I get the chance to.

661
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:54,927
You should try to strike up
a conversation with him.

662
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:06,439
We should go now.

663
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:28,354
Prince Muyeong is
the one wearing the nobleman mask.

664
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,773
We prepared that mask for him.

665
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:33,526
His physique is not bad.

666
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,583
You should go and say hello
when he is alone.

667
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:32,459
Shall I?

668
01:09:33,377 --> 01:09:35,379
I shall grab some refreshments.

669
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:07,906
Tell me what you want.

670
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:10,743
Why did you not just stab me?

671
01:12:12,786 --> 01:12:16,665
You must have stopped
because you want something.

672
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:48,113
I only have one half of it.

673
01:12:48,822 --> 01:12:50,616
What will you do with just half?

674
01:13:17,309 --> 01:13:18,143
Here you go.

675
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,042
<i>Who are you really?</i>

676
01:15:05,125 --> 01:15:06,919
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

677
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:08,337
<i>That was originally mine.</i>

678
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:10,881
<i>I also need the brass key.</i>

679
01:15:10,964 --> 01:15:13,175
So that's why you approached me.

680
01:15:13,258 --> 01:15:15,636
<i>Did something happen</i>
<i>between you and Deok-su?</i>

681
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:17,554
<i>He is a friend who requires attention.</i>

682
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:19,681
<i>Maybe not "just a friend."</i>

683
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:22,893
<i>Did you break off your engagement</i>
<i>because of Hong Deok-su?</i>

684
01:15:22,976 --> 01:15:24,186
Your Highness.

685
01:15:25,145 --> 01:15:26,480
Are you in love with her?

686
01:15:26,563 --> 01:15:28,690
- That is enough.
- We live in different worlds.

687
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:31,860
If you truly wish her happiness,
please let her go.

688
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:35,239
I, Prince Muyeong, shall be
the next crown prince.

689
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:36,490
What?

690
01:15:36,573 --> 01:15:38,909
<i>You must shatter it.</i>

691
01:15:38,992 --> 01:15:41,537
<i>Please allow me to have a few men, Father.</i>

692
01:15:42,996 --> 01:15:44,540
Are you not responsible?

693
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:46,500
Please let go of me…

694
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:51,088
<i>If, by chance, something happens</i>

695
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:54,758
<i>to Hong Deok-su while I am gone…</i>

696
01:15:56,927 --> 01:15:59,137
<i>please keep her safe on my behalf.</i>

697
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:03,809
Deok-su.
