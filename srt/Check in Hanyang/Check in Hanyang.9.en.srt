00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,710
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,128
FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,030
Hold on.

4
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,556
You taught me a long time ago…

5
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,017
that to win,

6
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,896
one should switch to a game
they are better at.

7
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,114
Today, I finally…

8
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,784
realized what you meant.

9
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,422
Jae-on.

10
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,592
Do not utter my name with that vile mouth.

11
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:59,178
You can stop now.

12
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,058
Whatever you want to do,
if you do not stop,

13
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,727
you will be in greater danger.

14
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,564
Go far away from Yongcheonru now.

15
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,651
"Go far away"?

16
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:19,616
You want me to leave now
when I am finally facing you?

17
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,370
I…

18
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,626
I have clawed my way up here.

19
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,630
I cannot leave before I kill you.

20
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,843
You killed my father.

21
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,557
You shall die and atone for it.

22
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:52,232
Do you believe I killed my mentor?

23
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,152
Do not play dumb with me.

24
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,738
I saw it with my own eyes.

25
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,496
I have never once forgotten it.

26
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,792
That night, 12 years ago…

27
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,462
I remember…

28
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,423
how you killed my father.

29
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,055
<i>How could you do that?</i>

30
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,391
You were closer than family.
How could you?

31
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,396
I have been gritting
my teeth for 12 years,

32
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,900
to pay you back for what you did.

33
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,529
No. That is not true, Jae-on.

34
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,490
That is simply not true. Let me explain.

35
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:43,658
Shut that vile mouth.

36
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,244
Do you think your words now

37
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,414
will wash away my father's blood
on your sword?

38
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,374
I…

39
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,502
did not kill my mentor.

40
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,588
How dare you call him
your mentor! You traitor!

41
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:14,022
I never once betrayed my mentor,
not even for a fleeting moment.

42
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,275
I have never done anything
to bring disgrace to him

43
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,610
or abandoned my principles.

44
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:20,778
Your principles?

45
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,782
Did they lead you to kill him

46
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,993
and take the seat of the innkeeper?

47
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,202
Hong Jae-on.

48
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,039
Leave Yongcheonru.

49
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,750
That is how you hold on to your life

50
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,044
and honor your father's wishes.

51
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,308
Even in his last moments, he beseeched me

52
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,686
to keep you safe.

53
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,528
Lies.

54
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,615
Stop lying!

55
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,401
Why did you stop? Stab me.

56
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,863
If that will bring you peace…

57
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:50,243
If this is the revenge
you've been dreaming of, stab me!

58
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,208
Why do you hesitate?

59
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,628
You dreamed of avenging
your father's death for 12 years.

60
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,362
I am not who you need to get revenge on.

61
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,949
Do you think I would fall for that?

62
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,743
Recklessly jumping in
will only get you killed as well.

63
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,370
Shut up!

64
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:40,418
Your father worried about you
until his dying breath.

65
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,714
Do not let his sacrifice go to waste.

66
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,589
<i>I came across something peculiar</i>
<i>while looking into Grand Proprietor Cheon.</i>

67
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,051
<i>It involves the missing person poster</i>
<i>from the marketplace.</i>

68
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,469
HONG JAE-ON

69
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,725
<i>Lord Cheon had a business partner</i>
<i>who died a long time ago.</i>

70
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,395
<i>And he put up the poster</i>
<i>to find the missing daughter.</i>

71
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,063
<i>I wonder why he is looking for her.</i>

72
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,866
I am not who you need to get revenge on.

73
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:22,038
Recklessly jumping in
will only get you killed as well.

74
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:15,109
BULLAKHO

75
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,577
You must keep this safe.

76
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,954
You can never lose it.

77
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:10,915
Do you understand?

78
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,590
<i>Jae-on.</i>

79
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,301
<i>Finding the jade ring</i>
<i>is not the only way to happiness.</i>

80
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:26,013
<i>Just remember to be content</i>
<i>with whatever you get.</i>

81
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,369
What is this?

82
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:34,498
So, Prince Muyeong never went to Onyang?

83
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,791
Are you certain?

84
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,209
Yes, my lord.

85
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:39,962
I knew it…

86
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,841
His Majesty's heart has strayed.

87
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,802
Did he think I would just let him?

88
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,806
As if I would just hand over
the royal throne!

89
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,021
What sort of fool do they take me for?

90
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,105
My lord!

91
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,778
Someone from Yongcheonru is here
with an urgent message.

92
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:08,240
Who? Is it Seol Mae-hwa?

93
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,825
It is not her…

94
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,328
He says he is the head clerk.

95
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,164
The head clerk?

96
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,292
- He is here to see me?
- Yes, my lord.

97
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,087
Let him in.

98
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:36,727
My lord!

99
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,106
Who are you?

100
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:57,039
That is enough. You are plenty handsome.

101
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,459
The day has finally come.

102
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,086
I know, right?

103
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:06,215
Hong Deok-su is really something else.
She actually did it.

104
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,801
You have been her rock.

105
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,595
After all, Eun-ho and I were
both against it at first.

106
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,721
That is true.

107
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:18,185
But, I had my reasons
to pursue this as well.

108
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,272
So? When are you going to confess?

109
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,899
Confess?

110
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,778
Deok-su told me
that she was a woman herself,

111
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,613
but she does not know you know.

112
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,826
You should confess you know
before either of you make a mistake.

113
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,037
Oh… About that? Right.

114
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,582
Do you think so?

115
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,668
She arduously acts like a man
in front of you.

116
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,421
If she finds out later
that you knew this whole time,

117
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,757
you will both be in awkward situations.

118
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,804
Right. I should bring it up first.

119
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,516
Yes, tell her before it is too late.

120
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,237
BULLAKHO

121
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:21,081
This bears repeating.
That is a well-made sign.

122
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,126
Were you two here last night?

123
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,587
Did you two hang it up again?

124
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,134
Hold on.

125
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,596
Where did this come from?

126
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,890
It was not there yesterday.

127
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,353
- What could it be?
- Did something happen yesterday?

128
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,314
No, nothing happened.

129
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,610
Trouble sleeping?

130
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,154
Your eyes are puffy.

131
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,122
Do you have a cold?

132
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,417
Did you get rained on yesterday?

133
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,469
Speak for yourself.
Your ugly face is extremely puffy.

134
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:24,103
I am… just nervous
about the opening of Bullakho.

135
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,316
Wait, what happened to your hand?

136
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,692
What are you doing?

137
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,989
How could you hurt your hand
right before the opening?

138
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,032
Is it serious?

139
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,620
I see you only worry about Bullakho.

140
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,626
Was I too harsh?

141
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,380
Let's go.

142
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,803
BULLAKHO

143
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:08,397
Perhaps, there is something
you would like to tell me?

144
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:10,816
I am not sure.

145
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,860
Is that so?

146
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:20,200
I hear Yongcheonru is holding
some sort of major event today.

147
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:21,910
Do you not know?

148
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,665
I am unsure of what you have heard,

149
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,084
but I will look into it if you wish.

150
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:33,463
How could you hide the fact Yongcheonru
is opening a gambling den from me?

151
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,175
Were you planning to play dumb forever?

152
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,261
How could you even dare
to open a gambling den?

153
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,263
That is a violation of the state law.

154
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:47,728
The Grand Proprietor is
up to something, is he not?

155
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,024
Something smells fishy. Very fishy.

156
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,749
BULLAKHO

157
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,444
It is all ready.

158
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,749
We will now open.

159
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:38,171
It is a gambling den
involving the upper class of the capital.

160
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,799
The raid must be swift…

161
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,719
and discreet.

162
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,178
Yes, my lord. Let us leave.

163
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,503
- Well done.
- Twenty one.

164
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,588
Congratulations.

165
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:29,973
All set.

166
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,156
Get in there and leave no stone unturned!

167
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,282
- Yes, my lord!
- Yes, my lord!

168
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,960
This is amazing.

169
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,508
- Hurry!
- Yes, sir!

170
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,885
- Stop where you are!
- Stop this instant!

171
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,180
Stop at once!

172
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,015
- Nobody move!
- Stop!

173
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,559
Apprehend all those
in violation of state law!

174
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,463
<i>What do we do</i>
<i>if the police bureau shows up?</i>

175
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,925
Just focus on practicing.
Do not worry about such things.

176
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,760
How do you remain so confident?

177
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,179
Goodness…

178
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,684
Because we will not be violating
the state law.

179
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,936
Are you saying
the Grand Proprietor is aware?

180
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,748
My deepest apologies,
but you are not allowed in here, sir.

181
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,877
Wait, you are…

182
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,174
What is all this fuss?

183
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:32,053
Are you from the bureau?

184
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,726
Today is our day of leisure. Leave us.

185
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,438
Now, go on and keep playing.

186
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,525
My apologies, sir.

187
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,032
Spin it.

188
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,241
Let us go again.

189
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,159
Great. Again.

190
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:12,427
My lord, let me escort you out.

191
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:16,848
I implore you

192
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,143
to stay away from Yongcheonru tonight.

193
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:21,728
What?

194
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:25,398
Have I ever offered you ill advice before?

195
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:29,152
This is not the right time.
Please listen to me.

196
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,446
Is that why you--

197
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:32,948
Damn it!

198
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:37,160
I can't concentrate with all this noise!

199
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,755
My deepest apologies, my lord!

200
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,384
Pardon my delay.

201
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,052
The bureau is a bit mixed up.

202
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,846
I was just getting amused.

203
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,515
Take care of it immediately.

204
00:25:58,598 --> 00:25:59,641
Yes, my lord.

205
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,892
What are they saying?

206
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,856
You should retreat, my lord.

207
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,444
He is an envoy from Qing.

208
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,281
What? Envoy?

209
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:18,785
Now,

210
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,495
please enjoy yourselves.

211
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,272
He is a Qing envoy?

212
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,482
Yes, that is right, my lord.

213
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,068
Domestic residents are forbidden
from entering here.

214
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,529
A Qing envoy was in Hanyang?

215
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,615
Even the royal ministers were not privy
to such intel.

216
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,617
How were you?

217
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,799
Was it His Majesty's order?

218
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:20,263
How could I be privy to the intentions
of such esteemed individuals?

219
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:28,521
I shall also gladly keep
your rashly executed noble outing tonight

220
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:30,899
a secret.

221
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:54,589
Have I ever told you
about how Jun-hwa was named?

222
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:01,971
Two characters that would attract
great wealth were split with another.

223
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,683
For my immature Jun-hwa,

224
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:09,270
I have been searching forever
for the bearer of that lost name.

225
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:12,399
But perhaps,

226
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:18,071
we might be able to find
a different sort of partner for him.

227
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:24,911
Young Master Jun-hwa is blessed
when it comes to companions.

228
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,583
I was after Prince Muyeong,

229
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,295
but it seems I have ensnared
a far superior catch.

230
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,009
What a fearsome fate my son has.

231
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,346
How fearsome indeed.

232
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:58,987
Here, sir.

233
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,490
Good. Great.

234
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:20,467
Excuse me. I need to wash my hands.

235
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,563
How shall we proceed, my lord?

236
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:43,072
I swear I will make him pay
for this humiliation.

237
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,326
Withdraw all units.

238
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,327
Yes, my lord.

239
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,747
Let us leave!

240
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,898
It seems things did not go
the way you desired with the Minister.

241
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,863
Are you pleased because they did for you?

242
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:06,823
Do you still think

243
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,951
that I am reckless?

244
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,379
Why are you two together alone?

245
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,055
Hong Deok-su.

246
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,351
Well done.

247
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,646
As promised,
I shall grant you reinstatement.

248
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,610
Thank you, my lord.

249
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,988
I assume you are in agreement?

250
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,619
Do your best to mentor him.

251
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:56,289
How fortunate we are
to have not lost such a talent.

252
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,251
Yes, my lord.

253
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,796
Are the guests enjoying themselves?

254
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:09,427
I was curious to see what sort of pests
would end up swarming around Bullakho.

255
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:13,473
I never imagined the Minister of War
would show up on the first night.

256
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,521
Let us return.

257
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,065
Yes, my lord.

258
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,032
Whoever the rat is,

259
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,743
they are certainly quick.

260
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,460
- Hong Deok-su.
- Yes, my lord.

261
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,964
When it comes to business,

262
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:52,887
you must be the most careful about the rat
that gnaws its way into your coffers.

263
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,847
- Do you understand?
- Yes, my lord.

264
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,261
<i>You killed my father.</i>

265
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,763
You shall die and atone for it.

266
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,434
<i>Lord Hong!</i>

267
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:44,772
You must find the strength. You must flee!

268
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,482
Hong Min-sik.

269
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,707
You must stay alive.

270
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:49,087
You need to stay alive and experience
the world we dreamt about.

271
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:53,091
Lord Hong… Why?

272
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,760
Someday…

273
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,097
if my Jae-on ever comes to you…

274
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,601
please look after her.

275
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:10,233
My Jae-on… Please take good care of her.

276
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,778
Please let go of this sword.

277
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,239
Please let go!

278
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,858
Please check over there.

279
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,025
Let's go!

280
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:21,888
Jae-on…

281
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,049
Stop lying!

282
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:06,140
My Jae-on… Please take good care of her.

283
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:53,688
Of course. I knew
you would be reinstated in no time.

284
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:57,358
That is right. The manly Hong Deok-su…

285
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,278
returned in no time.

286
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,325
What is wrong with you?

287
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,868
What are you doing?

288
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,788
Gosh. What is with you? So silly…

289
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,796
- Stop!
- Goodness me.

290
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,589
Dust your shoes off before you enter!

291
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,466
Geez…

292
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,510
Sure. Fine.

293
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,888
Shake-shake. Satisfied?

294
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,850
Your clothes too. Do it properly, Deok-su.

295
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:36,063
Why are you suddenly so obsessed
with cleanliness?

296
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:40,109
He has been sneezing the whole day.
Perhaps, the cold has him irritated.

297
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,573
No, that is not it. Hey, Lee Eun-ho.

298
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,951
What has you in such a sour mood?

299
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,456
Hong Deok-su.

300
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:56,876
How could I not be when I have
to share a room with your dirty self?

301
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,045
Then, how about switching rooms with me?

302
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,922
Being too clean is just as bad. Go inside.

303
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:05,843
What has gotten into you?
What sort of terrible cold is this?

304
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,721
We should get going.

305
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:11,932
Just say the word.
I will gladly switch rooms with you.

306
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,144
Switch what now?

307
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:22,068
Congratulations on your reinstatement,
"the manly Hong Deok-su."

308
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,030
Thank you.
Didn't I tell you I would be back soon?

309
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:29,617
You did. Do not resent me
for what happened back then.

310
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,868
Rules are rules.

311
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,703
Of course, Master Bang.

312
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,038
Well done.

313
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:37,583
And, Lee Eun-ho. Why haven't you returned
the hammer you borrowed yet?

314
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,752
Must I come all the way here
to retrieve it?

315
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,140
I am feeling a bit unwell…

316
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:56,852
Return it promptly.

317
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:17,957
Eun-ho.

318
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,543
Are you asleep?

319
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,215
I am.

320
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,926
What do you do…

321
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,639
if it turns out the goal

322
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,268
you have been sprinting toward
is the wrong one?

323
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,354
Are you talking about Bullakho?

324
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:45,776
Why? You worked so hard on it.
Do you regret it now?

325
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,654
That is not it.

326
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,537
You will know once you reach the end.

327
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:01,500
Whether it was the right path
or the wrong one.

328
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:07,006
And what if I reach the end
and discover that it was the wrong path?

329
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,842
Then, you can just turn back
and correct it.

330
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,640
That is what I plan to do.

331
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,148
You fixed the sign
and hung it back up, didn't you?

332
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,696
I simply hung it back up
because it had fallen.

333
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,493
You were so irritated,
scolding me earlier…

334
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,583
Thanks.

335
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,132
Did you cry because of the fallen sign?

336
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,932
What? Me? Who was crying?

337
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:02,603
- It is okay to cry.
- I told you I did not.

338
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,279
When I was little…

339
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:19,078
I could not cry
because I was too wary of others.

340
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,916
And later, even when I wanted to…

341
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,004
I could not.

342
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,529
You can cry here.

343
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,659
Everyone deserves

344
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,829
to have a place like that in life.

345
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:10,921
You should rest up tonight.

346
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:30,060
How does a man have such porcelain skin?

347
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,653
He looks like a painting.

348
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,210
Goodness gracious.

349
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:39,046
Who could have imagined
a Qing envoy would be here?

350
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:43,467
You know, that Hong Deok-su is
really something else.

351
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:47,638
Hold on now. I already called dibs
on that young man.

352
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,139
Do not covet him.

353
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:52,643
Really? It seemed like
Lord Cheon was interested in him as well.

354
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:55,979
Yes, I hear he is having a luncheon
with them today.

355
00:46:56,855 --> 00:47:00,567
By the way, doesn't it feel like
Lady Seol is falling out of favor?

356
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:05,113
This will be the very first time
she has not attended

357
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,241
his luncheon.

358
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,411
No, wait…

359
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:15,749
Maybe it was more than that.
Maybe she was explicitly excluded.

360
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:17,000
Oh, no…

361
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,627
It is Seong-jin.

362
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:31,473
Lady Seol is asking
for the Geumok Hall Hospitality Proposal.

363
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:34,101
Did I forget to submit it?

364
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:37,187
GEUMOK HALL HOSPITALITY PROPOSAL

365
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,314
Here you go.

366
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:55,163
Goodness me. What do we do?
What if he heard everything?

367
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,707
"We"?

368
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,083
You rattled on by yourself.

369
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,627
You should be more careful
about what you say.

370
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,380
What if someone spreads rumors?
What will you do then?

371
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:13,765
I hear Elementary Room performed
the best in Gyohwa Hall this year.

372
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:17,102
Your work setting up Bullakho
is also appreciated.

373
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:21,273
We are here to celebrate
your achievements. Enjoy yourselves.

374
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,317
Yes, my lord.

375
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,404
I hear you were

376
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,407
against Bullakho in the beginning.

377
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:35,954
If it violated the state law,
Yongcheonru would also be in danger.

378
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,374
You are worried about Yongcheonru.

379
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,961
I see you are
an official clerk in every way.

380
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:47,299
Your father must be so proud.

381
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:58,393
I have learned so much
since I came to Yongcheonru.

382
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:03,190
Especially, how to
distinguish real from fake.

383
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:06,652
Whether it is about objects or people.

384
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,322
Is that so?

385
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:15,869
Distinguishing real from fake…

386
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,205
And how would you do that?

387
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:22,000
If it is an imitation of what is real,
then, it is a fake.

388
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:27,964
Why did you design Yongcheonru
to look like the royal palace?

389
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,678
Do you desire to be the king?

390
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:37,432
Hey.

391
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:54,908
I see…

392
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,912
Oh, right. Deok-su,

393
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:03,500
how did you know
Lady Seol was gifted in dice-rolling?

394
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:10,799
She mentioned it herself
when she and I were entertaining

395
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,718
a guest at Jakyakjae.

396
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:23,645
Has Lady Seol been here
since Yongcheonru was first established?

397
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:30,569
Well… I guess you could say that.

398
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:37,451
How did Lady Seol manage
to get to where she is now?

399
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,831
It seems you are
quite interested in Lady Seol.

400
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:48,336
Yes, it is my dream to be
in her position someday.

401
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,966
We may have started
in the Elementary Room,

402
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:54,843
but our ambitions are great.

403
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:04,102
You possess the boldness of a great hero.

404
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,980
Despite your delicate,
maiden-like features.

405
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,623
Hong Deok-su.

406
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:27,959
Is your mother the only family you have?

407
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:33,381
Yes. My father passed away
when I was young.

408
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:40,472
Perhaps, that explains
the entangled fates…

409
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:52,943
Anyhow, the more I look at you,
the more familiar you seem.

410
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,320
The shape of that mouth…

411
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:12,420
We might end up with indigestion
if you continue to ask such questions.

412
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:16,508
Yes, you are right. It seems
I have prattled on for far too long.

413
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:22,180
Hong Deok-su. You should bring
your mother to Yongcheonru one day.

414
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:28,979
I would love to meet the great woman
responsible for raising

415
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,730
such a respectable young man.

416
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:35,068
Thank you, my lord. I shall.

417
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:45,662
That is tasty.

418
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:02,929
Have I done something wrong, Your Majesty?

419
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:07,058
Why would you ask such a question
as soon as you enter the palace?

420
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:12,647
I have only ever been loyal
to Your Majesty for the past 12 years.

421
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:16,234
I am truly disheartened.

422
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:20,405
You are failing to make any sense.

423
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:26,286
Do you know what I witnessed
at Yongcheonru last night?

424
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:30,999
A secret envoy from Qing?

425
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:36,922
Without a single discussion with me…
How did that even happen?

426
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:39,382
How did you manage to meet

427
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,010
an envoy that is here unofficially?

428
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:43,428
Say it is not so…

429
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:47,057
Did I just expose
some sort of secret arrangement

430
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,809
between Your Majesty and Lord Cheon?

431
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,771
Minister, be mindful of what you say.

432
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:56,858
The Qing envoy is here
to celebrate Prince Seonyang's birthday.

433
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,735
Pardon?

434
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:01,446
In preparation
for the prince's appointment ceremony,

435
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:03,531
I thought
I would introduce him in advance.

436
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:06,493
And your impatience led you
to run over here already?

437
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,203
Well, I…

438
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:11,456
What I mean is that…

439
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,418
Why was this not shared with me earlier?

440
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,589
I am his maternal grandfather.

441
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,384
Why would you need to hide--

442
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:23,802
Prince Seonyang is

443
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:27,013
my heir before he is your grandson.

444
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,082
And what is this?

445
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:58,795
Grand Proprietor Cheon

446
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:01,548
is searching for the daughter
of his late business partner.

447
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:06,177
He had given up a few years ago,
but it seems he is at it again.

448
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,979
Such actions
will not bring anyone back from the dead.

449
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,483
Just let him be.

450
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:25,155
Your Majesty, Lord Cheon's influence
has grown out of control.

451
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,657
And what do you propose we do?

452
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,243
With the continuing bad harvests,

453
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:33,329
we will be unable to govern
without his gold.

454
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,542
If you leave it to me,

455
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:44,049
I will remind him of the authority
of the throne and the royal court

456
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:47,469
so he will never forget again,
Your Majesty.

457
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:06,654
You know, I could not even tell
what I was eating

458
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:09,407
with the Grand Proprietor in front of me.

459
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,748
Slow down. You do not want indigestion.

460
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:18,083
Do not worry.

461
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,877
My belly is surprisingly big
and accommodating.

462
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:30,345
Deok-su, when do you plan
on bringing your mother?

463
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,140
She will probably run right over
when she hears.

464
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,102
Maybe we should all pay her a visit?

465
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:39,437
Sure. That sounds great.

466
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,488
Eun-ho, why aren't you eating?

467
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:51,991
He was sick yesterday.

468
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,327
Did your fever break, at least?

469
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:57,705
I am not sick.

470
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,348
- Deok-su.
- Yes?

471
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,603
I have something to say.
Can you spare me some time?

472
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:22,981
What is it? Tell me now.

473
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,023
Later.

474
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,609
I need to speak to you alone.

475
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:37,871
Okay, then.

476
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:41,958
I am off.

477
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:45,753
- Wait. I am done too.
- Okay.

478
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:57,974
Sit down.

479
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:02,812
Gosh. What is with you?

480
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,152
Eun-ho.

481
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:13,656
I would like to ask
for your advice on something.

482
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:23,958
What? You will confess your love?

483
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:26,836
Be quiet. They will hear you.

484
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,925
Have you lost your mind?
Why would you confess your feelings?

485
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:35,053
You cannot do that.

486
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:38,389
I have feelings for this woman.

487
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,601
I fell for her at first sight.

488
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:46,856
A woman you fell in love with

489
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:49,526
at first sight?

490
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:52,570
I have never felt this way
about anyone before.

491
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:57,867
Wait, so… You are saying…

492
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:01,496
that you have feelings for a woman, right?

493
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:05,750
Come on now. Are you trying
to embarrass me by repeating that?

494
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,002
Is that so?

495
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:10,296
A woman, you say…

496
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:13,967
Eun-ho.

497
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,971
Help me figure out
how to confess my feelings.

498
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:21,724
You made the right call.

499
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:25,937
I am an expert in such matters.

500
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:28,439
How fortunate!

501
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:34,988
When it comes
to professing love for a woman…

502
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:41,995
Conversation skills.

503
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:45,665
You should first compliment her
with the sweetest of words.

504
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,041
How?

505
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:50,587
Pay attention.

506
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:06,936
"If being beautiful is a crime,

507
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,648
you deserve to be executed."

508
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:12,483
- What?
- Repeat it.

509
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:21,200
"If being beautiful is a crime"…

510
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:23,119
That worked for you?

511
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:27,081
- Have you really dated before?
- Of course.

512
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:30,710
You would be shocked to see
how many maidens there are at my home.

513
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,801
Hold on… Don't you trust me?

514
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,595
It is not that…

515
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:47,810
Then,

516
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:53,691
let me tailor my advice to you.
Tell me about this woman first.

517
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:07,705
When we first met, she conned me.

518
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:08,998
Conned?

519
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,377
I am Hong Deok-su.

520
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:14,170
Five-tenths.

521
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:16,339
<i>Our first meeting was fiery.</i>

522
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:19,634
It did not get any easier
after that, though.

523
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,395
Above all else,

524
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:33,523
I found her smile the sweetest.

525
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:56,754
Hey, look!

526
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:21,612
I like to see you smile.

527
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:25,408
Please keep smiling

528
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,661
and never leave my side.

529
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,167
That is quite nice.

530
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:36,169
What? What was that?

531
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:37,211
Thank you, Eun-ho.

532
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:41,132
If it goes well, I shall be sure
to treat you to something nice.

533
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:42,133
Thank you.

534
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:54,145
Why was I thinking about Hong Deok-su?

535
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,566
Get a grip on yourself, Eun.

536
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:01,736
He is nothing but the holder
of the brass key.

537
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,638
What is with the swatting? Is it dusty?

538
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,516
I dusted myself off before coming in.

539
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:35,311
Where are you off to?

540
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:36,521
What?

541
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:39,899
This? I am off to spend the night
with my family in Geumok Hall.

542
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:57,208
Eun-ho? Hey!

543
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:58,876
What? Yes.

544
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:03,089
You seem out of it.

545
01:04:05,049 --> 01:04:06,676
Are you still sick?

546
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:09,095
Why do you keep…

547
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,476
Never mind. You should get going.

548
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:26,362
Fine, I am leaving.

549
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:33,870
No…

550
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:36,581
This is wrong.

551
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,838
Are you sick, Your Highness?

552
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:45,965
You look a bit pale.

553
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:48,009
I feel this weight on my chest.

554
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:50,094
Indigestion?

555
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:52,346
I have good medicine for that.

556
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:03,107
You can avoid indigestion
by sharing your tasty treats.

557
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:05,860
You refused to share any soup last time.

558
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,488
I am still dying
to try Hong Deok-su's soup.

559
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,324
Do not even mention his name to me!

560
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:14,076
Has he upset you in some way?

561
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:16,662
I will go catch him right now and--

562
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,706
I told you to stop!

563
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:22,919
You just never listen.

564
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:25,463
- But I…
- Follow me.

565
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:33,804
Goodness. This place is fit for a king.

566
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:35,264
I know, right?

567
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:40,227
- How is it up there?
- Dizzying.

568
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:41,395
Careful now.

569
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:48,861
This is the very Yongcheonru
that I have only ever heard about.

570
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:52,782
It is beyond spectacular.

571
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:57,119
Hold on. When is Deok-su coming?

572
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,455
I will go and fetch him.

573
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:01,332
You should go inside first.

574
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:04,043
Wait. Stop.
You can't just wander around in here.

575
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:05,711
I need to see all the sights!

576
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:09,006
My goodness.

577
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,011
Thank you.

578
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:17,348
Yes, thank you.

579
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:54,010
This is it, Your Highness.

580
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:04,395
This is the residence
of the deceased Hong Min-sik?

581
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:05,354
Yes, Your Highness.

582
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:52,735
He lived here with his sole daughter.

583
01:08:11,545 --> 01:08:15,841
What happened 12 years ago?

584
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:22,181
Hong Min-sik, the Grand Proprietor's
business partner, died…

585
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:26,310
and his daughter disappeared.

586
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:31,398
He must have his reasons for going so far
as to conduct a public search.

587
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:36,237
Lord Cheon is looking
for the missing half of the brass key.

588
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,739
He must not be looking for his daughter

589
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:42,493
but the missing half
of the brass key that girl took with her.

590
01:08:42,576 --> 01:08:46,372
Then, what is the brass key
Hong Deok-su has?

591
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,134
It was my father's.

592
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:01,554
It is the only item of his
that I have left.

593
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:07,059
He only had one daughter…

594
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,439
HONG JAE-ON

595
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,651
Hong Jae-on…

596
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,578
Hong Deok-su…

597
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:28,497
<i>Hong Deok-su.</i>

598
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:31,167
Hey.

599
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:36,755
- I have something to tell you.
- Now?

600
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:39,717
But I have to go inside now.

601
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,051
It will just take a moment.

602
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:45,681
Okay.

603
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:52,062
I never noticed it when I was working,

604
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:55,024
but looking at it from here,
it really is a beautiful place.

605
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,204
What did you need to tell me?

606
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:15,127
I… I need to confess something to you.

607
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:16,420
Confess?

608
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:20,049
Have you secretly done me wrong?

609
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:26,388
Forget it. I shall forgive whatever it is.

610
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,391
So, I…

611
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:34,230
<i>"If being beautiful is a crime,</i>

612
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:36,732
you deserve to be executed."

613
01:10:36,815 --> 01:10:38,984
Deok-su, you deserve to be executed.

614
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:40,861
What?

615
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:45,241
No, what I meant was…

616
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:47,117
I like to see you smile.

617
01:10:47,701 --> 01:10:50,996
Please keep smiling
and never leave my side.

618
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,539
Your smiling face…

619
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:56,377
deserves to be executed.

620
01:11:05,844 --> 01:11:07,554
That is not right…

621
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:10,891
Maybe something was
wrong with your dinner?

622
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:13,978
Are you sick too?

623
01:11:18,315 --> 01:11:20,067
Maybe you do have a fever?

624
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,074
Deok-su.

625
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:33,205
Come with me
to the Summer Palace in the summer.

626
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:37,209
The Summer Palace?

627
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:38,877
Later.

628
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:41,088
I want to go there with you someday.

629
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:44,466
Will you come with me?

630
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:24,840
<i>I have feelings for this woman.</i>

631
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,011
I fell for her at first sight.

632
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:30,637
<i>Above all else,</i>

633
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:34,308
I found her smile the sweetest.

634
01:12:40,272 --> 01:12:41,523
Hong Deok-su is…

635
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:45,361
a woman?

636
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:28,654
<i>I heard you were looking for a woman.</i>

637
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:30,614
<i>Shall I look into it for you?</i>

638
01:13:30,697 --> 01:13:31,824
It is none of your business.

639
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:33,617
You are also at the age to be wed,

640
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:36,161
which must have prompted
your interest in women.

641
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:37,121
<i>Hong Deok-su.</i>

642
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:40,082
<i>You should live as a woman now.</i>

643
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:44,711
<i>When your heart is tickled</i>
<i>and it flutters at the thought of someone…</i>

644
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:46,130
<i>Is that love?</i>

645
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:47,923
What on earth?

646
01:13:48,006 --> 01:13:50,592
I had something to ask. Do you perhaps…

647
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:54,471
I am Deok-su's closest friend
in Yongcheonru.

648
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:56,473
So put your faith in me.

649
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:58,142
Do not be cheeky, Jun-hwa.

650
01:14:00,477 --> 01:14:03,772
<i>You must get far away</i>
<i>from Yongcheonru as soon as possible.</i>

651
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:06,733
<i>It is still not too late</i>
<i>to leave with Hong Deok-su.</i>

652
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:08,610
Your Highness Prince Muyeong.

653
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:10,654
Why are you…

654
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:13,782
Deok-su! Deok-su…

655
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:16,076
Are you Hong Deok-su's mother?

656
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:20,789
You sure are a cheeky one.

657
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:22,166
<i>It was you.</i>
