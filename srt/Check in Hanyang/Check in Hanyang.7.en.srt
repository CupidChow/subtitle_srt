Lee Eun-ho.

5
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,847
Ko Su-ra.

6
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,152
Hong Deok-su.

7
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,654
Yes, my lord.

8
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,493
Move aside!

9
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,170
- Make way!
- Move aside!

10
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:10,672
Make way!

11
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,425
- Make way!
- Move!

12
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,512
Make way!

13
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,347
Make way!

14
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,354
Who is Hong Deok-su?

15
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,149
That would be me.

16
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,819
Hong Deok-su, you are under arrest

17
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,988
for the murder of Kim Man-dol in Seochon.

18
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,531
Pardon?

19
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,036
What did you just say about me?

20
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,246
- Apprehend him.
- Yes, sir.

21
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,914
No. I am not a murderer.

22
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,082
- Come with us.
- No, wait!

23
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,042
- He says he is not.
- Step back now.

24
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,961
There must be some sort of mistake.

25
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:50,920
What is going on?

26
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,630
You dare cause a commotion here?

27
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:02,015
You have heedlessly barged into
Yongcheonru's clerk appointment ceremony.

28
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,852
The matter at hand must be
of grave importance.

29
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:06,936
Correct?

30
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,814
We received a report
that a murder suspect was hiding here.

31
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,608
A report?

32
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:16,905
Take him away.

33
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,364
It is not true.

34
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,532
Hong Deok-su.

35
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,535
Keep your head on straight.
Nothing will happen to you.

36
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,416
I did not do it.

37
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,709
I did not do it!

38
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:51,648
<i>And all I get is</i>
<i>a measly Red Certificate thief?</i>

39
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,984
Once you catch the Red Certificate thief,

40
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,445
someone will come running
and jump right in.

41
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,616
A flashy bait is bound
to catch a big fish.

42
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:07,121
You want me to catch the "big fish"
that chases after the bait?

43
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,586
Are you sure this will aid in

44
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,047
Prince Seonyang's appointment?

45
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,634
I am sure you will not be disappointed.

46
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,354
They dare come barging in here?

47
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,189
The police bureau must have

48
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,401
a lead in the Red Certificate forgery
and murder cases.

49
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:39,153
Police bureau?
The Minister of War must be behind it.

50
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:59,257
The appointment ceremony was
completely ruined, thanks to Hong Deok-su.

51
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,093
What a damn mess.

52
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:06,681
Goodness me, Myeong-ho.
A murderer! Can you believe it?

53
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:11,144
How could he do something so heinous,
looking so perfectly normal?

54
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,106
Did I not tell you there was
something off about him from the start?

55
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,858
I mean, how did such a heinous bastard

56
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,776
even manage to enter Yongcheonru?

57
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,699
What about Eun-ho?

58
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,494
Hey, Du-sik.

59
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:32,790
Do you know how many lashes one can endure
before they die?

60
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:33,791
Come on now.

61
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,837
It is not a sword. A few smacks
with the rod can not kill anyone.

62
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,590
Foolish boy.

63
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,093
You just need to drench the buttocks

64
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,263
and apply exactly 30 smacks…

65
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,684
to make the skin rip apart into shreds

66
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,979
and lead you straight to death.
That is what flogging is.

67
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,064
You did not know?

68
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:04,530
My goodness.
Since Hong Deok-su is of small build,

69
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,866
I am sure just after ten smacks,

70
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,078
he will croak like some dried-up frog.

71
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,293
What was that?

72
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,004
I was just curious.

73
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,717
I wanted to know how many times
a person must fall from a chair

74
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,552
before they died.

75
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,847
What?

76
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,103
What?

77
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:42,860
That was one.

78
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,476
Eun-ho!

79
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,661
Eun-ho, are you going too?

80
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,836
Go where?

81
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,673
Could it be the police bureau?

82
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,717
We need to see how Deok-su is doing.

83
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,433
Su-ra, you too?

84
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,728
I am a member of Elementary too.
I should be there as well.

85
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,238
Mother!

86
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,073
Mother!

87
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,242
Something terrible happened!

88
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,744
What could be so terrible?

89
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:18,372
Deok-su was arrested
and dragged to the police bureau!

90
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,375
What did you just say?

91
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,963
Deok-su is at where?

92
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,676
My goodness. Deok-su!

93
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,636
Can I have…

94
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,095
- Mother!
- Where are you going?

95
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,847
- Make way!
- Move aside!

96
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,060
POLICE BUREAU

97
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,607
He has such a small frame.

98
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,026
Are they sure it is him?

99
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,611
What is going on?

100
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,447
Deok-su!

101
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,616
Mother!

102
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,243
- Deok-su!
- Mother.

103
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,828
- Deok-su! My dear Deok-su!
- Mother.

104
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,205
What is going on here?

105
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,289
Step back!

106
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,502
Sir! He would not hurt a fly!

107
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,754
I did not kill him. It was not me!

108
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,673
- Deok-su, what happened?
- Stay away!

109
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,800
Mother!

110
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,426
Mother!

111
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,806
Step away from the criminal. Go on!

112
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,350
Sir, this is a misunderstanding.
You must be mistaken!

113
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,811
Do not just stand there. Drag her away!

114
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:22,937
- Yes, sir!
- Deok-su!

115
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,439
Deok-su!

116
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,025
Mother! Are you all right?

117
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,073
Drag away the criminal now!

118
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,988
<i>Once you catch the Red Certificate thief,</i>

119
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,449
someone will come running
and jump right in.

120
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:21,120
A flashy bait is bound
to catch a big fish.

121
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,005
This is unbelievable!

122
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,967
People really love spectacle.

123
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,136
How crude.

124
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,431
Do not just stand there.
Kick them all out!

125
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,016
- Yes, sir.
- What is going on?

126
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,934
Let them be.

127
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,938
The interrogation must be loud and showy

128
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:51,317
if we want word to spread
and the people to be wary.

129
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,582
Are they just going
to interrogate him there?

130
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,336
He will not be able
to ignore protocol like that.

131
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,046
Something feels off.

132
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,640
Go and fetch me the evidence
collected at the murder scene.

133
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,599
Yes, my lord.

134
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,727
I feel wronged, my lord.

135
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,647
I am not Kim Man-dol's killer.

136
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,815
Shut it!

137
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:59,885
You stole this Red Certificate,
did you not?

138
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,977
There is a witness statement that claims

139
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,438
you and Kim Man-dol
were arguing in Seochon.

140
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,068
The Red Certificate…

141
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,904
<i>I ripped it in half</i>
<i>because you appreciate "honest and just."</i>

142
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:21,866
What do you think?

143
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,617
Share it. No need to fight.

144
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,327
I hope you both make it into Yongcheonru.

145
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,288
What have you done?

146
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,331
It becomes void if it is ripped!

147
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,417
I am done for.

148
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,672
That must have been Kim Man-dol…

149
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,352
You killed him with this sword,
did you not?

150
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,355
I do not know what happened.

151
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,899
That is not my sword.

152
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,650
You better tell the truth.

153
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,197
<i>The minister asked if I have been</i>
<i>working on my swordsmanship.</i>

154
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,950
He looked for the dragon-engraved sword
bestowed to princes,

155
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,327
so I showed him mine.

156
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,496
The minister is after you.

157
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,458
Once he finds out
that you are not in Onyang,

158
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,711
he will put a noose around your neck.

159
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,258
How dare he…

160
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,718
If this is not your sword,

161
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,970
then who does it belong to?

162
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,056
How would I know that?

163
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,142
Is that so?

164
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,229
Let us see if you stick by that statement

165
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,980
even after the flogging.

166
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,524
Look here!

167
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,525
Yes, my lord.

168
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,320
His official interrogation
will commence tomorrow.

169
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,905
Keep him locked up until then.

170
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,826
I shall carry out
the harshest line of questioning

171
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,828
until he confesses.

172
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,211
Yes, my lord.

173
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:03,926
I really did not do it!

174
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,095
I did not do it!

175
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,304
Wait…

176
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:10,266
I did not do it.

177
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,185
It really was not me!

178
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,245
When is that big fish going to bite?

179
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,461
I did not do it.

180
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,046
I never killed anyone.

181
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,507
Please listen to me. Hey!

182
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,968
I did not kill him!

183
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,761
Hey!

184
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:53,809
Hold on.

185
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,562
Let us figure out our next step first.

186
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,027
Do you think

187
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,195
Deok-su really stole it?

188
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,240
We need to save our friend first.

189
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,701
He is not the culprit.

190
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,122
Go back without me.
I need to stop by somewhere.

191
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,625
Eun-ho!

192
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,423
Su-ra, I also need to stop by somewhere.

193
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,091
You too? Where are you going?

194
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,551
Gyohwa Hall does not know we left.

195
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,844
Do not worry about me.

196
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,725
Hurry up and throw them.

197
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,186
<i>Gae.</i>

198
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,861
You scoundrels!
Who said you could slack off like this?

199
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,074
This is all because
of that punk, Hong Deok-su.

200
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,034
- Indeed!
- Quiet.

201
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:56,205
By the way, where did
all the Elementary rascals go?

202
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,750
Are you unaware?
They are on an unauthorized outing.

203
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,377
They should be fired immediately.

204
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,670
- Indeed!
- Indeed!

205
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,797
Shush. You rascals!

206
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,758
You all go and clean the bathhouse!

207
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,969
- Seriously?
- Seriously?

208
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,929
Just shut those traps already.

209
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,023
Deok-su is being held
at the police bureau?

210
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,192
Yes.

211
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,237
The Minister of War
was questioning him himself.

212
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,615
How did your search
of the Lord Cheon's residence go?

213
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,369
This is the half I found there.

214
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,787
You found it.

215
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,755
Let me see the scroll.

216
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,104
TWO MAKES ONE

217
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,067
Is something wrong?

218
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,695
No.

219
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,448
We just need to match it
with its other half.

220
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,586
What is the matter?

221
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:26,837
By chance,

222
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,632
are you worried about Hong Deok-su?

223
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,845
Of course, I am.
He is the holder of the brass key.

224
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,056
I worked so hard to find it.

225
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,812
He is just so reckless,
always getting into all sorts of trouble.

226
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,814
I can not even look away for a second.

227
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,649
He will be freed soon if he is innocent.

228
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,070
There is no way he is the culprit.

229
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,031
Things simply do not add up.

230
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,369
Let us go to the palace.

231
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,246
I need to check something.

232
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,285
They fell for it.

233
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,722
My friend, I am here!

234
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,723
Hello there.

235
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,811
Goodness. Is that a new safe chest?

236
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,437
Do you want to take a look?

237
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,606
This is the brass key.

238
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,612
My word. Are there two keys?

239
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,991
You can only open the chest
if you have both halves.

240
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:26,206
I see. It is indeed an interesting piece…

241
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,083
I plan to give one to Jae-on

242
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,877
when she grows up.

243
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,381
That chest will not fit much.

244
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,802
I am plenty satisfied with this size.

245
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,305
"Satisfied"?

246
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,516
That is not enough for me.

247
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,186
Listen, Min-sik.

248
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,396
There you go with that nonsense again.

249
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,903
It is our opportunity
to seat a king with our money.

250
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,654
We can acquire real power.

251
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,241
Power is no different from a blade.

252
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,369
The closer you are to it,
the more likely you are to be cut by it.

253
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,588
We have a way to soar higher,
to reach unimaginable heights.

254
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,591
Why do you insist
on standing idly by on the ground?

255
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,181
Listen, my friend.

256
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,100
Think about Jun-hwa and Jae-on.

257
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:30,395
We just need to make sure
we leave behind a world

258
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,147
where they can live respectably.

259
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,408
Go ahead and search all you want.

260
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,454
Nothing gets past me in my house.

261
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,220
Please save Hong Deok-su.

262
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,432
There is no way he is the culprit.

263
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,559
We must act
before they torture him tomorrow.

264
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,228
You were already at the bureau?

265
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,859
He is a member of Yongcheonru now.

266
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,779
You even presented him
the official appointment certificate.

267
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,909
You have never shown
any interest in Yongcheonru,

268
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,288
yet here you are worrying
about one of its members. How amusing.

269
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,293
Yes, I have decided to start
taking an interest now.

270
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,420
So please lend me some funds.

271
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,005
I will visit the Minister of War

272
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,881
and explain or bribe to persuade him.

273
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,384
The Minister of War…

274
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,390
Did you think he desired money?

275
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,811
Did you think

276
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:56,773
he locked up a small-fry clerk
of Yongcheonru

277
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,900
because he wanted money?

278
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,782
Is there anything better than money
when it comes to appeasing someone?

279
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:10,120
Fine. Do as you wish.

280
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,373
However,

281
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,002
why must I lend you such money?

282
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,506
Because…

283
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,634
If Hong Deok-su is that precious to you,

284
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:29,347
then take care of this on your own.

285
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,275
My apologies.

286
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,654
The Grand Proprietor
has given a strict order.

287
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,534
It must be his way of trying to tame me.

288
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,454
How far are you…

289
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:58,335
willing to go for Hong Deok-su?

290
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:02,130
Whatever is necessary to free him.

291
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,300
I will get him released,
even if I have to sell off all my assets.

292
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,473
Could you lend your support to my cause?

293
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:20,190
As of now, I remain
under the Grand Proprietor.

294
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,818
I can not defy him.

295
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,991
I understand.
I shall look for another way.

296
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,244
Private loans will not be available.

297
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,288
He has forbidden

298
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:39,876
the issuance of all loans
that could be made with your ID tablet.

299
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:16,079
That sword was indeed mine.

300
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,249
Then, are you saying the evidence
in that murder case is…

301
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:24,671
Who would dare break into the palace
and steal a royal sword?

302
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,425
- Let me fetch the guard and gatekeeper.
- No need.

303
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:33,096
My sword was intentionally placed
at the murder scene by the culprit.

304
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,306
I am the target.

305
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,974
Who would do such a thing?

306
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,019
The Minister of War…

307
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,023
visited Prince Eunseong
to check on his sword.

308
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,109
These swords were
only bestowed upon princes.

309
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,737
Prince Eunseong, Prince Seonyang…

310
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,156
and me.

311
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,994
He has clearly set up this trap

312
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,163
to ensnare me.

313
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,596
Why are you so startled?

314
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,779
These are not stolen goods, right?

315
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,826
Take a good look at me.

316
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,037
I would be a victim of theft if anything.

317
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,748
I have never stolen anything in my life.

318
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,045
Do not bother.

319
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,756
No one here will give you a loan today.

320
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:53,551
I assure you these are not stolen goods.

321
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,512
Do not worry.

322
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:01,393
I can not believe I even have to say this.

323
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,355
I am Yongcheonru's--

324
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,816
It is not that. I have no clue, either,

325
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:11,361
but Yongcheonru gave the strictest orders
to stop the issuance of all loans

326
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:14,322
to every private loan provider
and pawnshop in the vicinity.

327
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,199
It really is

328
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,285
a shame, but…

329
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,001
Take it back.

330
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,172
So, you are going to turn me down?

331
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:37,637
I mean, it will be quite difficult
to come across such goods again.

332
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,931
This is quite expensive, you know.

333
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,853
I mean, what can I do?
I can not force you.

334
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:50,734
Maybe there is
a fearless black market dealer nearby…

335
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,623
Goodness me.

336
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,125
Is that it?

337
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:11,379
Even if you do not know what they are
truly worth, this is ridiculous.

338
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,173
Just a nugget of silver for all these?

339
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,091
Listen.

340
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,011
I am being quite generous.

341
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:22,807
Who would dare to go behind
Yongcheonru's back and offer you a loan?

342
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:24,559
No one but me.

343
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:26,061
I can not believe this.

344
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,855
Hey, if you do not like it,
then, you can take it back.

345
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,648
I am just as afraid as the rest.

346
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,942
Unbelievable.

347
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,235
Hold on.

348
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,789
Ko Su-ra.

349
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,083
Did you return alone?

350
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,503
- My apologies, sir.
- Goodness…

351
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,630
Three from Elementary are missing.

352
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:54,964
How is this fair?

353
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,967
Just leave it.
I will do the work of four people.

354
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:02,389
I mean, your so-called "friends" leave you
to take care of all the cleaning.

355
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,641
How could you call that friendship?

356
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:05,558
Right, Myeong-ho?

357
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:06,726
Hey, you rascals.

358
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,728
Do you clean by blabbing the day away?

359
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,481
Goodness me. Quickly finish up and leave.

360
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,274
This is not good.

361
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,486
You better not splash any water.

362
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,740
Hey, Su-ra.

363
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,868
By chance, are you the outcast?

364
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,332
- Damn it.
- Move it. I need to clean.

365
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,756
One punk got dragged
to the police bureau for murder

366
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,968
and the other two abandoned you,
leaving you to pick up their slack.

367
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,929
Who says Deok-su killed someone?

368
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:45,849
The rumors have spread
like wildfire throughout Yongcheonru.

369
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:46,933
You did not know?

370
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,352
I do not believe in rumors
that others spew.

371
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,645
I believe in my friends.

372
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,317
"I believe in my friends."

373
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,902
Ko Su-ra!

374
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:03,032
Your Namhae Guild failed
because you are this naive.

375
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,367
Wake up already!

376
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:29,517
- Find Hong Min-sik's daughter!
- Yes, sir!

377
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,744
Plague patients!

378
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,996
You can not enter. They are infected.

379
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,549
Mother!

380
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:12,018
What sort of terrible nightmare
were you having?

381
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,070
Gu-sil.

382
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,863
Let us go.

383
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:29,160
We need to go
and make sure Deok-su is okay.

384
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,956
- Come on.
- Wait. Mother…

385
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,375
You should not go anywhere
in such a state.

386
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,308
Who are you?

387
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,793
Where is everyone?

388
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,724
You say…

389
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,936
you are the Grand Proprietor's son?

390
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,356
My name is Cheon Jun-hwa, my lord.

391
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,782
You look nothing like your father.

392
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,703
I see he had such a nice son.

393
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,373
I have recently returned from Qing.

394
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:01,711
I wanted to pay my respects
to your esteemed grace.

395
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:07,300
Tell me. Does my reputation

396
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,594
precede me in Qing as well?

397
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,640
It is certainly understandable.

398
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:17,101
I am His Majesty's father-in-law

399
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,730
and the maternal grandfather
to Prince Seonyang,

400
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,148
the future Crown Prince.

401
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:30,281
It would be impolite for me
to pay you a visit empty-handed.

402
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,619
What a respectable young man.

403
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,291
This is my entire fortune.

404
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:41,834
Your entire fortune?

405
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,342
Yes, of course.

406
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:55,264
The size of the chest does not make
the treasure inside any more precious.

407
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,726
Good things come in small packages.

408
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:03,398
So, what really brought you here today?

409
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:07,610
My friend is being wrongfully held
at the police bureau.

410
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,903
"Wrongfully held"?

411
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,451
As long as I am the Minister of War,

412
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,162
I will not let such injustice slide.

413
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:23,042
As expected,
your benevolence knows no bounds.

414
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:28,464
It is hard to find someone
so righteous like you nowadays.

415
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,894
Silver?

416
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,314
Not gold but silver?

417
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:56,159
Is this chest a treasure from the Qing?

418
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,870
What I have now may be meager,

419
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:02,582
but if there is something you desire
at Yongcheonru, I shall gladly offer it.

420
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,125
"Meager"?

421
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,965
The one being held is
a mere innocent clerk.

422
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,884
Are you trying to imply

423
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:16,429
the bureau persecuted
an innocent civilian?

424
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,556
Go back.

425
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,100
I shall pretend
as if this meeting never happened.

426
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:24,854
I could also put you behind bars
for soliciting a bribe,

427
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:27,690
but because of my long friendship
with your father,

428
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,151
I shall overlook this.

429
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,778
My lord.

430
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,112
Foolish boy.

431
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:36,240
Come back after you learn
and grow up some more.

432
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,409
Who brings his entire fortune
to a negotiation?

433
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,371
You still have a long way to go.

434
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,546
Here.

435
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,301
You must not waste it.

436
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,678
How many times
are you going to repeat that?

437
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:58,971
I hear you.

438
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,432
I told you I would buy you a new one.

439
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,351
This ointment is truly hard to come by.

440
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,894
This is a cure-all.

441
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,901
What sort of injury requires
the whole jar?

442
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,195
Let me apply it for you.

443
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,035
Gosh…

444
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,080
- He is here.
- Deok-su? Deok-su!

445
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,373
Mother.

446
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:28,417
- You should not be here.
- Deok-su.

447
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:31,462
I brought her here
because she insisted that you needed

448
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,089
warm soup and rice.

449
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,135
Are you okay?

450
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,636
Mother, are you all right?

451
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,763
- Are you okay? Have you eaten?
- Dear sir.

452
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,307
Something for your trouble.

453
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,269
You do not have long.

454
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,152
- Hurry.
- Thank you, sir.

455
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:55,987
My dear Deok-su.

456
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,530
My dear child…

457
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,501
Let me feed you. Open up.

458
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,504
Eat this and find the strength
to hang in there.

459
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,882
Go on.

460
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,228
I am sorry, Mother.

461
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,858
Deok-su, have you done something
that needs apologizing?

462
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,526
Tell me.

463
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,696
I…

464
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:45,286
played dice-rolling with Kim Man-dol.

465
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,248
That is how I won the Red Certificate.

466
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,835
My goodness.

467
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,838
I can not believe you.
Have I taught you nothing?

468
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,758
That was my only way into Yongcheonru.

469
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:01,344
Who cares about that damn Yongcheonru?

470
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:08,893
So?

471
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,812
Did he really die because of you?

472
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,689
No, that is not true.

473
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,233
I did not kill him.

474
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:19,612
My goodness…
What are we going to do about this sin?

475
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,118
I will fix this, Mother.

476
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,453
I promise I can.

477
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,667
Someone from Yongcheonru came by today

478
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,378
with some consolation money for your sake.

479
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,214
What?

480
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,008
Who gave you money?

481
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,846
Are you Hong Deok-su's mother?

482
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,682
Yes.

483
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,439
Consider it consolation money
for Hong Deok-su.

484
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,409
And that person…

485
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,163
also left this.

486
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,336
I played dumb,

487
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,172
but I had a terrible nightmare,

488
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:23,342
and I just can not help but feel anxious.

489
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,138
What did that person look like?
Do you remember?

490
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:30,099
She was dressed like a noblewoman.

491
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,059
"A noblewoman"?

492
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:37,690
It was…

493
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,192
a woman?

494
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,945
Why? Is it someone you know?

495
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:54,915
I have stopped the flow

496
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,835
of all lines of credit in the capital
as you commanded,

497
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,588
but it seems he still paid
the Minister of War a visit.

498
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:07,303
Have you ever seen
Jun-hwa act like this before?

499
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:12,141
He would not even bat an eyelash
if he heard I was dying.

500
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,436
I will tell him it is
now time for self-restraint.

501
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,146
No, just let him be.

502
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,441
This is just the beginning.

503
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:24,070
He will run wild as he likes
and eventually return

504
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,280
to surrender once he tires himself out.

505
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,199
Anyway,

506
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,870
I am more intrigued

507
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,581
by this Hong Deok-su fellow.

508
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:42,171
The rascal who is
making Jun-hwa behave this way.

509
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,302
There is definitely something about him.

510
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,223
If we use him well,

511
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:58,062
he could end up awakening in Jun-hwa
the wings he needs to soar.

512
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,785
Seol Mae-hwa…

513
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,247
Was that your way of paying for my life?

514
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,707
Rest up today.

515
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,585
Tomorrow will be a busy day for you.

516
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,679
I will be sure to pay you back
what is owed.

517
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,533
My belly!

518
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:57,705
What is with you?

519
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,001
Sir, please help me.

520
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,879
The soup and rice I had earlier…

521
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,715
Let go of me, you scoundrel!

522
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,676
Please help me, sir. I am about to die.

523
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,845
Sir. Please…

524
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:15,181
Let go of me. Let go, you scoundrel!

525
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,349
Damn it. You rotten bastard.

526
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,428
The prisoner has escaped!

527
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,388
Over there!

528
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,495
- Catch him!
- Catch him!

529
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,247
- Catch him!
- Catch him!

530
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:04,915
Do not lose him!

531
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:08,294
Catch him!

532
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:15,050
- Catch him!
- Catch him!

533
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,230
Hong Deok-su has escaped.

534
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:34,486
I suspected he would be a handful, but…

535
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,529
How shall we proceed?

536
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,912
I shall go myself.

537
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,368
Stop right there!

538
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:37,049
You scoundrel!
Kneel now if you do not wish to die.

539
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,346
Let go!

540
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,399
Take him away now!

541
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:56,068
No. Let go of me! Let go!

542
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,616
Let me go!

543
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:25,389
Damn it.

544
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,657
<i>Foolish boy.</i>

545
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,577
Come back after you learn
and grow up some more.

546
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,455
Who brings his entire fortune
to a negotiation?

547
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:33,165
You still have a long way to go.

548
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,961
You still had assets to sell off?

549
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,894
I am yours to buy, Grand Proprietor Cheon.

550
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:41,233
You just sold off everything for nothing

551
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:44,069
without knowing their true value.

552
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:48,865
Do you not think you will be filled
with regret if you even sell

553
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,075
yourself off like this?

554
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:53,370
Surely, I must be worth
as much as Yongcheonru.

555
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:58,792
Are you doing all this
only to save that child, Hong Deok-su?

556
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:05,132
He is my friend, Father.

557
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:07,551
"Friend"?

558
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:12,889
Friend, you say…

559
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:20,355
I also had a friend who I considered
the most precious in the world.

560
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:28,572
Since you now kneel before me,

561
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:32,576
ready to fulfill my wishes
and follow in my footsteps,

562
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:35,746
I shall teach you this.

563
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:44,004
You must not waste resources
on the weak and useless.

564
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:48,925
That is the first lesson you must learn
if you wish to follow in my footsteps.

565
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,511
Second.

566
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,847
In a negotiation,

567
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:56,808
knowing what the other party desires

568
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:59,936
is more important
than what you have to offer.

569
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:04,816
However, you did not even know
what the minister desired.

570
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,444
You were destined for failure.

571
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:08,570
Do you understand?

572
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,615
I shall bear those words in mind.

573
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:12,574
However,

574
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,703
Hong Deok-su will become for me
what Seol Mae-hwa is to you.

575
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:20,165
He is someone I need
if I wish to follow in your footsteps.

576
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,543
The innkeeper is not your friend

577
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,505
but a mere vassal you must order around.

578
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,093
Yes.

579
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:36,264
Then, please save my vassal.

580
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:40,936
Fine.

581
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,981
Since you have offered yourself up
to say that you need him,

582
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,566
I shall grant you that much.

583
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,358
Deok-su.

584
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,696
Hong Deok-su.

585
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:03,435
All of a sudden,
you wish to torture the criminal.

586
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:05,437
Why would you even bother?

587
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,608
That audacious scoundrel got caught
trying to escape prison last night.

588
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,027
I should go and have him flogged myself.

589
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,362
You should just order an officer to do it.

590
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,907
Why put yourself through such hardships?

591
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:19,451
This is just a part
of the tactical battle.

592
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,203
You do not need to worry.

593
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:24,706
Just hurry Prince Seonyang's
appointment ceremony preparation.

594
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,374
Why defile your hands

595
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:30,212
with the blood of a criminal when we have
that important celebration ahead of us?

596
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:37,010
Last night, the only son
of the Grand Proprietor of Yongcheonru…

597
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,055
bit the bait.

598
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:43,433
Pardon? The Grand Proprietor's son did?

599
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:44,434
Yes.

600
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,729
If we have leverage against Lord Cheon,

601
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:51,691
it should come in handy
for Prince Seonyang's appointment.

602
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,194
Even so!

603
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:57,781
Just a single nugget of silver
in that chest! How absurd!

604
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:01,034
How infuriating.

605
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:04,996
My goodness.
Perhaps, you should just take today off.

606
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:05,997
No.

607
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:08,083
I must make the bait dance more vigorously

608
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,627
if I wish to ensure a big catch.

609
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,003
My lord.

610
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:14,714
A gift from Yongcheonru has arrived.

611
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:15,841
Is that so?

612
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,385
Bring it in at once.

613
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,274
Goodness gracious.

614
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,237
I have never seen
such a small gift before.

615
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:39,364
What is this?

616
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:41,867
It is the same chest that his son brought.

617
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:49,916
Lord Cheon clearly knows a thing or two.

618
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:53,003
This is "a bookend structure."

619
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:57,883
He is making up for his son's mistake
by utilizing the same medium.

620
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,305
I shall gladly accept it.

621
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,267
It seems Lord Cheon has decided

622
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:11,438
to submit and finally grovel at your feet.

623
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,523
My goodness. That is quite heavy.

624
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,109
It feels different. Definitely different.

625
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:27,662
- What?
- Why would you shake it like that?

626
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,206
What if it is breakable?

627
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:35,754
What?

628
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:43,011
Hold on. What is this?

629
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:55,565
CHEON

630
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,195
What in the world is this?

631
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:04,449
My lord, someone is looking for you
at the police bureau.

632
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:00,588
<i>It is from a peach tree.</i>

633
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:04,050
It scares away ghosts
and prevents nightmares.

634
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:07,512
Lee Eun-ho…

635
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:29,325
Who in the world is looking for me?

636
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,095
It has been a while, Minister.

637
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:52,682
What? Prince Muyeong.

638
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,228
I hear you have been looking for me.

639
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:05,153
I rushed over
because I had an urgent matter

640
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:06,237
to discuss with you.

641
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:17,082
Your Highness, I was told
you were recuperating in Onyang.

642
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:19,167
Has your health been restored?

643
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:29,094
My goodness… It feels like
I have been waiting for you for eternity.

644
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:33,807
Release the innocent prisoner
you have captured

645
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,016
because of me.

646
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:39,562
I am the one you are after, am I not?

647
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:50,365
Even if it is an order from Your Highness,

648
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,660
how could I step in and intervene

649
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:56,162
in the official matters of the bureau?

650
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:02,961
Prince Seonyang's tenth birthday is
fast approaching, is it not?

651
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:07,465
We should not spill
innocent civilian blood

652
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,969
before the momentous
Crown Prince Appointment Ceremony.

653
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:16,975
Well, yes…

654
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:19,811
That is true.

655
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:23,690
Then,

656
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,650
will we be able to carry out

657
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:28,945
his appointment ceremony soon
without issue?

658
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:35,034
I shall provide aid.

659
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,288
Whoever ascends the throne,

660
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:41,833
he should rule
with a sense of virtue and justice.

661
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,003
I see no reason for me not to support it

662
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:47,213
if my brother is to become a sage king.

663
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,301
That is magnificent.

664
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,847
If Your Highness vouches for him,

665
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,640
I will gladly free the clerk
from Yongcheonru.

666
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,768
However,

667
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:05,482
I shall see
the murder investigation through

668
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:07,901
to catch the culprit.

669
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,112
The victim who was stabbed to death was

670
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:14,365
also a loyal subject of Joseon, after all.

671
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:23,166
Prisoner Hong Deok-su!

672
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,420
Yes?

673
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:30,048
- Come on out.
- What?

674
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:41,392
Get out of here.

675
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,311
What is going on?

676
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:45,855
Why are you suddenly letting me go?

677
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,941
How would I know? Get lost.

678
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:09,045
Let me be clear. I was against it.

679
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:11,464
Hong Deok-su is innocent.

680
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:14,342
He was just ensnared in the trap
the minister set for me.

681
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:16,553
You knew it was a trap
but still jumped in.

682
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,221
That was why I was against it.

683
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,101
Would you have done the same if it was me?

684
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,812
You should be punished
if you commit a crime.

685
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:28,773
Also, he and you are different.

686
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,109
How are we different?

687
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:32,318
Goodness…

688
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,696
I am hurt.

689
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:36,447
You were worried about him all night.

690
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,617
I was? About him?

691
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:41,995
You were.

692
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,830
You even demanded my ointment.

693
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,456
How could you not pity him?

694
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:51,296
Where is your sense of compassion
for your fellow man?

695
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:52,880
I never knew you were so cold.

696
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,424
I am?

697
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,011
Since the olden days,

698
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,054
gentlemen had compassion for the injured.

699
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,890
You always get so weird
at the mention of Hong Deok-su.

700
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,226
The brass key!

701
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:07,395
He is my brass key!

702
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,190
I have not forgotten my objective.

703
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,985
Since we have found the other half,

704
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,903
we will be done if it is a match.

705
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:19,198
You did not offer a single piece of praise
when I found that other half.

706
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:21,701
Let us move with haste.

707
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:25,538
This is simply unfair.

708
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:28,791
How could you be so cold to me?

709
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,210
- Your Highness.
- Jeez.

710
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,339
Gosh…

711
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:41,179
Lord Cheon, have you gone insane?

712
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:45,183
You send this measly thing

713
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:47,101
and ask me to free a murderer?

714
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:51,606
Are you and your son taking turns
mocking me?

715
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,279
CHEON

716
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:01,616
My word…

717
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:05,912
Hold on. Was this not enough?

718
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:07,288
And what is that exactly?

719
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:14,587
If you do not know, it would be
in your best interest to keep it that way.

720
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:19,717
Since you have rejected it,
I shall take it back with me.

721
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,054
I mean…

722
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:29,435
you should have included
an explanation of the gift.

723
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:35,733
Will you release the Yongcheonru clerk?

724
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:42,699
Well, the thing is…

725
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:47,537
- He is gone.
- Pardon?

726
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:48,913
You are too late.

727
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:51,499
Someone already swooped in before you

728
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:53,710
and freed Hong Deok-su.

729
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,546
Who might that be?

730
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:03,136
I shall tell you
if you return this gift to me.

731
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:08,474
That is quite all right.

732
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,935
If it is something that I must know,

733
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:14,105
I am sure I will find out eventually.

734
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:17,775
Please excuse me now.

735
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,533
He was released without warning.

736
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,248
Find him.

737
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:33,374
Yes, my lady.

738
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:48,973
YONGCHEONRU

739
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:06,240
Step aside.

740
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:30,932
CLERK APPOINTMENT
ELEMENTARY ROOM

741
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:33,059
CHEON JUN-HWA, LEE EUN-HO,
KO SU-RA, HONG DEOK-SU

742
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:39,148
What brings you by
at this late hour, Lady Seol?

743
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:44,695
Gyohwa Hall experienced
quite a tumultuous year.

744
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:45,613
Yes, it did.

745
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:48,574
It has been a while
since we have had such a rowdy bunch.

746
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,701
Thank you for your hard work.

747
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:54,539
But now, we need to clean the house.

748
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,963
Terminate Hong Deok-su's employment.

749
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:04,298
Pardon?

750
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:09,011
Lady Seol, you have--

751
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,388
Come back tomorrow.

752
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:12,265
You can give me your report then.

753
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:18,896
Where have you been all day?

754
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,606
I have been waiting a long time.

755
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:47,842
What brings you by, my lord?

756
01:04:50,928 --> 01:04:52,179
Hong Deok-su.

757
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:55,433
How could you show up here
after that mess at the police bureau?

758
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,435
My apologies for the distress.

759
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:02,356
I brought him here
because he was so desperate to see you.

760
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:10,448
And what sort of business
could I have with this child?

761
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,534
I offer my greetings upon my return.

762
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:17,038
His employment has
already been terminated.

763
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:21,250
He was arrested on a charge of murder.

764
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,628
Even if he is innocent of murder,

765
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:26,964
he lost his right to be here
when he forged the Red Certificate.

766
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:28,174
I came to ask you

767
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:32,553
for a chance to prove
that I deserve the right to be here.

768
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:37,516
Put the dismissal on hold.

769
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:43,105
My lord, what will the other clerks think…

770
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:46,859
It will set an example.

771
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:51,822
It will show how much Yongcheonru cares
for its members.

772
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:59,080
As you have suggested,
you shall prove yourself on your own.

773
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:01,582
Yes, I shall, my lord.

774
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:10,883
You shall officially be reinstated
after you achieve

775
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,426
what was promised.

776
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:15,054
That should be good enough.

777
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:29,610
You should have never returned
to Yongcheonru.

778
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:34,490
Why not?

779
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:39,996
I worked very hard to get here.

780
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:45,668
You seem to have a lot to say about me.

781
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:47,086
No matter what anyone says,

782
01:06:48,462 --> 01:06:50,006
I made it here on my own merits.

783
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:53,342
Nothing is out of reach for me now.

784
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:56,721
I even made it back safely from prison.

785
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:58,806
Hong Deok-su. You are--

786
01:06:58,889 --> 01:07:01,726
I know who tipped off the police bureau

787
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:03,728
to frame me for murder.

788
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:12,486
I will never…

789
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:18,409
run away like a coward.

790
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:39,847
Deok-su.

791
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,185
Hong Deok-su.

792
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:27,186
Please do not leave me…

793
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:34,652
Please do not leave…

794
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:51,460
Please…

795
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:26,055
<i>Grand Proprietor Cheon will soon know</i>
<i>that the brass key is missing.</i>

796
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:27,389
<i>You must make your move first.</i>

797
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:30,976
Hong Deok-su only just returned.

798
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,811
This is my last chance.

799
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:35,981
Do you believe
that you will be able to catch me?

800
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:40,569
This gambling den must be a success.

801
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:42,112
Find another way.

802
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:45,157
<i>I will not ask for your assistance.</i>

803
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,409
<i>This is my problem to solve.</i>

804
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:50,829
<i>If I were in that situation,</i>
<i>would you turn your back on me?</i>

805
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,456
<i>Are we not friends, Deok-su?</i>

806
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:53,457
What…

807
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:56,210
<i>- You like Deok-su, do you not?</i>
- What?

808
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:58,504
Jun-hwa prepared all this for you.

809
01:10:58,587 --> 01:10:59,421
Jun-hwa.

810
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:02,716
<i>Why do you remain at Yongcheonru?</i>

811
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,468
I may be out of line, but--

812
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:05,552
I am also well aware

813
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:07,054
<i>of why I chose to come here</i>

814
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:09,556
<i>under an alias.</i>

815
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:13,269
<i>You seem highly interested for someone</i>
<i>who was against the gambling den.</i>

816
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:15,938
By the way, Eun-ho, where are you from?

817
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:19,900
About the Elementary kids
that you call "friends…"

818
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:23,362
You are the one
who backed me into this corner.

819
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:25,364
How much do you know about them?

820
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:26,991
<i>I know my friends well.</i>

821
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:29,618
<i>You know nothing.</i>

822
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:31,412
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

823
01:11:31,495 --> 01:11:34,873
