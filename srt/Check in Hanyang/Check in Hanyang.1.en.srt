ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS

FILMING FOR CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,630
- Let us go!
- Oh, no!

4
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,764
Let us keep going!

5
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,695
Okay, here we go.

6
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,035
Number two!

7
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,914
You guys!

8
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,292
Enjoy.

9
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,964
That man is Kim Man-dol.

10
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,178
- It is over! Man-dol won!
- Oh, my!

11
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,472
That is just unbelievable.

12
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,391
Man-dol, you are so lucky today.

13
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,863
I am Hong Deok-su
and I would like to join.

14
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,076
- What do you say?
- Hong Deok-su?

15
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,411
- Who is that?
- Who is he?

16
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,872
- Hong Deok-su?
- I have never seen him before.

17
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,708
So? Did you bring
some money to wager then?

18
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,049
You can start us off.

19
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,637
ROYAL PALACE

20
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,432
Let us go.

21
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:46,684
Stop right there.

22
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,020
Who goes there?

23
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,075
Prince Muyeong.

24
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,619
Bow down and show proper respect.

25
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:05,703
It is Prince Muyeong.

26
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,310
Let them go.

27
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,158
- A pair of twos!
- A pair of twos.

28
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,910
He is simply unstoppable.

29
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,746
So why did you keep going?
You lost everything.

30
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,837
Gosh. Did you run out of funds?

31
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,176
If you did, a deed for a house
or land could work.

32
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,223
- I should get going then.
- Stop!

33
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,479
The Yongcheonru Red Certificate!

34
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,357
- The Red Certificate!
- It is!

35
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,900
The precious Red Certificate?

36
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,902
Have you lost your mind?

37
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,739
The new-recruit exam pass for Yongcheonru!

38
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,657
Will you accept it?

39
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,117
My word.

40
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,996
And how do I know
that it is the real deal?

41
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,748
Unbelievable.

42
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,584
Are you blind or something?

43
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,544
Go ahead and take a closer look.

44
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,881
It is the same emblem
as the one on Yongcheonru's main gate.

45
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,890
Even the highest-ranking minister
in the land

46
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:52,185
cannot get into the new-recruit exam
without this.

47
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,771
The Red Certificate.

48
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,287
Open the gates!

49
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,507
YONGCHEONRU

50
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,804
Yongcheonru.

51
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:56,624
I shall wager this. Hong Deok-su!
You should wager all this.

52
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,293
Come on, now.

53
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,004
Let me see that.

54
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,842
Even so, I still need to check for myself.

55
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:18,146
Yes, this is the real deal indeed.

56
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,440
Fine.

57
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,568
Do not cry and beg for a refund later.

58
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,571
Unbelievable. You better not cry either.

59
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,616
Goodness me.

60
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,368
Single round.

61
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,453
Deal.

62
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,580
Let us go to the west gate.

63
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,136
POLICE BUREAU

64
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,723
Who are you?

65
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,935
Sir, please lend me your ear.

66
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,855
There is a huge…

67
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,943
- A pair of fives!
- You won!

68
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,120
You are set. It is already over!

69
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,580
It is over.

70
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,917
A pair of sixes!

71
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,338
A pair of sixes? How is that possible?

72
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,348
I won. All right.

73
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,892
Right, I should at least give you
a consolation prize.

74
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,062
Thank you for the fun game.

75
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,314
Brother Deok-su!

76
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,901
Please help me out.

77
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,445
It belongs to my guild.
My boss will kill me if he finds out.

78
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,989
We agreed to no refunds.

79
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,448
Please!

80
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,034
Brother Deok-su! Please have mercy on me!

81
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,661
- What the…
- I beg of you. Just this once.

82
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,871
- Please!
- Help yourselves!

83
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,838
- Come on. Move.
- Move!

84
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,007
Stop this instant!

85
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,010
Arrest every single one of them!

86
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,345
Finally.

87
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,488
Gu-sil.

88
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,537
Stop right there!

89
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,165
- Did you win the Red Certificate?
- Of course.

90
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,083
You really did it!

91
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,880
Stop right there!

92
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,591
Let us go.

93
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,675
Come on.

94
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,971
Hurry up!

95
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,983
YONGCHEONRU

96
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,997
ROYAL PALACE, YONGCHEONRU

97
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,750
<i>The palace built across</i>
<i>from the royal palace.</i>

98
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,877
<i>Yongcheonru.</i>

99
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,885
<i>Joseon's premier inn,</i>
<i>built on a site blessed by a dragon.</i>

100
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,473
<i>Its prestige is celebrated</i>
<i>throughout this land</i>

101
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,059
<i>and even in the West.</i>

102

00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,278
<i>Each guest is welcomed</i>

104
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,865
<i>in the most elegantly dignified fashion</i>

105
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,076
<i>as soon as they walk in.</i>

GEUMOK HALL

107
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,674
<i>They have every delicacy known to mankind.</i>

108
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,431
- Bring over the cabbage and green onions.
- Yes, I will get them.

109
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,892
Let us hurry up.

110
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:51,979
<i>And one could even be served</i>
<i>the king's royal meal if they desired it.</i>

111
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,401
<i>At Yongcheonru,</i>

112
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,446
<i>the guest is the king.</i>

113
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,412
<i>Joseon's unparalleled slice of heaven.</i>

114
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:20,424
<i>If you have the money,</i>
<i>nothing is out of reach.</i>

115
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:29,225
<i>And you can even be reborn</i>

116
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,240
<i>If you have the money,</i>

117
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,575
<i>anything is possible at Yongcheonru.</i>

118
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,543
<i>And that is all thanks to its employees.</i>

119
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,883
<i>These are dream jobs</i>
<i>for the youth of Hanyang,</i>

120
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:07,096
<i>where social classes do not matter</i>

121
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:16,689
<i>Yongcheonru becomes</i>
<i>fully realized in their hands.</i>

122
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,286
<i>And they are all led by…</i>

123
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,293
<i>the innkeeper.</i>

124
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,676
<i>My target is</i>

125
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,304
<i>the innkeeper.</i>

126
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:05,779
Let go of me! Is the queen still not back?

127
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,907
Tell her to come and pour me a drink!

128
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,033
Is that man…

129
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,118
If she is not around,
bring me a royal concubine!

130
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,037
Is he wearing the Dragon Robe?

131
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,957
My goodness!
You cannot do this out here, Your Majesty!

132
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,667
How dare that abominable man…

133
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,169
You cannot, Your Highness.

134
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,755
This is not the time.

135
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:23,923
Let go of me!

136
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,223
DOHWA HALL

137
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,069
It seems we have
uninvited guests in our midst.

138
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,365
Shall I dispatch the guards?

139
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,658
Let them be.

140
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:55,871
You cannot chase after every stray cat
that climbs over the fence.

141
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,566
Hand over my Red Certificate!

142
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,069
Hold on. Wait.

143
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,613
Just hand it over, and no one gets hurt.

144
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,949
Deok-su!

145
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,367
All right.

146
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,372
I will leave all my money here.
You can take it.

147
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:41,625
No, I do not want your money.
Just hand over the Red Certificate!

148
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,336
Do you really mean that?

149
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:49,216
I just return this to you,
and we are all good?

150
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,676
Yes, that is it.

151
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,639
Fine.

152
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,978
Here.

153
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:04,982
Take it.

154
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:10,863
Why, you little…

155
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,828
Gu-sil, you need to run. Get up.

156
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,538
Go on!

157
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,749
- Deok-su!
- Go, Gu-sil!

158
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,584
Go on!

159
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,379
Hand over my Red Certificate! It is mine!

160
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,135
Give me back my Red Certificate!

161
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:39,892
Stop!

162
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,041
Stop right there!

163
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,086
Stop!

164
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,680
Stop right there!

165
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,599
Stop!

166
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,989
Hand it over!

167
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,375
My Red Certificate!

168
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,751
Damn it!

169
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,671
Let go! Why, you little…

170
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,422
Let go!

171
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,306
Where do you think you are going?

172
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,059
Come here!

173
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,855
It is my Red Certificate! It is mine.

174
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,106
- Give it back.
- What the…

175
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,941
What are you doing?

176
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,943
Let go! Let go of me!

177
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,778
Give it back.

178
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,615
- Wait.
- Let go of me.

179
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,450
Let go of me already!

180
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,162
- Let go!
- Come on.

181
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,059
Are you all right?

182
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,606
Are you two from Yongcheonru?

183
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,733
Give it back. It is mine.

184
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,611
Wait, no. It is mine.

185
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:56,653
That is nonsense.

186
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,991
I mean… It belongs to my boss,

187
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,744
but he conned me
into going double or nothing--

188
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,206
Double or nothing?

189
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,418
No.

190
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,128
What I meant was…

191
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,088
You better tell the truth.

192
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,341
Hold on.

193
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,972
We are future apprentices of Yongcheonru.

194
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,600
That is the certificate that verifies it,
so please return it

195
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,852
and be on your way, my lords.

196
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,355
Future apprentices of Yongcheonru…

197
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,651
Do you even know
what you are getting yourself into?

198
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,737
Are you aware
of the abominable acts committed there

199
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,990
by the lawless and depraved?

200
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,827
I do not care about their abominable acts.
I just need to get in there.

201
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,914
- Mind your own affairs and be on your way.
- What did you say?

202
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,958
Yongcheonru is probably
more honest and just

203
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,669
than you two threatening me with swords.

204
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,926
These two going for double or nothing,

205
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,804
gambling and fighting
in the dead of night,

206
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,765
dare to speak of "honest and just"?

207
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,936
Did you say this belonged to you?

208
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:14,022
- Yes, it belongs to me, my lord.
- Seriously, going back on your word?

209
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,399
And you also claim

210
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,944
that it belongs to you.

211
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,446
What?

212
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,907
One certificate but two owners…

213
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,744
I have the ideal resolution.

214
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,471
I ripped it in half
because you appreciate "honest and just."

215
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,850
What do you think?
Share it. No need to fight.

216
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,687
I hope you both make it into Yongcheonru.

217
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:01,820
I am done for. I am ruined.

218
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,991
What have you done?

219
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,785
It becomes void if it is ripped!

220
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,373
You…

221
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:32,642
Attacking from behind like a coward,
and you talk about "honest and just"?

222
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,811
Do not make me laugh.

223
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:39,232
Then again, you are
aspiring Yongcheonru apprentices.

224
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,693
Shame must feel foreign to you.

225
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,905
You ripped someone else's certificate.
You are also--

226
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,537
You are just as cowardly.

227
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,668
I will use the blade
and not the sheath next time.

228
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,222
You will pay for this one day.

229
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:16,019
I will be sure to include assault
on your list of charges!

230
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,063
Let him be.

231
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,817
After all, I owe a debt
to the esteemed gentleman.

232
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,408
Damn it.

233
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,884
TAVERN

234
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,805
Hey, are you okay?

235
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:54,307
And the Red Certificate?
You have it, right?

236
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,523
What is wrong with this?
It is ripped in half!

237
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,817
How could you let this happen?

238
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:08,071
Darn it. How could he rip
my Red Certificate?

239
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,407
<i>I ripped it in half</i>
<i>because you appreciate "honest and just."</i>

240
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:14,035
Share it. No need to fight.
I hope you both make it into Yongcheonru.

241
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,997
That vile punk.

242
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,916
Who did this?
Was it that jerk Kim Man-dol?

243
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,918
No, it was some other jerk.

244
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:27,924
After all that work you put
into acquiring that darn certificate…

245
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,593
What are we going to do now?

246
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,179
We have no other choice.

247
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,471
Since we cannot undo it…

248
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,642
we just move on to the next step.

249
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,977
THIRTY

250
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,791
Here are the ten chests
of gold bars for this month.

251
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:30,005
You could have just sent them
in a palanquin.

252
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,426
Why come in person?

253
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:37,220
I am a shrewd businessman
down to the bone.

254
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:40,473
How could I possibly trust
my subordinates with gold?

255
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:45,228
It was my pleasure.
I enjoyed the tour of the royal palace.

256
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:50,358
Even the walls have eyes
in the royal palace.

257
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,403
The Minister of War will find out
soon enough.

258
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,406
No good can come from your presence.

259
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,826
For both you and me.

260
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:04,789
Then, perhaps Your Majesty could pay
a visit to Yongcheonru?

261
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:09,669
You could consider it a visit of goodwill
to your close friend.

262
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:10,920
"Close friend"?

263
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,551
You dare to consider yourself
my close friend?

264
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:20,847
You do utilize my coffers
as if they were your own, after all.

265
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,559
If I am not your close friend,
then what could I be?

266
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,687
You dare to insult me and the royal family

267
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,356
over some measly gold?

268
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,902
My deepest apologies.

269
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,155
My lack of knowledge
regarding moral principles and laws

270
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:40,075
has led my lowly self
to commit an unforgivable sin.

271
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:44,621
Therefore, starting this month,
as a show of repentance,

272
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:49,000
may I add 10 more chests
to make my monthly offerings 20?

273
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:54,172
This lowly creature has committed
an unforgivable sin to His Majesty.

274
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,883
You must command what you desire

275
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,469
for me to have any hope
for your forgiveness.

276
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:01,388
I await your command.

277
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,598
What do you desire, Your Majesty?

278
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:14,943
And if he desires Yongcheonru?

279
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,512
I shall hand it over.

280
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,482
Your reputation certainly precedes you.

281
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,568
Your tongue is sharper than a sword.

282
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,738
Do you not agree, Father?

283
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:03,783
And why have you shown up unannounced
in the dead of night?

284
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,201
Forgive me, Father.

285
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:09,998
I ignored the rules of etiquette
because I had an urgent request.

286
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,125
A request?

287
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,963
Did you say you were willing
to offer anything?

288
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,467
Yes, Your Highness. I await your command.

289
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,888
I hear Yongcheonru is accepting
new apprentices this season.

290
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,849
I would like to join

291
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:31,686
to acquire some expert business acumen.
What do you say?

292
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:36,441
Prince Muyeong.
What in the world are you saying?

293
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:41,696
"The power of gold is
what feeds the people."

294
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,492
That is what you have taught me
time and time again, Father.

295
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:50,580
Therefore, I would like
to master the craft of business myself.

296
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,000
I beseech you for your royal permission.

297
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,376
However,

298
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,713
even with His Majesty's royal permission,

299
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,423
if you enter Yongcheonru,

300
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:04,636
you will also have to learn
as one of the lowly apprentices.

301
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,388
What did you say?

302
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:13,478
That is the way of Yongcheonru.

303
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:16,231
Regardless of class or background,

304
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,024
one must start at the bottom

305
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:22,153
and survive the hardships
to claw their way to the top.

306
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:26,157
That is the very teaching
we bestow upon our apprentices.

307
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,577
Would you mind that, Your Highness?

308
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:34,624
Not at all.

309
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,585
The future crown prince possesses

310
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:41,130
such modesty and audacity.

311
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:44,926
Having such a dependable son
must be quite reassuring.

312
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,595
You are in no place
to commend me for such matters.

313
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:52,100
I shall review
Prince Muyeong's request later.

314
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,686
Leave me now.

315
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,334
<i>You wish to join Yongcheonru?</i>

316
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,962
Why would you dare
to take such initiative?

317
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,799
I am aware what you seek is
inside Yongcheonru.

318
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,469
What is it? Please tell me, Father.

319
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,523
There is a shadow ledger.

320
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:47,196
It is the one weakness
of those wrapping me around their fingers.

321
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:53,870
We must find it if we wish to eradicate
the parties who scorn the throne.

322
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,790
Then I shall find it as soon as possible.

323
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,954
The brass key.

324
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:39,791
That is the only key
to the safe which holds the shadow ledger.

325
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,966
Those two pieces must come together
to open the safe.

326
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,009
It cannot be opened by one alone.

327
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:55,348
That despicable Cheon has hidden
one of them somewhere in Yongcheonru

328
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,725
and is looking for the other.

329
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,981
Prince Muyeong, you must find it first.

330
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:10,071
They seated me on this royal throne
to be their puppet

331
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,824
for the sake of their personal gains.

332
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:19,580
Finding that shadow ledger is the only way
to safeguard this feeble throne

333
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,792
and the royal line.

334
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,180
For the sake of the sovereignty and state,

335
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,684
and to relieve you of your distress…

336
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,104
I shall go in there myself

337
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,065
and find that key.

338
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:24,956
Get them!

339
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,791
12 YEARS AGO

340
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,376
Hand over the safe!

341
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,096
Jae-on.

342
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:41,973
Father.

343
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,058
Let us go. Hurry!

344
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,245
Father.

345
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,165
I am very scared.

346
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,293
I know, my dear child.

347
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:11,961
All right.

348
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,701
You must keep this safe.

349
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,245
You can never lose it.

350
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:48,956
Do you understand?

351
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,336
From now on, you shall live as a boy.

352
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,341
Run far away. As far as you can.

353
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:02,470
You must never go near Yongcheonru.
Do you understand?

354
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,829
Find Hong Min-sik's daughter!

355
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,081
Search thoroughly!

356
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,290
She must be nearby!

357
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,071
After staying out all night
like some stray cat,

358
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,198
you dare touch my meat?

359
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,994
Why would you even bother crawling back?

360
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,246
Come on, now.

361
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,374
I am going to have you living
in the lap of luxury real soon.

362
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,712
You are going to regret it
if you continue treating me like this.

363
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,255
You will be filled with remorse.

364
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,217
Lap of luxury, my foot!

365
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,511
- Welcome.
- Come on in!

366
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,935
- Have a seat.
- Welcome.

367
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,272
- What can I get you?
- Two soups with rice.

368
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,523
Sure.

369
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,651
WANTED
REPORT TO KIM DU-PAL

370
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,451
It has been a while,
but I guess the search is back on.

371
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,703
Her dad must be some big shot.

372
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,206
They are offering 100 nyang for any tip.

373
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,249
They just started the search back up.

374
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,085
She must be dead after ten years.

375
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,252
Come on, now.

376
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:43,214
Right, surely she must be dead by now.

377
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,007
Excuse me.

378
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,842
- Make it quick.
- Sure thing.

379
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,511
A generous portion.

380
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,941
- Come back next time.
- Sure.

381
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,317
Take care now.

382
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,404
Hello there. Are you looking for some dye?

383
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,989
- Is this it?
- It is of the highest quality.

384
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:12,326
- I will take that.
- Thank you, kind sir.

385
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,619
Hey, Deok-su!

386
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,290
Do you need something else?

387
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,337
Let me see here…

388
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,257
Hold on. Let me see that one.

389
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,508
- This one?
- Yes.

390
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,802
Here you go.

391
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,721
This will do.

392
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,724
Let me get a bundle of this.

393
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:39,395
Sure. You have got quite a discerning eye.
I will wrap it right up for you.

394
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:42,940
This is nice.

395
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,203
- Hey, take a look at this.
- Yes?

396
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,497
It was imported from the Qing.

397
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,458
Oh, my.

398
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,960
My goodness.

399
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,295
You look like a clown bride.

400
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:08,340
As if you know anything, Hong Deok-su.

401
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,843
- Do you? What do you know?
- Goodness.

402
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,219
Stop it.

403
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,345
I need to concentrate.

404
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,244
That looks just like the real one.

405
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,457
You will forge the royal seal
in no time at that rate.

406
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,541
Of course.

407
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:45,252
I am the Hong Deok-su.

408
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:49,673
You are willing to do all this
just to get into Yongcheonru?

409
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:52,843
Yes.

410
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,848
There is someone I need to meet.

411
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,435
What? Who?

412
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:36,011
The lady tends to suffer
from a persistent minor cough.

413
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,305
Avoid using flowers with excessive pollen.

414
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:39,974
Yes, my lady.

415
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,803
I set aside some agarwood from the West
for deserving subjects.

416
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,222
Shall I send some to the palace?

417
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,391
The palace?

418
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,351
No need.

419
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,939
What will you do about Prince Muyeong?

420
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:35,988
The king must be having him search
for the brass key.

421
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,451
They are just scurrying around
in the palm of my hand.

422
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,286
GRAND PROPRIETOR

423
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,580
Let them have at it.

424
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,491
Uncle!

425
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,243
Eun, do not run!

426
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,162
- Uncle!
- Eun!

427
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,749
My goodness! Why, it is Prince Muyeong.

428
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:31,502
Dear brother.

429
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,505
I see you are
with the crown prince, Your Majesty.

430
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,258
You must behave in His Majesty's presence.

431
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,469
Let him be.

432
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,805
Let my adorable nephew be.

433
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,480
Brother, do you have a cold?

434
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,276
Are you worried about his health?

435
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,446
I shall protect you if you are sick.

436
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,740
What comforting words.

437
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:05,994
All right. Prince Muyeong,
be sure to keep him safe in the future.

438
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,704
Can you promise me that?

439
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,039
Yes, Your Majesty.

440
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:18,799
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

441
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,384
Brother!

442
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,471
Father!

443
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,516
Father!

444
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,565
<i>Father!</i>

445
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,569
<i>Father…</i>

446
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,363
It is late. What are you doing there?

447
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:04,928
Has the physician come by?

448
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:07,139
Yes.

449
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,975
But with tonics day and night,

450
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:11,977
the physician
only provides more suffering.

451
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:17,900
You must take care of yourself
and hang in there, Brother.

452
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,527
The royal line must be steadfast.

453
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,031
Is Uncle…

454
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:28,702
I mean, is His Majesty doing well?

455
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:33,123
You must prioritize
his and your well-being over mine.

456
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:34,833
Promise me that.

457
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:03,737
Twenty-eight.

458
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:06,823
Are you sure you will be all right alone?

459
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,411
I must be.
We only have one Red Certificate.

460
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,704
What choice do we have?

461
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:15,415
I will be sure to remain in your vicinity.

462
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,430
Beom-ho?

463
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,974
What are you doing?

464
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,822
TWENTY-EIGHT

465
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,575
Yongcheonru.

466
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:10,887
What is that?

467
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,765
My goodness. Look at all this.

468
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:16,560
What is going on here?

469
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,147
That is a meaty chicken.

470
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,274
So you are really going?

471
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:30,741
I told Gu-sil to help you out
with the cooking.

472
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:35,037
Do not get up at the crack of dawn
to prepare it all by yourself. Okay?

473
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,289
You never listen to your mother.

474
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,208
Do not even think about coming back.

475
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:44,171
Eat. Fill your belly.

476
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:49,134
Food must be eaten when it is warm.
It is no good when cold.

477
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,971
You must never skip meals,
wherever you are.

478
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:54,431
- Okay.
- Got that?

479
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,898
Why must you insist on going there?

480
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:06,026
You do not need to worry about me.
I will be safe.

481
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,407
When are you coming back?

482
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,493
After about a month?

483
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:16,745
Who knows? Maybe sooner if I get fired.

484
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,706
Even if you do not get fired,

485
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,084
just make sure you do not get exposed.

486
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,004
I will.

487
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,177
- You should have some too.
- I am good.

488
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,970
- Come on. Open up.
- No.

489
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,138
- Go on.
- My goodness.

490
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,724
Open up. Go on.

491
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:41,895
Is it not good? So good, right?

492
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:43,480
- Have some more.
- No, I am fine.

493
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:45,565
Let us eat it together. Come on.

494
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,026
- You eat it all.
- No, eat it with me.

495
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,654
- You have a long journey…
- Then I will not eat it either.

496
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:52,489
Okay, fine. We will eat it together.

497
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:55,450
- Eat up.
- This one is mine. Where is yours?

498
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,827
ESCAPE FROM THE HEAT
GOLDEN ICE

499
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,672
When are they going to let us in?

500
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:54,384
I am going to die waiting
for this golden ice or whatever.

501
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:58,180
How precious is this golden dish for them
to only make five servings per day?

502
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:03,310
Unbelievable. This is all just
a sales tactic at the end of the day.

503
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,896
Do not worry, my lady.
Our palanquin is the fifth in line.

504
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,355
You will taste it today.

505
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,900
Make way. Move aside.

506
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:12,778
And who is that?
Why are they getting in before us?

507
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:17,282
Stop right there.

508
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:19,451
- Who are you to cut the line?
- Who is that?

509
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,621
What is all this commotion about?

510
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:25,832
There is no more golden ice for the day.
I am the fifth and last serving.

511
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:30,337
Do you know who I am? Let us go in.

512
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,464
- Who are you to cut the line?
- Move it!

513
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,175
- My goodness!
- What in the world?

514
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,760
Madam!

515
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,766
Welcome. We have been waiting for you.

516
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,520
See?

517
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,651
One should respect order.

518
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,946
Order? What order?

519
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,365
It is only right to follow the order
if there is a line.

520
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,282
He is right!

521
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:02,869
You can go to the police bureau
way over there to argue right and wrong.

522
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:03,870
This is Yongcheonru.

523
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,915
It has its own code of law and order.

524
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,334
This way, madam.

525
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:17,384
Thank you for stepping in
and taking my side.

526
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,719
Compensation will not be necessary.
Take care.

527
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:20,929
Excuse me.

528
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:25,559
I have a novel idea.
Would you like to hear it?

529
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:26,643
Look here.

530
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,397
A shortsighted scheme
may seem useful at first,

531
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,482
but it will leave a dishonorable stain.

532
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:36,027
Right. Such awe-inspiring words. Thanks.

533
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:40,365
So, what exactly is
this useful, shortsighted scheme?

534
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:44,744
My scheme will indeed leave
a bit of a dirty stain.

535
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,712
What should we do?

536
00:52:57,257 --> 00:53:00,260
Let us just wait
and see what happens for a moment.

537
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,344
Yes, my lady.

538
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,389
YEONHWA HALL
RESTAURANTS IN YONGCHEONRU

539
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:10,604
It has been a while, Lord Yu.

540
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:14,232
Yeonhwa Hall is already
so bustling this early in the morning.

541
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:18,153
Word has spread throughout the capital
about how tasty the golden ice is.

542
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:22,198
I am also here to taste
that famous golden ice.

543
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,201
That must be the golden ice.

544
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:28,038
My goodness.
I have only ever heard about it.

545
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,755
It is my first time seeing it.

546
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:39,549
What a precious dish.

547
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,850
You always go above and beyond for me.

548
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,810
Thank you, madam.

549
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:55,857
This is one of the five daily servings
of the golden ice that we serve.

550
00:53:55,941 --> 00:54:00,111
Unfortunately, that is why
I missed my chance to taste it.

551
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,449
I shall now take my leave. Enjoy.

552
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,494
Hold on.

553
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,579
What have you done?

554
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,623
Pardon?

555
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,125
This is no golden ice.

556
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,461
- What?
- Pardon?

557
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:19,714
It certainly is. It was
just freshly prepared in Yeonhwa Hall.

558
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,676
Did you think you could trick
her ladyship like this

559
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,344
because it is her first time?

560
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:28,264
Golden ice should be served
with a heavy dollop of condensed milk.

561
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,976
I do not even see
a single drop of it here.

562
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:33,019
Well… That is a misunderstanding…

563
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,229
Tell me the truth!

564
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,399
It is because

565
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:40,860
first-time tasters could experience
an upset stomach after having it--

566
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:44,781
Are you sure it was not left out
because it is a pricey condiment?

567
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,702
If you lack the funds, I will gladly pay.

568
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,329
So serve her a proper bowl
of golden ice immediately.

569
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,498
Stop underestimating
and fooling your guest.

570
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:54,874
That will not be necessary!

571
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,669
Fetch me a dollop of condensed milk now.

572
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,921
I do not care how much it costs.

573
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:02,882
Bring me every last drop
in this establishment!

574
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,093
Yes, madam.

575
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:25,989
Golden ice is a summer confection
of finely shaved ice

576
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:28,950
with simmered red beans, fruit,
and condensed milk on top.

577
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:29,909
So?

578
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:34,873
The noblewoman who just walked in had
an undoubtedly pale and frail face.

579
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:36,583
Her constitution must be weak.

580
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,877
And what does her face have to do
with golden ice?

581
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,298
A weak constitution and condensed milk are

582
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,008
an ill-fated match.

583
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:47,093
You cannot eat so much of it, madam.

584
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,429
Please stop there. My goodness.

585
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:52,432
What is wrong?

586
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,768
What is it?

587
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:03,485
Goodness me! It happened.

588
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:05,528
You have an upset stomach now.

589
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:10,366
That is what happens when you are greedy.

590
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,243
Goodness me!

591
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:14,287
<i>She suffered in the restroom</i>

592
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,790
and went home just now.

593
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,043
Lord Yu tried to stop her,

594
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:22,212
but she consumed
all of the condensed milk.

595
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,343
Another guest at Yeonhwa Hall
suggested condensed milk to her?

596
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:29,719
Yes, my lady.

597
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,648
It must have been that boy
who had the face of a sly fox.

598
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,317
What an adorable rascal he is.

599
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:49,531
I hope there will be such clever ones
in the upcoming recruitment intake.

600
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:52,450
No.

601
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:56,788
Maybe they would only give me a headache.

602
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:14,973
You are all set.

603
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:16,433
Go on up.

604
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:27,527
Listen. The apprentices can collect
their supplies after registering.

605
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,338
- Excuse me.
- Jeez!

606
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,967
Why are you so startled?

607
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:54,053
Maybe your petite physique comes
with equally frail nerves?

608
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,891
My name is Cheon Jun-hwa.

609
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,769
Okay. I am Hong Deok-su.

610
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:05,607
No, I was not asking for a handshake.

611
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:06,941
Help me carry this instead.

612
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:09,194
Two grown men should not hold
each other's hands.

613
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:11,738
Seriously?

614
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:19,496
I did not know we could only bring
two bundles per person when we enrolled.

615
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,789
I only found out
after I came with all this.

616
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,918
Too bad. My heart goes out to you, really.

617
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,419
It is indeed terrible.

618
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,506
But what can I do?
I cannot just toss out my belongings.

619
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:34,594
Since you only have one bundle,

620
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:37,555
holding my third one would
only complete you.

621
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:39,682
No thanks.

622
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:42,393
Right.

623
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,229
A merchant must know how to deal.

624
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:49,275
These bundles are filled
with jerky and other snacks.

625
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:53,780
I heard this program is arduous
and you find yourself constantly famished.

626
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,615
Proceed that way.

627
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,537
I will give you a tenth of mine.

628
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:06,084
- Make that five-tenths.
- Five-tenths?

629
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:10,213
What sort of merchant asks for half
for such a short delivery?

630
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:12,507
You can just toss it
if you do not like it.

631
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:15,051
Two-tenths.

632
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:16,886
Two-tenths. Final offer.

633
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:20,890
This jerky is from Damyang. Heard of it?
Top-grade and enjoyed by the king.

634
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:21,933
Five-tenths.

635
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:29,065
I am being robbed in broad daylight
as soon as I arrive.

636
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,278
Fine. Five-tenths.

637
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:41,202
Now, half of this bundle is mine, right?

638
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:42,912
A deal has been struck, so yes.

639
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,930
Goodness. Thank you for your service.

640
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,285
Excuse me.

641
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:46,100
RECEPTION DESK

642
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:56,944
Attention.

643
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:11,376
My name is Bang Sa-seon.

644
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:13,002
I will be your mentor here.

645
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:17,548
Since you have enrolled in Gyohwa Hall,
you are now mere pupae.

646
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:19,967
What exactly is a pupa?

647
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:21,260
Just another bug.

648
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,970
You are past the caterpillar stage

649
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:26,307
but still nowhere near being a butterfly.
A pupa.

650
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:27,975
A pest! Got that?

651
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,770
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

652
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:34,023
In Yongcheonru, you will be assessed
only on your achievements.

653
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:38,403
You could climb up with merit points,

654
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:41,614
or come crashing down with demerit points.

655
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,950
What happens when you hit rock bottom?

656
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:46,160
You will be kicked out immediately.

657
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:53,626
Now, all you pupae will swiftly
get changed and gather in the front yard.

658
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:57,046
The order of your arrival is crucial.
What happens if you are late?

659
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,464
Death.

660
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,135
What are you standing around for? Move it!

661
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,347
Where do we…

662
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,816
Wait. Here?

663
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,410
Pardon me.

664
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:53,644
Did you see the uniform
that was just here?

665
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:55,229
Let go of me! Jeez.

666
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,881
You! It is you! The ripper!

667
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:25,384
You are a Yongcheonru apprentice too?

668
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:30,097
So that is why you ripped my certificate.
You rotten jerk!

669
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:35,853
Have you lost your mind?

670
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,563
I just need a moment.

671
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,398
Just a moment, my foot!

672
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:40,483
Get off me!

673
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:47,865
Come on, now. Use your words.

674
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:50,618
Darn it. Insane bastard.

675
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:52,912
You just ripped my shirt.
Should I rip yours too?

676
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:55,122
You just need to show me once.
It will be quick.

677
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:57,250
Come on, now. Hold on.

678
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,919
Such vigorous quarreling on the first day.

679
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:03,005
That is youth for you.
A strong first impression.

680
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,049
Just show me what is
under your undergarment.

681
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:07,468
Look here.

682
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:11,222
Why are you trying to see
another man's bare chest?

683
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:13,140
That is some bullshit. What is with you?

684
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:17,186
"Bare chest"? Such abominable phrasing.

685
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:18,813
Watch it, now.

686
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:20,273
Dirty bastard.

687
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,109
Such insolence!
How dare you call me dirty!

688
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:24,443
You scoundrel!

689
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,113
- Stop it.
- Look here.

690
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:28,364
Let go of him.

691
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:30,575
I just need to check once. Just once.

692
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:32,910
We are both men.
What do you need to check? Let go!

693
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:35,496
A scuffle on the first day
will get you kicked out.

694
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:36,455
Just let go of him.

695
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,457
Hold on.
I think our uniforms were switched.

696
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:39,792
Who are you?

697
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:45,965
- Let go and talk it out.
- They were switched!

698
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:47,049
It would not take long.

699
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:54,473
Move those feet swiftly.

700
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,852
Do you not grasp the concept of ranking?

701
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,439
Lady Seol, what brings you here?

702
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:05,401
Yongcheonru just welcomed new trainees.
Of course I should be here.

703
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:07,028
Yes, my lady.

704
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:13,034
Move it!

705
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:18,539
Faster! Your arrivals will be ranked!

706
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,008
Do not do this here!

707
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,635
That is my uniform.

708
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:32,511
You have eyes. Use them and look.

709
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,972
Mine is clearly bigger.

710
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:36,098
Bigger?

711
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:38,392
Who is bigger? Well?

712
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:40,436
I am telling you, that is my uniform.

713
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:49,153
- Let go of me!
- What are you scoundrels doing?

714
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,783
Demerit points for all you scoundrels!

715
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,190
12 YEARS AGO

716
01:06:26,273 --> 01:06:28,192
Find Hong Min-sik!

717
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,319
Where is the safe?

718
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,029
Find Hong Min-sik!

719
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:34,532
Hand over the safe!

720
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:36,575
Where is the safe?

721
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:39,870
Where is Hong Min-sik?

722
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:42,665
You must keep this safe.

723
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:44,709
You can never lose it.

724
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,087
Do you understand?

725
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:51,298
From now on, you shall live as a boy.

726
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,221
Once you climb over this wall,

727
01:06:57,304 --> 01:07:00,808
you will no longer be Hong Jae-on.

728
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:05,521
But I am Hong Jae-on.

729
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:08,899
I am Hong Jae-on, your daughter.

730
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:11,736
No! You are no longer my daughter!

731
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:15,656
No one can know you are Hong Jae-on

732
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,743
or that you are a girl. Do you understand?

733
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:25,791
Yes.

734
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:27,793
All right.

735
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:29,420
Let us go.

736
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:35,801
- Go on.
- Find Hong Min-sik!

737
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:41,891
Go on. Now!

738
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,521
Go.

739
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:50,269
<i>I saw the brass key.</i>

740
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:52,980
<i>It was not Lord Cheon.</i>
<i>Someone else had it.</i>

741
01:09:53,063 --> 01:09:56,859
<i>What is his true identity?</i>

742
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:58,986
Could there be something you are hiding?

743
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:01,864
<i>He sure is a weird one.</i>
<i>I am staying clear of him.</i>

744
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:03,824
Such fine, delicate hands.

745
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:05,492
This is how a true man studies.

746
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:06,452
<i>Something is not right.</i>

747
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:09,914
<i>Darn it. Lee Eun-ho?</i>
<i>I have to share a room with him?</i>

748
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:12,499
You are hiding something under there.

749
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:13,834
Damn it. Seriously?

750
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:15,252
<i>Watch yourself, Deok-su.</i>

751
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:17,671
Hey, Lee Eun-ho. Why, you little…

752
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:19,298
What are you looking at?

753
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:22,009
Hong Deok-su.
You cannot be expelled just yet.

754
01:10:22,092 --> 01:10:23,761
<i>I am telling you to behave.</i>

755
01:10:23,844 --> 01:10:25,387
Where does the innkeeper stay?

756
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:28,307
<i>A man was killed for his Red Certificate.</i>

757
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:32,853
One desired Yongcheonru so much
that he killed for a spot?

758
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:34,063
And where is the other half?

759
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:35,606
Who goes there?

760
01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:37,608
<i>Someone must have forged</i>
<i>the stolen Red Certificate</i>

761
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:39,193
<i>to join Gyohwa Hall.</i>

762
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:41,570
<i>Lady Seol,</i>
<i>I have been wanting to meet you.</i>

763
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:46,659
