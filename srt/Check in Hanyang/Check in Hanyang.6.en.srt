1
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,793
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,128
FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,467
Elementary Room cannot pass!

4
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,513
They do not even have
the right to be tested.

5
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,475
Therefore, their passing is also invalid.

6
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,435
- Kim Myeong-ho!
- Hong Deok-su…

7
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,733
He is a girl.

8
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,458
This wench dared

9
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,252
to deceive Yongcheonru!

10
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,923
And she dared to take the apprentice exam.

11
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,599
She deserves the harshest of punishments.

12
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,393
Kim Myeong-ho. Shut that mouth of yours.

13
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,103
Hong Deok-su.

14
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,482
Confess in front of everyone now!

15
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,410
Why you…

16
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:37,949
Are you okay?

17
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,752
Will you take responsibility
for your claim?

18
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,049
If you are accusing the innocent…

19
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,223
you will pay with your life,
Kim Myeong-ho.

20
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,227
Why should I

21
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,023
when she is the one lying?

22
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,278
I apologize, my lady.

23
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,572
They lack etiquette
since they are apprentices.

24
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,326
I will give them an earful,
so please head inside.

25
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,830
Will you let it slide like this,
Lady Seol?

26
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:29,459
Our esteemed guest is staying here.
Why are you causing a ruckus?

27
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:57,111
I came to bid you farewell since you are
leaving for Onyang tomorrow morning.

28
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:02,700
I was also here to bid farewell.

29
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,454
That is wrong, Lord Cheon.

30
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,122
Kim Myeong-ho.

31
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,125
That is enough.

32
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,338
Lady Seol, allow me
to dismiss the apprentices.

33
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,510
Return to your quarters
and let Her Ladyship rest.

34
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,553
Follow me.

35
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,176
So, was the outing enjoyable?

36
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,187
Nothing happens in Yongcheonru

37
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,815
without me knowing.

38
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,322
They were following my orders.

39
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,908
So do not reprimand anyone, Lord Cheon.

40
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,869
Reprimand them?

41
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,582
I should handsomely reward them
for making you happy.

42
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,753
Also…

43
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:41,007
I will come up with a good excuse
to tell the Minister of War.

44
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,678
Thank you.

45
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,354
I apologize.

46
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,649
Due to its urgent nature, I tended
to the matter before reporting it.

47
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,279
Was this
the Elementary apprentices' doing again?

48
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,614
Including Jun-hwa?

49
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,324
Yes.

50
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:10,078
Despite the trouble they caused,
they managed to win Her Ladyship over.

51
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,705
The heavens must be watching over them.

52
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,586
The heavens are watching over them?

53
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,967
That is Jun-hwa's fate.

54
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,888
He was born to be lucky
and to gather people around him.

55
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:38,606
Speaking of which, read the fortunes
of the other Elementary apprentices.

56
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,797
Faster.

57
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,134
Make haste!

58
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,481
As your instructor,

59
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,358
I am deeply disappointed in you.

60
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,528
You may be each other's competition,

61
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,405
but scheming against your opponents--

62
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,739
However,

63
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,200
Lady Seol wants to let it slide, so why--

64
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,162
You and your "however"s!

65
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,415
There is always an excuse
for everything with you!

66
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,750
Enough with the excuses!

67
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:44,464
This will not do.
So that you can be true colleagues,

68
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,757
I will offer a helping hand.

69
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:47,967
Do you hear me?

70
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,469
- Yes, Master.
- Yes, Master.

71
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,095
Louder!

72
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,221
- Yes, Master!
- Yes, Master!

73
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,225
Give me ten jumping jacks.

74
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,561
Do not say the last count.

75
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,188
Proceed!

76
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,981
- Proceed.
- Proceed.

77
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,150
- One, two, three.
- One.

78
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,027
- Two.
- Two.

79
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,070
- Three.
- Three.

80
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,239
- Four.
- Four.

81
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,199
- Five.
- Five.

82
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,159
- Six.
- Six.

83
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:14,911
- Seven.
- Seven.

84
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:16,704
- Eight.
- Eight.

85
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,247
- Nine.
- Nine.

86
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,916
Ten.

87
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:25,671
Focus, you brats!
Lie down on your stomachs.

88
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,216
Move it! On your stomachs.

89
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,926
- On our stomachs.
- On our stomachs.

90
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,137
On your backs.

91
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,350
On your stomachs.

92
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,644
On your backs!

93
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,063
- On your stomachs.
- Damn it.

94
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,232
- Who said "Damn it"?
- That is enough.

95
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,400
Number 28. Hang in there a bit more.

96
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,111
On your backs.

97
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,322
You brats! Do it properly.

98
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,448
On your stomachs.

99
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,847
I will win, no matter what.

100
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,394
I will win, no matter what.

101
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:37,868
<i>Hong Deok-su…</i>

102
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,205
<i>is a girl.</i>

103
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,801
I have always wanted
to meet you, Lady Seol.

104
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,457
Hong Jae-on.

105
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,461
Is it really you?

106
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,709
Well, to tell the truth,

107
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,797
there is something I have not told you.

108
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:17,760
You see--

109
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,345
Was it because of the scar on his arm?

110
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,846
What?

111
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,390
I am talking about that fool.

112
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:26,644
Maybe he has not shown his body
because of that scar.

113
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,604
But such a scar is nothing.

114
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:29,897
I mean, every man

115
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,483
has at least one or two scars on his body.

116
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:33,901
Probably.

117
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:37,321
That would be the case for a man.
Of course.

118
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,949
By the way, that despicable Kim Myeong-ho

119
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,118
did not apologize for ripping his shirt.

120
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,411
I will have him pay

121
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,831
for the disrespect he showed today.

122
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,292
Maybe I should order his legs to be wrung.

123
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:54,880
Anyway, Eun-ho.

124
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,259
What is wrong with you?

125
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,847
- What?
- This is unlike you.

126
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,891
You were overly worked up.

127
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,768
Right.

128
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,313
Well, I…

129
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,943
I mean, we.

130
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,656
It is only natural

131
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,451
for a man of virtue
to be against injustice.

132
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,580
<i>You all must be hiding some secret.</i>

133
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:31,083
Could that secret possibly be…

134
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,336
Hong Deok-su?

135
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,175
No way. My father also died young.

136
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,303
We need to be successful for sure.

137
00:12:58,944 --> 00:12:59,945
Hong Deok-su.

138
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,239
Are you okay?

139
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,533
Yes.

140
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,826
I must ask this.

141
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,417
I am shattered.

142
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,047
We had to roll at least ten times more

143
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,174
because Sang-u kept saying the last count.

144
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,300
You fool.

145
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,887
By the way, Myeong-ho…

146
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,015
what if Hong Deok-su is actually a man?

147
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,225
He is right.

148
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,602
He seemed more athletic
than Sang-u earlier.

149
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,145
Shut it.

150
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,897
Are you saying I spoke nonsense?

151
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,273
Gosh, no.

152
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,568
But now that Lord Cheon knows,
it might get us in bigger trouble.

153
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,655
We just need evidence
that proves he is a girl.

154
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,491
Pardon? What kind of proof?

155
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,118
Irrefutable evidence!

156
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,496
What? How will we…

157
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,542
Move over.

158
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,126
Look at yourselves.

159
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:00,256
Even Hong Deok-su will take a bath today.

160
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,510
We must trap her and catch her red-handed.

161
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,616
I am off to bathe. Do you want to join?

162
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,453
I will wash up later. You go ahead.

163
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,956
Right, go ahead.

164
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,884
- Hong Deok-su.
- I said I would wash up later.

165
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,176
That scar on your arm.

166
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,513
It is nothing.

167
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,644
It is normal for one to get hurt in life

168
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,396
and suffer wounds that leave scars.

169
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,028
You do not need to go
out of your way to hide it.

170
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,926
GEUMUI CHAMBER

171
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:31,180
You have a bright future ahead of you.

172
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,976
You could have told me
that you needed a room.

173
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,360
Goodness me.

174
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,988
Has it already been reported to you?

175
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,033
I just wanted

176
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,911
to have a relaxing bath alone.
It has been a while.

177
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:59,917
It must have been difficult for you
to shower with others.

178
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,252
Yes, well…

179
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:06,048
I figured I could use
a quiet night by myself.

180
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,153
Did you ask for me?

181
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,615
Beom-ho, I have
an important mission for you.

182
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,120
Grand Proprietor Cheon will attend
the appointment ceremony

183
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,621
for Yongcheonru's apprentices.

184
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,872
While he is there,

185
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,126
you will search his residence.

186
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,877
Have you finally found out
where he resides?

187
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,046
He invited me to his residence.

188
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,217
His arrogance got the best of him,
and he revealed where he resides.

189
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,720
We must seize this opportunity.

190
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,224
ELEMENTARY ROOM

191
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,685
Why is she not coming out?

192
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,774
Hey. There she is.

193
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,692
Shut it.

194
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,033
It is as you predicted.

195
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,160
She is leaving the room at night alone.

196
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,086
- Should we follow her now?
- No, not yet.

197
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,802
- She stopped.
- Why did she?

198
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,497
- She left.
- Come on. Go.

199
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,456
Right. Okay.

200
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,118
It does not look like
she is going to bathe.

201
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,411
Dirty bastard.

202
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,664
She is set on not taking a bath.

203
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,137
It is not over yet, Hong Deok-su.

204
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:02,432
You will trip over something and fall.

205
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,769
- Trip.
- Trip.

206
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,272
Trip.

207
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,068
- Yes!
- Nice!

208
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:16,947
Darn it.

209
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,786
I had better take a bath.

210
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,415
The heavens must be
on your side, Myeong-ho.

211
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,333
Shut it.

212
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,670
This is why I said
we needed to catch her red-handed.

213
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,423
We will use this to get rid
of all of the Elementary jerks.

214
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,970
Off she goes. Let us follow.

215
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,666
Hong Deok-su, my friend!

216
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,051
Where did he go?

217
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,056
He would appreciate this.

218
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,268
I found it on the ground.

219
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,065
It was not to help you per se.

220
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:37,611
Wash up already. You are dirty.

221
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,449
No, that will not do.

222
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,065
That scar. It is Hong Deok-su for sure.

223
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,566
Barge in and get her.

224
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,236
Myeong-ho, those ill-bred brats
are done for.

225
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:46,013
What… What am I looking at?

226
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,265
That is a man.

227
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,729
What are you looking at?

228
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,314
It is nothing.

229
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,149
Who is lurking over there?

230
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,487
Myeong-ho, wait!

231
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,489
Shut that trap.

232
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,200
- Only you were here.
- Myeong-ho, we must go!

233
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,410
No…

234
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,996
You must die for me to live.

235
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,874
If you want what is best for your family,

236
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,294
do what you have to do.

237
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,214
But Myeong-ho…

238
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,599
- Why you…
- My lord.

239
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,933
Hold on.

240
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,102
Goodness.

241
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,274
What are you doing here?

242
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,569
- No, I--
- Why were you watching it?

243
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,739
- Why, you brat?
- That is not it.

244
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,240
This is wrong!

245
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,867
Why did you do this?

246
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,453
Tell me why you did this!

247
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,822
Thank you for helping me, Su-ra.

248
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,536
And I am sorry I kept the truth from you.

249
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,167
You probably had a reason
to live as a man.

250
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,798
We both have families to take care of.

251
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,347
Do not worry.

252
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,266
Your secret is safe with me.

253
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,435
Right.

254
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,841
Hey.

255
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,969
It was Hong Deok-su
we saw last night, right?

256
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,637
I am sure of it.

257
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,015
I even saw the scar on his arm.

258
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:37,851
It was not just the scar.
I know what I saw.

259
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,312
He was one manly man.

260
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,858
It is a relief that Sang-u
was the only one who got caught.

261
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,693
Shut your traps.

262
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,333
I see that someone is missing.

263
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,211
Shut it, Namhae Guild.

264
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:09,341
What is it?
Did something not go as planned?

265
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,804
Not every plan works out
in the way we want.

266
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,473
It happened to me too.

267
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:32,072
Apprentice Byun Sang-u did
something disgraceful last night

268
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,907
and has been expelled.

269
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,745
This is unfair. I do not covet men.

270
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,289
Oh, no. What do I do now?

271
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,583
Those who bring disgrace to Yongcheonru

272
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,460
can never be here.

273
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:47,379
Heed my warning.

274
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,716
Now, I will announce the result
of your final test.

275
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:56,930
All right.

276
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,519
Expert and Elementary are tied.

277
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:05,105
Thus, you will all be promoted to clerks.

278
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:07,399
Yes!

279
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:14,864
Quiet.

280
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,788
The appointment ceremony
will be held tomorrow.

281
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,165
And lastly,

282
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,960
there is something you must do today.

283
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,920
GEUMUI CHAMBER

284
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,297
<i>That is</i>

285
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,008
<i>to spend a day as guests.</i>

286
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:37,220
<i>Experiencing Yongcheonru</i>
<i>as a guest will teach you</i>

287
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,222
<i>how to serve guests properly.</i>

288
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,392
<i>Experience the bedding,</i>
<i>the items provided,</i>

289
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:45,979
<i>and the service of our clerks</i>
<i>from the guest's point of view</i>

290
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,272
<i>and write up a report.</i>

291
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,859
Jun-hwa, come on.

292
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,795
Wait.

293
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:30,774
No way.

294
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:32,984
My gosh.

295
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,242
Goodness.

296
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,080
It is soft and fluffy.

297
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,879
It feels like sitting on cirrus clouds.

298
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,674
Behave, will you?

299
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:59,928
No one should climb into bed
without washing up first.

300
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,647
It is so soft.

301
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,531
This must be

302
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:23,410
one of Yongcheonru's
most popular cotton cloth.

303
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,915
We almost died
while washing it at the stream.

304
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:30,583
Exactly.

305
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,336
I almost died while saving you
from drowning.

306
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:44,013
The cotton cloth is soft and fluffy

307
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,516
like cirrus clouds.

308
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,604
This is incredible!

309
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,151
Stop lounging around
and write your report.

310
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,069
This is a part of our task.

311
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:02,824
It is my rotten luck
to be teamed up with you.

312
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,371
Why? What about me?

313
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,706
Look here.

314
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,086
If you hate it that much,
switch rooms while you can.

315
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,047
To be honest,
I find Su-ra more comfortable anyway.

316
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,890
I warn you not to shed tears
when I get complimented

317
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,308
for my detailed report.

318
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,977
Fine. If we get complimented,

319
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,688
I will get down on my knees
and serve you as my senior.

320
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,816
Eun-ho, consider me to be your junior.

321
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,238
Stop goofing around and get up.

322
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,492
If it gets dirty,
how will I sleep in it later?

323
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,623
I will sleep here alone.

324
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,750
Then,

325
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,170
where am I supposed to sleep?

326
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:12,519
If you wish to sleep alone,
sleep over there by yourself.

327
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,230
I suffered enough
in that small Elementary Room.

328
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,941
This is awesome.

329
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,242
Jun-hwa, look at this.

330
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:34,165
I did not realize there was
such a big suite here.

331
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,292
Have you been here before, Jun-hwa?

332
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,892
Yongcheonru.

333
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,485
Unbelievable.

334
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:07,490
Why do Deok-su and Eun-ho
have to be roommates?

335
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,409
Darn.

336
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,664
Look at this delicate embroidery.

337
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:17,083
All this detail into a mere tablecloth?

338
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,128
I expected nothing less
from Yongcheonru's fanciest suite.

339
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:23,006
Is that so? But they are common.

340
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,304
Oh, it is flower tea.

341
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:34,267
Hey, they must serve
a variety of flower teas.

342
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,102
Yes, flower teas are nice.

343
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,353
Wait. Flower tea?

344
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,191
Do not drink…

345
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,154
that.

346
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,657
I cannot say it is tasty.

347
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,456
Wait.

348
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,751
This room…

349
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,840
It is a suite for newlyweds
on their honeymoon.

350
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:16,100
Are we supposed to try everything in here?

351
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,978
Sure. We will give it a try.

352
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,571
"How to use adlay powder."

353
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,824
"Pour adlay powder into the bowl."

354
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:41,084
"Once the powder thickens like a paste,

355
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,002
apply it on your face."

356
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,339
It is to be applied on skin
and not to be consumed?

357
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,471
"Foot bath manual."

358
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:56,307
"Dip your hand into the water

359
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,310
to check if the temperature
is to your liking."

360
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:03,022
"Massaging each other's feet

361
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,984
will rejuvenate your energy and spirit."

362
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,239
What are you doing?

363
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,413
Since I am clearly larger than you,

364
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,581
I was going to change
into the bigger gown.

365
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,376
Why? Would you rather wear this one?

366
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:28,089
I mean, why are you
changing into that right now?

367
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:32,301
We are to experience every item here
and write up a report.

368
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,472
Change into this.

369
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,933
Sure.

370
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,185
You get changed here. I will go elsewhere.

371
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,479
Do not follow me.

372
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,648
I mean, stay here.

373
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:47,567
Hong Deok-su.

374
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:51,904
I told you, a scar on a man's body
is nothing to be ashamed of.

375
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:53,990
Look.

376
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,535
- While wielding spears and swords--
- Stay here.

377
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,601
Here is today's special.

378
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:26,606
We get to order this feast from our room?

379
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:31,110
Wait. Did we have to pay for it?

380
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,570
It was for his service.

381
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:36,324
That was not mentioned
in <i>Clerkship Chronicles</i>.

382
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,410
- I must write it down.
- Listen, Su-ra.

383
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,413
You are here as a guest,
so enjoy it for now.

384
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,498
Go on. Dig in.

385
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,130
This is tastier.

386
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,267
I have never tasted
anything like this before.

387
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,436
Does your hometown only have fish?

388
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:15,154
"Check if the temperature
is to your liking."

389
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,701
"Massaging each other's feet…"

390
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,668
Massage my feet, then.

391
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,920
Why should I?

392
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,217
Because I am the one writing the report.

393
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,471
Hong Deok-su, do not try to get
a free ride while lounging around

394
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,348
and at least massage my feet.

395
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,474
Go ahead.

396
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,060
Fine. Sure thing.

397
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,152
What the…
You are splashing water everywhere!

398
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,113
Take that.

399
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,575
Hold on. Are you all right?

400
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,743
I warned you not to be flippant.

401
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,120
Such insolence!

402
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,164
What?

403
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,917
Foot baths…

404
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:14,338
can lead to arguments

405
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,549
and are not ideal.

406
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:32,148
The portion is generous,
and the food is divine.

407
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:37,195
Then maybe we should take this
to Deok-su's room.

408
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:41,032
We were always four.
Are you not bored to be with just me?

409
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,284
No way.

410
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,622
We have to eat this all
and write a detailed report.

411
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,166
Come on, my friend.

412
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:53,294
We should share our opinions
as group guests as well.

413
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,172
As guests who visit other guests
in their rooms.

414
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,140
Are you sure
you read the manual correctly?

415
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,767
This is to be applied on the face?

416
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,101
That is correct, my lord.

417
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:13,940
Joseon's greatest beauty, Park Chun-hui,
would apply adlay powder on her face too.

418
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,775
But we are men.

419
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:19,695
We are also clerks
who must write up a report.

420
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,530
Now, come closer.

421
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,407
All right.

422
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:29,538
There you go.

423
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,040
Are you doing it properly?

424
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:35,294
Do not forget that it is your turn next.

425
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:39,298
Please shut your mouth,
or adlay powder will get in your mouth.

426
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,083
It is my turn now.

427
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,280
Breathe.

428
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,116
What?

429
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,036
And close your eyes.

430
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,883
We ran out of adlay powder.
I will get some more.

431
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,124
Hey, Eun-ho.

432
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,334
Where are you going?

433
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,467
What on earth?

434
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,386
What are you doing here?

435
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,972
We were on our way to your room.

436
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,644
Right, sure. Enjoy your time there.

437
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,980
Where are you going?

438
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,773
To get some fresh air!

439
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,832
It has to be…

440
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,919
a side effect of the adlay powder.

441
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,635
Or was it the honey?

442
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,685
Why did he leave the room first?

443
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:23,189
It is not like I wanted to be
in the same room myself.

444
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,289
Goodness.

445
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:50,049
Have you finally decided to work for me?

446
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,636
I work for Yongcheonru.

447
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:59,058
Says the one discreetly soliciting me.

448
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:02,311
I am only trying
to lessen your work, my lord.

449
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,314
You and that innocent act of yours.

450
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,150
You have jumped ship before.

451
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:11,862
Did you not betray
your mentor, Hong Min-sik?

452
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:20,663
Smart ones know how to look ahead.

453
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:23,374
That is not wrong. It is wise.

454
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:28,712
For Prince Seonyang to ascend the throne,

455
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,506
he needs someone wise.

456
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,509
If this goes well,

457
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:36,804
it will rattle the grand proprietor
and diminish his power.

458
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,896
So what do you want in return?

459
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:55,406
Prince Eunseong is ill?

460
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:59,159
The Minister of War
recently offered him an herbal tonic,

461
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,953
and it seems to have caused problems.

462
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:05,749
What made him think
that the minister is trustworthy?

463
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,961
Prince Eunseong told me not to tell you,

464
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,130
but I thought you should know.

465
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,715
I apologize.

466
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,720
No, I am glad you told me.

467
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,810
THE PALACE

468
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,114
Brother.

469
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,123
What brings you here?

470
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,959
I heard you were ill

471
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,377
and came out of concern.

472
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,254
I am fine.

473
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,927
Coughing is not new to me.

474
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:00,554
Come.

475
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,435
When did you get back from Onyang?

476
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:09,688
I was worried to hear
that you left the capital to recuperate.

477
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,775
Are you feeling better?

478
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,818
It is your health that matters.

479
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,322
As long as you and Father are well,

480
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:19,990
I will have no worries.

481
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,870
His Majesty sent
the royal physician my way,

482
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:25,788
so I am better.

483
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,667
Will you stay at the palace
now that you are back?

484
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:34,713
No.

485
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:38,384
I have business to tend to,
so I will be away a bit longer.

486
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,845
Listen, until I finish my work
and return--

487
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:45,015
You have not been staying in Onyang,
have you?

488
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:51,146
The Minister of War
came to see me recently.

489
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:55,984
Is this business of yours
related to him by any chance?

490
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,904
I cannot speak of it yet,

491
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,865
but I promise to return to my place.

492
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,618
The minister asked if I have been
working on my swordsmanship.

493
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:08,163
He looked for the dragon-engraved sword
bestowed to princes,

494
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,456
so I showed him mine.

495
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,875
Why would he ask you that?

496
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:15,254
Are you in some sort of trouble?

497
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:20,926
Of course not.

498
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:25,013
Everything is in order, so do not worry.

499
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,265
Allow me to help.

500
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:30,602
If you are in danger,
I will gladly take the fall for you.

501
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,655
I will not let that happen.

502
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,033
You just…

503
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,495
focus on getting better.

504
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:06,805
Is there any progress
on your work at Yongcheonru?

505
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:10,434
There will be an appointment ceremony
for the new clerks soon.

506
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,811
When Grand Proprietor Cheon
leaves his residence,

507
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,688
I will have it searched thoroughly.

508
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:18,609
You must hurry.

509
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:22,237
Prince Seonyang will soon turn ten.

510
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,699
The Minister of War is at my throat.

511
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:29,077
I cannot postpone
the crown prince appointment any longer.

512
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:34,374
Prince Muyeong,
that position is yours to fill, is it not?

513
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,506
The minister went to see Prince Eunseong.

514
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,842
Is there something I am not aware of?

515
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,305
The minister is after you.

516
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,559
Once he finds out
that you are not in Onyang,

517
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,604
he will put a noose around your neck.

518
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,856
So, always be alert

519
00:46:58,732 --> 00:46:59,608
and watch your back.

520
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,239
I will, Father.

521
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:44,444
Hong Jae-on.

522
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,906
I have found her.

523
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:55,455
It has taken quite a while.

524
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:01,295
I see that my mission
is finally coming to an end.

525
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,900
Find Hong Min-sik's daughter!

526
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,320
Search thoroughly! She must be nearby!

527
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:54,640
Over there!

528
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,230
What the hell?

529
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:44,731
Who are you?

530
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,192
Hong Deok-su, it is me, Lee Eun-ho.

531
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:49,986
What are you doing at this late hour?

532
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,492
Hey.

533
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,370
Does it hurt a lot?

534
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,040
I bet you are faking it.

535
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,463
Of course not.
Were you having night terrors?

536
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,006
What?

537
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,635
I could hear you whimpering from outside.

538
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,638
Were you dreaming of ghosts like a child?

539
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,226
No, I was not.

540
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,270
What about you?

541
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:27,357
Why did you come back so late?

542
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:36,283
Follow me.

543
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:38,827
What?

544
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,663
Where are we going at this hour?

545
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:04,060
What is this?

546
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,104
It is from a peach tree.

547
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,150
It scares away ghosts
and prevents nightmares.

548
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:16,031
I see you are superstitious.

549
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:17,741
Give it back then.

550
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:20,619
Keep whimpering in your sleep
and be haunted for all I care.

551
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,579
Okay, fine. I am sorry.

552
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:00,408
The sky is not as illuminated
by stars tonight.

553
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,204
The fireflies were so beautiful.

554
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,749
But you did not manage
to catch a single one.

555
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,710
What? That is only because you suddenly…

556
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:21,805
How do you know that this branch
scares away ghosts?

557
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:29,104
I have an older cousin.

558
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,190
<i>As children, we witnessed</i>

559
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,151
<i>a terrifying sight.</i>

560
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,541
Was it a ghost that you two saw?

561
00:52:58,842 --> 00:52:59,968
What we saw

562
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:03,388
was more terrifying than ghosts.

563
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:09,519
I used to have nightmares about it often,

564
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:12,856
but one day, my cousin brought me

565
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,026
peach tree branches from the garden.

566
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,452
I had fewer nightmares since then.

567
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,663
Your cousin is a sweet man.

568
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,417
Thank you, Eun-ho.

569
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:37,005
So, do you not have nightmares anymore?

570
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:38,214
And is your cousin well?

571
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,802
I will make sure that he is.

572
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:48,183
Gosh, what a reliable little cousin
you are.

573
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,936
You are more reliable than these branches.

574
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,205
What?

575
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:51,037
Hey, Deok-su.

576
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:37,375
Deok-su.

577
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:39,753
Hush.

578
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:57,145
Jun-hwa, do you want in on it?

579
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:02,192
We need to get our revenge
on Kim Myeong-ho and his goons.

580
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,154
Sure. Lead the way.

581
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:14,412
Who did this?

582
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:17,082
What in the name…

583
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,209
Who did this?

584
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:22,545
Get them!

585
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,103
Hong Deok-su!

586
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:43,066
You brat! How dare you?

587
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,192
It was Jun-hwa.

588
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:46,194
- On my handsome face?
- It was Jun-hwa.

589
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:47,821
Calm down, will you?

590
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:50,698
Boys, we should get ready.

591
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,497
- Su-ra, you…
- You have whiskers.

592
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,502
- Is he a cat?
- That he is.

593
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,129
- Me?
- Meow.

594
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:05,421
It was Deok-su.

595
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,216
- No, it was Jun-hwa.
- Hong Deok-su!

596
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:12,262
- Get back here.
- No, it was not me. Come on!

597
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:13,555
- What?
- It was Jun-hwa.

598
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,609
Coming to my chambers at this hour?

599
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:32,657
It must be too early for an audience.
I apologize.

600
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,706
What is this?

601
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:42,167
High quality pork
that is difficult to obtain

602
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,835
was finally procured by Yongcheonru.

603
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:47,422
I came to give it to Your Majesty
as an offering.

604
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:51,759
You trusted me and entrusted
Prince Muyeong to Yongcheonru,

605
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:54,512
and I wanted to show you my appreciation.

606
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:59,100
That is why you brought me this rare pork?

607
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:00,852
Yes, Your Majesty.

608
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:17,827
Today,

609
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:22,373
Prince Muyeong will be appointed
as an official clerk of Yongcheonru.

610
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:24,876
He has lasted longer than I expected.

611
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:31,382
I only say this
out of concern for his safety,

612
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:34,802
but I will be in a tight spot
should he cross paths

613
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:36,721
with the Minister of War there.

614
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,016
So you should not let that happen.

615
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,645
Most officials of the royal court
have sided with him

616
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:47,357
and are making daily requests to appoint
Prince Seonyang as the crown prince.

617
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,275
And tax collection is at a low point.

618
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,486
Then…

619
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:57,242
is this you asking me for a favor,

620
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:58,785
Your Majesty?

621
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:07,919
Yes, I understand, Your Majesty.

622
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:18,096
Your partner who died 12 years ago…

623
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:23,226
Are you still searching
for Hong Min-sik's safe?

624
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,022
Why would you concern yourself with that?

625
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:32,277
I heard he was a man of great fortune.

626
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:36,739
That money could solve
a lot of our problems, could it not?

627
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,549
<i>Were you at the palace?</i>

628
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:56,301
ACCOUNTING LEDGER

629
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:57,427
Yes.

630
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,848
Is there still no news about the daughter?

631
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,517
We will hear it if she is alive.

632
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,769
Hong Jae-on…

633
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:11,065
She and Jun-hwa share the same fate.

634
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,943
She was given a life that would last.

635
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:19,657
By the way, did you read the fortunes
of Jun-hwa's roommates?

636
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:23,620
- Would you like to see them?
- Yes.

637
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:31,210
Ko Su-ra.

638
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:36,174
LEE EUN-HO

639
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:37,592
Prince Muyeong.

640
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:42,430
He is fated to be king.

641
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:46,601
But should I make him a king

642
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:49,812
or discard him?

643
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:55,902
Prince Muyeong's fate is up to Jun-hwa.

644
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:57,779
That is amusing.

645
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:04,285
HONG DEOK-SU

646
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,287
This Hong Deok-su.

647
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:11,417
Did you read his fortune yourself?

648
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:14,170
Of course.

649
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,590
It was based on his date and time
of birth that I was informed of.

650
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:23,221
It does not fit the fate
that I read from his face.

651
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:42,990
I should invite him over
to have a closer look at him.

652
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:57,630
HONG DEOK-SU

653
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,694
The manly Hong Deok-su.
Getting dolled up, are you?

654
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:25,408
What?

655
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:29,829
Pick up the pace, will you?

656
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:34,625
Let us go.

657
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:39,130
Let us go get appointed.

658
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:38,606
I thought Jun-hwa would run off, saying
he does not want to be a part of this.

659
01:03:38,689 --> 01:03:40,483
But he made it this far.

660
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:44,070
I expected no less from your successor.

661
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:10,137
We will commence the appointment ceremony.

662
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:21,983
The appointment ceremony
for the Yongcheonru clerks will commence.

663
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:24,110
We will first hear
from Grand Proprietor Cheon,

664
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:27,446
who has granted us all
this honorable moment.

665
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:40,459
<i>Lord Cheon's residence</i>

666
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:43,254
<i>is tucked away</i>
<i>inside the garden of Yongcheonru.</i>

667
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:03,816
Why did you…

668
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:08,279
join Yongcheonru?

669
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:17,788
<i>Lord Cheon will be attending</i>
<i>the clerks' appointment ceremony,</i>

670
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:19,415
<i>so that is our window.</i>

671
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:27,757
<i>In the short time you have,</i>
<i>you must search thoroughly.</i>

672
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:34,847
Becoming an official clerk
is the beginning and not the end.

673
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:39,143
Your task from here on out

674
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:41,646
is to create a world

675
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:44,607
that is different from the outside.

676
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:48,527
A world where money can buy everything.

677
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:51,948
Regardless of class or status…

678
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:57,453
those with money rule above all here.

679
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:01,999
That is the Yongcheonru I built.

680
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:09,131
Congratulations on joining Yongcheonru.

681
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:27,900
Next, you will receive
your certificates and name tags.

682
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:33,781
Grand Proprietor Cheon
will present them himself.

683
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:48,129
Kim Myeong-ho.

684
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:56,804
Min Du-sik.

685
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,601
Maeng Seok-sam.

686
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:10,901
Cheon Jun-hwa.

687
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:22,705
Lee Eun-ho.

688
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:33,651
Ko Su-ra.

689
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:39,281
<i>Father, do not worry about me.</i>

690
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:49,375
<i>Soon, I will avenge you for that day.</i>

691
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,174
Hong Deok-su.

692
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:00,302
Yes, my lord.

693
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:11,480
- Move!
- Step aside!

694
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:12,940
Make way!

695
01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:20,281
Make way!

696
01:09:20,364 --> 01:09:21,657
What is going on?

697
01:09:29,206 --> 01:09:30,291
<i>So?</i>

698
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:32,626
What do you want in return?

699
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:34,086
Tomorrow,

700
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:37,590
there will be an appointment ceremony
for the new clerks of Yongcheonru.

701
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:38,757
Attending the ceremony

702
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:42,678
is someone involved in the murder
you are investigating.

703
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:50,060
Which one of you is Hong Deok-su?

704
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,774
That would be me.

705
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,319
Hong Deok-su, you are under arrest

706
01:09:58,402 --> 01:10:00,988
for the murder of Kim Man-dol in Seochon.

707
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:03,782
Pardon?

708
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,640
You actually made it this far.

709
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:32,102
I owe it to you, Lady Seol.

710
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:39,652
Hong Deok-su, what brought you here
to Yongcheonru?

711
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:42,863
My parents.

712
01:10:47,868 --> 01:10:49,119
There is something

713
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:53,165
I must do for them.

714
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:03,008
I see. I hope you achieve your goal.

715
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,135
Right.

716
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:07,471
I am determined to do so.

717
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:11,600
Rest up today.

718
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:13,727
Tomorrow will be a busy day for you.

719
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:56,770
You killed him with this sword,
did you not?

720
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:58,314
<i>There is no way he is the culprit.</i>
