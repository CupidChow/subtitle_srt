1
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,710
ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,128
FILMING OF CHILD ACTORS DONE
UNDER BROADCASTING GUIDELINES

3
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,964
All my memories with my father…

4
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,426
are at this place.

5
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,641
Including the memories…

6
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,103
of that day, 12 years ago.

7
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,108
Have you been…

8
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,655
living as a man since then?

9
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,077
I had to

10
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,871
survive somehow.

11
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,006
Shell game?

12
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,518
Here we go.

13
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,114
Finding the jade ring
is not the only way to happiness.

14
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:44,117
One of them had a flower under it.

15
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,245
And one of them hid the jade ring.

16
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:51,040
Just remember to be content
with whatever you get.

17
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,165
There.

18
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,253
Happiness.

19
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,051
You will find your happiness

20
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,222
under whichever cup you choose.

21
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,322
Happiness?

22
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,490
Yes.

23
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,284
It is what my father
always used to tell me.

24
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,334
I thought coming here…

25
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,464
would be quite hard on me.

26
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,426
I was afraid.

27
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,185
I have some happy memories…

28
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,315
but I also have painful ones.

29
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,621
I am glad you are here with me.

30
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,718
It will be over once we find the safe.

31
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,805
You are right.

32
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,724
It will all be over soon.

33
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,935
Right.

34
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,441
Then shall we start
with the reception quarters?

35
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,581
I guess it is not here.

36
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,000
Maybe I was wrong?

37
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:30,718
Here.

38
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,189
Take your time and think.

39
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,526
Your father must have hidden
some sort of message.

40
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,030
Maybe I should ask Lady Seol?

41
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,117
Lady Seol Mae-hwa?

42
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,955
Yes. She was my father's only mentee.

43
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:06,087
There is someone precious to me
that I must protect.

44
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:11,509
Look into the incident from 12 years ago
involving the brass key.

45
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,682
What are you thinking about?

46
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,230
Let us return for tonight.

47
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,391
Drinking alone without any food?

48
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,980
Ko Su-ra, my friend.

49
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,404
"Friend"?

50
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,825
Cheon Jun-hwa is my son.

51
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,369
Will you assist him by his side?

52
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,872
Do you not need money?

53
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,790
Desperately?

54
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,008
Jun-hwa…

55
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,428
Is this because of Deok-su?

56
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,027
I said you should be
ready for a rejection.

57
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,532
Rejection?

58
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,790
I should just make it impossible
for her to turn me down.

59
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,251
Jun-hwa.

60
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,423
I was first.

61
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:16,967
I saw…

62
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,097
I saw her first.

63
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,361
I will not let him steal her from me.

64
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,252
I will stay on guard.
You can relax and wash up.

65
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:52,753
Okay.

66
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,006
Thank you, Eun-ho. I will be quick.

67
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,728
It is not like I did all the work.

68
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,356
I hope I was not too stinky.

69
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:25,786
Snap out of it!

70
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,248
The Master said to not look
at the improper. Do not listen to it.

71
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,709
Do not speak of it.

72
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,377
Do not act on it.

73
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,754
If it is against propriety,

74
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,631
do not look or listen to it.

75
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,308
The wise will not be confused,
and the benevolent will not be sorrowful.

76
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:50,436
The wise will not be tempted…

77
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,663
Remember what the Master said.
Maintain decorum.

78
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,461
I will also go wash up.

79
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,446
Let me. You should rest.

80
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,989
No, I will do it.

81
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,158
- Just let me do it.
- No.

82
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:12,977
Okay.

83
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,898
I see you are quite strong, Deok-su.

84
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,191
Yes…

85
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,486
I am the manly Hong Deok-su.

86
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,364
But you are not…

87
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,035
Right.

88
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,640
This is my first time.

89
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,313
Maybe because I always lived as a man?

90
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,149
I find these feelings…

91
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,986
strange.

92
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,328
Having someone in my heart…

93
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,583
and my heart fluttering.

94
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,797
I feel the same.

95
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,194
Eun-ho.

96
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:49,573
My friend Gu-sil told me

97
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,410
that if your heart flutters
and it feels tickled,

98
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,829
it is love.

99
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,669
Did you feel that too?
Did your heart flutter?

100
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,588
Did it feel tickled?

101
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,261
It was painful.

102
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,979
My heart did not flutter…

103
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,233
or feel tickled.

104
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,364
Every time I saw you…

105
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,623
<i>it was painful…</i>

106
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,256
<i>and agonizing.</i>

107
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,349
I thought you were a man.

108
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,396
I had to deny my heart…

109
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,942
but I could not.

110
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,741
I am sorry. That was…

111
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:15,701
It is all right.

112
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,916
Whether you are Hong Deok-su
or Hong Jae-on…

113
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:25,919
Whoever you are…

114
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,214
you are…

115
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,969
the only one I will hold in my heart.

116
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,106
Likewise.

117
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,656
I have never lived as a woman before,

118
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,703
so it will be hard
and I will fall short sometimes…

119
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,626
but I will still try my best, Eun-ho.

120
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,382
Likewise.

121
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,427
I promise you.

122
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,015
I will protect you…

123
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,937
no matter what.

124
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,535
You can rest easy now, Hong Deok-su.

125
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,996
I will stand guard through the night.

126
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,540
Do not worry and sleep.

127
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,422
I do not want to sleep.

128
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,135
I do not want this day to end.

129
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,678
What? Hong Deok-su.

130
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,848
What are you doing?

131
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,060
You should stop while I still ask nicely.

132
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,362
Deok-su, I am not…

133
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,450
ready for that yet.

134
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,404
Look at you sleeping so soundly.

135
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,199
Oblivious to my state.

136
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,834
After all this is over…

137
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,464
I should be able to tell you everything.

138
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,279
<i>I, Prince Muyeong,</i>

139
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,906
shall be the next crown prince.

140
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,991
What?

141
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:27,286
Following my father's footsteps,
I will rectify the nation and royal court.

142
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:31,748
I order you to fall in line
as a loyal subject.

143
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:57,316
The pumpkin fritters are
exceptionally good today.

144
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,400
Here.

145
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,403
What?

146
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,904
They are my favorite.

147
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,034
Then, you…

148
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,247
should have this. Meat.

149
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,255
- Tasty?
- You gave it to me, so of course.

150
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,923
Really? Then, eat it all.

151
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,221
What is the matter? Are you choking?

152
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:31,224
Water. Drink some water.

153
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,775
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

154
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:44,863
Eat up.

155
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,411
Where did you two go last night?

156
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,748
What? Yesterday?

157
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,877
You were not in your room last night.

158
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,717
Our room became a bit too hot,

159
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,720
so we went for a walk to cool off.

160
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:09,971
That is right.

161
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:12,599
I see.

162
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,492
I have lost my appetite.

163
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,337
Jun-hwa, you should still eat something.

164
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,089
I will go with him.

165
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,814
I brought you some <i>sikhye.</i>

166
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,698
Is your stomach okay?

167
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,826
Why did you drink so much?

168
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,182
I met with Lord Cheon yesterday.

169
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,483
I did not realize
how much you take after your father.

170
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,115
I heard that you are his only son

171
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,951
and the sole heir to Yongcheonru.

172
00:24:58,872 --> 00:24:59,748
Su-ra.

173
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,337
I am friends
with the future grand proprietor.

174
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,548
I am lucky.

175
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,260
I am sorry.

176
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,430
I should have told you sooner.

177
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:18,934
I understand.
You were distracted by Deok-su.

178
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,901
What business did my father
have with you?

179
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,454
We are about to lose
our guild to creditors.

180
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,084
Your father offered to pay off the debt.

181
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:49,214
You should have told me about that first.

182
00:25:56,263 --> 00:26:00,100
I will stand by your side and support you
until you become the grand proprietor.

183
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:08,066
But I will still continue to speak up.

184
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,028
I would appreciate that.

185
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,533
We will have a lot to do from now on.

186
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,892
Eun-ho.

187
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,022
Maybe we should keep our distance.

188
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,234
What do you mean?

189
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:55,947
I mean, we cannot tell
our friends about us yet,

190
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,490
so we should be careful.

191
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,451
Because of Jun-hwa?

192
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,541
You knew?

193
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,003
Jun-hwa is…

194
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,178
Never mind. We are all friends.

195
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,223
Once we find the chest and ledger,
then we will…

196
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,186
have a lot to do.

197
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,485
Let us focus on work during the day,

198
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,323
and at night,
let us search for the chest together.

199
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,575
Okay?

200
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:54,297
And leave dangerous tasks like this to me.

201
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,132
Okay?

202
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,635
Stop it.

203
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,307
Eun-ho, watch out!

204
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,484
What are you two doing?

205
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,455
Is that any way
for two men to be behaving?

206
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,001
How obnoxious.

207
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:37,382
Well, I…
I need to go and hang those sheets.

208
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,677
Bye.

209
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,600
Sheets.

210
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,032
I told you I did not need help.

211
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,410
Hand them over. I will hang them all.

212
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,078
You rest in the shade.

213
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,413
Then, let us do it together.

214
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:09,998
Here we go.

215
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,210
One, two, three!

216
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,956
Maybe that is when it started?

217
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,920
I started noticing you.

218
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,932
You have liked me since then?

219
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,481
That was my second kiss.

220
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,402
Your second? Who was your first?

221
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,737
Someone who was

222
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:26,199
so beautiful
even when she was soaking wet.

223
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,330
Who was it?

224
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,792
Tell me.

225
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,922
How could you forget your savior?

226
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,082
Look at me.

227
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,630
That pays off my debt.

228
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:26,968
Let us go.

229
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,728
Lady Seol

230
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:21,856
never appeared
on the mountain pass to Uiju.

231
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:25,902
It seems she caught on and fled.

232
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,029
Is that so?

233
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:31,616
I would expect nothing less from her.

234
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,618
Shall we continue the search?

235
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,662
Let her be.

236
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:40,458
Even if she makes it to Uiju,
she will not be able to return alive.

237
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,884
<i>You must stay alive.</i>

238
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,970
You need to stay alive

239
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,598
and experience the world we dreamt about.

240
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,101
Lord Hong…

241
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,228
Someday…

242
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,732
if my Jae-on ever comes to you…

243
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,236
please look after her.

244
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,905
<i>Please take good care of her.</i>

245
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,756
I have always wanted
to meet you, Lady Seol.

246
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,587
GANGNYEONGJEON

247
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:02,850
PETITION

248
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,769
How am I to blame

249
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,480
for the prolonged drought?

250
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,716
This is our welcome tea.

251
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,511
Gosh. That is Yongcheonru for you.

252
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,513
Even when inflation is rampant in Hanyang.

253
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,558
Then again, a three-year drought is
serious business.

254
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,561
We might end up
with an uprising at this rate.

255
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:50,439
We are in this predicament
because of His Majesty's sins.

256
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,358
Shush. How could you say that?

257
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,360
You must watch what you say.

258
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:58,531
What did you mean by "His Majesty's sins"?

259
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,991
Well…

260
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,869
They say the sitting king

261
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,829
angered the heavens
and caused this drought

262
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:07,206
because he murdered
his own brother for the throne.

263
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,125
What sort of nonsense is that?

264
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,503
My apologies, my lords.

265
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,924
Everyone in Hanyang is talking about it.

266
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,342
Yongcheonru is a bit behind.

267
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,344
That is all a heinous lie.

268
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:21,721
Please forgive us.

269
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:25,016
My word. Can you even blame them
for saying such things

270
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,893
after three years of bad harvests?

271
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,353
We need a new monarch.

272
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,646
How could he murder

273
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,233
his own flesh and blood
to steal the royal throne?

274
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,318
Lee Eun-ho.

275
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,404
Are you all right?

276
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,535
I need to leave early and visit my family.

277
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,039
Will you wait for me at your old house?
I will come later.

278
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,249
What is going on?

279
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,586
I will not be late.
Just wait for me there.

280
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,346
Do not get hurt again.

281
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,599
Be careful. Okay?

282
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,865
I heard you helped out
Su-ra's family's guild.

283
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:28,246
He is a clever boy with ambitions.

284
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,623
He will be helpful
if you keep him by your side.

285
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:37,296
Why did you send Lady Seol to Uiju?

286
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:43,761
I can only appoint you
to that position if it is vacant.

287
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,431
Then,

288
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:51,477
does that mean she will never be able
to return to Yongcheonru?

289
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,984
Well… Yes, I guess so.

290
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:07,785
Jun-hwa, you are my heir.

291
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,330
You should return
to your rightful place now.

292
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:17,878
Alcohol does not solve any problems.

293
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,260
It seems you know
all there is to know about me.

294
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:32,143
I am also aware of how lovesick you are
over the elusive Hong Deok-su.

295
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,195
Cheon Jun-hwa.

296
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,241
Are you aware
of the fate associated with your name?

297
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,079
A long time ago,

298
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,083
a friend gave me one of the characters
meant for his child's name.

299
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,046
He ended up having a daughter,

300
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:04,216
and I ended up having you.

301
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:11,057
We each took a character from a name
that would attract the utmost wealth.

302
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:18,105
"Jae" as in wealth
and "Hwa" as in fortune.

303
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,107
<i>"Jae-hwa."</i>

304
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,527
<i>His daughter took the "Jae" character…</i>

305
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,741
<i>and you received the "Hwa" character.</i>

306
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:42,797
That child's name is Hong Jae-on.

307
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:49,887
The very same girl you have
by your side at this moment.

308
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,476
Hong…

309
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,647
Deok-su, you mean?

310
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,650
Hong Jae-on has always been meant

311
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,277
to be yours, Jun-hwa.

312
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:09,365
Hong Deok-su is

313
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,244
my soulmate who shares a name with me?

314
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,954
You must not lose

315
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:18,165
what is meant to be yours.

316
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:22,086
Jun-hwa, you have enough power
to ensure that never happens.

317
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,363
Are you planning

318
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,992
for another outing with Deok-su tonight?

319
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,661
"Another"?

320
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,499
What exactly did you see?

321
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,543
I cannot just let her get hurt.

322
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,881
Do you not realize that Deok-su could be

323
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,758
put in danger if you stay by her side?

324
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,220
Just…

325
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,515
leave now.

326
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,698
I shall protect my person.

327
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,345
Please make your decision, Your Majesty.

328
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,930
You barge in here

329
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,183
and make such a demand of your king

330
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:47,189
over this measly edict
for the Crown Prince Appointment?

331
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,774
"Measly," Your Majesty?

332
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,902
Do you know what the people are saying?

333
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,655
They say sins

334
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,449
have led to the droughts.

335
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,204
Is that your way

336
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,749
of saying that I have sinned?

337
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:09,587
You should officially appoint
a crown prince and hold the ceremony

338
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,046
along with a rain ritual.

339
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,178
Do you truly believe

340
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:21,515
doing so will lead to rain?

341
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,726
There is no way for me
to know for certain.

342
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:24,810
However,

343
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:31,108
I will personally make sure to turn
public sentiment in favor of Your Majesty.

344
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:35,321
We should not burden
the young crown prince with such matters.

345
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,125
I understand.

346
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,963
I will issue the edict
after a thorough review.

347
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,882
You may leave now.

348
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,971
I implore you…

349
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,684
to grant it right now, Your Majesty.

350
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,826
You will…

351
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,704
approve!

352
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,963
The Minister shall kneel this instant!

353
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,429
Kneel.

354
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,725
Prince Muyeong, do not get involved.

355
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:49,520
Will you only feel remorse
for this insolence

356
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,855
after you are beheaded for treason?

357
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,675
Even if you behead me here…

358
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:27,516
you must still grant the edict
for the Crown Prince Appointment.

359
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,938
I implore you to restore law and order

360
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,817
in our nation, Your Majesty.

361
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,116
Then, we must select

362
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:47,077
an auspicious date first.

363
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:51,123
How can we carry out
such an important event

364
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:52,499
on just any given day?

365
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,419
His Majesty shall consult
the Astronomy Bureau

366
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:58,130
to select a proper date.

367
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:05,053
Yes, that would be best.

368
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:14,855
You may leave us now.

369
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:23,363
Yes, Your Majesty.
We shall proceed accordingly.

370
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:34,833
There are three auspicious days
before the end of the month.

371
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:39,588
It must be held within this month.

372
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:09,535
He kicked a mad dog fixated
on making his grandson the crown prince.

373
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,121
All that is left is for him to be bitten.

374
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,417
What are we to do now?

375
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:19,878
I will…

376
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,090
acquire the Grand Proprietor's ledger.

377
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:27,052
I will secure evidence that proves
the Minister assassinated the late king.

378
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,764
With the brass key secured,

379
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,101
I will make sure to acquire the safe chest

380
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,187
before the Minister comes back.

381
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:42,484
Prince Muyeong.

382
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,320
I am counting on you.

383
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,004
Brother.

384
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,383
I heard the Minister barged in.

385
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,427
Is His Majesty all right?

386
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,971
He has retreated. Do not worry.

387
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,140
What in the world is going on?

388
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,809
I heard of the broken engagement.

389
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:21,023
I will no longer submit
to the Minister's intimidation.

390
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,651
I will correct the wrongs
of those immoral individuals.

391
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:28,989
But with what power?

392
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:30,699
I will soon…

393
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,744
acquire that power.

394
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,481
I offer you my congratulations.

395
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,569
Allow me to pour you a drink, my lord.

396
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,572
Gosh. I mean, Your Grace,

397
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:13,367
the grandfather
to His Highness the Crown Prince.

398
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:18,038
My dear man.
The edict has not been granted yet.

399
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:23,543
It is as good as done. We just need
an auspicious date to be selected.

400
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:27,923
I concur. You will soon have
the world at the end of your chopsticks.

401
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,430
Like this?

402
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,900
Listen, my lord.

403
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:49,277
After the appointment ceremony,

404
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,281
you should just toss the Grand Proprietor.

405
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:54,950
I concur.

406
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,869
You must not associate
with those of lowly blood for too long.

407
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:00,414
His name is Mak-dong for goodness' sake.

408
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,166
His name reflects
his inferior weed-like origins.

409
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,545
Come on now.

410
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:11,633
Even so, you must not look down
on someone for the name they were given.

411
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,892
He can call himself "Grand Proprietor"
all he wants,

412
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:24,771
but he can never free himself
from that lowly name.

413
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,773
Cheon Mak-dong! That petulant weed!

414
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:34,281
He just shamelessly stinks up
wherever he goes with his trail of dung!

415
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,245
But I wonder

416
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:44,082
why Prince Muyeong did that.

417
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,920
He even broke off the engagement.

418
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:52,048
Where did he find the nerve to do that?

419
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,177
It is suspicious.

420
00:50:57,637 --> 00:51:01,558
Is he using the date selection
to buy some time?

421
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,729
My lord, they still only have

422
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:08,190
until the end of the month.

423
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:09,649
What could they possibly do?

424
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,486
Something feels off.

425
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:17,991
It feels as though he has
some sort of secret weapon.

426
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,578
You should not worry.

427
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:23,205
You have us, my lord.

428
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:46,102
I know where Prince Muyeong
will be tonight.

429
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,982
You told me not to lose what is mine.

430
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,361
Hong Jae-on.

431
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,447
The maiden whom I share a name with…

432
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,076
I shall reclaim her.

433
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:07,374
Will you be able to overpower
Prince Muyeong?

434
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,003
I will.

435
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:17,759
You are finally acting like my son.

436
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,680
I will give you Cho Seung-ryang.

437
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:25,267
Go and do as you wish.

438
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:38,238
GYOMYEONG:
AN EDICT THAT THE KING ISSUES

439
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,698
FOR A ROYAL APPOINTMENT

440
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:55,797
There are three auspicious days
before the end of the month.

441
00:52:55,881 --> 00:53:00,176
It must be held within this month.

442
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,305
I will make sure to acquire the safe chest

443
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:06,474
before the Minister comes back.

444
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,109
Royal Swordsman, are you there?

445
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:24,659
Yes, Your Majesty.

446
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:29,789
Gather your men and follow Prince Muyeong.

447
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,463
Once he finds Lord Cheon's ledger,

448
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,799
secure him and the ledger.

449
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,177
And kill any and all witnesses.

450
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:45,931
As you command, Your Majesty.

451
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:17,295
Deok-su.

452
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:19,965
Eun-ho.

453
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,885
What took you so long?

454
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,804
Was your trip here safe?

455
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:27,806
It was fine.

456
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,558
I thought I would search by myself,

457
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,102
but I found nothing.

458
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,814
It seems you were searching really hard.

459
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:46,741
Did something happen?

460
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,537
No, not at all.

461
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,789
- Let us continue our search.
- No.

462
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,333
Something is definitely going on.

463
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,088
I can see it on your face.

464
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,341
You want to cry,
but you are holding it in.

465
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:11,224
Do you even read people's minds now?

466
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,061
Come here.

467
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,282
A family matter, right?

468
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:31,369
Is it something bad?

469
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,674
After my mother passed,

470
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:47,761
if it were not for you,

471
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:51,347
I would still be on that floor.

472
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:02,358
I, too, would like to be
someone like that to you.

473
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,200
Come on. Lean.

474
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,535
It may be small, but it will do.

475
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,039
Two is better than one.

476
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,798
Okay. Let us do that.

477
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,118
You were right.

478
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,663
It feels much better
to lean on each other.

479
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:59,541
See? I told you I was right.

480
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:05,922
You know… I did prepare
something else as well.

481
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:06,840
What is it?

482
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:10,552
Ta-da!

483
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,806
Here we go.

484
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:16,182
Ta-da!

485
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:19,185
Wait, when did you prepare all this?

486
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,896
Here. Try it first.

487
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,527
What?

488
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:31,781
Jeez…

489
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,785
Here. Open up.

490
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:40,915
Are you going to eat my hand too?

491
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:43,084
Sorry. I guess I was really hungry.

492
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:46,629
- You should have some too.
- I can feed myself.

493
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:49,632
No, stop. Let me feed you.

494
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:55,638
Open up.

495
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,515
Go on.

496
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,019
Wider. Come on.

497
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:07,567
Goodness.

498
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,320
We should share this equally.

499
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:13,072
One for you.

500
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:16,910
And one for me.

501
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:21,998
Sharing food doubles

502
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:24,125
the tastiness, does it not?

503
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,293
Yes.

504
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:31,007
My father used to say that.

505
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:32,967
Your father did?

506
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:34,594
Yes.

507
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,693
Jae-on, where are you rushing off to?

508
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,196
It is a secret. Do not ask anymore.

509
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:15,570
The brass key. Can I see it?

510
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:17,030
The brass key?

511
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:28,041
"Yeo-Hui-Hyang-Wi-Bae."

512
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:37,258
"Sharing doubles your joy."

513
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:44,223
This is it. I know where it is.

514
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,624
Are you ready?

515
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:12,377
Yes, my lord.

516
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:14,212
Let us go.

517
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:15,421
Yes, my lord.

518
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:35,668
That is the chest.

519
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,096
Those responsible
for my father's wrongful death…

520
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,142
I will make them pay.

521
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:51,619
Minister of War Oh Yeong-rak.

522
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,373
Cheon Mak-dong.

523
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:03,923
PRINCE LEE HYEON-WI

524
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:05,967
Prince Lee Hyeon-wi.

525
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:08,678
His Majesty?

526
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,517
PRINCE LEE HYEON-WI

527
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:52,013
Who are you?

528
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,042
Get them!

529
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:49,528
They are after you, not me.

530
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:51,572
You must stick by my side.

531
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:53,908
Okay.

532
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:58,829
Deok-su!

533
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:03,960
Who are you?

534
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,176
Get them!

535
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:23,229
Come with me, Deok-su.

536
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:24,772
What are you doing here?

537
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:32,196
Kill them all!

538
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:33,864
Stop them!

539
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:42,581
Let us go.

540
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:44,834
Eun-ho, let go of that hand.

541
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:48,337
She will be safer with me.

542
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:50,214
- Why? We should flee together.
- Deok-su.

543
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:53,634
- No! Eun-ho!
- Deok-su!

544
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:54,844
No!

545
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:06,772
Master?

546
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:18,159
No!

547
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:29,628
Are you okay?

548
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:32,298
Deok-su, you need to flee with Jun-hwa.

549
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:33,883
We cannot leave you here.

550
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:35,718
Leave while I hold them back. Go on.

551
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:37,094
Lee Eun-ho!

552
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:38,763
Let us go, Deok-su.

553
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:44,101
Come on, Deok-su. Let us go.

554
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:45,019
Catch them!

555
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:47,980
Go!

556
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:54,403
No… We cannot!

557
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:58,657
We cannot let them go. Kill them all!

558
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:06,457
Stop.

559
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:15,966
Prince Muyeong is present.

560
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:22,181
Put down your swords
and bow down immediately!

561
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:34,568
Bow down and show respect.

562
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:16,235
Lift your head.

563
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:47,516
Eun-ho.

564
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:53,689
Jun-hwa.

565
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,443
Leave with Deok-su.

566
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:13,542
Eun-ho.

567
01:10:16,503 --> 01:10:17,504
You are…

568
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:20,299
Prince Muyeong?

569
01:10:32,144 --> 01:10:36,106
He commanded me
to kill everyone else here.

570
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:37,441
Royal Swordsman!

571
01:10:41,278 --> 01:10:43,072
Hear my command!

572
01:10:45,282 --> 01:10:46,700
We will return to the palace.

573
01:10:53,874 --> 01:10:54,959
Escort His Highness.

574
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:01,257
Eun-ho.

575
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,701
<i>That was it?</i>

576
01:12:10,784 --> 01:12:11,785
<i>For that ledger?</i>

577
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:13,954
<i>I do not ever want to see you again.</i>

578
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:15,581
Your Highness Prince Muyeong.

579
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:19,126
<i>He lives in a different world</i>
<i>than the rest of us.</i>

580
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:21,670
<i>You are bound to be hurt</i>

581
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:23,464
<i>if you stay by his side.</i>

582
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:26,383
Why did you bring this to me?

583
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:29,553
I need to get rid of the Grand Proprietor.

584
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:32,264
<i>I must protect my father</i>
<i>and the royal family.</i>

585
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,560
<i>We must restore the order of this nation.</i>

586
01:12:37,144 --> 01:12:38,562
<i>Where did you go this time?</i>

587
01:12:38,645 --> 01:12:39,730
Do not roam around recklessly.

588
01:12:39,813 --> 01:12:40,898
Is that an order?

589
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:42,691
<i>Do as I say.</i>

590
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:45,069
<i>That is best for your sake.</i>

591
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:47,738
Cheon Jun-hwa, the Grand Proprietor's son?

592
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:49,782
<i>That seems to be</i>

593
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:51,784
<i>the only way to protect Deok-su.</i>

594
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:53,077
Die!

595
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,912
I am the new innkeeper,

596
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:56,538
Cheon Jun-hwa.

597
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:58,082
<i>I will make the three men</i>

598
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,334
<i>who killed my father 12 years ago</i>

599
01:13:00,417 --> 01:13:02,795
<i>destroy themselves</i>
<i>while fighting one another.</i>

600
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:06,715
<i>I will not give up nor stop.</i>

601
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:10,302
