00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,423
<i>I will not give up</i>

5
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,300
<i>nor stop.</i>

6
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,011
Then, let me join you.

7
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:56,181
Whatever you intend to do,
let me assist you.

8
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,807
Are you willing to be the bait

9
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,185
for the trap I set?

10
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,607
<i>The three people responsible</i>

11
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,277
<i>for my father's death 12 years ago</i>
<i>are all after this ledger.</i>

12
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,282
<i>I will make them destroy themselves</i>
<i>while fighting one another.</i>

13
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,952
Cho Seung-ryang, locate Prince Muyeong.

14
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,789
<i>Eun-ho, you will serve as bait</i>
<i>and spread word</i>

15
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,665
<i>that this is in the minister's hands.</i>

16
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,918
Where did you get this?

17
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,420
I want Grand Proprietor Cheon…

18
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:29,130
gone.

19
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,008
You have a deal.

20
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,636
<i>I will make His Majesty's assassin,</i>

21
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,887
<i>or Grand Proprietor Cheon,</i>

22
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,806
<i>suspect the Minister of War.</i>

23
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,684
Prince Muyeong gave the ledger
to the Minister of War?

24
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,187
We had the three swordsmen
from his residence followed,

25
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,855
but their ledgers were blank.

26
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,106
Forgive me.

27
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,861
Minister…

28
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,532
You have such a loyal son, Your Majesty.

29
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,702
The ledger that proves

30
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,704
how the former king was poisoned.

31
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,249
If you kill me now…

32
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,420
the ledger I have safely tucked away

33
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,882
<i>will be distributed</i>
<i>on the streets of Hanyang.</i>

34
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,551
I am almost there.

35
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,345
Finally, tomorrow,

36
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,515
my flesh and blood

37
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,643
will ascend the throne!

38
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,017
ACCESS FORBIDDEN

39
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,316
Did you secure the footprint?

40
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,400
Yes, sir.

41
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,701
EXHIBIT TWO
FOOTPRINT

42
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,066
The minister was already dead?

43
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,609
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

44
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,611
The ledger was also gone?

45
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,783
And Prince Muyeong?

46
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,369
Where is he right now?

47
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,081
He is at Yongcheonru.

48
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,627
That foolish boy.

49
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:22,470
Ultimately, everything ended up
in Grand Proprietor Cheon's hands.

50
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,527
Did you take care
of the minister without issue?

51
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,786
The Royal Swordsman was seen
climbing over the wall.

52
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,081
We will frame him for the murder.

53
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,377
Well done.

54
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,423
You may leave.

55
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,448
I welcome you to Yongcheonru,

56
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,533
Guildmaster of Uiju Guild.

57
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,959
Where is my boy Myeong-ho?

58
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:22,048
It has been a while,
and I would love to see his handsome face.

59
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,425
Let us go in.

60
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:13,057
Tell me, are all the men
of Hanyang so pretty?

61
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,643
"Pretty"? You crazy bastard.

62
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,438
So, you have not made a reservation,

63
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,648
but you want a VIP room?

64
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:21,899
That is correct!

65
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,402
We want the best room in Yongcheonru!

66
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,657
Are you aware of how scary

67
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,493
the elder lady over there can be?

68
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,590
Do not just stand there!

69
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,509
We need the innkeeper's permission
to give you a VIP room.

70
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,386
Is that so?

71
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,346
Let them have it.

72
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,647
I am Cheon Jun-hwa, the new innkeeper.

73
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,449
Are you the new innkeeper of Yongcheonru?

74
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,786
Then, is your father
Grand Proprietor Cheon?

75
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,288
Yes, ma'am.

76
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,831
Escort them.

77
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,125
That will not do.

78
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:25,713
I would like to be escorted
by the new innkeeper himself.

79
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,215
Let us go.

80
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,759
Sure, ma'am.

81
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,204
In here is the bathroom.

82
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,707
And there is a small bedroom over there.

83
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,878
If you need sleepwear or anything else,

84
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,339
you can call for a room clerk.

85
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:13,886
What is this thing?

86
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,307
Did you ring for me?

87
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,435
Hey, give me that.

88
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,812
Let me give it a go.

89
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,480
This is…

90
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,649
How fun!

91
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,490
Please use it with purpose.

92
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,869
I see you have a temper.

93
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,541
Here.

94
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,168
Take it.

95
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,423
What? You want more?

96
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:53,968
No, ma'am.

97
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:57,221
How could I refuse
precious money from a guest?

98
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:01,767
Now we are talking. Do you know
where that money came from?

99
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,895
I earned that money by tirelessly sweating

100
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,356
on horseback and boats
all throughout Uiju.

101
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,776
You should rest.
It must have been a long journey.

102
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,445
Yes, I should. Thank you.

103
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,160
Hold on. Innkeeper.

104
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,789
Truth be told,

105
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,251
my son works here at Yongcheonru.

106
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,170
Perhaps you know him?

107
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,755
His name is Kim Myeong-ho.

108
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,388
SLUSH FUNDS

109
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,852
BRIBES AND SLUSH FUNDS

110
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,169
INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLERKS

111
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,845
Lord Cheon, it is Hong Deok-su.

112
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,961
Are you the one who made this fake
and sent it to the Minister of War?

113
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,385
Now that the minister is taken care of,

114
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,511
who is next?

115
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,477
I have…

116
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,771
been seeking revenge all my life.

117
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:54,857
However,

118
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:59,403
I changed my mind after I heard
what you told me.

119
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,239
I want the Minister of War
to be the last revenge

120
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,826
led by bloodshed.

121
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,996
I realized there is no better revenge

122
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,041
than my undeniable success for all to see.

123
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,293
I hope to find

124
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,295
such success at Yongcheonru.

125
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:25,304
You dare to defy the heavens
with such audacious ambitions?

126
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,600
Was this not your dream 12 years ago?

127
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,311
I want to

128
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,773
make that dream come true for me too.

129
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,444
How am I to trust you?

130
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,790
This is your ledger.

131
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,107
I see this was
all planned out from the start.

132
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,157
You possess what your father did not.

133
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,204
You have once again confirmed
how alike you and I are.

134
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,039
Yes.

135
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:38,961
That is why I have decided
that I could entrust you with my fate.

136
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,715
You even possess the same gall

137
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,551
that allows you to challenge the heavens.

138
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:51,765
However…

139
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,353
that is not enough.

140
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,650
You must prove your determination to me.

141
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,448
Marry my son.

142
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,831
Surely, if you marry Jun-hwa
and become my family,

143
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,460
I should be able to believe

144
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,712
that we are in the same boat.

145
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,532
You do not need to answer now.

146
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,203
I shall wait until you are
ready to accept me.

147
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:56,705
Just wait and see.

148
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,833
I will do anything you want me to do.

149
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,337
That is enough.

150
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,089
You say you want to succeed here.

151
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,758
Let me make that happen.

152
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,593
Just say the word. What do you need?

153
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,929
And why must I tell you that?

154
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,516
I do not need you…

155
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,519
to succeed.

156
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,900
No. I am certain you will.

157
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,612
Use me, Deok-su.

158
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,738
Use me…

159
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,907
however you wish.

160
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,370
Marry me.

161
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,300
Eun-ho.

162
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,404
What brings you by, Your Highness?

163
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:15,034
Should you not be
at the palace, Prince Muyeong?

164
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,955
I am still an official clerk
of Yongcheonru.

165
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,791
I have a right to be here.

166
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,876
Do not tell me…

167
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,337
you actually plan to stay here.

168
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:30,966
Why would I not?

169
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,719
If that is the case,

170
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:38,557
are you willing to work under me,
the new innkeeper?

171
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,570
If need be.

172
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,531
- Lee Eun-ho.
- If need be…

173
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,410
I am prepared to give up

174
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,538
everything I have.

175
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,004
Why?

176
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,882
For what?

177
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,275
Did you not…

178
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,905
leave Deok-su in my care that night?

179
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,867
You abandoned her
without hesitation and now--

180
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,452
- Back then--
- Stop…

181
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,748
playing with her heart.

182
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,169
I do not know why you have come back here,

183
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,132
but stay away from Deok-su.

184
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,842
- Cheon Jun-hwa.
- Stop.

185
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,553
That is enough.

186
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,560
Jun-hwa.

187
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,812
I need to talk to Eun-ho privately.

188
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,025
Fine.

189
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,862
But it will be the last time.

190
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,619
Leave Yongcheonru, Lee Eun-ho.

191
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,554
I know why Jun-hwa is acting like that.

192
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,764
- However--
- The ledger…

193
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,895
I gave it to Lord Cheon.

194
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,481
The minister is gone. Lord Cheon is next.

195
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,858
Deok-su.

196
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,861
Will you really see this through?

197
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,238
You might end up getting hurt.

198
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,741
Please stop.

199
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:01,825
No.

200
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,454
I will do it.

201
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,123
I must.

202
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,421
I told you I would be your bait.

203
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:16,924
Deok-su,

204
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,968
do not dirty your hands
with any more blood.

205
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,099
It is not just for my father.

206
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,438
The Grand Proprietor…

207
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,776
killed my mother too.

208
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,448
So let go. Do not try to stop me.

209
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,532
Deok-su.

210
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,580
I made up my mind
the moment I decided to hand over

211
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,707
the ledger to him.

212
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,253
You should get back.

213
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,168
<i>I, Cheon Mak-dong, am your friend.</i>

214
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,795
Have some faith in me.

215
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,131
The world will be turned
upside down tomorrow.

216
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,009
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

217
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,552
Your Majesty!

218
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,971
Brother!

219
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,308
Min-sik, what did I tell you?

220
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,310
The world has been flipped upside down!

221
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,752
He took the ledger?

222
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,761
SHARING DOUBLES YOUR JOY

223
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,474
- Get him!
- Get him!

224
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,559
Go! Find Hong Min-sik!

225
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:39,274
Hong Min-sik hid the safe chest.

226
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:41,735
- We must find it, no matter what.
- Yes, my lord.

227
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,489
Search thoroughly!

228
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,415
Where is Hong Min-sik?

229
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,711
No!

230
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,463
Find the safe chest!

231
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:51,429
Father!

232
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,391
Over here! This way!

233
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,810
Jae-on…

234
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,072
Where is he?

235
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,830
Hong Min-sik!

236
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,675
Seol Mae-hwa, you wench!

237
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:12,677
How dare you betray me!

238
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,476
Where did you hide the safe chest?

239
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:24,773
Is that all you have to say
to your old friend?

240
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:27,817
Hand it over right now!

241
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,111
Hey, Cheon Mak-dong.

242
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,073
It is all over for you now.

243
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,449
You are wrong!

244
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,453
I, Cheon Mak-dong,

245
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,580
will climb up higher than the royal throne

246
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,749
with my gold

247
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,043
until…

248
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:48,880
my influence reaches the heavens!

249
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,051
Watch me from your grave

250
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,345
and see if I am wrong.

251
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,187
Where is his daughter?

252
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:10,235
She must have
the other half of the brass key.

253
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,195
Go and find it.

254
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,873
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

255
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,959
Du-sik, it has been a while.

256
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,463
Seok-sam, how have you been?

257
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,590
Myeong-myeong…

258
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,258
- Hello.
- Hey.

259
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,926
Is Young Master Myeong-ho inside?

260
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,597
Myeong-ho is…

261
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,518
- He is sick!
- He went to poop!

262
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,813
What sort of nonsense is this?

263
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,607
Step aside. Move it!

264
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,741
What is going on?

265
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,368
- Young Master…
- What happened?

266
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,913
- Are you all right?
- Forgive us!

267
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,956
We deserve death.

268
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,375
Please end our lives.

269
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,008
Who did this?

270
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:00,804
Tell me right now!

271
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,680
Well, it was…

272
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,308
Please forgive me…

273
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,523
What is the meaning of this?

274
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,066
Who are you to tell me anything?

275
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,323
Who here messed up
our Young Master Myeong-ho's mug?

276
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,574
Who is it?

277
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:28,415
The prick that beat him up
better show himself.

278
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:31,000
Now! Show yourself!

279
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:35,422
I see everyone here has a death wish.

280
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,340
It was me.

281
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,302
I hit Kim Myeong-ho.

282
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,851
You?

283
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,605
You did?

284
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,650
You did that?

285
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,194
Are you kidding me right now?

286
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,864
Are you saying
these dainty wrists were responsible?

287
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:04,159
As if you could even throw a punch
with such puny fists.

288
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,997
Should you not be asking
what he did wrong first?

289
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,209
He slandered and threatened another clerk.

290
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,136
Get up.

291
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:24,888
Come here.

292
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:27,348
Come here. Come on now.

293
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,270
What are you doing?

294
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,023
Jun-hwa, just walk away.

295
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,609
At the very least,
we should return the beating.

296
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:39,569
Hey, Baek-baek.

297
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,697
Hold onto him tightly.

298
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,534
Do not just stand there. Move it!

299
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,245
Let go of him!

300
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,500
Look here, Innkeeper.

301
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,085
You should step aside.

302
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,255
It was me. I hit Kim Myeong-ho.

303
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,425
Listen, Innkeeper.

304
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,178
Stay out of it.
You will only make things worse.

305
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:09,098
Tell your guildmaster to come to me
if she wishes to raise an issue.

306
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,309
Is that so?

307
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,685
You are asking…

308
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,813
for war.

309
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,900
Surely…

310
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,278
you must understand what that means.

311
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,829
My poor boy…

312
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,543
Ma'am.

313
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,211
The new innkeeper was behind it.

314
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,965
The new innkeeper?
That punk from earlier did this?

315
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,300
Yes, ma'am. Grand Proprietor Cheon's son.

316
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,846
Yu Su-in, what were you doing?

317
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,138
Ma'am?

318
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,223
I trusted you,

319
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,851
but you only failed Myeong-ho
and lost the innkeeper's title!

320
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,228
How can you even call yourself
a man of Uiju?

321
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,401
My dear Myeong-ho…

322
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,153
You need to wake up.

323
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,490
Mom?

324
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,033
Yes, it is your mother.

325
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,579
Why would anyone beat up my son like this?

326
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:16,624
Mom… I almost died!

327
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,418
What took you so long?

328
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:21,296
Did you really fight
Grand Proprietor Cheon's son?

329
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,423
"Fight"?

330
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,884
Careful.

331
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,177
Mom, did you forget who I am?

332
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,847
I am Kim Myeong-ho, your son.

333
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,058
You know I would never hurt a fly!

334
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,602
Why these little…

335
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,229
After running our Uiju Guild ragged,

336
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,732
this is how they pay back our loyalty?

337
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,151
Hey! Fetch me
that damn proprietor this instant!

338
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,489
I will make him pay.

339
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,743
- Mom…
- Lie back down.

340
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,621
Why did you not just hit him back?

341
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,624
I have never hit
another person before in my life!

342
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:01,377
Yes, I know. My poor boy…

343
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,839
The Uiju Guildmaster is here?

344
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:08,051
Yes, she is determined to make
Young Master Jun-hwa…

345
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,470
I mean, Innkeeper Cheon pay
for assaulting her son.

346
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,683
Now of all times,

347
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,771
the Uiju Guildmaster came here herself?

348
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,693
Let us go.

349
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,071
War must be prevented.

350
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,157
Lord Cheon.

351
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,628
What is it?

352
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,588
I have something to tell you.

353
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,508
Could you spare me a moment?

354
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,804
I have a guest
who requires my urgent attention.

355
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,764
I will call for you later.

356
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,001
<i>The Grand Proprietor…</i>

357
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,836
killed my mother too.

358
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:28,506
I made up my mind
the moment I decided to hand over

359
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,883
the ledger to him.

360
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:08,379
It is quite a long way.
To what do I owe this unannounced visit?

361
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,464
Forget all that.

362
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,883
Have you seen my son's eye?

363
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:16,095
There seems to have been
a misunderstanding.

364
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,222
What did you just say?

365
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,892
I hear assailants nowadays
never lose a wink of sleep.

366
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,852
Not an ounce of shame to be found.

367
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,729
Bring me alcohol!

368
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,148
This is not something
to be discussed over tea!

369
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,818
What happened to Seol Mae-hwa?

370
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:36,491
As if making my son's eye
black and blue was not enough,

371
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,493
now you nitpick over your request to us?

372
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,165
I do hope you took care of her
without issue.

373
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,628
<i>Grant me an audience</i>
<i>with your guildmaster.</i>

374
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,008
Relay this message to her.

375
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,887
"It is time
for a new master of this world."

376
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,390
- That is enough out of you, wench!
- Stop.

377
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,436
Keep talking.

378
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,865
It seems I must insist on proper payment

379
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,785
for that brat, Seol Mae-hwa,

380
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:23,287
and for my battered son.

381
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,000
Yes, I shall offer you as much.

382
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,548
What? Wait…

383
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,259
One, two, three.

384
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:21,387
Where did the rest go?

385
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,828
Eun-ho.

386
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,588
Where are we going?

387
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,232
Lady Seol?

388
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,570
Lady Seol!

389
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,739
You have returned.

390
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,908
Have you been well?

391
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,417
I was worried
because I did not hear from you.

392
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:38,005
I apologize.
You had to deal with a lot alone.

393
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,553
Lord Cheon

394
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,431
is pushing for me to wed Cheon Jun-hwa.

395
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,351
"Wed"?

396
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,812
It will not happen, of course.

397
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,397
Soon…

398
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,733
Yongcheonru will be turned upside down.

399
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,655
All preparations have been made.

400
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,701
Now, all I need to do is wait.

401
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,078
Cheon Mak-dong…

402
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:14,542
I just need to witness
his demise for myself.

403
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,591
I…

404
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,429
just hope you will not be blinded
by your desire for revenge.

405
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,224
You must not put yourself in danger.

406
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:37,231
You might end up getting hurt.

407
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,525
Please stop.

408
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,404
You sound like someone I know.

409
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:48,534
Anyone who loves and cherishes you
would tell you the same thing.

410
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,702
Both Lord Hong

411
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,288
and your late mother

412
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,416
prayed for your safety
with their last breaths.

413
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:57,960
But…

414
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,005
both my father

415
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,424
and my foster mother

416
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,303
passed away because of me.

417
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,056
How could I ever forget that?

418
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,391
That was not your fault, Jae-on.

419
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,280
The unimaginable will soon take place.

420
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:30,993
"The unimaginable"?

421
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,664
The king will be replaced.

422
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,032
<i>Take it.</i>

423
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,787
This is Prince Muyeong's dragon sword.

424
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,006
Please take it.

425
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,758
It is of no use to me ripped.

426
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:47,111
The one who stole that Red Certificate

427
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:50,448
must be the killer!

428
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,451
I shall leave it to you.

429
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,791
<i>The minister asked if I have been</i>
<i>working on my swordsmanship.</i>

430
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:04,503
He looked for the dragon-engraved sword
bestowed to princes,

431
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,046
so I showed him mine.

432
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,549
Allow me to help.

433
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,217
If you are in danger,

434
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,595
I will gladly take the fall for you.

435
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,974
I will soon acquire that power.

436
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,194
<i>Follow the path you have decided to take.</i>

437
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,278
Brother…

438
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:32,114
We will talk later. Go now.

439
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,506
<i>A new king?</i>

440
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,133
All the past evils
of Grand Proprietor Cheon

441
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,428
and His Majesty will be eradicated,

442
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,764
once and for all.

443
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,058
If that happens…

444
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,395
Prince Muyeong will also get hurt.

445
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,670
What is the matter, Deok-su?

446
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,138
Do you love Jae-on?

447
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,808
Lady Seol.

448
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,853
Yes. I love Hong Deok-su.

449
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,235
That is why I promised her

450
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,655
that I would keep her safe,
no matter what.

451
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,658
I will take your word for it.

452
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,036
You must keep Jae-on safe.

453
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,963
We do not have much time.
You must make your decision quickly.

454
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:50,878
Your abode is quite remarkable.

455
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:55,049
I never thought you would come
all the way here, Your Majesty.

456
00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:00,596
You told me I was
always welcome here as your close friend.

457
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,562
The Minister of War is dead.

458
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,149
I am aware.

459
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,527
This worked out well.

460
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:17,946
Very well.

461
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,241
It seems his greed

462
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,703
sent him to an early grave.

463
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,209
I heard Hong Min-sik's daughter

464
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,671
handed the ledger over to the minister.

465
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,760
Have you retrieved it?

466
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:42,471
Why do you want to know that?

467
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,058
We need to get rid of it.

468
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,853
Let us burn it together.

469
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,816
In the end, it is a secret
that must never see the light of day.

470
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:57,236
That is the only way

471
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,363
we can rest easy.

472
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,410
The ledger was nowhere to be found.

473
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:06,829
However…

474
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:11,750
they did find this.

475
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:17,089
This is the culprit's footprint
discovered at the crime scene.

476
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,010
EXHIBIT TWO
FOOTPRINT

477
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:28,725
Are you asking me
about the whereabouts of the ledger

478
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:32,187
when you sent
the Royal Swordsman to kill the minister?

479
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,657
What is the matter, Eun-ho?

480
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:28,827
Let us go.

481
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:44,760
Eun-ho.

482
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,387
Eun-ho.

483
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,308
What is wrong?

484
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:56,980
Who were those men just now?

485
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,154
Are they from the palace?

486
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,745
That was my father.

487
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,124
I am certain something happened

488
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,669
given Father is at Yongcheonru.

489
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,047
<i>The unimaginable will soon take place.</i>

490
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,508
If that happens…

491
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,385
Prince Muyeong will also get hurt.

492
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:28,345
You must leave this place, Jae-on.

493
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,597
I should go.

494
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,848
To the palace? Now?

495
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,727
Do not worry too much.

496
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,943
Do not go.

497
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,282
You cannot go now.

498
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,915
Are you feeling better?

499
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,960
I heard you went through many hardships.

500
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:02,004
Not at all.

501
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:07,175
Thanks to Uiju's warm hospitality,
I was restored to full health.

502
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,136
She is…

503
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:13,849
the esteemed Uiju Guildmaster.

504
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:22,941
I am here to offer my greetings to you,
the legitimate heir, Your Highness.

505
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,904
Legitimacy is inconsequential.

506
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,699
Whoever ascends the throne gains it.

507
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:35,245
As you can see,
I am a mere deposed crown prince

508
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,956
who is begging for his life at the moment.

509
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:44,254
So, what made
the powerless deposed crown prince decide

510
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,758
that he wants to ascend the royal throne?

511
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,056
Ma'am.

512
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,808
No, I must hear it for myself.

513
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,977
My life is on the line here.

514
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,938
I should at least hear him say the words.

515
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:04,483
So…

516
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,986
you want to know
why I desire to ascend the throne?

517
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,745
I wish to stop lowly peddlers like you

518
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:20,415
from swindling
and disgracing the royal family.

519
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,376
Do you understand?

520
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:41,645
Then, you have picked the right person.

521
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:44,981
I am only ever interested in money.

522
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:49,069
Power and the royal court are
of very little importance to me.

523
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:54,491
Then, shall we proceed with this deal?

524
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:59,830
If we provide the funds,
what will we get in return?

525
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,084
Yongcheonru.

526
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:12,217
Your son should be
at its helm in the future, should he not?

527
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,436
Let us do that.

528
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,814
Let us wipe this slate clean

529
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,941
and create a whole new world.

530
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,204
Why are you telling me to stay?

531
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:03,560
Leave with me.

532
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:08,356
A boat will be waiting for me
at the docks at dawn.

533
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,525
Come with me.

534
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:14,863
Let us run far away.

535
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,951
What… do you mean?

536
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:23,789
Is something wrong, Deok-su?

537
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:38,804
Can we trust the Uiju Guildmaster?

538
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:42,182
Trust has never been
a driving force for them.

539
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:44,434
They only chase after profits.

540
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,981
I have waited more than a decade for this.

541
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:54,319
I cannot afford a single mistake.

542
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:59,783
I, too, have endured 12 years
to prepare for this.

543
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,410
It is time to see it through.

544
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,400
I want you to have it.

545
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,446
Deok-su.

546
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,240
Let us…

547
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,535
be together.

548
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,385
You said you wanted me to be happy, right?

549
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:03,680
I…

550
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:09,185
do not think I could be happy without you.

551
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,399
Let me keep you safe now.

552
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:26,119
We should get going.
The boat should be ready soon.

553
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,539
Your Highness.

554
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:33,793
What is it?

555
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:35,670
Prince Eunseong asked for you.

556
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,088
He did?

557
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,183
I should go.

558
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:50,602
Do not go.

559
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:02,280
There is still time. I shall hurry back.

560
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,785
I must say goodbye
to Brother before I leave.

561
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:09,537
- But--
- I need to let him know.

562
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,335
At the least, he should know the truth.

563
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,964
He should have from the start.

564
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,184
Promise me.

565
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:36,439
Promise that you will come back.

566
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,239
Do not worry.

567
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,035
I will meet you at the docks soon.

568
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:51,913
I will be there.

569
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:03,591
I promise.

570
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:12,786
Take it.

571
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:15,914
This sword belongs to you now.

572
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:27,050
I changed my fate with this sword.

573
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:30,053
Your fate, too,

574
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:34,390
shall be determined
by that sword in your hands.

575
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,322
It has been a while.

576
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,367
Seol Mae-hwa.

577
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,329
You look like you have just seen a ghost.

578
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:19,727
Did your father give you that sword?

579
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:23,273
You returned
even though it has been revealed

580
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:24,983
that you killed Deok-su's father.

581
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,611
Have you no shame?

582
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,574
Did Lord Cheon tell you that?

583
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:34,617
Hong Deok-su… No,

584
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:40,373
young Hong Jae-on was an eyewitness.
Will you continue to play dumb?

585
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:43,543
Wake up.
Stop burying your head in the sand.

586
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:48,339
The one who killed Jae-on's father
and her foster mother

587
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:52,594
is none other than your father,
Grand Proprietor Cheon.

588
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,809
He used that sword in front of you

589
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:02,645
to slay her father to death.
Do you understand?

590
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:04,397
What…

591
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:09,110
What did you just say?

592
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:13,239
I hardly recognize you now.

593
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:17,243
Did your title get to your head?

594
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:20,205
You are lying…

595
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:23,249
- Do not lie to me!
- Twelve years ago…

596
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,836
Cheon Mak-dong, your father,

597
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:29,297
killed Hong Jae-on's father.

598
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:33,635
Do you wish to sever your precious ties
with that same sword?

599
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,341
Are you leaving?

600
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,772
Climb over the female dormitory wall.
That will be safer.

601
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:29,566
What?

602
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:37,657
Okay. Thanks, Su-ra.

603
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,076
Try to understand Jun-hwa.

604
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:45,164
You know how hard it is
to control your feelings for someone

605
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,000
that you love.

606
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:52,672
It must have been hard for him too.

607
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:58,970
Have a safe journey.

608
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:01,848
Let us see each other again.

609
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:13,985
Okay.

610
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:37,717
<i>A family was ruined</i>
<i>because of that ledger.</i>

611
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:41,763
Do you know what kind of life
his daughter has had to live?

612
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:44,307
To avenge the unfair death of her father,

613
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,851
she spent her whole life in agony!

614
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:55,401
Let us go.

615
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,075
Royal Swordsman.

616
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:10,917
Was that girl earlier

617
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:13,586
Hong Min-sik's daughter?

618
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,046
Yes, Your Majesty.

619
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,884
She must have the ledger.

620
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,178
- Royal Swordsman.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

621
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:25,098
Bring me Prince Muyeong and the girl.

622
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:33,064
<i>A bead from Prince Muyeong's sash.</i>

623
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,735
A grand undertaking is afoot.

624
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:44,117
We cannot leave any trace behind
until that is complete.

625
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,369
Yes, Your Highness.

626
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:41,340
We need to set sail soon.
Why are they not here yet?

627
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:45,803
Jeez. As if we were not busy enough,
we need to look after a runaway now?

628
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,431
- Are you from Uiju?
- Yes.

629
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:51,392
The passenger has arrived.
You can set sail now.

630
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:52,477
No, you cannot.

631
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,981
There is someone else coming. Please wait.

632
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:07,200
Show them this once you arrive in Uiju.

633
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,703
That will ensure your safety.

634
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,289
Baek-baek, let us leave.

635
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:18,419
Thank you.

636
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:20,838
Thank you so much!

637
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:40,441
I heard you called for me.

638
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:47,740
I came

639
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,202
because I also had something to tell you.

640
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:06,217
Twelve years ago, the late king…

641
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:11,848
was poisoned to death.

642
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,269
And…

643
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,063
behind that murder--

644
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:20,565
I am already aware.

645
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,203
This is evidence from the scene
of the minister's murder.

646
01:04:47,174 --> 01:04:48,968
I am sure you are not the culprit.

647
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:51,345
I do not wish

648
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,806
to see it end up in someone else's hands

649
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,309
and you be framed for the crime.

650
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:03,190
I am glad I can help you.

651
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:04,483
Brother.

652
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:05,860
Leave now.

653
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:06,944
And…

654
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,447
never return.

655
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:29,610
We cannot wait any longer.

656
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:33,489
Just a bit longer. He will be here soon.

657
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:35,116
Please.

658
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,593
<i>Do not worry.</i>

659
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,595
I will meet you at the docks soon.

660
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:00,016
I will be there.

661
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,247
<i>Promise me.</i>

662
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,416
Promise that you will come back.

663
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:51,872
<i>I heard my father used this sword</i>
<i>to kill his friend</i>

664
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:53,415
<i>and gain what he desired.</i>

665
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:56,126
<i>Could I win Deok-su that way as well?</i>

666
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,461
<i>Step aside, Jun-hwa.</i>

667
01:10:57,544 --> 01:10:59,255
This is the only way to protect her.

668
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:00,714
With what power?

669
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:02,508
<i>I, Prince Muyeong,</i>

670
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:04,468
will ascend the royal throne.

671
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:09,265
<i>That is the only way</i>
<i>I can keep Deok-su safe.</i>

672
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:10,975
<i>Have you finally decided?</i>

673
01:11:11,058 --> 01:11:12,810
<i>Bring forth a new world.</i>

674
01:11:12,893 --> 01:11:16,355
<i>I gathered you here so that I may petition</i>
<i>for my crown prince appointment.</i>

675
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:20,442
<i>Why can I not just follow</i>
<i>in my father's footsteps?</i>

676
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:23,279
<i>Return Yongcheonru to Hong Jae-on.</i>

677
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:25,572
<i>I will nip</i>
<i>any potential hurdles in the bud.</i>

678
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:27,032
<i>Whoever it may be.</i>

679
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,830
<i>As long as you are by my side…</i>

680
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:34,915
<i>No matter the dangers…</i>

681
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,293
<i>I can…</i>

682
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:38,877
<i>Me too.</i>

683
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:41,046
<i>- I promised to keep you safe.</i>
<i>- I promised to keep you safe.</i>
