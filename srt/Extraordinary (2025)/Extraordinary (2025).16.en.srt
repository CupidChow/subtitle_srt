1
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:56,240
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

2
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,879
Who told you that?

3
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,439
I heard it from the Imperial Sister-in-law.

4
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,959
She said the Imperial Brother is sending you
to Mou County.

5
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,200
I'm afraid I won't see you for a long time.

6
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,599
Don't worry.

7
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:24,719
I'll come back safe and sound.

8
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,040
It's getting late.

9
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,120
Princess, you should return to the palace.

10
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,280
I should go too.

11
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,159
Young Duke, let me go with you.

12
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:44,239
Shuang'er is right.

13
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,519
She's thoughtful and can look after you
on the road.

14
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,519
Shuang'er is skilled in martial arts.

15
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,359
How do you know that?

16
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,159
That day, you were in my father's study.

17
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,280
I knew everything.

18
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,840
But what you were looking for

19
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,159
wasn't in the study.

20
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,159
The road ahead is dangerous.

21
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,879
You must be careful.

22
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:15,960
I'm leaving.

23
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:38,680
Let's go.

24
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,400
Come.

25
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,199
Shi Feifan.

26
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,280
I'll wait for your safe return.

27
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,639
Everyone, stay alert.

28
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:26,159
Soon, Shi Feifan won't make it back.

29
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes.

30
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,360
Young Duke.

31
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,680
Young Duke.

32
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,160
I smell blood.

33
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,560
The mantis hunts the cicada,
unaware of the oriole.

34
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,480
Let's go.

35
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,680
Ziyan.

36
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,720
You betrayed Celestial Star Tower.

37
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,079
You're annoying.

38
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:51,759
Your Highness.

39
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,360
This is a small token of my respect.

40
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,800
It's especially for Your Highness.

41
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,600
I wonder why Your Highness
came here this time.

42
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:01,879
Is there something important?

43
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,319
This time, I came

44
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:06,160
to take care of someone.

45
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,639
Rest assured, Your Highness.

46
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,040
No matter who it is,

47
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:13,079
he won't leave Mou County alive.

48
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,759
Shi Feifan.

49
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,720
Even if you escape the ambush ahead,

50
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:21,720
you can't escape the net here.

51
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,959
Brave one, wait!

52
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,160
Did you come from Mou County, sir?

53
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,720
I've heard Mou County is beautiful.

54
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,399
I'm planning to visit there.

55
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,759
Brother,

56
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:54,120
you really can't go to Mou County now.

57
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,000
Why is that?

58
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,680
Those damn officials in Mou County

59
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,800
prey on the people and run wild.

60
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,639
Now the people there are homeless.

61
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:03,879
They can't even fill their stomachs.

62
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,279
Their suffering is beyond words.

63
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,079
You mean the damn officials prey on the people
in Mou County?

64
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,600
How do they prey on them?

65
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,240
Let's go.

66
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,720
Let's go.

67
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,039
Buns!

68
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,200
Fresh buns!

69
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,759
Hot and fresh!

70
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,639
Take a look, buns here!

71
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,399
Young Duke, we've arrived.

72
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,039
Come.

73
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,240
Slow down, Young Duke.

74
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,039
Slow down, Miss Shuang'er.

75
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,519
Little trinkets!

76
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,200
Little trinkets!

77
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,159
Young Duke, could we be mistaken?

78
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,159
Yeah.

79
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,720
Why is Mou County busier than the Capital?

80
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,240
Latest style fans!

81
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,159
Come and take a look!

82
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,200
How much is this?

83
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,600
Rouge and powder!

84
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,879
Ladies, come and see!

85
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,799
Beef!

86
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,320
Don't look if you won't buy!

87
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:52,879
Forget it, forget it.

88
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,240
Let's go.

89
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:56,639
We don't have money to buy.

90
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:57,960
Let's go.

91
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,120
Let's go.

92
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,879
You're lucky today.

93
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,600
The County Magistrate said

94
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:58,519
we must stay alert these days.

95
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,720
Don't let anyone see a flaw.

96
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,879
Yes, yes.

97
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,759
Yes.

98
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,879
Here, eat quickly.

99
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,960
Eat up, eat up!

100
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,360
Come on, come on!

101
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:10,360
Grab it!

102
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,679
Hurry, grab it! Come on!

103
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,960
Hurry, grab it!

104
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,159
Aren't you hungry?

105
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,279
Young Duke.

106
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,000
Let me go and take out those damn yamen runners.

107
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,120
You think I don't want to?

108
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,039
If we rush in now,

109
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,519
we'll only alert them.

110
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:25,759
We won't find anything.

111
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,440
Once you're full, go back and take my place.

112
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,759
If anything goes wrong,

113
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,200
your miserable life won't be spared.

114
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,600
Boss, does this really help?

115
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:38,000
Those big officials from the Capital,

116
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,279
they all muddle through like this.

117
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,600
You tell me, does it work or not?

118
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,559
Hurry back.

119
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,720
There's important business at the yamen today.

120
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,200
Darn it!

121
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:50,679
Spare me, Young Master!

122
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,320
Watch where you're going next time.

123
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,320
You blocked my way.

124
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:57,720
My boots are dirty now.

125
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,039
Let's go.

126
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,399
Stop looking.

127
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,360
Someone's following us.

128
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,200
Here's the plan.

129
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:24,240
You and the Egg Yolk brothers go scout
the city first.

130
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,720
Meet at the yamen gate at noon tomorrow.

131
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:27,080
Okay.

132
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,759
Okay.

133
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:28,840
Let's go.

134
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:29,840
Let's go.

135
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,600
Young Duke, what about us?

136
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,120
Thirty-Six Stratagems.

137
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,519
Feint to the East, Attack to the West.

138
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,279
Feint to the East, Attack to the West.

139
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:53,480
We've been tricked.

140
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,639
Your Highness,

141
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,519
your "catching a turtle in a jar" move

142
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,039
is truly brilliant.

143
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,440
Even if that kid has the Gatling,

144
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,960
he still can't escape.

145
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,240
On my turf,

146
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:08,879
he can't do as he pleases.

147
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,600
Your Highness, you're absolutely right.

148
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,600
Your Highness, Shi Feifan has escaped!

149
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:16,960
What?

150
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,279
Then hurry and chase after him!

151
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:20,480
Where should I chase him?

152
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,480
He didn't come to the county office,

153
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,960
which means he's suspicious.

154
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:29,440
At this moment,

155
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,360
he must be looking for a loophole.

156
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:35,320
Your Highness,

157
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:36,879
I know of a loophole.

158
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,720
Wujia Village.

159
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,639
Young Duke,

160
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:56,720
there's a girl there.

161
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:01,559
Miss, how do we get to Wujia Village?

162
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,159
Do you know which way Wujia Village is?

163
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,080
Young Duke, is this girl mute?

164
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:17,759
Don't talk nonsense.

165
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,240
Can you tell me now

166
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,120
which way to go?

167
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,279
Can you take us there?

168
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,200
Where is your village chief?
