1
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:56,759
Big liar

2
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,600
Shi Feifan is a big liar

3
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:17,599
Nan Batian

4
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,000
Nan Batian

5
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,959
Wake up

6
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,920
Giving you a chance to redeem yourself

7
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,200
Nan Batian

8
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,359
A clever way to leave no witnesses

9
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,760
Lord Han

10
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,079
The land has been sorted out

11
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,400
But it hasn't been allocated yet

12
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,239
If I leave just like this

13
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,439
Everything I've done before
would be for nothing

14
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,439
Give me three more days

15
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:54,840
Just three days

16
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,280
Alright, I promise you

17
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,319
That's great

18
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,879
Don't fight, don't fight

19
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,680
There's enough for everyone

20
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,520
We have land now

21
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:25,120
There's enough for everyone

22
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:25,960
This is wonderful

23
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,360
You ruin your own future

24
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,639
Do you truly not regret it?

25
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,240
In one's lifetime

26
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,120
You must do a few things
that make you proud

27
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,120
Big, passionate things

28
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,000
The nation is its people

29
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,120
The people are the nation

30
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,240
So even if I face great danger

31
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,080
No matter the cost

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,840
I will still do it

33
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,560
When I grow old one day

34
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,479
Lying on a rocking chair

35
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,280
Looking back on my life

36
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,039
Only then will it all be worth it

37
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:34,759
Truly meaningful

38
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,960
Be an official like Shi Feifan

39
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,800
I regret not meeting you earlier

40
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,199
It's not too late to know you now

41
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,919
Let's use tea instead of wine

42
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:45,840
I'll drink a cup with you

43
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,879
Tea at midnight affects sleep

44
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,280
Alright then

45
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,280
When we reach the capital

46
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,360
I'll have a good drink with you

47
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:57,199
Alright

48
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,680
It's finally done

49
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,400
The three-day deadline is here

50
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,000
Lord Shi, it's time to go

51
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,159
Even if I agree to go back with you

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,199
I might not make it back alive

53
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,439
It's not that I don't trust you

54
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,600
But Nan Batian kills without warning

55
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,759
The journey back may be dangerous

56
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,480
Don't worry, Lord Shi

57
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,959
I'll risk my life to protect yours

58
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:07,680
Shi Feifan

59
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,839
Do you have anything else to say?

60
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:13,879
Your subject Shi Feifan has
completed the resettlement

61
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,560
Today I return to report in the capital

62
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,040
Resettlement is complete

63
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,680
You disregard the law

64
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,199
You killed a prince

65
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,600
Is this your way of resettling?

66
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,240
Extraordinary times call for
extraordinary actions

67
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,160
If I hadn't killed Liang Qing
or divided the land

68
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,079
The people would have rebelled soon

69
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,560
Nonsense

70
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,120
Even with your silver tongue

71
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,480
You can't escape the fact
you killed a court official

72
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,319
If I don't kill the traitor

73
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,439
Should I let him keep harming the people?

74
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:47,839
You

75
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
Dying for the people

76
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,959
My life is worth it as Shi Feifan

77
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,720
Shi Feifan

78
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,079
Take a good look at yourself

79
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,199
You're unbelievably bold

80
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:58,720
Tyrant

81
00:05:59,360 --> 00:05:59,639
You

82
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,800
Insulting Your Majesty is
a grave offense

83
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,600
You should be executed

84
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,199
Your Majesty

85
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,319
Your Majesty

86
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,160
For the merit he has earned

87
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,160
Please spare his life

88
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,759
I, your old subject, will die for him

89
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,519
Father

90
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,279
Duke of Nan, you failed to teach your son

91
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,480
Letting Shi Feifan cause a disaster

92
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,000
For your repeated military merits

93
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,600
Go home and reflect on your mistakes

94
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,680
Your Majesty

95
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,519
Your Majesty

96
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,879
What did my father do wrong?

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Your Majesty dares to act
but not let me speak?

98
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,360
Shielding the culprit is unjust

99
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:40,240
Letting the people suffer is unkind

100
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,680
Now I have completed my task

101
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,079
Yet Your Majesty wants to punish me

102
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,240
Believe it or not

103
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,040
History will judge for itself

104
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,319
Fine, fine

105
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,839
You have a sharp tongue

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,879
Facing death, you still show no remorse

107
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:54,920
Guards

108
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,920
Take Shi Feifan to the Imperial Prison

109
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,560
Execution at noon tomorrow

110
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,120
I bear Heaven's mandate

111
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,920
Shi Feifan disregarded the law

112
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,399
Violated ancient virtue, killed a prince

113
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,439
The law cannot tolerate this

114
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,360
Now to uphold order and discipline

115
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,240
Send Shi Feifan to the Imperial Prison

116
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,920
Await further punishment

117
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:34,199
Announce this to all

118
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,279
Pass down the order

119
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,519
Anyone who pleads for Shi Feifan

120
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,600
Will be executed as well

121
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,959
Shi Feifan

122
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,519
Why are you here?

123
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,839
As long as I can be with you

124
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,120
Even if I eat only husks and greens,
I'm not afraid

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,399
Even if I go to the underworld

126
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,440
I'm willing to go with you

127
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,639
I once wasted my time

128
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,679
Thought life was nothing special

129
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,559
But right now

130
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,399
I wish I could live a long life

131
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,600
Don't worry

132
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,679
I will get you out for sure

133
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,159
Thank you

134
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,519
What?

135
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:29,080
You've always seen me as a love rival?

136
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,200
Then you

137
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,399
What do you plan to do next?

138
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,759
Go somewhere no one knows me

139
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,200
Start over

140
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,480
Take care of yourself

141
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,000
Please tell Shi Feifan

142
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,440
We're even now

143
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,080
How hateful I am, truly.

144
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,000
I wouldn't dare.

145
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:46,960
I wouldn't dare.

146
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:49,840
You must have already, in your heart,

147
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,559
cursed me tens of thousands of times.

148
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,320
Your Majesty, you are absolutely right.

149
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:56,440
You—

150
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,679
Sometimes I truly envy you.

151
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:04,759
You speak your mind when upset.

152
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,039
You strike out when unhappy.

153
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,000
No need to weigh or consider.

154
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
No need to think of pros and cons.

155
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,799
I ascended the throne as a child.

156
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,279
Prime Minister Lü suppressed me.

157
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:16,799
I wish to be a good emperor loved by the people.

158
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,919
But as a ruler,

159
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,519
I am not free to act as I wish.

160
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,080
At just twenty-something years old,

161
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,120
How can you be so constrained?

162
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,720
You hold the highest position in the land.

163
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,519
Loyal subjects support you, the people adore you.

164
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,000
What could be impossible for you?

165
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,039
Life is not always smooth sailing.

166
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,080
More often, it is rowing against the current.

167
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,080
If Your Majesty wishes to reach the end faster,

168
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,919
I do have a suggestion.

169
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:04,600
Your Majesty—

170
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,120
My father spent his life in battle.

171
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,919
His wounds are countless.

172
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,480
After yesterday's events,

173
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:11,200
he exhausted too much of his strength.

174
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,480
He fell ill as soon as he returned.

175
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,360
I humbly ask Your Majesty

176
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,679
to allow my father to retire and return home, enjoying his old age.

177
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,960
Since Elder Shi is unwell,

178
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:42,279
I grant your request.

179
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,600
In honor of Elder Shi's loyal service,

180
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,639
I reward him with ten thousand taels of gold.

181
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

182
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,639
Last night, my father gave me the Tiger Tally.

183
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,840
But I believe I lack the ability.

184
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,639
I wish to present the Tiger Tally to Your Majesty.

185
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:03,639
And hope Your Majesty

186
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,080
will continue to treat the Shi Family Army well.

187
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,360
It seems the plan must be moved up again.
