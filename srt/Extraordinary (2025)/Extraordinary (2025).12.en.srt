1
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,640
Let us in! Let us in!

2
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:58,000
Let us in! We need an explanation!

3
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:58,960
We need an explanation!

4
00:00:59,119 --> 00:00:59,759
What's going on with you?

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,399
My wife ate hotpot at your Fan Lou.

6
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,200
Now she's feverish and sweating.

7
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,200
She's vomiting and has diarrhea.

8
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,239
She vomited like it was spraying out.

9
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,560
She's unconscious now.

10
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:10,959
My wife too.

11
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:12,319
Today.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,799
You—you must give us an explanation!

13
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,480
Yes, we need an explanation!

14
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:20,920
Could it be food-induced gastroenteritis?

15
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,680
No.

16
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,599
You ate at Fan Lou too.

17
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,560
N-no, I didn't.

18
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,760
Fever, chills, sweating...

19
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:43,560
Could it be...

20
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,760
Quick, lock them up!

21
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:48,799
No contact with anyone!

22
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,480
Hurry!

23
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:50,640
Hurry!

24
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,280
Quick, quick, quick!

25
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,799
Let me go!

26
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,079
Let go! Hurry, get out!

27
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,120
What are you doing? Go, now!

28
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,519
Let me go! Why are you locking us up?

29
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,359
Let me go!

30
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,079
Go, go, go!

31
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,480
Let me go! Let us go!

32
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,840
Feifan, what's happening?

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,239
This will affect everyone in the city.

34
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,480
I must go to the palace at once.

35
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,280
Also, get me some cotton cloth.

36
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,480
I need to make masks.

37
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,159
Masks?

38
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:07,799
Masks?

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,840
No time to explain.

40
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,800
I must go to the palace now.

41
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,840
Alright, alright.

42
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,280
Also, keep those two locked together.

43
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,280
No contact with anyone.

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,680
Alright.

45
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,479
Okay, okay.

46
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,199
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

47
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,759
Go call someone! Go get help!

48
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,479
Someone, help!

49
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,639
How is the situation?

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,719
How is the Princess?

51
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:11,800
Your Majesty,

52
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,120
The Princess may have typhoid fever.

53
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,960
This illness is contagious.

54
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,280
Your Majesty, please step back.

55
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,759
Is there a cure?

56
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,439
I will prescribe some medicine first.

57
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,080
How confident are you?

58
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,360
About ten or twenty percent.

59
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,520
Ten or twenty percent?

60
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,159
What use are you to me?

61
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,240
Your Majesty, Young Duke Shi requests an audience.

62
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,879
Let him in.

63
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:37,680
Yes.

64
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,840
Your Majesty, Young Duke Shi is here.

65
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,879
I believe an epidemic will break out in the capital.

66
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,159
Please issue an order, Your Majesty.

67
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Close the city gates immediately.

68
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,360
An epidemic?

69
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,960
I think it's very likely.

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,919
Your Majesty, I believe

71
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,360
this is very likely an epidemic.

72
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,800
It's what we call malaria.

73
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,159
This illness can be fatal.

74
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,840
It spreads extremely fast.

75
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,479
Besides closing the gates,

76
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,039
is there any other cure?

77
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,759
I can try to make medicine.

78
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,680
Good.

79
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,279
For the Princess and the people,

80
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,959
I order you to make medicine quickly.

81
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,480
Princess.

82
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,759
Why are you still standing there?

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,800
Go make the medicine!

84
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,800
Curing one is not as good as curing all.

85
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,720
Source, transmission route,

86
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:31,720
patients—

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,519
If we break any link in the chain,

88
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:34,839
the epidemic can be stopped.

89
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,319
The most common cause of epidemics

90
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,600
is transmission by mosquitoes.

91
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,079
Mosquitoes?

92
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:41,480
Exactly.

93
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,399
I beg Your Majesty to order

94
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,079
every household to burn incense to repel mosquitoes.

95
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,720
Clear all areas of standing water.

96
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,639
Close the city gates immediately.

97
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,560
Absurd!

98
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,720
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

99
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,920
Closing the gates may cause panic.

100
00:04:59,319 --> 00:04:59,920
Besides,

101
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,160
I've never heard

102
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,839
that Young Duke Shi knows the art of healing.

103
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,160
Prince Qing has so many doubts.

104
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,879
Why don't you do it?

105
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,639
You—

106
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,040
Prince Qing is right.

107
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,480
If we really close the gates,

108
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,040
the people will surely be suspicious.

109
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,399
Better to cure the Princess first, then discuss.

110
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,319
In your opinion,

111
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,319
how should the Princess be treated?

112
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:29,720
Your Majesty,

113
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,040
I have found a way to make medicine.

114
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,959
If conditions allow,

115
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,279
she'll improve in a few days.

116
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,839
Then hurry and make the medicine!

117
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:37,639
No!

118
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,160
How dare you, Shi Feifan!

119
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,759
You dare deceive His Majesty!

120
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,920
Oh no! The Princess has fainted!

121
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:56,399
Why are you still standing there?

122
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,079
Go quickly!

123
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,560
How is the Princess now?

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,959
Earlier, I

125
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,720
gave the Princess San Gen Cao juice.

126
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,879
She shouldn't be like this.

127
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:22,879
Speak honestly.

128
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,639
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

129
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,720
If the Princess doesn't wake today,

130
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,600
I'm afraid she won't last long.

131
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,079
Quack!

132
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,879
They're all quacks!

133
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,199
You go!

134
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,360
Me?

135
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,959
Go quickly!

136
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,360
It's you.

137
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:14,920
So you are the Princess.

138
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,399
The Princess is awake.

139
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,600
Still not back yet?

140
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,839
Duke, please don't worry.

141
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,920
It's already so late.

142
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,920
Why isn't Feifan back yet?

143
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,040
Duke, Duke, please don't worry.

144
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,519
Since Young Duke found a way to repel mosquitoes,

145
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,240
he should be fine.

146
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,120
Don't worry.

147
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,360
Young Duke.

148
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:52,560
Feifan! Father!

149
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,160
Young Duke.

150
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:54,959
Safe and sound.

151
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,759
Go tidy up the guest room.

152
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,480
Take the Princess to rest in the guest room.

153
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,160
Alright!

154
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:10,959
Princess, be careful.

155
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:15,639
Feifan.

156
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:17,279
Feifan.

157
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,680
Why did you bring the Princess here?

158
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,600
The Princess caught the epidemic.

159
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,519
The imperial doctors couldn't cure her.

160
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,759
His Majesty asked me to treat the Princess.

161
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,120
Feifan, are you out of your mind?

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,799
If even the imperial doctors failed,

163
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,480
how could you promise His Majesty?

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,879
What if...

165
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:41,720
I mean, what if...

166
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,360
What if you can't cure her?

167
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,840
Our Duke's Mansion will be doomed!

168
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,000
Father, please rest assured.

169
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,399
This is our chance to change our fate.

170
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,279
Besides,

171
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:00,200
I can't betray her trust.

172
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,279
It's you.

173
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,919
Even if you cure the Princess,

174
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,120
if everyone finds out

175
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,159
the Princess stayed at our mansion,

176
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,919
it will harm your reputation.

177
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,240
Father, isn't it the other way around?

178
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,720
What do you know?

179
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:35,440
A man's reputation matters too!

180
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,320
Th-this...

181
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,120
Th-this...

182
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,799
How about this:

183
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:42,879
Beg His Majesty for mercy, admit fault,

184
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,759
and send the Princess back.

185
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,120
At a time like this,

186
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,480
you can still laugh?

187
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,559
Father.

188
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:04,399
Father.

189
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,080
A woman's reputation matters too.

190
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,759
You brat!

191
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,480
Feifan.

192
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:30,519
How is the Princess?

193
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,639
San Gen Cao is holding it off for now.

194
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,000
San Gen Cao?

195
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,279
I heard the imperial doctors tried it.

196
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,320
It didn't work well.

197
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,320
It loses effect when heated.

198
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,240
But I have another way.

199
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:47,000
As long as you have a way.

200
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:49,639
Father, what did you find out?

201
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,360
The first few patients

202
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
all watched the monkey show on the street.

203
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,039
And the monkey

204
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,600
came from the hot Ri Nan Jun Guo.

205
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,759
Now it's barely alive.

206
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,360
Have we ever traded with them?

207
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,639
No, we haven't.

208
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,879
You mean...

209
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:14,519
Exactly.

210
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,120
But whoever is behind this,

211
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,039
won't be found so easily.

212
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:23,039
Right now, making the medicine is key.

213
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,559
As for the rest,

214
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,399
we can settle it later.

215
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,440
The epidemic is raging now.

216
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:35,919
Everyone, take care of yourselves.

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,559
Stay safe.

218
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,799
Take people to burn mugwort in every room and yard.

219
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,600
Understood.

220
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:41,879
Egg Yolk Pie.

221
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:43,840
Lead people to clear standing water.

222
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,600
Cover all drinking water.

223
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:46,519
Yes.

224
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,000
Meat Floss Pie.

225
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,000
Give Artemisia juice to those in quarantine.

226
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,879
Feed them Artemisia juice.

227
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,559
Yes.

228
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,480
Go ahead.

229
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Be sure to protect yourself.

230
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,799
Yes.

231
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:06,919
Young Duke.

232
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:10,320
Feifan.

233
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,200
Is this wine for...

234
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:12,960
Father.

235
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,519
I'm purifying a crucial substance.

236
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,440
Feifan, tell me the truth.

237
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,960
These fuzzy things,

238
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,519
these green grasses,

239
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,480
are all for making medicine?

240
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,159
Yes.

241
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,679
San Gen Cao cures the epidemic.

242
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,120
Fresh grass juice works best.

243
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,159
But for better results,

244
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:32,759
the juice needs to be purified.

245
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,279
With limited resources now,

246
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,159
this is the best method.

247
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,080
Notify the Four Great Medicine Merchants:

248
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,679
No one is allowed to sell medicine to the Duke's Mansion.

249
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:50,480
Let him struggle for a while.

250
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,840
He'll be blamed for delayed treatment.

251
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:54,679
Interesting.

252
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,039
Very interesting.

253
00:12:58,919 --> 00:12:59,440
Yes.

254
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,759
Safe and sound.

255
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:12,519
Go to the medicine shop.

256
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,080
Buy some San Gen Cao.

257
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,360
Alright, I'll go now.

258
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:29,840
Miss.

259
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,799
Are you really sending these precious herbs

260
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:32,879
to the Duke's Mansion?

261
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:34,840
Just returning them to their owner.

262
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,279
If they can make a cure,

263
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,480
it would be a blessing.

264
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,360
Go on, go on, there's really none left.

265
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,120
You...

266
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,080
Boss, why not do business with him?

267
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,919
What do you know?

268
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,279
The Four Great Medicine Merchants have spoken.

269
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,600
If we don't listen to them,

270
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,039
this shop won't last.

271
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:02,879
Get back to work.

272
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,320
Making medicine is crucial now.

273
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,720
Don't let Young Duke get distracted.

274
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,440
There must be another way.
