1
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,280
Sir

2
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,640
Sweetheart, sir

3
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,719
You're so annoying

4
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,719
Mischievous

5
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,560
Come on

6
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:17,599
Sir

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,599
Give it to me

8
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,200
Don't snatch

9
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,840
Mine

10
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,799
I'm right here

11
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,239
Here, sir

12
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:23,959
Give it to me

13
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,159
Come here

14
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:25,959
Sir

15
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,280
Mine, let go

16
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,159
Hand it over, it's mine

17
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,000
Give it to me

18
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,400
Give it to me

19
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:32,959
Mine

20
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,519
I grabbed it

21
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,519
Sir

22
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:46,200
Sir, you're annoying

23
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,959
No, no

24
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:48,959
Everyone says no

25
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,400
Then you all teach us

26
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,439
What should we do

27
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,680
Your Majesty

28
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:56,000
It was Shi Feifan before

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,560
A blind cat caught a dead mouse

30
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:00,319
Vice Minister of Revenue is so important

31
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,840
He shouldn't get it at all

32
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,120
I have lived in Mou County for years

33
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:11,479
Your Majesty, I believe

34
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,280
Prince Qing is mistaken

35
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,080
Refugees are everywhere now

36
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,960
Sir Shi cares for the people

37
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,400
I think it's worth letting him try

38
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,240
As for the official post

39
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,560
It's fine to decide later

40
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,520
Princess, it's getting late

41
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,479
Your Majesty is waiting for you to return

42
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,080
Back in the day

43
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,360
Your mother and I felt the same

44
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,960
We couldn't bear to part for a moment

45
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,199
How you feel now

46
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,919
Your father understands

47
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,280
I get it

48
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,199
Shi Feifan

49
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,439
Your Majesty requests you

50
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,520
Congratulations, Sir Shi

51
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,919
What's there to congratulate

52
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,759
Your Majesty trusts Sir Shi to handle Mou County's refugees

53
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,560
If this succeeds

54
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,839
It will be a great service to the nation

55
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,759
Refugees

56
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,079
It's your wrongdoing

57
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,680
It must be you, old scoundrel

58
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:29,399
You

59
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,199
Sir Shi, the Prime Minister means well

60
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,399
You've really lucked out

61
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,639
I believe

62
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,920
With Sir Shi's skills

63
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,639
He can surely handle the refugee issue

64
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:47,120
I'm waiting for your promotion banquet

65
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,720
You sly old scoundrel

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,240
Now you drop the act

67
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,839
Throwing this hot potato to me

68
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,879
And still want to freeload at my house

69
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,000
Outrageous

70
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,240
Who's this barking dog now

71
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,839
You

72
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,120
Step aside

73
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:25,959
Your Majesty

74
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,279
My dear Shi, you arrived just in time

75
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:31,240
We wanted to grant you Vice Minister of Revenue

76
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,480
But all the ministers opposed

77
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,160
We can't rule alone

78
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,160
Or hurt the officials' feelings

79
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,879
Besides, my dear Shi

80
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,199
You still need more experience

81
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,360
Achieve more accomplishments

82
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,839
Then even if some oppose

83
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,480
We can stand up for you

84
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,079
Your Majesty wants me to handle the refugees

85
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,879
Exactly

86
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,639
Forgive me, Your Majesty

87
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,439
I'm afraid I can't obey

88
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,319
Your Majesty, have you forgotten

89
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,480
My Ling Gou Official post

90
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,439
You already dismissed me

91
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,040
Now I hold no office

92
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,199
I'm just a commoner

93
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,920
Hard to take on such a task

94
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,600
That's easy to fix

95
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,839
Send our decree

96
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,560
The people of Mou County

97
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,319
Will they believe Your Majesty sent

98
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,839
A commoner with no official post

99
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,360
Your Majesty

100
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,120
I can't explain myself

101
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,160
And you won't even grant me a post

102
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,079
Your Majesty

103
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,839
Maybe you don't truly trust me

104
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,680
It's because of your past misdeeds

105
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,680
Any one of them

106
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,040
Could be used against you

107
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,519
If not for that

108
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,519
Prime Minister Lü wouldn't keep hounding you

109
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,439
Let him hound me, it's fine

110
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,680
As long as Your Majesty gives me one thing

111
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,720
We don't have it

112
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,199
No, you do

113
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,759
And only you have it

114
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,759
What

115
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,319
You want our throne now?

116
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,879
This Imperial Sword is so heavy

117
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,000
Prime Minister Lü, please rise

118
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,240
Man is iron, food is steel

119
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:32,079
Without food, can't lift the sword

120
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,959
Prime Minister Lü won't be mad, right?

121
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,079
Prime Minister Lü, do you know

122
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,000
This Imperial Sword grants execute first, report later

123
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,439
I heard Your Majesty say

124
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,600
It can slay a foolish ruler

125
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,120
Or a treacherous minister

126
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,560
This sword has a little quirk

127
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:57,279
It hates those who boast of their merits

128
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,079
And sly, petty schemers

129
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,240
Heaven sees what people do

130
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,720
No wall in the world is airtight

131
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,680
I advise you, Prime Minister Lü

132
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,759
Do less harm to others

133
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,720
Leave some virtue for your descendants

134
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,000
Shi Feifan, don't push me too far.

135
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,680
Don't be mad, don't be mad.

136
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:29,959
Prime Minister Lü.

137
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,159
If Prime Minister Lü doesn't mind,

138
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,519
let me be your godfather.

139
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:40,840
If you need help, your godfather's got you.

140
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,200
Shi Feifan.

141
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,840
The road ahead is long and winding.

142
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,679
Take care on your journey.

143
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,960
Thank you for your concern.

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,720
Prime Minister Lü,

145
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,200
after I met you,

146
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,120
I realized

147
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,440
how ugly human nature can truly be.

148
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:02,440
But I, Shi Feifan, never hold grudges.

149
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,559
I always settle scores right away.

150
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,159
Face soldiers with generals, floods with earth.

151
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,240
No one in the Shi family has ever feared anyone.

152
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,639
Let's have fish together sometime.

153
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,039
You sure know how to nitpick.

154
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,159
You're out of your mind.

155
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,759
How could you be an official if you weren't?

156
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,039
Isn't this way more fun than games?

157
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,600
A real-life senior official role.

158
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,559
Take care, Prime Minister Lü.

159
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,679
I'll make sure they can't escape my grasp.

160
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,720
They won't see tomorrow's sun.

161
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,039
Yes, sir.

162
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,039
Yue Ying,

163
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,080
has her own plans.

164
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:21,960
Just in case,

165
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,799
go secretly to Mou County at once.

166
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,480
Find Nan Batian.

167
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,480
Deal with that Shi kid for me.

168
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,000
How should I do it?

169
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,440
I don't need to teach you, do I?

170
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,759
Yes.

171
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,720
Can't wait any longer, huh?

172
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,240
Looks like this trip will be fruitful.

173
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,600
Father.

174
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:20,759
Feifan.

175
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:34,960
Your grandfather's sword.

176
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,600
I wanted you to carry it for protection.

177
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,840
Turns out Your Majesty thought of everything.

178
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:42,039
Come.

179
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,519
Let's have a few drinks together.

180
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,559
Come, Father.

181
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,279
The Emperor would never give it to me.

182
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,120
Besides,

183
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,879
I've got a Gatling for protection.

184
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,759
The Imperial Sword is just for show.

185
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,240
Feifan.

186
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,519
Mou County borders Qiang Country.

187
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,159
It's remote, full of all sorts of people.

188
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,159
Disasters happen there often.

189
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,879
The court sends tens of thousands in relief funds yearly.

190
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:20,240
But it never changes the people's misery.

191
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:34,679
Those relief funds

192
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,679
probably end up in others' pockets.

193
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:38,279
That's right.

194
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:42,080
Prime Minister Lü strongly recommended you this time.

195
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,799
It can't be as simple as it seems.

196
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,120
I hear Mou County's magistrate is tough.

197
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:59,720
You must be very careful, my son.

198
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,080
Never act rashly.

199
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:17,279
Father.

200
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,559
I never fight unprepared battles.

201
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,559
Come.

202
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,440
Father.

203
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:38,440
No matter if it's a mountain of blades or a sea of fire ahead,

204
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,639
or a bottomless abyss,

205
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,039
I must go to Mou County.

206
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,200
Good.

207
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,159
My son has ambition.

208
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,879
Come, let's drink.

209
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,320
By the way, Father,

210
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,799
fifteen years ago,

211
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,799
the case of Governor of Shu Province, General Ren Gengyao—

212
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,960
Was there any evidence found later

213
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,399
proving General Ren betrayed the country?

214
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,240
No.

215
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:21,360
Then who accused General Ren of treason back then?

216
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,080
Anonymous report.

217
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:27,399
Feifan, why are you asking this?

218
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,000
Just curious.

219
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,039
I was fighting outside at the time.

220
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,720
Didn't know he was killed in Mou County.

221
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,080
General Ren—

222
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:48,639
He was a loyal servant of our dynasty.

223
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,039
What a pity.

224
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,039
No evidence to clear his name.

225
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,519
Father.

226
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:18,320
A loyal minister like General Ren—

227
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:25,759
Father.

228
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,320
Father.

229
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:31,639
This old man

230
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,759
is down after just a few drinks.

231
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,879
Even a tough man has a gentle side.
