1
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:59,759
Do you believe in parallel universes?

2
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,240
Me, in this universe,

3
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,040
am well-read, a science nerd.

4
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,480
No connections, all self-made.

5
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,319
Struggling daily, hustling for life.

6
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,719
Don't spit on my book.

7
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:11,480
This... this is all I have.

8
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,799
This is everything I own.

9
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,480
Spit over here.

10
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,319
Look at you, so shabby.

11
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,640
Me, in another universe,

12
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,719
indulges in pleasure, stubborn and useless.

13
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,239
Short on luck, not on money.

14
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:24,640
Living in fear, unsure of life or death.

15
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,879
Shi Feifan.

16
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,760
Prepare to die!

17
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,200
Get lost!

18
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,120
Until one moment,

19
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,439
when time and fate collide.

20
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,439
One dies, but the soul remains.

21
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:49,120
One revives, stronger in will.

22
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,719
Retreat.

23
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,439
Life is a play,

24
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,680
even if the stage changes,

25
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,599
you still have to act your part.

26
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,800
Duke of Nan.

27
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,199
Young Duke, he... he's awake!

28
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,000
Son, you're awake!

29
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:40,919
Feifan!

30
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,879
Call me your son.

31
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,479
Quick, tell me.

32
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,000
Duke of Nan.

33
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,159
How are you feeling?

34
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,560
I...

35
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,240
Wasn't I hit by a car?

36
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,039
Hit by a car? What?

37
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,800
Yesterday, you were attacked by this assassin.

38
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,240
Yesterday, you were attacked by this assassin.

39
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,960
You almost lost your life.

40
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,280
Father.

41
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:55,639
I'm fine.

42
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,800
Glad you're okay.

43
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,680
Assassinated...

44
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,199
I've been reborn.

45
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,680
Son...

46
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,199
Did you see who attacked you last night?

47
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,520
Some say a miracle happened, like a god possessed you.

48
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,560
Nonsense.

49
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,240
Only by killing his useless son

50
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,199
can I get the Tiger Tally.

51
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,199
Tell your men to keep watch.

52
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,879
No mistakes next time.

53
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,919
Celestial Star Tower.

54
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,000
Right.

55
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,560
I investigated this before.

56
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,159
Duke of Nan sent me.

57
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,599
I haven't reported back yet.

58
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,520
This is all I could find.

59
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,599
Rumors in the martial world say

60
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,520
Celestial Star Tower works for money.

61
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:48,840
Anyone who's met them in the past ten years

62
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,039
hasn't lived to tell the tale.

63
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,360
You're the exception.

64
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:54,439
Celestial Star Tower... Young Duke.

65
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,360
I really did transmigrate.

66
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:57,560
Dare to assassinate me?

67
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,639
Interesting.

68
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,960
Shi Xiaofan.

69
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,919
Let Shi Feifan reshape your life here.

70
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,400
My life is mine to command, not heaven's to decree.

71
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,360
I heard the capital's top playboy,

72
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,879
Young Duke Shi won't live long.

73
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:20,800
So why is Duke of Nan

74
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,120
still hiring servants now?

75
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,040
Who cares?

76
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,360
As long as there's money.

77
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:25,360
Yeah, yeah.

78
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,160
I volunteered to sneak into Shi Manor for my royal brother.

79
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,079
So it seems

80
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:32,360
Shi Feifan won't last long.

81
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,240
It's the perfect time to look for the Tiger Tally.

82
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,480
I... I...

83
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,879
Wait, just wait.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,519
I...

85
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,279
Don't push.

86
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,519
I... I... Line up!

87
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,040
How can you manage with that tiny frame?

88
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,399
Move aside, move aside.

89
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,759
Don't push, don't push.

90
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,399
One at a time.

91
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,600
Line up.

92
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,399
I'm young.

93
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,839
Hurry, you, come here.

94
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,199
Looks like I need another plan.

95
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,480
Young Duke.

96
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,720
Duke of Nan won't let us out.

97
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,480
What if you run into danger outside?

98
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,519
How is he still alive?

99
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,480
Young... Young Duke, no...

100
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,800
Young Duke, I'm not messing with you.

101
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,959
Who'd dare attack in broad daylight?

102
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,800
Young Duke, please take me in.

103
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:11,519
Go, hurry up!

104
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,240
Young Duke.

105
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,800
Young Duke.

106
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,600
If you don't take me in, I'd rather...

107
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,480
Why are you shouting?

108
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,319
What did you say?

109
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,079
If I let go, don't scream, okay?

110
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,959
My name is Mei Zhenlong.

111
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,480
Not "Zhengrong."

112
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,319
It's "Long," not "Rong."

113
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,639
Mei as in plum blossom, Zhen as in real,

114
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,600
Long as in dragon.

115
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,720
That's a unique name.

116
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,879
Alright, got it.

117
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,839
Young Duke.

118
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,600
You don't...

119
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,160
Alright, alright.

120
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,319
Stay, stay, stay.

121
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,600
No more shouting, got it?

122
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,079
Let me go.

123
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,199
I...

124
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,000
Safe.

125
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
So dirty.

126
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,040
Take her back to change clothes.

127
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:01,319
Filthy—hurts our Duke's reputation.

128
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,199
Alright, alright.

129
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:03,879
What are you doing?

130
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:04,959
Come on, let's go change.

131
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,519
Still holding me?

132
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,319
Go, go, go.

133
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,079
Young Duke.

134
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,000
Let's go.

135
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,000
Young Duke.

136
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,879
He really let her stay.

137
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,519
She looks like my friend who sells books.

138
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,120
She's quite pitiful.

139
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,800
You have such poor friends?

140
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Do I judge friends by wealth?

141
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,519
Your biggest hobby before

142
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,480
was living carefree.

143
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,519
Spending money like water.

144
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,560
Everyone who met you...

145
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,480
This girl looks familiar.

146
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,600
Young Duke, you really joke around.

147
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,480
Isn't that Ziyan?

148
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,680
The maid next to her.

149
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,959
Her name is Xiaocui.

150
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,319
Ziyan.

151
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,600
I never thought he'd be the first since
Celestial Star Tower was founded

152
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,279
to slip through our net.

153
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,399
I have failed in my duty.

154
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:19,680
Yueying,

155
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,959
Celestial Star Tower trained you

156
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:26,879
not for you to dance and sing here
in Cangxiang Pavilion.

157
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,439
You must always remember

158
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,240
you belong to Celestial Star Tower.

159
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:34,519
Yes.

160
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,439
If Duke of Nan killed your family,

161
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,879
he's an enemy of our entire Tower.

162
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,279
Go ahead, don't hesitate.

163
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,439
Of course I want him cut to pieces.

164
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,720
But after the last fight,

165
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:58,959
acting in secret is safer.

166
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:05,240
I've raised silkworms all my life,

167
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,959
never seen such a low price.

168
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,839
Ask around if you want,

169
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,439
that's the market price.

170
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,480
The higher-ups said

171
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,759
it all ends tomorrow.

172
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,920
If you don't sell today,

173
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,240
tomorrow you won't get even half.

174
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:19,920
Fine, fine.

175
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,000
I'll sell to you then.

176
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,879
That's more like it.

177
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,800
Young Duke,

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,800
they buy cocoons so cheap,

179
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,160
but sell silk so expensive.

180
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,040
Isn't that cheating honest folks?

181
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,879
They're milking both ends of the deal.

182
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,039
Silk cloth...

183
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,279
Here's our chance.

184
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,000
Careful.

185
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,360
Let's go, let's go.

186
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:52,960
Alright.

187
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,240
Young Duke,

188
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:55,519
looks like

189
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,440
even broad daylight isn't safe.

190
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,480
No one is allowed to live, no matter who.

191
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,320
They're forcing me to fight for real.

192
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,200
You want to fight on the road, huh?

193
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,440
Fine.

194
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:14,600
Father,

195
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,639
what's troubling you?

196
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,000
This month's army rations are covered,

197
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:25,679
but next month will be tough.

198
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,600
No money? Then make some.

199
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,159
Make income?

200
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,360
Create revenue.

201
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,000
You know how to earn money?

202
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,879
Scholars, farmers, artisans, merchants—

203
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,440
merchants are the lowest.

204
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,879
I'll use the lowest, merchant ways

205
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,759
to show His Majesty

206
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,360
Duke of Nan's house has no interest in politics.

207
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,519
At the same time,

208
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:48,679
I can help you with the army pay.

209
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,080
No, that's not right.

210
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:52,759
This is a serious matter.

211
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,639
We must think it over carefully.

212
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,480
Besides, at this time every year,

213
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,559
Qiang Country sends envoys.

214
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,360
Now's not the time for trouble.

215
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,600
Why does Qiang Country send people?

216
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,080
You don't care about court affairs,

217
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,039
so you wouldn't know.

218
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,720
Since the Founding Emperor lost,

219
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,519
our dynasty must send Qiang Country

220
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,840
a tribute of silk every year.

221
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,960
Tribute.

222
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,759
Looks like a huge opportunity.

223
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,279
Shi Feifan's little sidekick.

224
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:47,159
Tiger Tally.

225
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,399
Such an important item

226
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:52,080
must be where Duke of Nan stays most.

227
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,399
Who?

228
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:09,279
Stop!

229
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,720
D-Duke of Nan...

230
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,799
What are you sneaking around for?

231
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,799
To answer you, Duke of Nan,

232
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,840
what are you doing here?

233
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,440
Brother Ping'an sent me to get you food.

234
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,679
I'm new here, don't know the way.

235
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,840
That way.

236
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,440
Son,

237
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,960
this person is suspicious.

238
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,840
You still want to keep him?

239
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,720
We don't know his true intent yet.

240
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,879
Besides, we're short-handed.

241
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:56,399
Let him stay for now.

242
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,720
Your mother's memorial is in a few days.

243
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,480
Father,

244
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,240
let me go with you to honor her.

245
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,039
It's a long journey.

246
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,879
You should stay at home.

247
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,200
Don't leave the estate.

248
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:11,759
Just in case.

249
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:14,320
I was just worrying how to send you off.

250
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,279
I'll do as you say.

251
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,679
Alright.

252
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,919
Father, let's hurry on our way.

253
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:30,960
Be careful on the road.

254
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
I'll be here at home

255
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,919
waiting for your safe return.
