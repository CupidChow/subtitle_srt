1
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,560
Young Duke, you really went all out.

2
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,640
This hidden weapon is so powerful.

3
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,079
What's its name?

4
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:22,840
Gatling.

5
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,680
Gatling.

6
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,680
That's right.

7
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,040
This is the mini Gatling.

8
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,239
There's an even stronger one.

9
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,319
But Your subject hasn't built it yet.

10
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:32,920
Good.

11
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,680
Quick, draw it for us.

12
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:35,640
Let us see it.

13
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,519
Yes.

14
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:40,640
Sir.

15
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,439
Did you find out where that kid

16
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,079
got his weapon?

17
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,079
I sent people all over the capital.

18
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,359
No one knows.

19
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,799
Only Shi Feifan has it.

20
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,200
Such a fine weapon.

21
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,840
I must get my hands on it.

22
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,599
Just... just this little thing?

23
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,200
Your Majesty,

24
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,920
this is called Gatling Plus.

25
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:09,159
Within five hundred meters, nothing survives.

26
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,879
What is five hundred meters?

27
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,039
It's a unit of measurement.

28
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,560
It converts to one li.

29
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,520
Is that true?

30
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,599
Your subject would never joke.

31
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,879
Your subject has even stronger weapons.

32
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,520
Like airplanes,

33
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,879
tanks,

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,800
and aircraft carriers.

35
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,319
Hurry, hurry!

36
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,120
Draw all of these quickly.

37
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,120
Let us see.

38
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,000
Yes.

39
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,520
Such magical hidden weapons exist?

40
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,319
Make all of these at once.

41
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,879
Drive the Qiang Country envoys out of our land.

42
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,360
Your Majesty,

43
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:08,199
making these weapons will take some time.

44
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,759
But Your subject has a way

45
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,639
to make them leave

46
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,680
without giving them any excuse.

47
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,599
We grant you time.

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

49
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,000
If Your subject completes the task,

50
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,879
may Your subject receive a reward?

51
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:23,599
Granted.

52
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:25,400
Wait.

53
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,680
Next time you come,

54
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,639
can you bring that

55
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,960
Gatling Plus

56
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,199
for us to see?

57
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,919
Your subject will try, will try.

58
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:47,520
Your Majesty.

59
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,439
The Qiang Country matter is serious.

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,759
Are you really letting the Young Duke

61
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,120
"Shi" means mountain.

62
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,039
His roots are solid as rock.

63
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,560
Maybe he'll become a true gem.

64
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,800
Young Duke.

65
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,879
That Plus,

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,080
can you really make it?

67
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,480
Just talk big for now, worry later.

68
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,920
Big talk? Why now of all times?

69
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:33,319
Fan'er.

70
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,920
What punishment did His Majesty give?

71
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:37,759
Tell me.

72
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,879
Father can handle it.

73
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,199
Duke.

74
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,800
His Majesty praised the Young Duke.

75
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,120
Really?

76
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,839
Is this really my son?

77
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,240
He truly has grown up.

78
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:58,879
Get ready.

79
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,279
The show is about to start.

80
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,680
Cunning Southerners.

81
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,279
Spit it out, don't hold back.

82
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,959
His Majesty has issued a decree.

83
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,439
Commander Linggou Shi Feifan lacks virtue.

84
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,439
He overstepped his bounds.

85
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,959
His pay is docked for half a year.

86
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,360
He must apologize to you.

87
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:23,879
Apologize?

88
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,680
Where is he?

89
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,519
Right now, Commander Shi

90
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,439
just got scolded at the palace.

91
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,879
He's at the best restaurant in the Southern Dynasty

92
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:37,079
setting up an apology banquet for you.

93
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,600
Brother, you honor me by coming today.

94
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,600
It's truly my honor.

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,759
Commander Shi.

96
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,959
We met through conflict, now we know each other.

97
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,000
A pleasure, a pleasure.

98
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,759
I heard you, Brother, in Qiang Country,

99
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,560
fought tigers in the south,

100
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,319
kicked dragons in the north.

101
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,720
I admire you.

102
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,560
You flatter me, Brother Shi.

103
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,000
Today, I accept you as my brother.

104
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,199
Come, good brother.

105
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,279
Drink!

106
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:26,839
Brother Shi.

107
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,399
That powerful weapon last time,

108
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,000
could you let me see it?

109
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,720
Unfortunately,

110
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,399
the Emperor took it back.

111
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,319
He said

112
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,319
he was afraid I'd misfire

113
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,600
and hurt you, Brother.

114
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,759
That's a shame.

115
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,480
Not a shame.

116
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,480
There will be chances later.

117
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,800
Brother.

118
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:49,720
Come.

119
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,319
Come.

120
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:55,600
Come.

121
00:06:59,279 --> 00:06:59,759
Come.

122
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:00,480
Alright.

123
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:07,480
Slow down.

124
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,279
Will this really work?

125
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,480
You'll see soon.

126
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,240
Princess, please come in.

127
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,480
Princess, please come in.

128
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,720
Princess.

129
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,879
Since our countries are marrying,

130
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,079
Brother, don't you want to see the Princess's face?

131
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,279
Please.

132
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,839
This is your princess.

133
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,199
So, Brother, what do you think?

134
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,959
Has the princess's beauty stunned you?

135
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,000
Look at the princess's eyes.

136
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,920
Hold me, I need to rest my feet.

137
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,240
They're truly dazzling.

138
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,360
One glance and your Khan is bewitched.

139
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,560
Now look at the princess's teeth.

140
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:17,079
They're like stars in the sky.

141
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,920
Far apart from each other.

142
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,879
Yet they echo one another.

143
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,439
Her features each have their own charm.

144
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,240
It gives her a unique allure.

145
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,560
Our princess is a real treasure.

146
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,480
Amazing! Help me inside, quick.

147
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,399
Brother Shi.

148
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,600
Your Southern Dynasty's taste

149
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,559
is truly one of a kind.

150
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,960
With such beauty,

151
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,480
your Khan marrying her

152
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,080
is a real blessing.

153
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,200
Don't worry, Brother.

154
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,240
I promise to help you with this task.

155
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,679
Brother, what's wrong?

156
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,120
Is the food not to your liking?

157
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:57,279
Brother.

158
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,919
Sir.

159
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,679
Brother, what's the matter?

160
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,159
Is it the food that's not good?

161
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,039
The marriage alliance was just a rash remark.

162
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,159
It doesn't count.

163
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:19,559
Where's the wine?

164
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,080
Bring the wine.

165
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:30,759
Brother.

166
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,200
Today,

167
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:35,960
we won't leave until we're drunk.

168
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,320
How about it, Brother?

169
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,799
Lord Xue.

170
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,399
It's your turn now.

171
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,440
At your command.

172
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,960
Shi Feifan, let's see what you'll do next.

173
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,240
We're screwed, got too drunk.

174
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,759
Urgent news from the palace.

175
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,679
His Majesty will send troops to Qiang Country.

176
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,720
In just this short time,

177
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,759
His Majesty is about to attack Qiang Country.

178
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,240
His Majesty said,

179
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,039
Qiang Country is troubled inside and out.

180
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:37,200
His Majesty has reached an agreement with Qing Country.

181
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,279
A Gatling for an alliance between two nations.

182
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,519
This is a great opportunity.

183
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,159
We must not ally.

184
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,840
I just became brothers with him.

185
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,200
No matter what, I have to help him.

186
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,080
Just your word alone—

187
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:00,159
How would His Majesty agree?

188
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,039
Unless...

189
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,360
Unless what?

190
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,320
Qiang Country gives up tribute and marriage alliance.

191
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,919
Sir, Qing Country's envoy is here too.

192
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,600
I'm afraid we won't be coming back.

193
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,639
Brother Shi, no need for marriage alliance.

194
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,159
No need for tribute either.

195
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:22,879
We—we're leaving now.

196
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:23,879
Brother.

197
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,279
If Brother leaves now,

198
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,320
I can't explain to His Majesty.

199
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,440
Brother Shi, please accept this.

200
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,320
How could I accept this?

201
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,799
Brother Shi, it's just a small token.

202
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,080
When I return to Qiang Country,

203
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,879
I'll send ten thousand taels of gold.

204
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,240
No one believes you'll return.

205
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,000
That's not necessary.

206
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:50,360
Brother.

207
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,399
I think Fan Lou

208
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,960
is pretty nice.

209
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:56,960
Buy it.

210
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,960
Brother, you're truly generous.

211
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,679
Let's go.

212
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,240
Take care, Brother.

213
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:22,399
Brother Xue.

214
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,320
You deserve the Oscar Best Actor.

215
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,720
Osc—Osc—Oscar what?

216
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,639
I'm praising your acting.

217
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,320
It's all thanks to Commander Linggou's direction.

218
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:35,080
By the way, His Majesty is still waiting.

219
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:35,919
No time to waste.

220
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,000
Commander Linggou, you should hurry to the palace.

221
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,120
What's the rush?

222
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,600
It's getting late.

223
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,320
I'm heading home to sleep.

224
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,320
Sleep?

225
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,159
But what if the Qiang envoy

226
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,440
gets suspicious?

227
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:51,720
Don't worry.

228
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,120
With his brain capacity,

229
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,320
he won't figure it out even back in Qiang Country.

230
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:07,080
A long, endless night.

231
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:08,759
It's hard to endure.

232
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,320
This city is so empty.

233
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:19,639
These memories are so strong.

234
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,960
Are you here to kill me?
