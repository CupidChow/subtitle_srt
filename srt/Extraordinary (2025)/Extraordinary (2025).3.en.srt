1
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,479
Small trinkets

2
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,799
Selling small trinkets

3
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,159
Come and take a look, everyone

4
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,439
Small trinkets

5
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,359
Young master, have a look

6
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,599
I'll take this one

7
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,120
Alright

8
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,680
Here you go

9
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,599
Pay up

10
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,799
Send word to the palace by carrier pigeon

11
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:53,920
Yes

12
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,879
Be sure to enjoy yourself

13
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,319
Xiaohong

14
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,800
Hurry to the door and greet guests

15
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,719
Young Duke

16
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,560
Your family sold everything off

17
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,240
How do you still have money for us

18
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,159
Enough with the nonsense

19
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,080
Where is Ziyan

20
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,520
Young Duke

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,319
What have you been busy with lately

22
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,479
You haven't come in so long

23
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,639
What I've been busy with

24
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,080
Miss Ziyan, you don't know

25
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,199
Shi Feifan

26
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,159
Blame it on being the Duke of Nan's son

27
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,120
Prepare to die

28
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,439
It's all my oversight

29
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,159
I forgot to care for the Young Duke

30
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,360
Ziyan apologizes to the Young Duke

31
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,520
No need for an apology drink

32
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,360
Dance with me instead

33
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,919
Young Duke, you must be joking

34
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,479
Let me check your mark

35
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,039
It's not here either

36
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,520
Did I make a mistake

37
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,879
Miss Ziyan dances well

38
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,000
Your martial arts must be good too

39
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,919
Young Duke, you must be joking

40
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,599
If Ziyan knew martial arts

41
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,080
Why would she work at Cangxiang Pavilion

42
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,400
Young Duke, Young Duke

43
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,479
Finally found you

44
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,039
Sir, come join us

45
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,599
The silk cloth has been delivered

46
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,639
And also

47
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,879
Zhi'er must be from the palace

48
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,800
Did you deal with him

49
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,839
After doing so much

50
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,879
I was worried the Emperor wouldn't know

51
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:28,879
Let's go handle business

52
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,480
This is for you

53
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,759
You stay safe

54
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,319
And I'll be safe too

55
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,560
Thank you, Young Duke

56
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,040
Miss

57
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,759
This wastrel seems different now

58
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,079
I'm afraid he's already suspicious of me

59
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:16,720
Where's the lion

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,079
Went to the wrong door

61
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,519
Were they raided

62
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,360
What's going on

63
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,480
Duke, you're finally back

64
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,279
Sold, sold, everything's sold

65
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,480
W-what's been sold

66
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,720
Everything at home is sold

67
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,720
This

68
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,079
Duke

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,920
Rebellious son

70
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:54,920
I

71
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,560
Father, you're back

72
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:58,560
Come

73
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,439
Look

74
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,360
These silk cloths

75
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,800
This is the world I've won for you

76
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,439
Surprised? Unexpected, right

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,959
The world

78
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,199
Just these rags

79
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,240
Now all the silk cloth in the capital

80
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,040
Is almost all in our house

81
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:22,160
So what

82
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,680
Our dynasty gives Qiang Country two hundred thousand bolts yearly

83
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:28,959
This silk cloth barely counts as hard currency

84
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,160
Could it be he wants to

85
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,879
Th-this

86
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,160
This

87
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,639
This

88
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,959
I want to do business with the Emperor

89
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:45,360
You

90
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,519
I appeal to Your Majesty's judgment.

91
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:51,000
Academy of Arts and Crafts, Brocade Bureau,
Embroidery Bureau

92
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:51,959
have all reported urgent shortages.

93
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,639
The silk cloth market lacks raw materials.

94
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,240
Then buy from the common folk.

95
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,160
But no vendors sell it at the market now.

96
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,240
Your Majesty,

97
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,480
I have heard,

98
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,480
the Young Duke of Duke of Nan sold his assets

99
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,639
and stockpiled much silk cloth.

100
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,680
Hoarding so much silk cloth for no reason

101
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,079
suggests Shi Feifan has other motives.

102
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,560
Minister Shi, is this true?

103
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,279
Your Majesty, it is true.

104
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,480
But I was in my hometown then

105
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,439
and did not know the details.

106
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:19,680
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

107
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,519
Forgive my poor parenting, I am ashamed.

108
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,519
Minister Shi,

109
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,399
your Young Duke surpasses you.

110
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,399
I appeal to Your Majesty's judgment.

111
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,240
My foolish son is a wastrel.

112
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,439
He scorns me for not making money in war.

113
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,319
He said to gamble big once.

114
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:40,639
If he wins, I can retire with wealth.

115
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,000
and enjoy my old age.

116
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,519
Then sell your silk cloth

117
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,879
to the court at market price.

118
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,439
Sell to Your Majesty?

119
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,600
What is the current market price?

120
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,959
Your Majesty, one bolt is 1,400 wen.

121
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:58,879
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

122
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,480
Now the price of silk cloth

123
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,319
has risen to 1,700 wen per bolt.

124
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,079
Recently, a Qiang Country merchant

125
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,560
came to my manor to buy silk cloth.

126
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,000
He offered this price

127
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,079
to buy all the silk cloth.

128
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,279
Duke of Nan wants to sell to Qiang Country?

129
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,040
No, no.

130
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,519
I refused the Qiang Country deal.

131
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:22,800
But my purchase cost

132
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,600
was already 1,500 wen per bolt.

133
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,360
Enough, enough.

134
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,600
Add 200 wen to the cost per bolt.

135
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,600
Father, don't sell, don't sell!

136
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,559
Fan'er, I bought all of these.

137
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,279
I decide.

138
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,200
Not selling.

139
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,320
Listen to me.

140
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,559
Two hundred wen is still money.

141
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,519
Why won't you sell?

142
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,799
Mother,

143
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:46,200
your son worked hard to earn for the family,

144
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,159
but your husband lost it all.

145
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,080
Enough, enough.

146
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,720
Fan'er.

147
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,200
Fan'er.

148
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,679
Two hundred wen, two hundred wen!

149
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,960
Even for two hundred, I won't sell.

150
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,559
This, this...

151
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,559
Really not selling?

152
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:57,440
Not selling.

153
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,360
Go tell the Emperor

154
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,799
This price is for beggars. Not selling.

155
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,919
Fine, I'll report you to the Emperor.

156
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:03,600
Go ahead.

157
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,159
This, this...

158
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,039
So infuriating!

159
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,080
Your Majesty,

160
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,279
I made these pastries for you myself.

161
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:24,639
Please try them.

162
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,320
The Empress is truly graceful and wise.

163
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,039
I wonder how the Princess is now.

164
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,399
I should have gone with her.

165
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,200
Empress, you are unwell.

166
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,440
Zhi'er can go instead.

167
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:44,440
I heard that mischievous Fan'er

168
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,480
caused a stir for Your Majesty.

169
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,480
No idea where he got the news.

170
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,879
While Duke of Nan was away,

171
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,799
he sold all the family assets

172
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,159
and bought all the silk cloth in town.

173
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,919
He does resemble my elder sister.

174
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,720
My elder sister passed away early.

175
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,720
Duke of Nan was busy expanding the realm.

176
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,639
He neglected Fan'er's upbringing.

177
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:08,679
Your Majesty, don't be angry with a child.

178
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:12,480
Your Majesty,

179
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,759
Shi Feifan wants to price gouge.

180
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,360
What?

181
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,720
Eunuch Cao, summon him to the palace.

182
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,399
Yes.

183
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,519
Fan'er, Fan'er.

184
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,360
Fan'er.

185
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,480
Fan'er.

186
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:31,279
What's wrong?

187
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,320
Fan'er.

188
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,919
What are you doing?

189
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,159
Father, this is my new weapon design.

190
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:44,919
This weapon hurts you first

191
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,399
then the enemy.

192
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,039
Find the best craftsman in the capital

193
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,759
to make these parts.

194
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:56,559
Also,

195
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,559
go to the imperial fireworks shop

196
00:10:58,799 --> 00:10:59,759
and buy some black powder.

197
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,320
It still needs testing.

198
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,559
His Majesty has issued a decree.

199
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,240
Summon Shi Feifan, Young Duke of Duke of Nan,

200
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,120
to the palace for an audience.

201
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,440
Shi Feifan, you rascal!

202
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:20,759
How dare you price gouge!

203
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,639
You even try to cheat me!

204
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,879
Your Majesty,

205
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,960
my father only spends on the army.

206
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,919
Now the Shi family can't even afford meat,

207
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,600
even the Shi Family Army soldiers

208
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,159
have only silk cloth at home.

209
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:36,960
We have no other choice.

210
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:42,799
You

211
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:46,440
Your Majesty, please look.

212
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,399
I have drawn the most basic

213
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,360
Price Analysis Chart.

214
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,240
Based on this supply-demand relationship,

215
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:53,639
silk cloth will see another big surge.

216
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,159
Supply-demand relationship.

217
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,759
Simply put,

218
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,360
when buyers are many and silk cloth is scarce,

219
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,519
the price goes up.

220
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,399
When buyers are few and silk cloth is plenty,

221
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:05,600
the price drops.

222
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,879
Last year, silkworms had a major drop in yield.

223
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,960
Though the court encouraged sericulture,

224
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,960
but from my investigation,

225
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,200
the results were poor.

226
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,320
Farmers are unwilling to grow mulberry and raise silkworms.

227
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,919
Production will surely decrease.

228
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,200
As for the capital, stock is also low.

229
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,759
So the price has risen.

230
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:23,840
This silk cloth,

231
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,240
the price changes daily.

232
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,080
If Your Majesty doesn't buy today,

233
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,159
you can always buy another day.

234
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,440
You dare play tricks with me?

235
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:33,759
Aren't you afraid I'll have you killed?

236
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,840
I wouldn't dare.

237
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,360
I only know

238
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,080
even Qiang Country's small merchants can pay this price.

239
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:41,720
Our wise Majesty,

240
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,159
surely isn't outdone

241
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:45,440
by those mere Qiang Country merchants?

242
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,480
Shi Family's boy,

243
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,559
now everyone says you boast wildly,

244
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:53,960
commit violence in public,

245
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,679
and are the worst wastrel.

246
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,080
Street rumors are not to be trusted.

247
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,600
My own great achievements

248
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:05,120
less than a tenth are known in the world.

249
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,720
Things like boasting, drinking, and gambling,

250
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,919
and brawling in the street,

251
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,559
are just my little hobbies.

252
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,320
As for reputation,

253
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:19,120
there's a saying, isn't there?

254
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,240
It's like dirt.

255
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,320
My true path

256
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,480
remains unchanged.

257
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,799
Good, good.

258
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,600
I will do this deal with you.

259
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,960
Your Majesty is wise.

260
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,200
Let's solve this urgent need first.

261
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,159
Afterwards,
