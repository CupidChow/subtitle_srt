1
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,320
How many have fought for it?

2
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,319
Fathers and sons turn against each other,
brothers become enemies.

3
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,680
How much blood has stained this throne?

4
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:14,879
Throughout every dynasty,

5
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,319
countless have died vying for this seat.

6
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,319
I do not understand.

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,120
Why do people still

8
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,239
rush forward one after another?

9
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,359
Your Majesty, you are the True Dragon Son of Heaven.

10
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,599
Everything will be as Your Majesty wishes.

11
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,599
Let us hope so.

12
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,799
Your Majesty, the Imperial Guard requests an audience.

13
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,120
Enter.

14
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,120
Your Majesty.

15
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:48,120
The Princess instructed the Imperial Kitchen

16
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,560
to send you this sweet soup.

17
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,359
Just give it to me. You may leave.

18
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,799
Yes.

19
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,239
Your Majesty.

20
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,960
It seems tonight is destined to be restless.

21
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,680
How dare you, Lu Yi!

22
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,159
You break into the palace at night—what is your intent?

23
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,400
I heard Your Majesty is gravely ill,

24
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,919
beyond the help of medicine.

25
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,840
I came to mourn Your Majesty.

26
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,599
Prime Minister Lü.

27
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,759
You lead troops into the palace at night—

28
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,719
are you plotting to seize the throne?

29
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,120
Your Majesty.

30
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,879
I think you misunderstand.

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,919
This is not usurping power.

32
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,360
That seat was always meant for me.

33
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,120
How dare you! Outrageous!

34
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,080
Guards!

35
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,280
Guards!

36
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,719
Come!

37
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,159
Bring him here!

38
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,319
Go!

39
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,360
My dear Shi.

40
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,199
Lu Yi, you—

41
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:37,719
Your Ma—

42
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,400
Your Majesty.

43
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:44,120
Such deep loyalty between master and servant.

44
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:44,919
Well then,

45
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,759
I’ll send you both off together today.

46
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,639
Why are you so certain

47
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,400
that leading troops to seize power won’t be your own funeral?

48
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:01,080
I have already taken control of the entire palace.

49
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,240
Your Majesty.

50
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,159
Tell me, on what grounds do I—

51
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,439
Well done, Lu Yi.

52
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,360
The late emperor treated you generously.

53
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,039
Since I ascended the throne,

54
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,159
I have treated you with kindness.

55
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:15,080
Every matter, big or small,

56
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,759
I always sought your counsel first.

57
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,279
Why would you commit such treacherous acts?

58
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,600
What a benevolent father and son.

59
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,120
Years ago, my grandfather risked his life

60
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,639
to expand the Southern Dynasty’s territory.

61
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,680
He laid the foundation for the Southern Dynasty.

62
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,519
He should have been this nation’s ruler.

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,160
This country should bear the Lü name.

64
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,879
Now, that seat

65
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,199
should rightfully be mine.

66
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,800
The court raised you with high rank and riches.

67
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,000
Who would have thought

68
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,560
it would breed a wolf like you.

69
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,439
What else?

70
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,839
Am I

71
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,959
just a dog you keep?

72
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,079
Yes.

73
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,120
The Shi family is a pack of loyal dogs you raised.

74
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,240
Lu Yi, you—

75
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,839
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

76
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,759
Your Majesty.

77
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,639
Lu Yi!

78
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,759
What have you done to His Majesty?

79
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,399
I saw His Majesty was exhausted,

80
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:16,959
so I made some sweet soup.

81
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,560
I added a little something extra.

82
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,439
He’ll be dead from poison within half an hour.

83
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,040
You—

84
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:25,399
Your Majesty!

85
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,120
Stop struggling in vain.

86
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,560
Shi Mengze must be dead on his way home.

87
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,079
No one can save you today.

88
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,680
Prime Minister Lü, don’t you think

89
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,480
the four city gates are unusually quiet?

90
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,160
So quiet it’s

91
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,680
rather strange, isn’t it?

92
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,720
Do you still not understand?

93
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,839
His Majesty’s troops are loyal to him.

94
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,600
Do you think they’ll obey

95
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,240
a cold, lifeless Tiger Tally?

96
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,720
Besides,

97
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,360
it’s a fake.

98
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:03,839
No, that’s impossible!

99
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,839
Impossible!

100
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:07,680
Prime Minister Lü!

101
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,279
This is your first time seeing a Tiger Tally, isn’t it?

102
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,360
Absolutely impossible!

103
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,920
Th-this can’t be!

104
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:17,720
Guards!

105
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,360
Cut this brat down!

106
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,319
You—

107
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,000
You’re all in on this!

108
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,160
Sorry.

109
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,199
It seems

110
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,759
I’ll have to disappoint the esteemed Celestial Star Tower Lord.

111
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:47,519
Shuang’er.

112
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,360
It’s your turn.

113
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,959
The south and north gates are secured.

114
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,399
The west and east gates are under control.

115
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,839
Not a single rebel escaped.

116
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,839
Good.

117
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,360
Well arranged.

118
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,240
So you set this trap long ago,

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,720
luring me in.

120
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,160
I’ve schemed for over twenty years,

121
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,360
yet I never thought

122
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,560
I’d lose today

123
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,680
to a mere child like you.

124
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,360
But do you think

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,519
I will truly lose?

126
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,360
Guards!

127
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,759
Hurry up and do it!

128
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:44,800
This—

129
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,680
Didn’t expect that, did you?

130
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,120
Quick!

131
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,279
It’s all because of you!

132
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,920
What a perfect inside-outside collaboration.

133
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,040
What a pity.

134
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,079
You’re still one move short.

135
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,160
Impossible!

136
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,800
This can’t be!

137
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,319
Deputy General Zhang!

138
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:26,399
Go!

139
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:27,879
Kneel!

140
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,759
Impossible!

141
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,559
Impossible!

142
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,480
Time waits for no one.

143
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,639
Today, I, Lu Yi, fall here.

144
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,519
But at least the dog emperor dies with me.

145
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,519
It’s worth it.

146
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,320
Worth it.

147
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:51,679
Is that so?

148
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,840
I’m afraid Prime Minister Lü will be disappointed again.

149
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,799
You—

150
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,440
Lu Yi

151
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,799
You sold offices for profit,
took bribes.

152
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:25,840
Privately raised an army.

153
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,360
Deliberately spread disease.

154
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:28,759
Embezzled disaster relief funds.

155
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,000
Incited public outrage.

156
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,879
Colluded with the Qiang envoy,
betrayed the country.

157
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,759
Each and every one of these crimes

158
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:34,919
is punishable by death.

159
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,679
I did it.

160
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,399
So what?

161
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,519
Lu Yi

162
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,919
You harmed loyal subjects.

163
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,039
You betrayed the nation.

164
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,799
Aren't you afraid of being scorned
by the world?

165
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,320
Of being reviled for generations?

166
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,159
I'm afraid.

167
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,720
I'm truly terrified.

168
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,559
So scared that every night I wonder

169
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,080
how to seize control of the capital.

170
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:00,240
How to silence those who talk big.

171
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,120
Only you, Prime Minister Lü,
can make scheming for power
sound so noble.

172
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,240
Only you, Prime Minister Lü.

173
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:06,879
You've already lost.

174
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:08,639
Surrender now.

175
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,720
Never.

176
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,960
I, Lu Yi, have never lost.

177
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,440
Never, not once.

178
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,919
No one can.

179
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,759
No one can.

180
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,559
It's a new day again.

181
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,120
How does Your Majesty
plan to punish me?

182
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,559
If the nation is a chessboard,

183
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,039
then Your Majesty is the player.

184
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,639
Officials and the common people

185
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,679
are all pieces in your hand.

186
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,039
Your Majesty is skilled at chess,

187
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,840
naturally knows when

188
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:14,360
to place each piece
in the perfect spot.

189
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,879
To control the whole game.

190
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,519
So, my dear Shi,

191
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:21,360
do you think you're a good piece?

192
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,039
Compared to the nation's interests,

193
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,120
my own future as Shi Feifan

194
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:27,799
is not worth mentioning.

195
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,279
About those aircraft and tanks
you mentioned before,

196
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,799
and aircraft carriers,

197
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:37,879
how is the research going?

198
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,279
It still needs time.

199
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,399
But don't make us wait too long.

200
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:46,919
Your Majesty.

201
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,360
My father is getting old.

202
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,360
I beg Your Majesty to let him
retire and return home.

203
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,840
To enjoy his remaining years.

204
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,320
Venerable Minister Shi
is still vigorous.

205
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,080
Let him stay with us.

206
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:15,480
Young Duke.

207
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,360
Laifu.

208
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:21,600
Why are you here?

209
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,240
I promised Brother Ping'an

210
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,559
to never leave your side,
Young Duke.

211
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,399
Not even afraid of death.

212
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,759
If Brother Ping'an can do it,

213
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,080
so can I.

214
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:32,159
Alright.

215
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:43,799
What did His Majesty say?

216
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:46,000
Exile.

217
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,039
His Majesty's decree.

218
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,159
By law,

219
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,919
exile requires wearing shackles.

220
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,759
Young Duke, I'm sorry.

221
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,440
The road is long.

222
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,600
Young Duke,

223
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,159
take care.

224
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:05,960
Take care.

225
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,639
Shi family's boy,

226
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,039
Xishan is yours now.

227
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,600
We have high hopes for you.

228
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,960
His Majesty's exact words.

229
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,320
I dare not disobey.

230
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,039
Go back and tell His Majesty

231
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,159
we keep our word.

232
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:31,320
Farewell.

233
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,159
Why did you come?

234
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,639
I want to go with you.

235
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,159
I'm being exiled.

236
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,519
It's a long journey.

237
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,559
How can you come with me?

238
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,679
I'm not afraid of hardship
or exhaustion.

239
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,799
Even if we wander the world,

240
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,120
or are driven into exile,

241
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,399
I will be with you.

242
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,279
Now that I'm disgraced,

243
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,480
I can't tarnish the princess's honor.

244
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:23,159
If the princess insists on coming,

245
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,120
I'm afraid my father...

246
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,120
I understand.

247
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:31,720
As long as it's you in the end,

248
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,639
I'll wait for you, no matter how long.

249
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,120
Wake up! Wake up!

250
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,399
Are you alright?

251
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,519
Wake up.

252
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:05,120
Hang in there.

253
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,559
I'm calling 120 now.

254
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:09,720
Hello?

255
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,080
Hello?

256
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,919
Is this 120?

257
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,480
I'm on Hua Hai South Road.

258
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,279
There's been a car accident here.

259
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,279
Please hurry!

260
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,519
As soon as possible.

261
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,000
120 will be here soon.

262
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,000
Hang in there.

263
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,320
Are you alright?
