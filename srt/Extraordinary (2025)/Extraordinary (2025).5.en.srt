1
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,359
Young Duke

2
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,320
Young Duke

3
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:03,960
Young Duke

4
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,040
His Majesty summons you.

5
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,200
Come with this servant.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,359
Well, Shi Feifan!

7
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,840
You assaulted the Qiang envoy.

8
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:14,000
Do you admit your guilt?

9
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,519
Replying to Your Majesty,

10
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,599
I do not.

11
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,000
The facts are clear, yet you deny it.

12
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:22,319
Guards, beat him for us!

13
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,200
Brother, I was wrong.

14
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,239
No, no.

15
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,519
Your Majesty, let's talk calmly.

16
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,519
Let's talk calmly.

17
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:31,840
You truly aren't afraid we'll punish you?

18
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,840
I'm not afraid.

19
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,680
If Your Majesty wished to punish me,

20
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,400
the authorities could have arrested me.

21
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,079
But Your Majesty did not do so.

22
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,400
You're quite clever.

23
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,239
Then guess why we didn't do it.

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:43,920
I won't guess.

25
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,319
Guess right, and it's prying into royal intent.

26
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,120
Guess wrong, and I give others a handle.

27
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,359
You know how to act and retreat.

28
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,280
Rise.

29
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,120
Thank you, Your Majesty.

30
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:19,199
Envoy, it's been a long time.

31
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,840
Your Highness, I hope you've been well.

32
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,439
For decades now,

33
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,919
our country and Qiang have traded.

34
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:37,439
Border folk have been spared war.

35
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,639
But Qiang is truly shameless.

36
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,280
They sent a rogue envoy to threaten us.

37
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,479
Demanding more tribute.

38
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,960
Negotiation is our only option now.

39
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,360
Your Majesty, please spare me.

40
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,919
I'm inexperienced, unfit for heavy tasks.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Right now, I just want to do small business.

42
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,400
That would satisfy me.

43
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,280
Are you bargaining with us?

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,719
I dare not.

45
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:02,479
Rest assured.

46
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,800
As long as you complete this task,

47
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,240
what you wish will be granted.

48
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,439
Really?

49
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:09,919
But what if...

50
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,599
"What if" isn't in our vocabulary.

51
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,800
Your Majesty, rest assured.

52
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,479
I have my own way.

53
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,879
Good.

54
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,199
We await your good news.

55
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,280
Then what post will Your Majesty grant me?

56
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:48,639
Steward.

57
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,520
Order Vice General Zhang.

58
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,520
Enough, enough.

59
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,599
Duke, Duke!

60
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,879
Young Duke became a dog official!

61
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,639
Nonsense, what dog official?

62
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,479
Ling Gou Official.

63
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,680
Yes, yes.

64
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,840
Son,

65
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,280
His Majesty let you

66
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,000
Ling Gou Official is too minor a post.

67
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,879
This is hard to handle.

68
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:26,720
I shouldn't have advocated negotiation at court.

69
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,480
Now it's hard to back down.

70
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,279
No.

71
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,079
I'll go to the palace now.

72
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,040
Father.

73
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,480
If no one advocates negotiation,

74
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,560
war will surely break out.

75
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,800
It will harm the nation and the people.

76
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:39,120
And once war starts,

77
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,000
the Shi Family Army will be sent first.

78
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,360
You were right to advocate negotiation.

79
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:44,560
Father.

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,600
Don't worry.

81
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Your son is brave and wise.

82
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,800
Chivalrous and loyal.

83
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,879
If anyone can handle the Qiang envoy, it's me.

84
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,959
Are you confident?

85
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,279
I'm fully prepared.

86
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,439
Mother, he became a dog official!

87
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,439
Child,

88
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,319
It's "Gou," Ling Gou Official.

89
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,319
Not "dog official."

90
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,759
Ling Gou Official.

91
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,639
Dog official.

92
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,360
A child's nature shows early.

93
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:20,480
Young Duke.

94
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,240
I heard the Qiang envoy

95
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,600
has checked into Hui Fang Suo.

96
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,040
Good.

97
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,920
Let's go meet him.

98
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,839
Is the Hui Fang Suo chief courting death?

99
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
Why hasn't he come to serve us?

100
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,439
Tiny country, wild people.

101
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,319
Our three hundred thousand cavalry

102
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,040
could crush the Southern Dynasty.

103
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,040
Sir,

104
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,800
aren't you afraid we'll raise an army

105
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,079
to demand an explanation?

106
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,639
Uh...

107
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,680
Who's causing trouble on my turf?

108
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,519
You again.

109
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,319
It's you.

110
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:10,839
What?

111
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,519
Didn't get enough of a beating last time?

112
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,240
Brought backup?

113
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,040
Seems you really aren't afraid of a beating.

114
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,240
I won't waste words with a minor official.

115
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,000
Have your emperor come in person.

116
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,759
You were just shouting

117
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,199
that our nations should go to war.

118
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,040
That's right.

119
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,199
In recent years, Qiang

120
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,600
has annexed plateau tribes.

121
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,560
We've readied our troops.

122
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,920
We have three hundred thousand cavalry.

123
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,639
Countless warriors in our ranks.

124
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,439
Once we march south,

125
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,839
we'll easily take Yun Zhou and Shu Zhou.

126
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,319
How can the Southern Dynasty resist?

127
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,480
What?

128
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:50,680
You don't believe?

129
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,639
Then let's prove it with strength.

130
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,319
How?

131
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,199
Each side sends one for a contest.

132
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,639
If you lose,

133
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,240
the princess marries us at once.

134
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,839
Annual tribute increases tenfold.

135
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,920
But no bows or crossbows like last time.

136
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:04,839
Do you dare?

137
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,040
Negotiations between nations

138
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,560
aren't child's play.

139
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,800
Afraid?

140
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,360
Then let's lower the stakes.

141
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,759
The loser

142
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,959
kneels and begs for mercy.

143
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,079
This is their provocation tactic.

144
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,920
We must not fall for it.

145
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,279
Fine.

146
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,160
We'll do as you say.

147
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,279
Your Highness

148
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,399
What are your orders?

149
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,720
The main event at Hui Fang Suo begins.

150
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:50,199
If the Qiang envoy dies by Shi Feifan's hand,

151
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,120
how should the Emperor deal with him?

152
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,439
Since the rules are set,

153
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,959
let's get started.

154
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,959
This is Balu, a warrior from my army.

155
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,519
Who will you send to fight?

156
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,120
Me.

157
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,600
Ling Gou Official, this is no child's play.

158
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,919
Does Liang have no one else?

159
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,799
You're so frail.

160
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,879
Are you sure you want to fight yourself?

161
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,639
Then let's wait and see.

162
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,639
Am I seeing this right?

163
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,919
Such a little kid.

164
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:54,559
My Gatling will keep him away.

165
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,200
My broadsword can tear you to pieces.

166
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,679
What...

167
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,480
Our Southern Dynasty is a land of etiquette.

168
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,759
We always win people over with virtue.

169
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,240
Never bully the weak with strength.

170
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,120
Balu.

171
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,639
You used a hidden weapon.

172
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,600
Young Duke, we won!

173
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,600
You Southerners are so unfair.

174
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:40,919
What are you doing?

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,159
With my truth,

176
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,360
I'll send you, a savage little thief,

177
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,399
to meet your ancestors.

178
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,120
Take a guess.

179
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,879
Do you think I'd blow your head off?

180
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,440
I'm a dignified envoy.

181
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,240
I don't believe you'd dare touch me.

182
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,720
Let me ask you,

183
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,000
would I dare?

184
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,200
You would.

185
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,000
Blue sparks are flying!

186
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,440
O-official...

187
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,840
This firepower is too strong.

188
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:24,799
Let's leave for now.

189
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,720
Go. Okay.

190
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,720
Go.

191
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,200
Shi Ling Gou, we'll see about this.

192
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,960
I'll be waiting for you.

193
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,720
Young Duke, you're amazing!

194
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,440
Ling Gou Official is so brave!

195
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,200
Careful, envoy.

196
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:39,840
Official.

197
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,720
You're great too.

198
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,480
Balu.

199
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,320
You Southerners are so unfair.

200
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,519
That wasn't me.

201
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,600
Come.

202
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,720
It's getting more interesting.

203
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,799
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

204
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,600
Shi Ling Gou really put the Qiang envoy in his place today.

205
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,879
There's always someone better out there.

206
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,840
Tell us quickly,

207
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,840
how did he do it?

208
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,360
Shi Ling Gou had a bet and contest with the Qiang envoy today.

209
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,759
The Qiang delegation sent a strongman.

210
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:23,600
But he was injured by Shi Ling Gou's hidden weapon.

211
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,960
What kind of hidden weapon?

212
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,159
Your Majesty, Shi Ling Gou requests an audience.

213
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,120
Summon him.

214
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:30,840
Yes.

215
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,039
Master.

216
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:48,679
How did it go?

217
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:51,120
The Young Duke injured the Qiang envoy.

218
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,399
Now he's entering the palace safely.

219
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:54,639
What?

220
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,080
Your Majesty, I am honored not to have failed.

221
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,679
The Qiang envoy was so frightened by me

222
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,440
he ran out of Hui Fang Suo in a panic.

223
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,000
Rumor has it you used

224
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,879
a very unusual hidden weapon.

225
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,559
Show us quickly.

226
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,039
Your Majesty.

227
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,759
If this weapon is mishandled,

228
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,320
it can be dangerous.

229
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,000
Then we must see it even more.

230
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:14,879
Hurry, hurry!

231
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:21,639
Ping'an.

232
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,240
From this far, can it really work?

233
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,080
Please step back a bit, Your Majesty.

234
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,200
Be careful not to hurt yourself.

235
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:41,720
Alright.

236
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,559
Your Majesty, don't blink for what's next.
