1
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:07,560
So bitter...

2
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,680
Drink it all while it's hot.

3
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,840
Even the Princess fears bitterness?

4
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,200
I've got a surprise for you.

5
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,400
Wait for me.

6
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,400
I...

7
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:17,719
Son...

8
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,879
Aren't you making medicine?

9
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,400
What are you tinkering with here?

10
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,080
The medicine still needs time.

11
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,240
Father.

12
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,719
Here, try this.

13
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,520
Come on, have a taste.

14
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,680
W-what is this?

15
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,879
My new invention. Try it.

16
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,520
Maybe add more sugar?

17
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,520
You don't get this mutual sweetness.

18
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,400
Son...

19
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,680
Tell me, am I really getting old?

20
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,719
Why is it when you talk,

21
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,159
I understand you less and less?

22
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
That's called a generation gap.

23
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,240
What? What gap?

24
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,560
Let me try.

25
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,159
Herbal medicine is bitter.

26
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,000
Maybe it does need more sugar.

27
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,120
Can I skip drinking it?

28
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,599
This medicine is too bitter.

29
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,959
If you keep sulking like this,

30
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,839
your illness will get worse.

31
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,560
This isn't the same medicine.

32
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,959
This is bubble tea—fragrant and sweet.

33
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,079
Is this the surprise you mentioned?

34
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,079
Try it quickly.

35
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:40,839
So sweet!

36
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,040
See, I wasn't lying.

37
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,040
Does it taste good?

38
00:04:58,879 --> 00:04:59,639
After you finish this,

39
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,879
you have to drink the medicine.

40
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,319
Young Duke.

41
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,199
Miss Ziyan sent this.

42
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,480
I shouldn't have hidden it from you.

43
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,399
I couldn't get the medicine.

44
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:19,920
What happened?

45
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,720
I overheard...

46
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,199
The Four Great Medicine Merchants said

47
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,000
they won't sell us any medicine.

48
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,560
We'll deal with these deadwood sooner or later.

49
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,319
Young Duke, but we have no medicine.

50
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,480
What should we do?

51
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,519
Relief herbs on slopes,

52
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,680
damp herbs in marshlands,

53
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,959
tonics in valleys,

54
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,160
vines in deep woods.

55
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:45,800
Perfect.

56
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,639
Fresh ones work even better.

57
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,560
This...

58
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,160
Your Majesty.

59
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,040
Young Duke Shi sent word.

60
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:03,439
There are no new epidemic cases now.

61
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,720
Still no reason given?

62
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,639
How is the Princess?

63
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,120
After taking Young Duke Shi's medicine,

64
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,600
her symptoms have eased.

65
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,680
That's wonderful.

66
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,680
Quick, prepare to go to the Duke's Mansion.

67
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,560
Yes.

68
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:28,920
Your Majesty.

69
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:29,759
Young Duke.

70
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,160
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

71
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:36,399
Your Majesty.

72
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,040
Standing here,

73
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,199
I can't work well.

74
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,639
You should check on the Princess.

75
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,279
The Princess is resting.

76
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,120
The medicine depends on this.

77
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:48,720
To answer Your Majesty,

78
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,600
yes.

79
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,040
How long will it take?

80
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,160
Before tomorrow.

81
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,480
Your Majesty.

82
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,720
Tomorrow, just wait for our Young Duke

83
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,519
to witness a miracle.

84
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,079
Young Duke.

85
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,360
Can this really cure illness?

86
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:36,959
Not yet.

87
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,759
But it's more than halfway there.

88
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,519
In theory,

89
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,560
it could already be used to treat illness.

90
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,000
But it's better if it crystallizes.

91
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,480
Crystals?

92
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,800
So what do we do next?

93
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,079
Now, we just have to wait.

94
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,519
Wait...

95
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,040
Wait for me, Young Duke!

96
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:49,360
Young Duke.

97
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,879
Young Duke! Young Duke!

98
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,039
Young Duke.

99
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,399
Wake up, Young Duke!

100
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,639
Young Duke.

101
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,759
Young Duke.

102
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,159
Young Duke, something's wrong!

103
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,080
The medicine was stolen!

104
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,279
Young Duke.

105
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,759
Young Duke, bad news!

106
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,360
The Princess has purple spots on her hand.

107
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,799
Young Duke.

108
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,039
Young Duke, where are you going?

109
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,240
To save someone.

110
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,639
I have no medicine!

111
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,559
Young Duke.

112
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,000
Wasn't the medicine stolen?

113
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,159
This is called "learn from mistakes."

114
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:31,919
Your Majesty.

115
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,279
Hurry and treat the Princess!

116
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:37,879
Your Majesty.

117
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,519
I wish to speak with you alone.

118
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:42,759
Safe and sound.

119
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:45,080
Then I'll take the medicine box.

120
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,720
This is utter nonsense.

121
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,600
Your Majesty, everything is ready.

122
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,799
I will go in now.

123
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,919
Go in soon.

124
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,080
Know what to say

125
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,360
and what not to say.

126
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,120
Wait a moment.

127
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,240
Let me check first.

128
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,399
Fan'er...

129
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,840
What could be said about curing illness

130
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,200
that can't be spoken?

131
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,720
Father, it's best you don't know.

132
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,919
If word of this gets out,

133
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,360
I will exterminate your entire clan.

134
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,399
Your Shi family will never rise again.

135
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:43,720
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

136
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,120
It had better be.

137
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,919
This batch of medicine

138
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,200
has already been prepared differently.

139
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:26,440
I guarantee it's not bitter.

140
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:39,320
Not bitter, right?

141
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,200
Next,

142
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,519
explain to the Princess first.

143
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,080
We...

144
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,639
We...

145
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:01,799
Don't worry, Princess.

146
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,639
I'm definitely not

147
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,000
someone who takes advantage of others.

148
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:04,960
I...

149
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,679
I trust your character.

150
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:09,679
It's just...

151
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,200
I cannot see what is in front of me.

152
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,559
I ask the Princess for forgiveness.

153
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,639
Your Majesty

154
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,639
I have finished treating the Princess.

155
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,559
What are you doing?

156
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:47,399
My reputation is not good.

157
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,200
The Princess is of noble birth.

158
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,159
So I had to treat the Princess blindfolded.

159
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,679
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

160
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,080
You have thought of everything.

161
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,360
I didn't expect he would actually make it.

162
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,120
Luckily, I had a backup plan.

163
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,919
Now the medicine is in our hands.

164
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,639
Let's see how he saves anyone now.

165
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:12,919
Prince Qing is right.

166
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,559
When we see Your Majesty soon,

167
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,159
say I funded your research.

168
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,799
Do not give yourself away.

169
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,559
Yes.

170
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:24,879
Your Majesty

171
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:27,240
The Princess has taken the medicine and is asleep.

172
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,559
But she still needs daily treatment.

173
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,000
I humbly ask Your Majesty

174
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:31,960
to let the Princess stay and recover.

175
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,000
I promise

176
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,320
to return a healthy Princess to Your Majesty.

177
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:38,480
Your Majesty

178
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:40,840
Prince Qing requests an audience.

179
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,399
I only brought Eunuch Cao out of the palace.

180
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,120
How does he know I am here?

181
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,360
I will not see him.

182
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,480
Why is he everywhere?

183
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:48,960
A lingering ghost.

184
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,440
Let him in.

185
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,039
Yes.

186
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,240
Your Majesty invites you in.

187
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:05,639
Your Majesty

188
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:06,480
Your Majesty

189
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,799
Speak, what is it?

190
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,000
I am very worried Shi Feifan is boasting.

191
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,320
He may delay the Princess's recovery.

192
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,000
He does not care about the people's lives.

193
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:18,600
So I sent people to seek famous doctors.

194
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:19,720
After much hardship,

195
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,320
we finally developed a cure for the epidemic.

196
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,440
If the Princess takes this medicine,

197
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,960
she will surely recover fully.

198
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,120
Prince Qing

199
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,399
Have you tested this medicine?

200
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,360
Of course.
