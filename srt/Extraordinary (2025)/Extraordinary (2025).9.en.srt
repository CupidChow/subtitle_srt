1
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:00,679
Zhi'er

2
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,240
Take a few workers with you

3
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,600
Sort these raw materials well

4
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:04,400
Then wash them

5
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:05,959
Ping'an

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,840
Add more firewood to the stove,
make the fire stronger

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,920
Got it, Young Duke

8
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,359
Fan'er

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,959
At such a critical moment

10
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,120
you're still playing here?

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,319
Dad, I'm making a mold

12
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,439
A mold

13
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,159
Anyway, it's serious work

14
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,680
As for the result

15
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:26,920
you'll know soon

16
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,400
Then let me help out

17
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,200
Dad

18
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,239
You rest, don't tire yourself

19
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,239
It's fine, it's fine

20
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,920
What are you looking at? Get to work

21
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,719
Is your lower belly hurting?

22
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,120
Let's go

23
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,319
Go back and eat Yufu Lao

24
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:16,960
Yes

25
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,080
This Young Duke is truly impressive

26
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,080
Absolutely

27
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,159
This vessel is bright and colorful

28
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,479
Its shine reflects like a mirror

29
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,120
Is this really made from those sands?

30
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,120
Exactly

31
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,120
It also has a beautiful name

32
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,319
It's called Liuli

33
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,000
Liuli

34
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,000
Listen

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,199
It sounds like gold and jade ringing

36
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,639
Wonderful

37
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,639
It's simply dazzling

38
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:54,800
Shining brilliantly

39
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,400
And also

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,400
each Liuli piece

41
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,240
is truly one of a kind

42
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:02,960
Duke

43
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,240
Zhi'er, are you alright?

44
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,840
Get through these days and you'll be fine

45
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,000
Go help out

46
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,280
Young Duke

47
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,960
If we sell these

48
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,240
we'll make a fortune

49
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,639
Of course

50
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,800
Naturally

51
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,840
Young Duke

52
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,599
Already prepared for your friend

53
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,599
Thank you, Young Duke

54
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:41,879
Dad

55
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,560
Try this

56
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,120
Look from the small end to the big end

57
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,560
Can't see anything clearly

58
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,639
Here, try again

59
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,439
It's crystal clear

60
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,400
What is this?

61
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,759
I made it casually

62
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,919
It's called a telescope

63
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,199
With it

64
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,719
you can see things ten li away

65
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,639
If used on the battlefield

66
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,680
a general with a telescope

67
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,400
finds a vantage point

68
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,360
sees enemy positions clearly

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,319
and makes the right strategy

70
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,319
Wouldn't we win every war?

71
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,040
It's a magical item

72
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,199
It's for you, Dad

73
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,560
That's great

74
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,199
Zhi'er

75
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:47,759
Zhi'er

76
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,360
Why are you running?

77
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,079
Why are you chasing?

78
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,639
Here, take this

79
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,040
Hold it

80
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,519
Warm your belly with it

81
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,800
Well

82
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,360
Don't touch cold water

83
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,000
Drink more brown sugar water

84
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,399
And take a day off

85
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,000
Go on, go on

86
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,000
Young Duke

87
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:32,879
Young Duke

88
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,360
That thing Zhi'er has

89
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,199
I want one too

90
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,000
You don't need it

91
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,199
Why wouldn't I need it?

92
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,879
I can drink water

93
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,720
Drink wine

94
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:40,439
Water flowers

95
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,399
And also

96
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,319
give it to friends

97
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,720
No, Young Duke

98
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:49,920
I'm serious

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,560
Imperial Brother

100
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,120
Imperial Sister-in-law, you're here too

101
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:05,839
Zhi'er

102
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,040
Fan'er didn't give you any trouble, did he?

103
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,240
Guess what

104
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:13,360
Zhi'er brought something for you two

105
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,680
Zhi'er

106
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,639
What is this?

107
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,040
Imperial Brother

108
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,800
This is called hot pot

109
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,800
It's popular among the people now

110
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,279
Everyone praises it highly

111
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:33,680
Really?

112
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
Then I must try it

113
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:44,879
How is it?

114
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,480
Tastes good

115
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,959
Empress, you try it too

116
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,279
It really tastes good

117
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,800
But such a big pot

118
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,120
isn't very refined

119
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,399
Empress

120
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,800
Rare to hear you criticize your nephew

121
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,120
Fan'er invented this dish

122
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:14,240
Playing dumb while knowing the truth

123
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,000
Your Majesty is wise

124
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:21,680
Zhi'er sees the deep love between you two

125
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,600
I'm already full

126
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:34,439
Zhi'er

127
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,240
What is this?

128
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,040
This is called Liuli

129
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,040
It's a new product made by Shi Feifan

130
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,759
Let me see

131
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:55,680
Your Majesty

132
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,720
Want to fill the national treasury?

133
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:05,920
Don't rush.

134
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,439
So beautiful.

135
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,240
This is yours.

136
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,160
Take care, come again next time.

137
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,279
This is yours.

138
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,040
Come often.

139
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,480
Please wait a moment.

140
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,399
This is yours.

141
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,240
Take care.

142
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,759
Thank you.

143
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:20,519
Please wait a moment.

144
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,000
Here.

145
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,199
Come again next time, it's lovely.

146
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:24,839
Okay.

147
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,439
Ping'an.

148
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,879
Why did you bring so many people this time?

149
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,240
That's another big expense.

150
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:33,240
This time, really not.

151
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,360
If you don't believe me, ask the Young Duke.

152
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,360
Yes.

153
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,360
There's really no trick this time.

154
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:43,639
It's all natural traffic.

155
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,799
Please, please.

156
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,559
Please.

157
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,039
To the left.

158
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,159
To the left, to the left.

159
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:53,159
Too far, too far.

160
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,360
Move back a bit, move back.

161
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,120
Okay.

162
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,000
Alright, alright.

163
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,720
Right at this spot.

164
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,080
Right at this spot.

165
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,480
Father.

166
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:03,320
Son.

167
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,799
Make another gourd.

168
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Long vines, many seeds.

169
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,480
Bless my son with a long life.

170
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,639
Many children, much fortune.

171
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,639
Father.

172
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,440
Aren't you thinking too far ahead?

173
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,559
Not at all.

174
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,799
My son is old enough to marry and have children.

175
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,240
I'll find a matchmaker for you.

176
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:18,679
No, no.

177
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:19,759
Arrange a marriage for my son.

178
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:20,559
In the future,

179
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:23,240
Give me seventy or eighty grandsons.

180
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,039
Old man.

181
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,840
I advise you to drop the idea of arranged marriage.

182
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,919
Feudal.

183
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,519
We should value free love.

184
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,279
Free love.

185
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,279
Love, love.

186
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,679
What, what love?

187
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,519
Love.

188
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,559
Father.

189
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,679
I have something important to discuss with you.

190
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:40,559
What's so important?

191
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,200
This Liuli is selling well.

192
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,440
But our workshop is too small.

193
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,799
I'm thinking,

194
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,440
to buy an old kiln factory.

195
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,399
And renovate it.

196
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,840
Father, what do you think?

197
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,080
Today,

198
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:58,440
It's probably not just about buying a kiln, right?

199
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,120
Father, you know me best.

200
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,159
This coal factory,

201
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,960
has solved part

202
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,600
of the employment problem for veterans.

203
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,320
But it's still not enough.

204
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,639
Right now, this glass factory

205
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,360
is the best choice.

206
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,120
But we still need to expand our sales channels.

207
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,039
Expand, expand.

208
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:19,519
What, Master?

209
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,000
What expand, Duke?

210
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,120
Someone from the palace is here.

211
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,279
His Majesty has an order.

212
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:29,759
Summon Shi Feifan to the palace.

213
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:35,039
Father, my chance is here.

214
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,759
Your humble servant Shi Feifan greets the Empress.

215
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:57,919
Fan'er.

216
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,039
Let Aunt have a look at you.

217
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,759
Haven't seen you in years, you've grown taller.

218
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,720
Thank you, Aunt.

219
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,279
Come.

220
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,559
What do you think of my painting?

221
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,000
A waterfall plunges straight from the sky.

222
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,759
Thunder rushes into the river, never stopping.

223
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,240
Aunt, your waterfall painting is magnificent.

224
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,399
Grand and majestic.

225
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,279
The people on both sides of the river

226
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,720
all say the river passes by their door.

227
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,159
All claim it belongs to their family.

228
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,679
If it were you, how would you judge?

229
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,679
The people rely on the river to thrive.

230
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,759
Our dynasty's rivers all originate from De Tian Shan.

231
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,240
So no matter where it flows,

232
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,720
the water's source remains De Tian Shan.

233
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,720
And that mountain is in Da Nan Chao.

234
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,519
Of course, it belongs to the nation.

235
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,000
Well said.

236
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,600
Fan'er has great vision, not an ordinary man.

237
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,320
I have something nice to give you, Aunt.

238
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,039
What is this?

239
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,679
Why is it so clear?

240
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,120
This is called a glass mirror.

241
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:17,879
It perfectly shows your natural beauty, Aunt.

242
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,080
Unmatched elegance.

243
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,200
You,

244
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,679
have a clever tongue just like your mother.

245
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:26,799
If you like it, Aunt,

246
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,279
everything I make in the future

247
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,000
will be presented to you first.

248
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,679
However,

249
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:33,799
I have a small request.

250
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,639
I hope Your Majesty will agree.

251
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,279
I wish to do business in the palace.

252
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

253
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,519
Twenty-eighty split.

254
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,440
Is Your Majesty satisfied?

255
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,399
Why did Imperial Brother summon him?

256
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,159
Young Duke.

257
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,320
Why did His Majesty call you?

258
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,159
It was the Empress.

259
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,879
The Empress liked the Liuli.

260
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,200
She asked how I made it.

261
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:42,679
That's all.

262
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:44,360
That's all.

263
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,080
But

264
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,759
I didn't go for nothing.

265
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,600
Her Majesty agreed I can do business in the palace.

266
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:51,399
But the condition is

267
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,360
new products must be tested in the palace first.

268
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,159
Why test them in the palace?

269
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,159
You know,

270
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:58,600
people in the palace are knowledgeable.

271
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,639
They're quick to accept new things.

272
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:03,720
Most importantly, they're rich and willing to spend.

273
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,960
They can serve as Key Opinion Leaders

274
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,720
and influence trends across all levels.

275
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,159
That way,

276
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,919
the product will sell easily.

277
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,120
What's K?

278
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:14,440
What does that even mean?

279
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:16,600
Doesn't matter.

280
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,399
As long as we have them,

281
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,240
new products will sell even better.

282
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,120
This is delicious.

283
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,279
Yeah.

284
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,159
So tasty.

285
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,120
Try this one.

286
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,759
You should eat more too.

287
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,919
Waiter, another plate of meat.

288
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:35,080
Coming!

289
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,279
Brother Lin, you're here too.

290
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,480
Join our table.

291
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:38,759
Come, sit with us.

292
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:13,600
Stop!

293
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,360
Who is it?
