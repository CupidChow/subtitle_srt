1
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,759
Your Highness

2
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,439
Wu Mao said the Wujia Village chief
is a tough nut.

3
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,960
He keeps opposing us
again and again.

4
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,560
If that Shi Feifan kid is found by him,

5
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:05,239
he'll definitely tell the truth.

6
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,879
If that doesn't work,

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,799
find a way to shut them all up.

8
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,040
You understand all my orders, right?

9
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,319
Understood.

10
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,159
How could he be here?

11
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,319
No wonder she didn't eat it herself.

12
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,159
Turns out it was for the chief.

13
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,080
We really do need food.

14
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,319
Thank you, everyone.

15
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,159
This poor child...

16
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,840
Her father was beaten to death.

17
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
Her mother was taken away.

18
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,800
Suffered that damn Your Highness's abuse.

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,199
Out of shame and anger,

20
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,400
she ran into a wall.

21
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,120
This child is nine years old.

22
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,840
She still won't speak.

23
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,639
In this family,

24
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,479
just to have something to eat,

25
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,280
they've sold everything they could.

26
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,120
Stop for a moment.

27
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,199
We're mainly here to ask you something.

28
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,479
I...

29
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,719
I don't know anything.

30
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,159
Wu Mao.

31
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,039
He's at the chief's house.

32
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,000
Why are you alone?

33
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:31,759
I walk fast.

34
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:32,919
Lord Nan said,

35
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,360
stir things up first.

36
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,680
The main force will arrive soon.

37
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,639
You old man...

38
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,000
We gave you steamed buns.

39
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,400
How can you talk like that?

40
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,639
Don't talk about the chief like that.

41
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,000
Stay out of grown-ups' business.

42
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:02,879
Take her back.

43
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,039
Safe and sound.

44
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,360
Young Duke.

45
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,759
This is the Imperial Sword
bestowed by His Majesty.

46
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,800
Chief, you can trust us now, right?

47
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,759
My name is Shi Feifan.

48
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,000
My father is Duke of Nan, Shi Mengze.

49
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,399
He leads the Shi Family Army,

50
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,279
defending our country as Duke of Nan.

51
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:48,800
Chief.

52
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,600
Please, get up, get up.

53
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,720
There's finally hope.

54
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,360
Don't kneel, please stand up.

55
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,439
Quick, quick, please rise.

56
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,240
There's hope now.

57
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,160
I want to know the truth.

58
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,480
Over there.

59
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,879
Folks, hurry up.

60
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,480
Safe and sound.

61
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,199
I understand.

62
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:19,680
Everyone, everyone!

63
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,560
Folks, it's him!

64
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,319
He's here to harm us.

65
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,279
Grab him!

66
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,639
Everyone, everyone!

67
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,959
He's an important official from the capital.

68
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,720
He's here to save us from disaster.

69
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:37,000
Chief, are you out of your mind?

70
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,839
Save us from disaster?

71
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,720
An important official?

72
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,279
What big official comes to a place like this?

73
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:43,759
If you ask me,

74
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,439
he just wants to win our trust

75
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,399
so he can steal our seed grain.

76
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,319
If he steals our seed grain,

77
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,360
what will we eat?

78
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,800
How will we survive?

79
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,519
Right?

80
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,319
That's right.

81
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,079
Exactly.

82
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:55,720
Catch him!

83
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:56,759
Grab him!

84
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,319
You people are clueless!

85
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,399
We came with the emperor's decree.

86
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,680
What?

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,519
The imperial decree?

88
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,600
He's just making it up.

89
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,319
Then show us the decree!

90
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,639
Well, Young Duke...

91
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,720
Can't show it, can you?

92
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,000
He's a fraud!

93
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,000
Fraud!

94
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,279
Spy!

95
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,360
Spy, you!

96
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,079
Fraud! Fraud!

97
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,800
You all...

98
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,759
Wu Mao, right?

99
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,079
I think you're the real problem.

100
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:31,439
Speak up.

101
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,319
Who's behind you?

102
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,040
It's him!

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,959
I've seen him several times

104
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,600
sneaking around for seed grain.

105
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,079
He was just with a constable.

106
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,839
Wu Mao, you...

107
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,759
No wonder the constable shows up
whenever we collect grain.

108
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,120
So you're the real spy!

109
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,199
Wu Mao, how dare you trick us!

110
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,199
Let me tell you,

111
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,720
Lord Nan will be here soon.

112
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,360
He'll have you all arrested.

113
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,120
The county jail is stricter than
the Imperial Prison.

114
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,519
You'll all be begging me then.

115
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,199
Wu Mao, how could you side with bandits?

116
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,879
You old fool!

117
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:10,439
Lord Nan is our county's magistrate.

118
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,600
He has support in the capital too.

119
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,160
If you know what's good for you,

120
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,959
arrest them now.

121
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,639
Then I might plead for you.

122
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,759
Folks, grab him!

123
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,040
Yes, grab him! Grab him!

124
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,120
Beat him! Beat him!

125
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,240
Hit!

126
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
Beat him! Beat him!

127
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:34,800
Go!

128
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,519
Stay close.

129
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,480
Young Duke, wake up!

130
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,040
Young Duke, sir, be careful—it's a trap!

131
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,639
Young Duke!

132
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,319
Young Duke!

133
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,600
Wake up, Young Duke!

134
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,800
Kneel before me!

135
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,480
Kneel!

136
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:24,959
Come here.

137
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,800
Let them go.

138
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,759
Let them go.

139
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,759
Fine.

140
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,200
But...

141
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,679
You have to hand over the Gatling.

142
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,799
Tell me, where did you hide it?

143
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:01,200
I heard this weapon is powerful.

144
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,519
I'd like to try it myself.

145
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:09,919
What are you planning?

146
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:32,519
Your Highness Liang Qing made
such a big scene

147
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,039
just for this thing?

148
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,600
This isn't much, really.

149
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:39,600
It's just a hunk of iron
that hurts your hand.

150
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,120
I advise you to let us go.

151
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,039
Or you'll regret it.

152
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,440
The emperor is far away.

153
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,679
Do you believe it?

154
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,519
I can have them killed one by one
right in front of you.

155
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,759
Then chop you up and feed you to the dogs.

156
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:04,519
You—

157
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,240
Our Young Duke

158
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:08,519
is here by imperial decree.

159
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,399
Don't do anything reckless.

160
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,559
You are the chicken—

161
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,360
I am—

162
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,480
I—I—I...

163
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,039
Sir,

164
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,559
You are the fish, I am the knife.

165
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,039
Go.

166
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,440
Go.

167
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,240
Since I'm the knife,

168
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,919
I can cut you down.

169
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,120
You—You...

170
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,519
Our Duke of Nan won't let you off.

171
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,639
I'll burn Wujia Village to the ground.

172
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,639
So no one can testify against me.

173
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,600
What can you do to us?

174
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:43,080
You—

175
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,480
On your turf,

176
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,360
of course we follow your lead.

177
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,600
Since you know your place,

178
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,480
I'll make it quick for you later.

179
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,639
Get them!

180
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,679
I'm the Imperial Commissioner.

181
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,679
Don't you think

182
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,600
I'm missing something?

183
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:21,559
Tell me, where is the Imperial Sword?

184
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:24,320
The Imperial Sword is somewhere safe.

185
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,919
If you want to know, let them go.

186
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,519
You—You—You...

187
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,879
Tell me right now!

188
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,840
Or I'll kill you right now.

189
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,759
The Imperial Sword isn't in Wujia Village.

190
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:39,279
Wu Mao!

191
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:41,480
Hurry, hurry!

192
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:42,320
Sir!

193
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,600
I saw someone take the sword away.

194
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:45,360
What?

195
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:46,519
Really.

196
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,799
My men are already heading to the capital.

197
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,879
If I die in Mou County,

198
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,879
you won't escape responsibility.

199
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,840
I'm the only son of the Duke of Nan.

200
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,039
And a favorite of the emperor.

201
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,879
Liang Qing—

202
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,240
is just a neglected Your Highness.

203
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,960
Lord Nan,

204
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,000
we should think long-term.

205
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,080
So tell me,

206
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,039
what can I get out of this?

207
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,240
A wise man adapts to the times.

208
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,879
Talents like Lord Nan

209
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:27,879
in the Shi Family Army

210
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
could easily be a general.

211
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:32,919
What do you think?

212
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,679
General...

213
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,559
Nan Batian, what are you up to?

214
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,639
What do you think?

215
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,399
What do you want?

216
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,039
You—

217
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,039
Of course, I'm untying you, sir.

218
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,639
Sir,

219
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,679
Let's keep our agreement.

220
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,159
Lord Nan saved my life.

221
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,480
I will keep my word.

222
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,320
But—

223
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,360
Sir, you tell me—

224
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,360
With Liang Qing here,

225
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,039
I can't finish the emperor's task.

226
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,000
I can't get Lord Nan a post.

227
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,519
I might not even survive to return.

228
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:32,879
Come.

229
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:39,320
Sir, this place is too rough.

230
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,679
Let's go to my office instead.

231
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,480
We can discuss things in detail.

232
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,200
Sir, please, please.

233
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,000
Please.

234
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,320
Slow down, slow down.

235
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,159
Slow down.

236
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,159
Sir, slow down.

237
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:00,240
Stop!

238
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:02,480
Speak.

239
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,960
Why are you following us?

240
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,200
You can see

241
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,720
I mean no harm.

242
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
I just want to know

243
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,039
the truth behind my family's massacre.

244
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,480
Don't worry, Village Chief.

245
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,080
I'll deliver it to Lord Shi.

246
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,480
Come.

247
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,120
Carry it.

248
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
Be careful on the road.

249
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,919
Please take care of Ying'er, Chief.

250
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,120
Go back.

251
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:17,720
Safe travels.

252
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:24,240
Chief, will there be any trouble?

253
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:28,799
Our words alone aren't enough.

254
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,799
They'll blame the big families.

255
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,519
In the end, only the magistrate

256
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,000
will be charged with mismanagement.

257
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:39,639
Instead of waiting for the enemy to slip up,

258
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,519
we should strike first.

259
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,000
Turn their trick against them.
