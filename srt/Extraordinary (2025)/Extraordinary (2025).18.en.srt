1
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,960
You have no idea how miserable I am.

2
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,000
I've saved up all these years.

3
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:06,599
I...

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,400
All I bought was this hat.

5
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,560
I thought buying a title

6
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,359
meant I wouldn't have to rob anymore.

7
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,200
But up to now,

8
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,200
I haven't made a single coin.

9
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,359
I even worked myself to the bone for him.

10
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,040
He beats me, curses me,

11
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,879
and still looks down on me.

12
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,680
He doesn't give you a single share?

13
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,719
That's just too much.

14
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,280
Brother Nan, calm down.

15
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,239
Let me help you.

16
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,439
Sit, sit, sit.

17
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,799
But after all these years,

18
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,280
do you have any proof?

19
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,560
Proof?

20
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,200
Of course I do.

21
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,280
Tell me, this Young Duke—

22
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,599
when will he ever find us?

23
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:00,200
You used to get thrown in jail every few days.

24
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,359
Aren't you used to it by now?

25
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,760
I've turned over a new leaf with the Young Duke.

26
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,680
Over here.

27
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,039
Let me tell you,

28
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,840
this place may look ordinary,

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
but it's hiding treasures.

30
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,960
All looted by Liang Qing.

31
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:16,479
Here.

32
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,479
Come.

33
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,000
Young Duke! Young Duke!

34
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,360
We're here, Young Duke!

35
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,199
Young Duke.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,479
Young Duke.

37
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,360
Young Duke.

38
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:52,759
Come, come.

39
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,479
Look.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,800
All of this—

41
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,560
It's all here.

42
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,800
This, this—

43
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:02,599
It's all right here.

44
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,199
This.

45
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,319
Take a look, go ahead.

46
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:11,840
This.

47
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,080
Young Duke.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,560
This, this, this—

49
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:17,960
If this were army pay,

50
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,840
it'd last ten years.

51
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,000
All the ledgers are here.

52
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,039
Looks like it's time to settle the score.

53
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:48,800
Watch your step.

54
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,080
Over there, over there.

55
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,240
Young Duke.

56
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,240
Young Duke.

57
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,400
Shuang'er, are you hurt?

58
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,439
Are you okay?

59
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,360
I'm fine.

60
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,840
Now your friend can relax.

61
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:08,840
Let's go.

62
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,400
Please.

63
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,000
Go, go, go.

64
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,480
My lord.

65
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,360
So sour—get out of here!

66
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,199
My lord.

67
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,439
Right here.

68
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,959
Look, it's right here.

69
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,319
Right here, please come in.

70
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,639
It's inside, it's inside.

71
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,759
What's all the noise?

72
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,720
Nan Batian, do you have a death wish?

73
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,240
Lord Shi, this way.

74
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,480
How are you still alive?

75
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,839
You're not dead either.

76
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,279
How could I bear to die?

77
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:29,759
Nan Batian.

78
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,279
You ungrateful bastard!

79
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,000
What gratitude, what loyalty?

80
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:38,160
You're just using me.

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,600
Guards!

82
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,800
They're here.

83
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,879
You want to catch me?

84
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,120
Let's see if you live long enough.

85
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,480
Let go of me!

86
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,639
I'm a prince of the realm!

87
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,560
Shi Feifan, let me go now!

88
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:14,399
Or else—

89
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,199
This man is threatening an official!

90
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,959
He embezzled disaster relief funds!

91
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,199
And colluded with Qiang Country!

92
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,519
Such crimes deserve death!

93
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,759
You traitor!

94
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,560
Careful!

95
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,160
Ping'an!

96
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:33,839
Ping'an! Ping'an!

97
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,000
Move! Ping'an!

98
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,519
Move! Move!

99
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,639
Ping'an.

100
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,480
Ping'an is fine.

101
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,399
Maybe this time,

102
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:54,240
we really can't go back.

103
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,120
We can, we can.

104
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,199
Yueying.

105
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,399
Kill him.

106
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,839
The Shi family are all your enemies.

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,519
Kill!

108
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,040
You can fool me for a while,

109
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,399
but not forever.

110
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,439
Wretch!

111
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,000
Master should've killed you long ago.

112
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,959
It's not the person who's vile,

113
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,079
but your contemptuous heart.

114
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,199
Go.

115
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,279
Shuang'er, Ping'an, you can't die!

116
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,360
Shuang'er! Shuang'er!

117
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,920
Let it—

118
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,920
Shuang'er.

119
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,680
This—

120
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,160
I want to give this to you.

121
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,240
Okay.

122
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:42,959
Alright, I'll accept it.

123
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:43,560
Ping'an.

124
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:44,879
Ping'an! Ping'an!

125
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,120
Ping'an! Ping'an!

126
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,240
Ping'an! Ping'an!

127
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,079
Ping'an.

128
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,040
Ping'an.

129
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,759
Kneel!

130
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,279
Ping'an.

131
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,360
Liang Qing.

132
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,639
You colluded with big merchants, took bribes,

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,800
amassed wealth, and exploited the people.

134
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,879
You seized women and took lives at will.

135
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,279
How touching.

136
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,480
Wonderful.

137
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,879
Truly wonderful.

138
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,040
So what if I did all this?

139
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,080
You can't even touch a finger of mine.

140
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,919
Shi Feifan, I'm a prince!

141
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,759
You can't—

142
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,240
I'm a prince!

143
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,360
Let me out!

144
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:10,919
Let me out!

145
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,879
Shi Feifan.

146
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:15,320
How did you trick me?

147
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,759
I'm not done with you.

148
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,440
Shi Feifan.

149
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,080
Let me out!

150
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,559
This is for you.

151
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:32,720
May you be safe and sound.

152
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,039
And I’ll be safe as well.

153
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,279
Thank you, Young Duke.

154
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,879
I won’t fall.

155
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,639
Carrying that big bow all day is a hassle.

156
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,720
Here’s a new weapon for you.

157
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,320
I just invented this.

158
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,759
You should try it too.

159
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:21,799
Try it.

160
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:22,559
I want some too.

161
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,360
Even food can’t shut you up.

162
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,799
Hot! Hot! Hot!

163
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,200
There’s no going back.

164
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,360
We can’t return to the old days.

165
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,720
Zhier got one, I want one too.

166
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,720
You don’t need it.

167
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,840
Why wouldn’t I need it?

168
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,919
It’s for a friend.

169
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:49,919
Thank you, Young Duke.

170
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:51,200
Drink.

171
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,480
What are you up to?

172
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,480
Careful.

173
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,039
Ping'an.

174
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:03,759
Ping'an.

175
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,440
Maybe this time we really

176
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,919
can’t go back.

177
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,320
Who says we can’t go back, Ping'an?

178
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,840
I’ll take you home.

179
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,600
Hurry back to the Capital and report.

180
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,399
Prince Qing has been executed by me.

181
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,000
Ping'an.

182
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,399
Shuang'er will take you home first.

183
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,759
Young Duke, take care.

184
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,960
The court will send people soon.

185
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,639
What’s your plan?

186
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,120
Open the granaries.

187
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:45,519
Young Duke.

188
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,000
You really are impressive.

189
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,120
We owe it to Ziyan.

190
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
She helped behind the scenes.

191
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,080
You knew it was me.

192
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:55,840
Then you...

193
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,080
What will you do now?

194
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,840
Go somewhere no one knows me.

195
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,639
Start over.

196
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,240
Is there anything else I can do for you?

197
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,279
Report!

198
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:30,200
Lord Shi executed Prince Qing in Mou County.

199
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,480
Th-this...

200
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:32,759
What did you say?

201
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,440
Your Majesty, Shi Feifan defies imperial authority.

202
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:39,519
Please issue an order to kill him on sight.

203
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,159
Han Jitai.

204
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:42,919
I am here, Your Majesty.

205
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,039
I order you to take a squad of Imperial Guard

206
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,080
and arrest Shi Feifan, bring him to the Capital.

207
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,639
Yes, Your Majesty.

208
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,000
We finally won’t go hungry.

209
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,519
Thanks to Shi the Just.

210
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,000
At last, we can have a full meal.

211
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,600
We can finally cook something tasty.

212
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,559
That’s right.

213
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,279
Exactly.

214
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,759
Come on, take a couple more.

215
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:32,320
Lord Shi has given orders.

216
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,279
Please invite Lord Han to the yamen for tea.

217
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,000
Lord Shi.

218
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,600
By order of His Majesty,

219
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:54,879
I’ve come to take you to the Capital.

220
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,799
Forgive me.

221
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,200
Please grant me three more days.

222
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,960
Lord Shi, His Majesty’s order is urgent.

223
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,879
There’s no time to delay.

224
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,639
Save your words for His Majesty.

225
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:24,080
The Young Duke caught corrupt officials, gave out food.

226
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,440
He gave the people a way to survive.

227
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:26,519
What crime is there?

228
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,039
Guilty or not,

229
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,440
His Majesty will decide.

230
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:32,759
A commoner has no right to speak.

231
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:33,720
My lord.

232
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,240
I have reasons I must stay.

233
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:52,039
All of this is true.

234
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,120
The Mou County magistrate is in jail.

235
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,720
If you don’t believe me,

236
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,480
you can go confront him with me.
