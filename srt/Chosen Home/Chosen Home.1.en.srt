1
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:07,874
Hey, when I was paying for this today,

2
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:11,411
the cashier asked
how many spoons I needed,

3
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:15,181
and without thinking,
I blurted out, "Two, please."

4
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:18,318
Why can't I just be honest about it, huh?

5
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:21,888
I mean, I'm fine eating alone.

6
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,123
VANILLA ICE CREAM

7
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,457
I may sound like

8
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:28,461
I'm putting up a strong front,
but I'm really fine.

9
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,664
Like, if this were the rest of my life,
I’d be satisfied. Don't you agree?

10
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,036
Right?

11
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,007
It's fine.

12
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:44,344
I can’t have everything to myself
if I'm not alone…

13
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:47,814
OUR HAPPY COUPLES STORIES

14
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,015
OUR HAPPY COUPLES STORIES

15
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:50,850
Are you Mr. Hatano?

16
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:51,751
Yes.

17
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:53,953
I’m Momose, and I’ll be assisting you.

18
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,189
First, this gentleman here.

19
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:59,459
He works at the city hall
and is 40 years old.

20
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,262
He’s looking for a partner who enjoys

21
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,297
traveling overseas every year.

22
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,501
And this gentleman is a French chef,
51 years old.

23
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,838
He’s a huge music fan, and it seems
both of you have shared interests.

24
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,741
Next is a dancer.

25
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,911
He's 39 years old. He loves fishing…

26
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:19,379
Did something catch your eye?

27
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:22,982
No, I just happened to notice
how careful you are.

28
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,684
Like with their faces.

29
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,621
Details are shown
only after official enrollment.

30
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,959
Rest assured, we take privacy
very seriously.

31
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:37,063
After all, we’re the industry’s
leading partner agency for gay men.

32
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,032
I see.

33
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,667
Would you like to see more?

34
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,735
Maybe tell me your preferences?

35
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:46,039
For instance, body type.
Do you prefer slim or muscular?

36
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,342
What about relationship style?
Wanting to be spoiled or vice versa.

37
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,877
Nothing at all?

38
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:54,080
Let me think…

39
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:01,654
- Someone to eat ice cream with.
- Pardon?

40
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:05,125
You know those giant
family-sized tubs of ice cream?

41
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,426
Oh, that!

42
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:10,296
The kind American kids eat
straight out of while watching movies.

43
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,866
I bought one the other day.

44
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,301
But I couldn't finish it.

45
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,605
That's when it hit me.

46
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,308
Wow, I really am alone.

47
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,111
So, if I had to name a preference…

48
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:28,515
I guess I'd like someone
who’d eat ice cream with me.

49
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,415
That’s sweet.

50
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,317
A partner to share a giant ice cream with.

51
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,419
- But…
- But?

52
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,557
I don't know. It's starting
to feel ridiculous.

53
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:40,493
Who would take a middle-aged
gay man's words like that seriously?

54
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,061
Even I think so, hearing myself.

55
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:43,163
No, not at all!

56
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,664
Don’t worry about it.

57
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:47,834
I’ll keep working away at that ice cream
on my own. Sorry about this.

58
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,370
- Mr. Hatano!
- Y-Yes?

59
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:54,007
- Love and revolution.
- What?

60
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:58,478
"Man was born for love and revolution."

61
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:02,849
It's a quote by Dazai.

62
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,084
Dazai?

63
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:08,488
Please consider joining us.

64
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:10,557
NAKAYOSHI PLAZA

65
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,963
TRY FEEDING THE ANIMALS!

66
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,966
So cute!

67
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,535
They had a bad reaction to the medicine,

68
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,170
and they threw up twice yesterday.

69
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,639
- Really?
- Once at 1 a.m. and again at 3 a.m.

70
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,574
Oh my.

71
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,343
Huh?

72
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:32,645
What?

73
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,215
Oh dear…

74
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,187
Hey there.

75
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,290
Abandoning a cutie like this?

76
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,026
Even Chan and Chasu would get mad,
am I right?

77
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,361
What?

78
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:51,497
At this rate, your apartment is going
to become a zoo, Hatano.

79
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,732
- Wait…
- What?

80
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,268
These two were abandoned,
and you took them in, Mr. Hatano?

81
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,337
Yes, and a turtle as well.

82
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,838
Wow.

83
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,208
I can’t really take in any more, though.

84
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,978
My place doesn’t even allow pets.

85
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:05,945
Really?

86
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,481
Yeah, but it seems to be fine so far.

87
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:11,150
Hey, maybe we should put up a sign.

88
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,620
"No dumping animals here!"

89
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:14,654
Right.

90
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:18,625
Okay, be nice, alright? We’re all going
to be living together now.

91
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,827
Let's all get along, okay?

92
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,563
Whoa, that was close.

93
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:29,702
It's loose here.

94
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,773
- Um…
- Yes?

95
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,074
Use this if you'd like.

96
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,912
Thank you.

97
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,689
‪I reserved the cake,

98
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,191
reserved the goods,

99
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:54,827
and reserved the book.

100
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:57,730
I'm so excited.

101
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:08,541
RESERVATION SLIP

102
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:11,444
- Sorry about that.
- Oh, no.

103
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,246
Thank you.

104
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:17,116
You reserved all of that?

105
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,719
Yes, for books, games,
and stuff like that.

106
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,488
This one here is for a Christmas cake.

107
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,725
Making a reservation is like giving myself
something to look forward to.

108
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,594
I'd then stare at the reservation slips
and smile to myself.

109
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,963
Today I placed an order for <i>osechi</i>.

110
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,832
<i>Osechi</i>? Amazing!

111
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,002
Sorry for rambling.

112
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,071
No, I'm the one who asked.

113
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,477
You know, that idea of yours
is really nice.

114
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,013
I recommend it.

115
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,991
Can it be fixed?

116
00:05:59,058 --> 00:05:59,892
Yes.

117
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:05,732
This part was coming loose,
so I'm bracing it with a clamp.

118
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,900
What's that?

119
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:08,968
This.

120
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,003
With this…

121
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,005
There we go.

122
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,474
Solid.

123
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,314
Oh, and this. What should I do about it?

124
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,951
You can throw it out.

125
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,452
Alright.

126
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,954
Well then.

127
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,189
Thanks again.

128
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,300
HUSBAND-TO-BE: RYOTA YOSHIDA

129
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,569
HUSBAND-TO-BE: SAKU SAKUTA

130
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:44,904
Husband?

131
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:57,283
The guy earlier was probably gay as well,
just like me.

132
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,553
You know, right?

133
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,689
We can’t file marriage registration forms.

134
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:04,824
But still…

135
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,827
he must’ve wanted to.

136
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,829
‪SAKU SAKUTA

137
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:10,930
Let's have dinner.

138
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,467
Important?

139
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:15,368
IMPORTANT

140
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,639
EVICTION NOTICE

141
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,809
"This apartment is strictly no-pets.
Please vacate immediately."

142
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,747
Well, guys…

143
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,417
looks like we’re moving.

144
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:38,958
<i>You hear me?</i>

145
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,428
<i>You're coming to school today, right?</i>

146
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,863
Yes.

147
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,997
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

148
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,534
<i>And about the parent-teacher conference,</i>
<i>can your dad--</i>

149
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,903
He can’t take off work.

150
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,773
He said he’ll think about the date.

151
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,876
<i>But graduation’s only half a year away.</i>

152
00:07:56,943 --> 00:08:00,480
I'd like to contact your dad myself.
Can you give me his number later?

153
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,083
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

154
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:06,118
Okay.

155
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,653
Will do.

156
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,790
Also, can you submit
your career sheet today?

157
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,291
<i>Yes.</i>

158
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,559
<i>Alright, I’ll be waiti--</i>

159
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,600
- Pets weren't allowed?
- Yeah.

160
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,970
What were you thinking?

161
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:27,206
You should’ve called us sooner.

162
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,842
Then we could’ve found something better.

163
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,813
I mean, it’s close to work and cheap too.

164
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,315
Why don’t you just buy a place?

165
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,150
Huh? Why?

166
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:39,252
Well,

167
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:42,121
this time, you got lucky finding one
that fits your circumstances.

168
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,657
But who knows if you can keep
renting there forever?

169
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,527
As you get older, renting a new place

170
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,095
becomes much harder.

171
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,229
I know.

172
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,697
Even more so for a loner.

173
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,299
Yeah, yeah.

174
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,301
That's exactly why I'm telling you to buy.

175
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,237
But I don’t have that much money.

176
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:01,173
That’s what loans are for.

177
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,343
Even if I were to take out a loan now,

178
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,045
a 35-year house loan…

179
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,981
Is that even possible?

180
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,918
- Who knows?
- Oh, come on.

181
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,521
It should be here…

182
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,157
- I'll go check.
- Okay.

183
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,194
- Welcome! This way.
- Oh.

184
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,095
Got it.

185
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:34,907
Keep going, keep going, keep going.
Okay, stop!

186
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,478
Nice to meet you. Just the other day,

187
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,847
I spoke with you on the phone.

188
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,051
I'm from Hibino Real Estate.
My name is Okabe.

189
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,322
Nice to meet you too.
I’m Inokashira, the landlady.

190
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,391
Oh, this is…

191
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,061
I'll be in your care from today onward.

192
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:56,996
I'm Hatano. Nice to meet you.

193
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,030
This way, please.

194
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,665
Thank you.

195
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,400
Let's go. Come on.

196
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:02,969
Welcome.

197
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,339
This place is huge! Awesome!

198
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,374
It's pretty old though.

199
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,508
Oh, no.

200
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,711
It’s far from the station too.

201
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:15,348
Since only one room is occupied,
it’s pretty much an empty house.

202
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,484
But you coming in will liven it up a bit.
This is your unit, Hatano.

203
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:19,418
Okay.

204
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:21,854
See? It's a dump, right?

205
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,357
So, don't mind it, pups.

206
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,459
Oh, no. It's cozy.

207
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,027
Really? Then that's great.

208
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,796
So, Ms. Inokashira,
about the contract paperwork…

209
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,432
Oh, yes. Let's go to my room.

210
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:34,400
Okay.

211
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,735
Thank you.

212
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,403
It's my pleasure.

213
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,438
Well, guys,

214
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:43,209
this is our new home.

215
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,110
A round of applause!

216
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:53,753
<i>Dogs?</i>

217
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:01,961
Hello.

218
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:03,729
Hi.

219
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,965
I just moved in. I'm Hatano.

220
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,000
- I'm Kusunoki.
- Nice to meet you.

221
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:09,835
- Ah.
- What?

222
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:11,804
Dogs.

223
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:16,042
- Did they scare you? I'm sorry.
- Oh, no.

224
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,912
The dogs are with me.
I hope you don't mind.

225
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,047
What are you doing?

226
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,948
Just doing a little rearranging.

227
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,851
Um, are your parents around?

228
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,486
- I want to say hel--
- They're not!

229
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:28,454
Oh, okay.

230
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,322
For now, at least.

231
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,959
Another time then.

232
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:46,772
Dang it.

233
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,078
Mr. Sakuta.

234
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:53,946
Kusunoki.

235
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,748
You want to use this?

236
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,050
Thanks.

237
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,287
Like I said earlier,

238
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,689
don’t forget
about the parent-teacher meeting.

239
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,257
Okay.

240
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,428
And your career sheet too, later…

241
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,665
I’ll hand it in now.

242
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,434
Now?

243
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,368
Got it.

244
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:20,639
You're heading home already?

245
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,476
I just came to turn that in.

246
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,646
THIS IS THE REAR GATE. PLEASE USE
MAIN ENTRANCE. NO UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLES

247
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,882
CAREER SHEET

248
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,486
I can't quite see it.

249
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:36,522
A100-yen coin really rolled right in!

250
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,791
- You need to go deeper.
- Oh, is that it?

251
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,493
Where's his hair swirl? I can't see it.

252
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,595
- Isn't it here?
- You're right.

253
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:46,265
I never knew adults have hair swirls too.
First time I’ve seen one.

254
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,566
We wouldn't go out of our way to look.

255
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,667
Yeah.

256
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:49,602
There's nothing!

257
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,539
How scary!

258
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,375
Hurry and run!

259
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,044
Hurry! Let's go!

260
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,520
DINNER SET
STARTING FROM 1,500 YEN

261
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,493
NO LONGER HUMAN. DON'T ABANDON YOUR PETS

262
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,928
Words of Dazai?

263
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,898
Alrighty.

264
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:20,900
Here you go.

265
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,168
I'll leave the feed here.

266
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,803
Thank you for your work.

267
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:32,978
Hello there.

268
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:35,848
You're the clamp guy.

269
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:37,516
Oh.

270
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,585
My name is Hatano.

271
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,853
I'm Sakuta.

272
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,522
The bench seems fine now.

273
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,891
Yes.

274
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,092
That's great.

275
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,765
Is there something on my face?

276
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,134
It’s more your neck than your face.

277
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,537
Oh God.

278
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,641
Please have a seat.

279
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,110
Oh, thank you.

280
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,613
Actually, I've been spending
the night in my car.

281
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,581
What?

282
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:10,649
I have it parked in the lot over there.

283
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,319
Are you traveling or something?

284
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,721
That'd be cool,

285
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,290
- but I don't have a place right now.
- What?

286
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,993
I broke up with my partner,
ended our cohabitation,

287
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,796
and ran off before finding a new place.
It’s a pretty common trope.

288
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,233
So, that's how it is.

289
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,500
Yeah.

290
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:29,668
Then, that paper…

291
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,470
What paper?

292
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,373
The one you gave me to fix the bench.

293
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,643
Sorry about that.

294
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,979
I opened it up and took a look. Sorry.

295
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,181
Right.

296
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,816
Of course you'd look at it.

297
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,717
I should be saying sorry.

298
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,085
Oh, no. Not at all.

299
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,320
One wouldn't expect
a marriage registration, right?

300
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,822
Must’ve shocked you.

301
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,258
Yeah, quite a bit.

302
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:55,127
As you saw, I'm gay.

303
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,433
Don't worry.

304
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,402
About what?

305
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:08,540
I'm the same as well.

306
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,710
Oh, really? Oh, I see.

307
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,712
But no need to worry about it.

308
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,048
I’m not really hiding it.

309
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,083
Is that so?

310
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,820
I'm not exactly open about it,
but if people ask, I'd tell them.

311
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,960
Even so, it’s not easy
to throw away that paper.

312
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,762
Yeah.

313
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:33,332
I had a hard time throwing it away myself.
I'm glad you did it for me.

314
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,468
Wasn’t that also something

315
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:38,971
similar to those reservation slips,

316
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:41,707
and you looked forward to it?

317
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,978
Not really. It didn’t mean anything.

318
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,347
We can’t submit it anyway. It's pointless.

319
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,083
Pointless?

320
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,353
We can't get married anyway.
There's no point.

321
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:58,757
You know,

322
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,627
I went to a marriage consultation agency
the other day.

323
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:02,594
Even though you can't marry?

324
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:05,197
Yeah, but…

325
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,032
there’s one for people like us.

326
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,468
I went out of curiosity.

327
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,404
Felt kind of excited, honestly.

328
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:16,208
But every profile photo

329
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,110
was pixelated.

330
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,879
Total privacy protection.

331
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,315
Which is nice, of course.

332
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,818
But it felt like…

333
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,621
in the end, people like us
are something to be censored.

334
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,624
Hidden. That's just how

335
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,028
we're forced to live our lives, I guess.

336
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,833
Well, what I'm trying to say

337
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,735
is, um…

338
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,505
What are we supposed to do?

339
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,608
Let's just drop this discussion.
It's pointless.

340
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,276
Well then.

341
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,960
You’ve got three hair swirls.

342
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,261
No way!

343
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,162
Aren't there five?

344
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,964
You can't see it yourself, right?

345
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,098
Hurry and take a picture.

346
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,066
Okay.

347
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,202
Here you go.

348
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,537
Thanks.

349
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,672
You can see it clearly.

350
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,642
Hey, what's the meaning of this?

351
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,977
Your hair swirl is beautiful!

352
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:25,944
It is!

353
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,679
Do you want anything?

354
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:32,217
You were collecting coins yesterday,
weren’t you? Anything you want?

355
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:35,387
I work with a group called Nikomado.

356
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:38,057
We listen to people’s problems,
help them out--

357
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:39,491
You're being a creep!

358
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,861
You see,
I just want to have a talk with you.

359
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:43,762
Get lost!

360
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,031
- No, wait!
- We said get lost!

361
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,433
Go away!

362
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,968
- Let go of me!
- Get out of here!

363
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:58,277
<i>She refused to give us</i>
<i>her parents’ contact information.</i>

364
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:01,780
The only number
she finally gave us was yours.

365
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,516
I'm really sorry about this.

366
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,785
Please wait here.

367
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,020
Can't you contact them?

368
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,490
Like I said, both my mom and dad
are very nice people.

369
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,625
They really care about me, and that’s why

370
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,127
I don’t want to call them.

371
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,529
I don’t want to bother them
during their trip.

372
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,599
They'll be back tomorrow.

373
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,834
I'm totally fine.

374
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:25,938
Please come in.

375
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,172
Please excuse me.

376
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,382
I'm sorry.

377
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,887
What time does your dad usually come home?

378
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,323
It varies.

379
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:47,025
- What about this Monday?
- What?

380
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,762
For the parent-teacher meeting,
I’ll come to your house.

381
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,265
Monday's not good…

382
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,667
Then what about Tuesday or Wednesday?

383
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:57,936
I'm not sure.

384
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:01,106
How about Saturday then?
Maybe around 5:30 p.m.

385
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,845
Okay.

386
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,819
Good boy… Wait up!

387
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:15,787
Oh, good evening.

388
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:17,756
What are you doing?

389
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,792
Figured I'd bathe them,
given how huge the yard is.

390
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,861
Huh?

391
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,064
Rearranging stuff again?

392
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,599
Yeah, something like that.

393
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,736
Good boy…

394
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,576
Is this yours too, Mr. Hatano?

395
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:42,247
Yeah, I just started keeping it recently.

396
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,883
What's its name?

397
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,153
- Good question.
- Huh?

398
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:51,390
It was abandoned. Like these two.

399
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:21,687
Oh! Let's go.

400
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,365
NO JUNK MAIL, PLEASE

401
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,301
- Hey, you!
- Yes?

402
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:37,469
You put something in, yes?

403
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:38,370
What?

404
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,305
Look what's written here.

405
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:43,141
- No, I… It's not--
- Take it back.

406
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,110
- But…
- See?

407
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,347
Huh?

408
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,049
- Um…
- What's the meaning of this?

409
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,887
You always liked strawberries, right?

410
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:58,090
No. You must be confusing me
with your new daughter.

411
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,262
Come on. Don't say that.

412
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,332
So, what did you want to talk about today?

413
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:10,469
I've got a favor to ask.

414
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,571
Did Mom call you?

415
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:13,672
It's not that.

416
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,474
Then, what is it?

417
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,609
There’s a parent-teacher meeting.

418
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:19,211
What?

419
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:21,146
So,

420
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,382
I want you to come.

421
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,685
Me? But I don’t know anything. No way.

422
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,453
Just bluff your way through.

423
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,389
There's no way I'm going to pull it off.

424
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,828
Right. You’ve got your new family
to worry about, Mr. Ichigaya.

425
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:40,432
Come on. Don’t be like that.

426
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,636
Welcome! This way, please.

427
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,075
Two guys coming to eat crepes?

428
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,047
He loved these banana crepes.

429
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,951
Can’t believe it ended up under a bench.
So, why’d you bring this?

430
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:01,553
What do you want?

431
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,192
I'm… the same kind.

432
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,127
Sorry, what?

433
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,397
I'm saying I’m gay too.

434
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,033
Did he say "gay"?

435
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,636
Phew.

436
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,538
Here I thought you were here
to blackmail me.

437
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,073
Oh, no.

438
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:24,376
I just couldn’t bring myself
to throw it away.

439
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,348
Sakuta said that this form was pointless.

440
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,550
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION FORM

441
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,585
Did something happen between you two?

442
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,120
Nothing, really.

443
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:39,224
It’s just that people like us,
we don’t have a clear goal, right?

444
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,494
Marriage, kids, etc.

445
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,429
It’s all kind of impossible.

446
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:45,330
Right.

447
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:49,568
So, we date, break up, get back together,
and the cycle repeats.

448
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:53,071
He must've hated that.

449
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,941
So, one day he said, ‘We can’t turn it in,

450
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,176
but let’s try filling out
a marriage registration form."

451
00:22:58,243 --> 00:22:59,177
HUSBAND-TO-BE: SAKU SAKUTA

452
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:02,848
But after we wrote it,

453
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:05,450
he was like, "It doesn’t mean
anything, does it?"

454
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:09,588
Society doesn’t recognize it,
and nobody celebrates it.

455
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:13,125
He said a relationship like that
is not worth keeping.

456
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,895
So, I just said, "Guess that’s it, then.

457
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,330
Let’s break up."

458
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,731
What else could I say?

459
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,534
Is that a couple’s ring

460
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,536
with Sakuta?

461
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:25,937
Oh, no.

462
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:28,440
I wear this on my own.

463
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:29,608
It’s fake.

464
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:31,510
Huh?

465
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,246
"Got a girlfriend yet?"

466
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,047
"When are you getting married?"

467
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:38,383
"Aren’t you too old to be single?"

468
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,452
Saves me from that kind of hassle.

469
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,754
I’d rather not explain myself.

470
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:44,956
I get that.

471
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,160
But still, I think

472
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,962
there was more you could’ve done.

473
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,697
What?

474
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,900
"Let’s be together
until we can turn this in."

475
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,402
Saying stuff like that.

476
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,304
Or even, "Let’s at least
wear wedding rings

477
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,807
as a sign of our bond."

478
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,175
To Sakuta,

479
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,777
there had to be something
you could’ve done or given him.

480
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,146
Listen, that’s between me and Saku.

481
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:11,316
I mean, wearing a ring
by yourself like that

482
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:12,751
is a little insensitive, no?

483
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,686
I said that is between me and him.

484
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:16,421
No, it's my problem too!

485
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,623
- What?
- The love between people like us…

486
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:20,759
I don’t want to believe it's pointless!

487
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:22,961
Oh, sorry.

488
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,697
Some kind of gay lovers’ spat?

489
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,700
So, are you seeing anyone?

490
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:29,801
No.

491
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,603
Got someone you like?

492
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,505
I'm not sure yet.

493
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:34,806
Huh?

494
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,575
But I do know

495
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:40,145
- that I want to love someone openly.
- Hey, now…

496
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:41,913
I wanna fall madly in love!

497
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,615
- Lower your volume!
- Ah!

498
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,952
People are staring.

499
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:53,725
You know him?

500
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,494
He’s from my apartment.

501
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:59,664
What are you even talking about?
You’re too old for that.

502
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,933
You’re right.
What the hell am I even saying?

503
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:07,072
Um… Hey.

504
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,344
Thanks for looking after my daughter.

505
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,311
Hey!

506
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,214
- You know him?
- No.

507
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:18,183
- Let's leave already.
- Okay.

508
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,222
Nice meeting you.

509
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:30,195
Kinda feels like we just saw
something weird.

510
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,930
It's not weird.

511
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:35,066
Come on. You don’t get to see
that kind of thing often.

512
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:38,637
I'm off.

513
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,110
HAPPY STORE

514
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:48,680
Earlier at the crepe place…

515
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,316
you said you wanna fall madly in love.

516
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,584
You heard that?

517
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,419
Yes, loud and clear.

518
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,856
Then, just leave me be, okay?

519
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:02,727
Are you gay?

520
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,329
Well, yeah.

521
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:05,897
The person you were with too?

522
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,499
I’m in no position to talk about others.

523
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,935
So, it’s fine to talk about yourself then?

524
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,041
You like men?

525
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,075
I guess.

526
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,412
- How do you know if he feels the same?
- Sometimes you can tell.

527
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,447
Sometimes you can’t.

528
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:23,448
Do you kiss?

529
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,349
What?

530
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,017
I said kiss. Do you usually kiss?

531
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:26,985
Hey now…

532
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,153
Well, answer me.

533
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:34,192
Look, you wouldn't normally ask
other people that, would you?

534
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:37,829
It's not good manners to ask questions
you wouldn't normally ask people.

535
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:43,134
But this is my first time
meeting someone like that.

536
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,270
It's probably not your first.

537
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,707
They say there's about one or two
in every 100 people.

538
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,042
I’m sure there are some
at your school too.

539
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,546
You just don’t see them.

540
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,718
FAMILY PACK ICE CREAM

541
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,753
Want something?

542
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:04,589
Since we’re here,

543
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:06,391
pick whatever you like.

544
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:11,062
- Then I'll have this.
- No mercy, huh?

545
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,466
Oh, this one doesn't come with a discount.

546
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,235
A hair swirl!

547
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,738
What?

548
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,674
Something you don’t notice,
but it’s there.

549
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:25,110
Hair swirl, huh?

550
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:27,746
Sorry.

551
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,049
For what?

552
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:34,219
The other day, I hated it
when you assumed I had parents.

553
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:35,920
But I said something similar to you.

554
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:39,658
Wait. You don't have parents?

555
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:40,558
No.

556
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,664
But the person you were with earlier…

557
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,265
That was my former dad.

558
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,734
My parents divorced. He has a new family.

559
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,404
My mom… Well, a lot happened.

560
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,975
I’m sorry for assuming.

561
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,678
Is being gay hard?

562
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:00,612
Huh?

563
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,017
What about you?

564
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,452
Then, are you glad you’re gay?

565
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:14,359
I want to believe I am.

566
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,728
So, what do you do?

567
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:18,763
What do you mean?

568
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:21,166
How do you come
to feel good about being gay?

569
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,507
Love and revolution?

570
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,015
Good afternoon.

571
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:40,685
So, you’re here today to complete
your membership paperwork?

572
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:43,988
What if feelings alone aren’t enough?
What do we do then?

573
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,858
- What?
- Here.

574
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,128
We can’t legally marry,
so how can you call it a marriage agency?

575
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:55,066
Here, if both partners have the intention
to marry, we acknowledge it as marriage.

576
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,568
Is there any way to stay together,

577
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,704
even if we can’t file
a marriage registration form?

578
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:07,212
Have you heard of the term "family glue"?

579
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,247
Like, "Children bring
the family together?"

580
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:12,784
I think couples who last a long time
have something like that.

581
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:16,888
It's hard to sustain it
based only on love or affection.

582
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,157
The "glue"…

583
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:23,361
- Well then, please fill out this form--
- Thank you.

584
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,431
Thank you.

I wonder if Hatano didn't have a home.

598
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,264
Poor man.

599
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:36,668

00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,623
I can hear it from all the way up.

604
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,358
Oh, my bad.

605
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,093
- What’s that song?
- Huh?

606
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,127
The title of that song.

607
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,664
I don't know. Maybe "No Home"?

608
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:10,268
Um…

609
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:11,169
Yes?

610
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,439
On Saturday, around 5:30 p.m.
in the evening, will you be home?

611
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,542
Yeah, I get off work
and come back by then. Why?

612
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:21,246
Well…

613
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,183
I want to see your parakeet.

614
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:27,018
My parakeet?

615
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:28,419
Yes.

616
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,955
Then, it's settled.

Hello.

620
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:57,916
Hello.

621
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:59,851
You're always here, huh?

622
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,352
Sakuta.

623
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,387
Yes?

624
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:03,288
Uh…

625
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,129
What do you think about buying a house?

626
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:12,997
What?

627
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:13,898
Here.

628
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:16,367
Please take it.

INTRODUCING PAIR LOANS

630
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,643
Wait. What is all this supposed to mean?

631
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,680
Living out of your car seems tough.

632
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:30,815
Well, that's true, but…

633
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,184
- I've spoken to Yoshida as well.
- What?

634
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,452
I've heard the circumstances.

635
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,821
Huh? You went and met him?

636
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:39,290
Well, sort of… yeah.

637
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:43,461
You may not be able to file
for the marriage registration now,

638
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,463
but maybe buying a house

639
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,332
could be the "clamp" instead.

640
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,635
Then, when breakup talk comes up,
dealing with the mortgage,

641
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:53,004
house rights, taxes, etc.…

642
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,540
Figuring out how to divide things
becomes such a hassle

643
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:57,942
that you just give up on breaking up,

644
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:00,044
and that way, you and Yoshida

645
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:03,081
could then stay together.

646
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:05,984
Just being gay makes love meaningless.

647
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,719
You don’t seriously believe that, right?

648
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:10,188
If so, then just like how you, Sakuta,

649
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,757
create meaning by working hard
on your reservation slips,

650
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,426
we can create meaning for ourselves.

651
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,397
"Man was born for love and revolution."

652
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,100
That was what Dazai said.

653
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:25,370
So, let’s buy a house, make it our clamp,

654
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:28,840
and prove our love has meaning too!

655
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:32,377
That will be our love and revolution!

656
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,013
Don't you agree?

657
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:38,149
Sakuta.

658
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,053
- Um…
- Could you not come any closer?

659
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,989
You're scaring me, to say the least.

660
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:46,391
Scary?

661
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:49,227
You met my ex, looked
at my marriage registration form,

662
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,095
and the nonsense about houses and clamps.

663
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:52,363
Like, what are you on about?

664
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,832
That's some freaky stuff you're doing.

665
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:58,336
Keep this up, and you’ll probably
get arrested one day.

666
00:33:58,403 --> 00:33:59,537
What?

667
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:02,707
Love and revolution, whatever.

668
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,809
Do as you like.

669
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:05,777
Bye.

670
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,019
I'm such a fool…

671
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:18,956
Coming.

672
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:20,858
Oh.

673
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,694
- Hello.
- Hello.

674
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:25,563
Right. The parakeet, yes? One sec--

675
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:26,898
I'll be back later.

676
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:34,906
Coming.

677
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:41,579
This is my dad.

678
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,214
- Huh?
- What?

679
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:44,515
What's wrong?

680
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,651
You're her father?

681
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:48,352
Uh, n--

682
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,654
Yes, he's my dad!

683
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,322
- Your dad, Hotaru?
- Yes. My dad.

684
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,492
And this is my homeroom teacher,
Mr. Sakuta.

685
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:57,895
What's going on?

686
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,503
What a small world we live in.

687
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,172
Are you two friends?

688
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,474
Not at all.

689
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,076
‪I see.

690
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:17,281
Today I came by to check in
about your daughter.

691
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:19,250
- Daughter?
- I'm his daughter. Right, Dad?

692
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,854
- May I come in?
- Oh, sure!

693
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,422
- Huh?
- Come on in.

694
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:25,957
Hey!

695
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:28,059
- Please excuse me.
- Ah, right.

696
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,630
Dad.

697
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,900
- Dad!
- Yes?

698
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,401
Offer him some tea.

699
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,806
- Please don’t trouble yourself.
- But I should…

700
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,908
Really, no need. I’m fine.

701
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:46,244
Okay.

702
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,949
Once again, I’m Sakuta,
her homeroom teacher.

703
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:54,285
I'm Hatano.

704
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:56,787
With Hotaru’s future path
needing to be decided soon,

705
00:35:56,854 --> 00:36:00,591
I wanted to meet you and discuss it
together. That’s why I came today.

706
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:02,727
First and foremost,

707
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:06,230
about going on to high school…

708
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,466
Shall I assume she plans to do so?

709
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:12,336
I’m still thinking about it.

710
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:15,473
Personally, if you don’t have
a clear idea of your future

711
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,575
or what you want to do yet,

712
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,944
it’s better to move forward
with high school.

713
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:23,781
Right now, Kusunoki's grades are…

714
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,049
No! Shoo!

715
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,817
Bad boy! Shoo!

716
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:28,986
Sorry about that.

717
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,558
If she pushes just a little harder,
referrals and more choices will open up.

718
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,562
Do you have any idea
what kind of high school you’d like?

719
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:39,463
It’s best to decide early.

720
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,532
Okay. I’ll think about it.

721
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,672
And what about you, as her father?

722
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:53,778
He’s still thinking it over too.
Right, Dad?

723
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:56,847
Yes…

724
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,919
I said stop that! Go, shoo!

725
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:04,288
Sorry about that.

726
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:11,062
Could I speak with your father
alone for a bit?

727
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:12,797
- What?
- Huh?

728
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:22,640
About Hotaru…

729
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,176
How is she like at home?

730
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:30,281
She was taken into custody
in Toyoko the other day.

731
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,216
Have you heard about it?

732
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,387
‪Um…

733
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,689
Could I get a reply?

734
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,860
- Yes.
- With the incident and all, life is hard.

735
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,428
What?

736
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:47,064
Whatever the circumstances, please…

737
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,700
Please make Hotaru your top priority.

738
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:53,871
This is a crucial stage for her.

739
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,339
Her third year of middle school.

740
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:57,775
Buying a house, clamps,

741
00:37:58,576 --> 00:37:59,644
and what else was it?

742
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:01,879
Love and revolution?

743
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,982
If you’ve got time to poke your nose
in my affairs--

744
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:08,185
I’ll go buy some tea.

745
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:09,987
What?

746
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,323
Hey!

747
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:15,760
Hey!

748
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:17,795
What's going on?

749
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,330
Please play along.

750
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:21,699
I'm begging you.

751
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:28,506
‪HIBINO REAL ESTATE CO., LTD.

752
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:34,045
Is there something you want right now?

753
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,883
- What?
- As of this moment. Anything?

754
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:49,894
Where's my dad?

755
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,362
He went to buy tea.

756
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,333
What were you looking at?

757
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:56,300
HOUSE FOR SALE

758
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:57,768
A house?

759
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,376
DRINKS CORNER

760
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:09,080
42,500,000 YEN

761
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,888
Welcome home!

762
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,625
Dad, the tea?

763
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:26,597
VANILLA ICE CREAM

764
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:28,532
Where's the tea?

765
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,668
This is in place of the tea.

766
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:34,105
Ah, I only asked for two spoons.

767
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:36,540
This spoon's from the other day.

768
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:38,676
Here.

769
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:40,211
We're eating straight from this?

770
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:43,814
Uh…

771
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,491
Okay then, let's dig in.

772
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:55,092
Yeah.

773
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,936
Well, okay.

774
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:19,316
Let’s talk about our favorite ice cream.

775
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,654
My favorite is the one
with <i>ramune</i> on the outside

776
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,956
and vanilla on the inside.

777
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,859
Refreshing and sweet. Best of both worlds.

778
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:30,895
What about you?

779
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,666
I'm the soft serve kind of person,
I suppose.

780
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:38,102
The half chocolate, half vanilla kind?

781
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,271
Just vanilla.

782
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:41,338
No way.

783
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,308
But the half-and-half ones
are the best deal!

784
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:47,378
Yeah.

785
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,348
What about you, Dad? What’s your favorite?

786
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,521
Homerun Bars, I guess.

787
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,258
The ice cream with a winning stick.

788
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:02,159
That's cool.

789
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,297
I used to eat those with him.

790
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:09,800
The first guy I ever liked.

791
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,101
What?

792
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,771
We ate so many together,

793
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,906
but I never once won.

794
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:22,012
You know how people say it’s because
of karma, or you’ve done something wrong?

795
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,082
I actually believed that.

796
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:28,686
I thought the reason I didn’t win

797
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:32,923
was because I liked a guy.

798
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:35,726
That it was something wrong.

799
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,263
So God wouldn’t let me win.

800
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:41,765
I always

801
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,535
felt out of place.

802
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:49,240
That loving someone, dating,

803
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:51,075
living together,

804
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:54,411
and sharing ice cream were forbidden.

805
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:58,015
Something I wasn’t allowed to want.

806
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,585
I know that it's not true,

807
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,990
but part of me still believes it.

808
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,932
I’ve gotten used to giving up on things.

809
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:19,069
But here we are,
eating ice cream together.

810
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:29,547
If you don’t truly let yourself want
what you want, you’ll never have it.

811
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,985
So, I’ve decided to let myself want it.

812
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:38,756
You want a house?

813
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:39,657
What?

814
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:46,997
Yeah.

815
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:48,766
I want a house.

<i>he really wants a house.</i>

822
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,718
<i>So, I thought about it too.</i>
<i>What do I want?</i>

823
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,656
<i>I want everything that everyone else has.</i>

824
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:16,560
Ah! I'm such an idiot!

825
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:20,164
Coming. Oh.

826
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,298
I’m coming in for a bit.

827
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:24,168
<i>I might not get it,</i>

828

Here…

829
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,505
Huh?

830
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:30,140
What the?

831
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:32,376
- There’s 30 million yen in here.
- Thirty million?

832
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,913
You want a house, right?

833
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,149
I will buy you.
