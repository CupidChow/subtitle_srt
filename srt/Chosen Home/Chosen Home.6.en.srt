1
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:06,806
<i>Gentle-hearted gay man Genichi Hatano</i>

2
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:07,707
<i>and his crush,</i>

3
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:10,844
<i>Saku Sakuta, end up living</i>
<i>in the same apartment.</i>

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,178
<i>The contract between Hotaru,</i>

5
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:14,314
<i>"Parent-Child Contract",</i>
<i>now has Saku's name too.</i>

6
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:18,251
<i>Meanwhile, Tomoe, while still on the run,</i>
<i>visits Inokashira…</i>

7
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,053
I want you to give these to Hotaru.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,022
<i>…and runs into her ex-husband who's after</i>

9
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:23,123
<i>the 30 million yen.</i>

10
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,357
Koito…

11
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,326
I liked him so much back in middle school,

12
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:28,094
but I said things like,
"Don't touch me, gay!"

13
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,063
<i>As memories of first love resurface,</i>

14
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,631
<i>a love story begins to bloom!</i>

15
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,967
Like this.

16
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:39,472
You know, maybe I should go see him.

17
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,409
Koito.

18
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:45,278
Are you seriously…

19
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:47,714
saying that in this situation?

20
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:50,717
Sorry, I was just joking.

21
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,552
No way he’s the Koito I know.

22
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,288
- Is that right?
- Yes.

23
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:58,158
Well then, good night.

24
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,160
Um…

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,628
Just a little longer.

26
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:03,997
Don’t get ahead of yourself!

27
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,499
You’re the one who grabbed my hand first.

28
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,471
- Hey!
- Come on.

29
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:12,906
Please let go of my hand.

30
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,141
Come on!

31
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:21,915
Hm?

32
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:25,285
SUGIMORI ZOOLOGICAL & BOTANICAL PARK

33
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,756
I wanna etch this feeling into my body!

34
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,391
What for?

35
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,393
Because I like you, Sakuta.

36
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,095
I know that already!

37
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,498
Ouch!

38
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:39,866
Hey…

39
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,135
- You fell?
- Are you okay?

40
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,804
- That scared me.
- You alright?

41
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,139
Yeah.

42
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,575
Oh dear! You fell, Hotaru?

43
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,310
The stairs just kinda gave way.

44
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,378
I'm really sorry!

45
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,613
I'm really fine!

46
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:00,253
I guess the stairs are getting old too,
after 60 years.

47
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,523
This apartment is turning 60 years old.

48
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,092
It was built the year I was born.

49
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,627
So, you're also the same age?

50
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,329
- Yeah.
- Sixty years, huh?

51
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:10,763
What should we do?

52
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,664
What?

53
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,266
It's dangerous, so you can’t use them.

54
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:14,934
Wanna stay over at my place?

55
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,871
- Or your dad’s place.
- That's even worse.

56
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:22,575
- Sakuta.
- Yes?

57
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,077
I’m only doing this for Hotaru.

58
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:25,678
Sorry to trouble you.

59
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:28,615
- I'm really sorry about this.
- Whoa.

60
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,483
Take this as my apology.

61
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,019
Are you sure? That's a lot.

62
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,721
Share them with everyone, okay?

63
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,791
Mr. Hatano said he's staying
over at Mr. Sakuta's place.

64
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,930
- They said they wanna be here.
- Then, be nice to them, okay?

65
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,400
Breakfast is over here.

66
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,572
Snacks are right here.

67
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,506
Snacks, got it.

68
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,875
The dogs like this.

69
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,044
NIKOMADO

70
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,346
Don't give them snacks before their meal.

71
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,416
YUTARO KOITO

72
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,517
Koito?

73
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,789
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

74
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,691
Please bring your own futon.

75
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:13,560
- Okay.
- Good night.

76
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:14,460
Good night.

77
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:19,933
- Excuse me.
- Huh?

78
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,535
- This.
- Oh.

79
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,971
We sell that at our park. You bought one?

80
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,208
Never mind.

81
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,175
Good night.

82
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,311
You too.

83
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,085
It’s a batting center,
not a napping center.

84
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:42,722
Quit following me already.

85
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,358
Maybe I’ll take a swing
for old times’ sake.

86
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,726
- You’ll hurt yourself.
- Whack!

87
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,928
Watching and actually batting
are totally different.

88
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,497
Hey! What’s your problem?

89
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,465
Cash is inside it, no?

90
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:53,600
Huh?

91
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,468
Stop it already!

92
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,737
This kinda feels like a school trip.
Fun, huh?

93
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,473
Wanna talk about love or something?

94
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,908
Just go to sleep already.

95
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,983
You know what? Actually, let’s talk.

96
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,451
About love?

97
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:12,952
It feels weird to keep quiet about it.

98
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,088
About what?

99
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,994
Is Koito's first name Yutaro?

100
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,463
Yes. Wait, did I ever tell you?

101
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,098
Have a look at this.

102
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,567
YUTARO KOITO

103
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,804
No way!

104
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,841
This is Hotaru's. I brought it out
without permission.

105
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:38,077
Looks like he works
for an NPO called "Nikomado"

106
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,379
in Kabukicho.

107
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,313
Is that so?

108
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,382
Is that him?

109
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,652
Yes. That's Koito.

110
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,754
Are you going to see him?

111
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,489
I want to give him a proper apology.

112
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:51,391
- Right.
- But

113
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,126
he probably never wants to see me again.

114
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,161
You don’t know that.

115
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,463
Remember what I told you before?

116
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,132
I didn't want people to know I’m gay,

117
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,634
so I shoved Koito away

118
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,270
and even said he was disgusting.

119
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,306
And saying sorry now?

120
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:08,808
That would only make me feel better.
It feels presumptuous.

121
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,176
Deciding how someone else feels

122
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,612
is just as presumptuous, though.

123
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,348
You think I should go see him?

124
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,716
That’s not for me to decide!

125
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,184
You're right.

126
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:21,521
I’m going to sleep.

127
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,091
Sakuta.

128
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,928
What’ll you do when this place is gone?

129
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,699
- What do you mean?
- Buying a house wouldn’t be bad, yes?

130
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,367
You're still going on about that?

131
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,868
Because I like you, Sakuta.

132
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,338
Yeah, I heard that already.

133
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,640
It’s been a long time
since I’ve felt this way.

134
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,608
I can’t really tell

135
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,344
what you’re thinking, Sakuta.

136
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,480
Neither can I.

137
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,449
Not right now.

138
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,352
Does that mean maybe someday you will?

139
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,222
When?

140
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,291
When will that time come?

141
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,592
Good night!

142
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,002
Ow!

143
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,271
Hard as a rock. Ow…

144
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,239
NAKAYOSHI PLAZA

145
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:55,848
What’s going on?

146
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,351
For the goat, Koharu’s tenth birthday,

147
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,620
I thought we’d make
a new info board along with it.

148
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,922
I asked Fujisawa to handle it.

149
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,190
What do you think?

150
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,892
- Let me see.
- Sure.

151
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,064
Whoa, full-on presbyopia.

152
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:13,933
I'm not proud of it.

153
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,334
Read it for him, Fujisawa.

154
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:16,302
Okay.

155
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,704
"A goat’s tenth birthday

156
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,773
is like being 71 in human years.

157
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,842
I used to visit often
when I was little, but--"

158
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,477
- Really?
- Yes.

159
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,746
Back in school, the kids
messed with my desk and chair.

160
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,748
They said, "You don’t have a place here."

161
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,083
So, there was a period
I didn’t go to school.

162
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:34,887
Here, though,
there are benches everywhere,

163
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,657
so I thought maybe
it’s okay for me to be here.

164
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,559
Moving on. "This goat, Koharu,

165
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,328
would headbutt me whenever it saw me,
so I never got along with it.

166
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,198
But after working here,

167
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:48,100
I learned that for goats,
headbutting is their form of greeting.

168
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,202
I realized that

169
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:51,804
all those years,
he’d been greeting me every time I came.

170
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:52,972
It warmed my heart.

171
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,808
Happy birthday.
Hope you live a long life."

172
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,078
- Wonderful!
- It's well-written!

173
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,751
- Where's the money?
- I don't have it.

174
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,653
Is it with Hotaru then, after all?

175
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,490
I didn’t embezzle anything.

176
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:13,759
That's a lie, no? It's gotta be!

177
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:15,561
How do you know?

178
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,698
I won’t tell the police, okay?
Let’s split it.

179
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,733
Why are you so desperate for cash anyway?

180
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,301
Doesn't really matter to you, right?

181
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,370
You got divorced again, right?

182
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,139
And you got fired from your job too?

183
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:29,775
How do you know?

184
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,078
Thank you for waiting.

185
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,016
- Is that all for you?
- Yes.

186
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:37,917
Please enjoy.

187
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,053
What’s with that miserable meal?

188
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,688
Hey, stop that!

189
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,924
That’s bad manners. Come on!

190
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,659
You sound like me.

191
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:50,096
- As if!
- Looks good.

192
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,136
You came?

193
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,139
Yes. My first time in a while.

194
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,775
I used to come here every day.

195
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,545
- Really?
- When I was in elementary school,

196
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,280
I told my mom

197
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,248
that I think I like petting guinea pigs,

198
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,484
so she brought me here every day.

199
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,220
I thought it was a bit much,
but I still petted them every day.

200
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,655
She really cared for you.

201
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,923
I don’t know.

202
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:18,758
She never came back.

203
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:24,764
By the way,

204
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:29,035
did you get some tutoring from Koinobori?

205
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,337
He was my classmate from middle school.

206
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,740
- Really?
- I’m about to finish work.

207
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,776
If you don't mind,
could you bring me to him?

208
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:37,677
YUTARO KOITO

209
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,250
Yes, this is Sakuta speaking.

210
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:48,087
Uh-huh. What?

211
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,890
SUGIMORI ZOOLOGICAL & BOTANICAL PARK

212
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,330
Enough already.

213
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,767
Is the money hidden here by any chance?

214
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,404
Of course not.

215
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,007
Then why are you here?

216
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:10,509
Just because.

217
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,646
It’s where I used
to bring Hotaru every day.

218
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:17,550
Since her dad wasn’t around,
I felt like I had to do my best.

219
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,853
Hotaru is asking a guy
living in the same apartment as her

220
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,822
to pretend to be her dad.
Did you know that?

221
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,692
- What?
- And he's gay.

222
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,098
Wow.

223
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,567
Isn't she impressive?

224
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,770
This is not the time to be proud of her.
Are you fine with that?

225
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,207
I’m glad it wasn’t you.

226
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,510
Why did you marry me then?

227
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,014
Huh?

228
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,053
When work was tough,

229
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:55,921
you’d take me

230
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,024
to see the sea at night.

231
00:10:58,691 --> 00:10:59,558
I said

232
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,994
it was pitch dark
and I couldn't see a thing.

233
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,897
You replied that it was fine, and that we
could just look at the dark sea

234
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,599
and laugh about how dark it was.

235
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,569
It was at that moment
I thought of marrying you.

236
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,273
I thought we could laugh
through anything together.

237
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,077
Why did you divorce someone
like that then?

238
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:20,680
Because you said the same thing.

239
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,382
When Hotaru was born
and things were tough,

240
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,518
you said, "let’s go see the sea."

241
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:26,452
And I was like,

242
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,422
"What's this dude thinking?"

243
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,759
I realized you hadn't changed at all.

244
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:36,462
You’re not someone I can grow
and change together with.

245
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,265
I can change!

246
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,402
You couldn't, and that's why
your remarriage failed.

247
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,072
Don’t start lecturing me, you criminal!

248
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:48,641
I’m just stating the facts.

249
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,610
Don't forget you walked out on Hotaru too!

250
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,448
Ouch, that hurts!

251
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,684
Hey!

252
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,622
What's this?

253
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,658
Huh?

254
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,293
Hey! Is everything alri--

255
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,227
NO LONGER HUMAN

256
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,295
Ah!

257
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,666
May I have more of this?

258
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,367
Oh, okay.

259
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,807
Please leave after you're done
with your drink.

260
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:22,775
Yeah, will do.

261
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,577
What are you going to do about this?

262
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,847
We’ll have to find someone to take it in.

263
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,482
Let's open your cage.

264
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,184
There.

265
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,086
How cute!

266
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,594
Sorry, I'm late.

267
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,463
You didn’t really have to come.

268
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,799
Then why did you bother calling?

269
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,235
I thought I should let you know,

270
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,536
just in case.

271
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,570
Anyway,

272
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,039
you might go off the rails
like you did with me,

273
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,242
and start saying nonsense
like buying a house

274
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,344
and cause trouble, so I was just worried.

275
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,546
I’d only ever tell you
that kind of thing, Sakuta.

276
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:02,314
Are we going or not?

277
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:03,883
- It's this way.
- Okay.

278
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,785
INTERNET AND COMICS

279
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,787
He should be here…

280
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,855
I’m getting nervous somehow.

281
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,056
I need a bathroom break.

282
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,093
Sorry.

283
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:16,529
Hello!

284
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:17,563
Koinobori.

285
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,765
What's the matter? Did you bring guests?

286
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:20,666
Um…

287
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,334
I'm Hatano.

288
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:23,369
Pardon?

289
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,336
Uh, you know…

290
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,806
- I'm Gen.
- Gen…

291
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,544
You're that Gen?

292
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:33,779
It's been a while.

293
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:37,583
This is my dad.

294
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,151
The person over here is my teacher.

295
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:42,721
Right…

296
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,523
So?

297
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,592
Well… Uh,

298
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,061
I just happened to be nearby…

299
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:50,696
and had some time.

300
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,233
If that's the case…

301
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,968
Hm?

302
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,304
We are distributing free meals.

303
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,209
It's hot.

304
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,812
Why don’t you go help him out over there?

305
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:07,847
What?

306
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,615
Hotaru and I are fine here.

307
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,283
- Don't you think so?
- Huh?

308
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:12,952
Yes.

309
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,557
Remember what you are here for today.

310
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,361
I’m going to give him a proper apology.

311
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,031
This is really tough work, huh?

312
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,868
Yeah, it’s not easy.

313
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:29,869
But I enjoy it.

314
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,204
Doing this for a while?

315
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,874
I had a job back home for a bit, but…

316
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:37,877
I just couldn’t see myself

317
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:40,179
- living there long-term.
- What?

318
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:43,282
If I stayed there, I felt like I'll lose
my sense of identity.

319
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:44,884
I thought that was bad,

320
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,853
so I came to Tokyo on impulse

321
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,456
and worked in a bar
in 2-chōme for a while.

322
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:53,626
I see.

323
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,595
I’m gay.

324
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,999
I hope you're okay with it.

325
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,938
- I'm gay too.
- What?

326
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,041
Uh, Sakuta…

327
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,777
He's Hotaru's teacher, right?

328
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,513
He's the person I like.

329
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,817
So, I guess you're co-parenting
Hotaru together?

330
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,620
Oh, no. We’re not dating to begin with.

331
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,088
Aw.

332
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,723
I’m actually doing

333
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,159
foster parent training
with my partner too.

334
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,595
Wait, fostering kids with your partner?

335
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,898
Yeah, that became possible
recently. And so…

336
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:36,435
- You're jealous?
- Yes, I’m jealous.

337
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:37,536
Uh-huh.

338
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,205
Seeing my ex with someone else

339
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,607
makes me feel frustrated.

340
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,409
Seems like it really got to you.

341
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:46,211
I thought I was fine.

342
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,114
I’m the type to stay friends
after a breakup, right?

343
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,683
I wasn’t aware of that.

344
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,718
So, I thought,
maybe if I start my next love,

345
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,986
I’d feel better.

346
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,056
But the people you showed me now,

347
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,291
none of them spark my interest.

348
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,659
I just don’t know…

349
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,394
what to do anymore.

350
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,898
If I may say,

351
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,166
romance and whatnot,

352
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:09,768
once you realize you can live without it,

353
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:10,769
life becomes easier.

354
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,305
Is that how you’ve been living too,
Ms. Momose?

355
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,206
That's right.

356
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,275
With lots and lots

357
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,243
of parfaits.

358
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,411
Really?

359
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,579
Did you get to talk to him?

360
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,715
Not really.

361
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:23,849
What are you doing?

362
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,352
Thank you so much for today.

363
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,087
Um, so…

364
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,289
- Hey, Koi!
- Oh!

365
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,757
- Hey!
- It's been a long time!

366
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,658
What are you doing?

367
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,626
Oh sorry, were you with your friends?

368
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:35,928
Ah, it’s fine.

369
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,297
They know I’m gay.

370
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,499
Oh, good.

371
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,468
By the way, next time, this guy is going

372
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:43,969
to bring his boyfriend.

373
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,804
It's because you've been pestering

374
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:46,972
- to meet him.
- I'm curious!

375
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,540
Oh, is it him?

376
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:49,541
- Yep!
- Yeah!

377
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,510
I was curious about him too.

378
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,746
You’ve got an eye for guys, Koi.
Make sure he’s good.

379
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,047
- That's not needed.
- Why?

380
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,149
You'd better consult him!

381
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,484
What are you afraid of?

382
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,085
Alright, let's get in touch.

383
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,453
Sorry for interrupting.

384
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,988
- See you!
- Bye.

385
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,193
We all worked at the same bar in 2-chōme.

386
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,095
- They’re my friends.
- They all look so cool!

387
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,767
Let’s all grab a meal next time.

388
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,368
Sure.

389
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:20,506
How about tomorrow?
Let’s bake sweet potatoes together.

390
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:24,543
What’s with the whole "let’s bake
sweet potatoes" thing?

391
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,944
Well,

392
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:28,480
the landlady gave us so many…

393
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:32,084
and I thought we might as well
have Koito join us too.

394
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,986
He's really something else too.

395
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,521
Without any hesitation,

396
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,023
"Okay, tomorrow at Gen's place then.
Got it."

397
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:39,691
No restraint at all, huh?

398
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,061
That's very Koito-like.

399
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:43,629
Sorry for not knowing.

400
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,431
In the end…

401
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,966
I still haven’t apologized.

402
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:50,335
He's probably already
forgotten by now, but…

403
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,678
Here, feel free to have
a little snack while you work.

404
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,313
Thank you.

405
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,083
When the sweet potatoes are done,
I’ll bring them over.

406
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,819
Do you like baked sweet potatoes,
Koinobori?

407
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,054
I guess so.

408
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,690
Oh? Since you came all this way here,

409
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,059
I thought you must really love them.

410
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,463
Yeah, you're right.

411
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,832
I like them. I very much do.

412
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:20,899
I'm glad to hear that.

413
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:21,834
Here,

414
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,368
have some tea if you like.

415
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,770
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

416
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,171
- That's hot.
- Here.

417
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,906
Thank you.

418
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:29,608
The landlady who gave us sweet potatoes.

419
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:31,977
And this is my frie--

420
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,480
An old acquaintance of mine, Koito.

421
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:35,547
Let's eat!

422
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,684
I worked hard digging them out,
so please enjoy every bite.

423
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,852
Thank you.

424
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:46,859
What?

425
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:57,703
Ms. Matsu.

426
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,974
- Hi.
- Are you perhaps…

427
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,810
- staking out?
- Something like that.

428
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:05,978
Wow, so detective-like!

429
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,713
I’m a police officer,

430
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,081
not a detective.

431
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,750
That’s not exactly
donuts and coffee, is it?

432
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:15,087
Uh, what are Mr. Ichigaya
and the others doing?

433
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:16,722
Mr. Jin Ichigaya, I mean.

434
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,391
- Who?
- His stage name is Genichi Hatano.

435
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:21,560
Oh, right!

436
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,062
As you can see,
it's a baked sweet potato party.

437
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:25,464
Why don't you join them?

438
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:27,432
- I'm good.
- Is that so?

439
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,034
Well then, I wish you luck.

440
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:29,935
Thanks.

441
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,072
I should crank up the heat more, right?

442
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,741
- Hey, now.
- Stop!

443
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,845
Sorry, I thought it was scrap paper.

444
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,681
- You’re thinking of buying a house?
- Well…

445
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,716
It's just a thought.

446
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:45,984
I worked hard and bought one

447
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,487
- last year with my partner.
- What?

448
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,789
We've been together
for a long time already.

449
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,058
Oh, that's great!

450
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,359
Huh?

451
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:55,594
Oh, right.

452
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,930
I don’t usually get to show this
to anyone else.

453
00:19:58,664 --> 00:19:59,498
Here.

454
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:01,600
Take a look.

455
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,001
PARTNERSHIP CERTIFICATE

456
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,136
What's this?

457
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,338
It's proof that even
same-sex couples like us

458
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:09,174
are officially recognized
as family by the city.

459
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,809
Like a marriage certificate?

460
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,744
Not exactly.

461
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,880
Legally, you still can’t get married.

462
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,417
But there are a lot of things
you can only do as a family,

463
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,220
such as insurance, company benefits,

464
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,322
home loans, hospital visits,

465
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,658
family discounts, etc.

466
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,261
This makes it easier
to have those rights recognized.

467
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,929
But most importantly,

468
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:34,366
the city accepts us for who we are.

469
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:35,801
I wished the country and law

470
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,936
did the same.

471
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,504
This is my first time seeing this.

472
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:41,073
Me too.

473
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,143
But I’m glad…

474
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,747
you met someone who doesn’t disgust you.

475
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,383
You called me that before, no?

476
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,319
That I'm disgusting.

477
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,791
It seems there’s plumbing under this room.

478
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,660
No worries. Please give me a moment.

479
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,262
I haven't opened this room recently.

480
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:06,798
You scared me!

481
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,166
If it hadn't been opened lately,

482
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:09,835
could there be…

483
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,337
- bugs?
- Maybe.

484
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:13,338
Giant spiders too?

485
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,574
- Maybe.
- Are you oaky with it?

486
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,146
- I know someone who'd be fine with it!
- Really?

487
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:29,087
Done roasting yet?

488
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,155
Leave some for me.

489
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:31,890
Okay.

490
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,459
Sorry about that.

491
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:37,596
I got a little worked up.

492
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:38,997
My words were harsh, right?

493
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:40,465
No.

494
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,035
Uh…

495
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:43,935
- I…
- Over here!

496
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:44,836
Okay.

497
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:47,639
- Huh?
- What?

498
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,709
- Hello.
- What are you doing here?

499
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:51,977
She's staking out.

500
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,513
Staking out? Is she a police officer?

501
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,083
Are you being watched?

502
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,221
I'm Matsu from Suginami Central Police.

503
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:04,323
She was staking out.

504
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,491
This place, you mean?

505
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,761
Alright, I'm counting on you!

506
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,929
Okay.

507
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,731
- Is this place being staked out?
- Stand back.

508
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:13,732
Okay.

509
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:20,272
Seems safe.

510
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:21,707
Thank you!

511
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:23,842
Go ahead, please.

512
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,544
- Please excuse us.
- Coming in.

513
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,182
Is it okay if we move
the stuff out of the way?

514
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,917
Huh? What stuff?

515
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,827
I’m really, really sorry.

516
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,896
- What?
- The way I treated you in middle school.

517
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:46,932
I’ve wanted to apologize ever since.

518
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:48,667
What did you do?

519
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:50,502
I betrayed you.

520
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,805
You were my best friend,
and yet I hurt you.

521
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,477
I wanted to talk about that too.

522
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:02,881
That’s why I thought the baked
sweet potato party might be my chance.

523
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,686
I figured you’d still remember, Gen.

524
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,955
And maybe you'd still be blaming yourself.

525
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,791
- Huh?
- Back in middle school,

526
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,528
I was always worried I might be gay.

527
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:18,663
But…

528
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,299
I couldn’t accept it myself.

529
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:22,334
KŌJIEN DICTIONARY 3RD EDITION

530
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,335
<i>Even…</i>

531
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,605
<i>the dictionary said it was "abnormal".</i>

532
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,607
GAY- AN ABNORMAL DESIRE
FOR SOMEONE OF THE SAME SEX

533
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:31,243
<i>And the health textbook said</i>

534
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:32,144
<i>when you hit puberty,</i>

535
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,746
<i>everyone starts getting interested</i>
<i>in the opposite sex…</i>

536
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:35,647
DEVELOP AN INTEREST IN THE OPPOSITE SEX

537
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:38,450
<i>so I tried not to think about it too much.</i>

538
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:39,651
Yay, I win!

539
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,753
- You played dirty, Gen!
- <i>I was always with you…</i>

540
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,455
- No, I didn't!
- Yes, you did!

541
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,457
<i>…and I really enjoyed your company.</i>

542
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,759
- So good!
- But so cold!

543
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:49,060
<i>But…</i>

544
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,930
<i>when the kids in class</i>
<i>started calling us gay…</i>

545
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,665
Homo!

546
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:54,966
Homo!

547
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,773
Don't touch me, gay! You're disgusting!

548
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,075
I…

549
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,012
was terrified that people
would know I was gay.

550
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,550
I was going to shove you away too,
back then.

551
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:15,086
- Really?
- It just so happened

552
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:16,455
that you did it first.

553
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,423
So, Gen,

554
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,725
you don’t have to think
you're the only one at fault.

555
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:21,927
No, but…

556
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:24,496
I was just as much at fault.

557
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:25,764
Did you like him?

558
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,267
Yeah.

559
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,570
More than I can say.

560
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,043
I liked you too.

561
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:41,513
You were my first love.

562
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,382
So we both felt the same way
about each other?

563
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,853
Past tense, mind you.

564
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,321
Both of you "liked" each other.

565
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:50,889
Don't get that wrong.

566
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,290
Right…

567
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:53,191
Yes.

568
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:55,694
We "liked" each other.

569
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,496
You two should’ve talked about it sooner.

570
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,664
About how you really felt.

571
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,400
Yeah. I do that now.

572
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:03,368
With my partner, that is.

573
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,903
We talk about everything.

574
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,105
We even made a partnership declaration,

575
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,641
took out a mortgage,
and bought a house together.

576
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,248
Knitting…

577
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:18,683
Hula dancing…

578
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:23,388
Trying my hand at clothes-making…

579
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:27,225
And oh, painting.

580
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,896
You’ve done so many things.

581
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:33,131
I’ve been trying to find something I like.

582
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,867
But I still haven’t found that one thing

583
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,802
that really clicks.

584
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:40,939
A whole fascinating history…

585
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,941
of Inokashira.

586
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,110
Well…

587
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,746
Um, please have one, if you’d like.

588
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:49,648
Thank you.

589
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,183
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

590
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,921
Did you know? She's on a stakeout.

591
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:57,923
May I know why you're here today?

592
00:25:57,989 --> 00:25:59,791
I can’t comment on ongoing investigations.

593
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:01,893
So cool…

594
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:05,797
I’ll be taking my leave.

595
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,502
Could you tell me secretly?
Just between us.

596
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,803
Take care!

597
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,140
- She hasn’t noticed, right?
- What?

598
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:16,341
About you acting as my dad.

599
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,211
Let's just think we're fine.

600
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:23,448
It's still here.

601
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,484
That’s a terrible drawing!

602
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:28,253
MOTHER’S DAY: PORTRAIT CORNER

603
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,989
Huh? How did you even know I’d be here?

604
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:33,725
Well, I'm your ex. Of course, I’d know.

605
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,193
Come to papa.

606
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:37,963
- What's that?
- I took it in.

607
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,131
I’ll take care of it till it dies.

608
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,767
Ain’t that right, cutie?

609
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,069
HAPPY STORE

610
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:46,171
Hey! Where are you off to next?

611
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:47,372
Thanks for coming today.

612
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,308
Next time, come over my place.
Everyone’s invited.

613
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,010
Are you sure? I'd love that!

614
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,345
Oh, yes.

615
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,413
There’s something I wanted to ask.

616
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,215
What is it?

617
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,249
Um, you see…

618
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:02,253
I’m not actually her real parent.

619
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,490
There’s a lot behind it, but…

620
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,627
Is there a way

621
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:09,995
for someone to become

622
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:12,697
the legal parent
of another person's child?

623
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,367
Like adopting them, for instance?

624
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:16,568
Or becoming a foster parent?

625
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,069
Well, I guess that's different.

626
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,473
When you said you wanted
to buy a house with someone important…

627
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,642
is Hotaru in the equation too?

628
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,878
I’m not sure yet.

629
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:30,248
You’re kind, Gen.

630
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,549
No, it’s not like that.

631
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,852
Come by our office sometime.

632
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:36,087
We’ve got counselors
who know all about that stuff.

633
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,123
- Let's figure it out together.
- Okay, thanks.

634
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:40,025
Oh, right. Let’s exchange contacts.

635
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,927
I don't have my phone with me.

636
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,329
You can type yours in then.

637
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,168
- Presbyopia?
- Yeah, I guess.

638
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:52,937
Here, use this.

639
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:56,141
You used to wear round ones
like these, no?

640
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:57,075
Did I?

641
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,476
I used to like

642
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,478
watching you from the back row, Gen,

643
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,414
with your glasses on.

644
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:06,117
<i>I kept staring through your glasses.</i>

645
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,420
<i>Wondering what you were looking at</i>

646
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,155
<i>and what you were thinking.</i>

647
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:14,125
When you hit puberty, you begin
to develop interest in the opposite sex.

648
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,262
Some may show interest in the same sex,

649
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:20,165
but that’s just a passing phase.

650
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,101
Oh, I’m not gay, by the way.

651
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,405
You sure about that?

652
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,044
The current one
looks better on you, though.

653
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:40,351
INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS

654
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,226
I knew you'd come to see Hotaru.

655
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:50,395
Right?

656
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:55,700
Glad the stairs got fixed so quickly.

657
00:28:57,969 --> 00:28:59,070
Thanks for having me.

658
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,511
Are you collecting these?

659
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,680
No, it's not me.

660
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,250
Hotaru.

661
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,420
Mom?

662
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,522
- What?
- Huh?

663
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,757
Tomoe?

664
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:20,458
I’m here too, you know.

665
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,467
- What?
- Huh?

666
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,237
Did you think I’d run up and hug you
while crying tears of joy?

667
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:33,471
Hey, that's dangerous!

668
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,907
Maybe a little, sorry.

669
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,842
Even if you apologize,
I won’t forgive you!

670
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:39,377
- Hey, now.
- That can't do.

671
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,512
Let go of me!

672
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:41,679
Hey!

673
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:42,847
Come on, Hotaru.

674
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,983
- Hey!
- Stop!

675
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,619
Have you calmed down?

676
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:48,887
Not at all.

677
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:49,954
Well then!

678
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:53,424
Then let’s talk this through,
all of us, okay?

679
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:54,492
I have a question.

680
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,460
Yes, Sakuta?

681
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,396
I’ve been Hotaru’s homeroom teacher
since her third year. I’m Sakuta.

682
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,765
I’ll skip the details,

683
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,567
but I'm living in this apartment now.

684
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,703
Um, did you really embezzle the money?

685
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,507
I was wondering that too. Oh, I'm--

686
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:10,675
This is the guy

687
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,877
pretending to be Hotaru’s dad
when he’s gay.

688
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,814
I was the one who asked him to.

689
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,049
I’m Hatano. I live here too.

690
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:21,452
I’m really sorry.
I've caused you all trouble.

691
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:24,956
So, about the embezzlement…

692
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,060
Yes, I did it.

693
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,362
You really did, huh?

694
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:32,564
You did, huh?

695
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:36,301
Tomoe had her own reasons for doing so,
am I right?

696
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,335
What reasons?

697
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:40,038
Before I knew it, I had done it.

698
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:44,909
Maybe I shouldn’t be saying this, but…

699
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:45,844
Absolutely.

700
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,412
The fake dad shouldn't say a thing.

701
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:48,546
You keep quiet too.

702
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:51,115
I think it's a little too selfish of you.

703
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:55,186
Hotaru must've been really cornered to ask
someone like me to act as her parent.

704
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:58,523
As Hotaru's homeroom teacher, I've to say

705
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,758
this is a really important time for her.

706
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:01,659
I hope you underst--

707
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:03,595
Please do not badmouth my mom!

708
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:04,762
Oh…

709
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,433
I'm so sorry about this.

710
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,603
Stay here…

711
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:18,109
I can't do that yet.

712
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,378
- Sorry.
- Why?

713
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,982
You wouldn’t understand,
even if I tell you.

714
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:26,284
Even so, tell me.

715
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:27,518
I want to know too.

716
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,360
A dream.

717
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:41,332
- What dream?
- I never had dreams.

718
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:46,137
Be it school, work, marriage, or kids.

719
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:47,906
Now that I think about it,

720
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:52,010
I just followed what everyone else did.

721
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,212
There was probably nothing
I really wanted.

722
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:56,748
But…

723
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,250
while I was on the run,

724
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,586
I found those keychains.

725
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:02,620
And I remembered.

726
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:05,857
Collecting all 47 of them

727
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:08,526
was my childhood dream.

728
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,930
I kept at it little by little
until I started working.

729
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:12,830
Now,

730
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,499
I know what you’re thinking.

731
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,768
"That’s it?" Right?

732
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:20,605
But when I remembered my dream,

733
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:21,839
I was glad.

734
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:24,876
Like, "Oh yeah, a dream,

735
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,312
I did have one."

736
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,949
I do feel bad for Hotaru,

737
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:34,185
but I don’t know what the future holds.

738
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,988
So, if I want to fulfil that dream,
it has to be now.

739
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:39,223
So…

740
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:40,591
the keychains.

741
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,394
Until I collect all 47 of them…

742
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,130
I can’t go home.

743
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:48,766
You've seriously lost me.

744
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,102
Don't worry, you're not alone.

745
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:52,737
You can't relate?

746
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,875
Since I haven’t been able to fulfill
such a silly dream like this,

747
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:02,447
it’s been stuck in my throat
like a fishbone this whole time.

748
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,950
I hate myself for it.

749
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,187
I can’t even fulfil such a dream,

750
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:13,257
so how can I expect anything else
to work out?

751
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:15,994
Don’t you get that?

752
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,428
I don't.

753
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,064
What about you, Inokashira?

754
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,301
Well…

755
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:29,173
- What about you, Hatano?
- Hey, why don't you ask me too?

756
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,375
I sort of get it.

757
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:32,910
Back in middle school,

758
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:34,912
there was someone I hurt,

759
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,281
but I never got to say sorry,

760
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,384
and that stung me.

761
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:43,121
But today, I got to talk to him.

762
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,024
That stung has now become a little prick.

763
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:47,792
It feels like

764
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:51,462
something new could start
from here, finally.

765
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,165
It's just a feeling, you know?

766
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,367
- Don't you agree?
- What?

767
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,269
When a little bone is stuck
in your throat,

768
00:33:58,336 --> 00:33:59,737
you just have to reach in

769
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:02,073
and pull it out, huh!

770
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,608
Once, I couldn’t get one out,

771
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,977
so I kept on eating rice to force it down.

772
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,212
It’s impossible to get it out
like that, isn’t it?

773
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:10,882
It’s apparently a superstition.
It only makes it go deeper.

774
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:11,883
Really?

775
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,785
It just fills your stomach, and that’s it.

776
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:14,719
Guess what?

777
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:17,855
I had surgery for it at a hospital.

778
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:19,190
- What?
- Whoa!

779
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:21,292
They pried my mouth open like this…

780
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:22,693
You're lying.

781
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,928
No, really.

782
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,531
Something this huge went down my thro--

783
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:29,133
- Ah! Hot!
- Oh!

784
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,768
- So hot!
- Are you okay?

785
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:31,869
- Shall I dry your pants?
- Ugh!

786
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:33,237
Just what are you doing?

787
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,138
Man…

788
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:39,877
- Huh?
- Well…

789
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:42,880
I know, it’s pathetic…

790
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,450
I’m not young anymore,

791
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,087
and yet, why am I such a failure?

792
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:51,155
You're just getting started, no?

793
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,391
You still have to take care of the rabbit.

794
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:55,426
I’m trying to change.

795
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:56,894
That’s commendable.

796
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,797
Don’t worry, it’ll dry soon.

797
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:02,467
For a gay,

798
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:04,969
you're surprisingly decent, huh?

799
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:07,105
Um…

800
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,174
Like, what are all of you up to?

801
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,642
Sorry.

802
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:13,845
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

803
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:14,946
Whatever.

804
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:19,417
You’ll be satisfied once you collect
all 47 of them, right?

805
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:24,155
Just three more, right? I counted.

806
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:27,892
Then…

807
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,762
go get it over with and come back quickly.

808
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:40,972
I’m sorry, everyone.

809
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,775
Please take care of my daughter.

810
00:35:58,756 --> 00:35:59,957
Mom.

811
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,794
Take these with you.

812
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,935
Mom.

813
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:17,575
Do you… love me?

814
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,784
Before… coming here,

815
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,855
I went to the family restaurant
we used to go.

816
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:32,290
You remember?

817
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,493
The one where you liked
mixing corn soup with rice.

818
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,195
And

819
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,631
the guinea pig park too.

820
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,733
Even the supermarket’s portrait corner

821
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,101
where you drew me.

822
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:45,136
I went around those spots.

823
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:48,472
I’ve always…

824
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,309
loved you, every age

825
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,445
you’ve ever been, Hotaru.

826
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:58,115
I’m leaving now.

827
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:00,851
Have a good trip.

828
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:19,704
Sorry for touching it without asking.

829
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,572
It’s fine. You can touch it.

830
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:26,744
There.

831
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:30,681
Should I hate my mom for what she did?

832
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,118
- What?
- She stole money,

833
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,354
and just when I thought she came back,

834
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,989
she left for somewhere again.

835
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:42,660
She's terrible, isn't she?

836
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,964
But there are things I like about her,

837
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,901
and there are things
I don’t like too, after all.

838
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,871
Right now,

839
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,974
whether I’m angry or sad…

840
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,276
I can’t even tell.

841
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:02,313
I don’t even know
if I should’ve tried stopping her.

842
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,015
Not at all.

843
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:09,020
And my mom’s feelings too…

844
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:11,756
I don’t get it at all.

845
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:20,665
Honestly…

846
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,301
I just don’t get any of it.

847
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,076
Here.

848
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:38,749
You don’t have to understand it now.

849
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,920
Whether you like or hate her,

850
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,955
there's no need to decide.

851
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,625
No need to rush.

852
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,628
Mr. Hatano.

853
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:53,831
How old are you again now?

854
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:55,566
Fifty years old.

855
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,035
Are you having fun?

856
00:38:58,669 --> 00:38:59,603
At 50 years old?

857
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:02,506
Yeah.

858
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:03,407
That’s a lie.

859
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,377
By the time I turn 50,

860
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:08,045
life will likely be so hard,
I’ll just die.

861
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,615
I mean, it already hurts this much now.

862
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,051
It’s not a lie.

863
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:16,420
Getting older has its good sides too.

864
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:20,157
Then tell me one.

865
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:21,859
Huh?

866
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,160
So sudden…

867
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,464
My knees ache

868
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:30,501
when it’s about to rain.
I guess that’s something.

869
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:33,504
- Anything else?
- What else?

870
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,139
Let me think…

871
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:37,208
Oh, by the window,

872
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:39,043
I’ve been growing pea sprouts.

873
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,378
It's incredible, you know?

874
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:42,113
They grow at crazy speed.

875
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:44,949
And when I see them pushing so hard
to keep growing,

876
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:46,617
it kinda makes me want to cry.

877
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:49,320
Like, bawling, while brushing my teeth.

878
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:53,124
I guess you start getting moved
by the tiniest things.

879
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,226
Every day I feel touched!

880
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:57,261
What the heck?

881
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:59,630
- What else?
- Uh…

882
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:03,167
When I was little,
I really hated cucumbers.

883
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,437
I’d even sneak them into the trash
at lunch if I found them.

884
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:09,840
But now? I love cucumbers.

885
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:12,176
And that kinda makes me happy.

886
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:13,978
What the hell?

887
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,448
The things you dislike decrease,

888
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:20,651
and the things you like increase.

889
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:22,787
I guess that's what it means to age.

890
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,822
It’s fun.

891
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:26,290
So, you like…

892
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:29,527
Mr. Sakuta?

893
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:31,896
What? Why do you ask?

894
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:33,631
I can just tell by looking.

895
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,371
Yeah, I like Sakuta.

896
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,918
It’s going to sting later
if you rub it like that.

897
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,621
Okay.

898
00:40:58,389 --> 00:40:59,457
Wear this.

899
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:02,393
What's that?

900
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,662
Reading glasses. Go on.

901
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:06,797
Getting farsighted
isn’t exactly a good thing.

902
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:07,898
Come on.

903
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,000
Just try it on, okay?

904
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:16,874
Maybe it's better you close your eyes.

905
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,079
Face this side.

906
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:23,948
Yeah, just like that.

907
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,090
This way, all your tears get absorbed.

908
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,293
Hacks like this are something you learn

909
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,462
when you get older.

910
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,598
What's this?

911
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:42,766
I can't see a thing.

912
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,271
That’s the point. You can still have fun.

913
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:49,406
Even at 50 years old.

914
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,781
<i>After the beep tone,</i>

915
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,751
<i>please leave your name and message.</i>

916
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:02,753
<i>Hello, Mom?</i>

917
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:06,323
<i>Where are you now?</i>
<i>I hope you find those keychains.</i>

918
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:09,093
<i>The things I like…</i>

919
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:11,095
<i>I think I’m kind of starting</i>
<i>to figure it out.</i>

920
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:13,264
Happy 71st birthday!

921
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,432
Congrats!

922
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:17,034
<i>So, for now,</i>

923
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:18,936
<i>I’ll just try my best</i>
<i>until I’m 50 years old.</i>

924
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:19,837
KOHARU IS 10 YEARS OLD

925
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:21,772
<i>In the meantime,</i>

926
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,209
<i>I’ll be waiting to welcome you home, Mom.</i>

927
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:26,610
<i>Bye.</i>

928
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:28,212
<i>Talk to you soon.</i>

929
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,285
Why 50 years old, though?

930
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,092
Enjoy.

931
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:52,536
So, how did the matter with your ex go?

932
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:58,008
I still can't let him go.

933
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:01,445
Yeah. We just can't give up that easily.

934
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:03,380
Huh?

935
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:05,749
Maybe the only way
is to throw caution to the wind

936
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:08,619
and lay all your feelings out there.

937
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,894
Everything’s so expensive. Seriously.

938
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:19,063
Yes.

939
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:23,167
I guess we should start
by figuring out a budget.

940
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:25,135
Yes.

941
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,173
Maybe the partnership stuff
should come first?

942
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,242
Um, Sakuta…

943
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:33,844
Isn’t this…

944
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,313
leading up to buying a house?

945
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:39,216
Living together…

946
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:42,252
I want to experience the activities
that come with it.

947
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,722
So, does that mean, um…

948
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:48,626
our feelings are mutual?

949
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:49,593
Yeah,

950
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:54,632
- I guess.
- You're saying you like me, yes?

951
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:57,968
Pretty much.

952
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:02,706
What's with that face?

953
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,512
Could you say it louder and more clear--

954
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:09,480
Are we buying it or not?

955
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:11,548
We are. Let's buy it!
