2
00:00:04,909 --> 00:00:06,644
Genichi Hatano, a man afraid of love

3
00:00:06,711 --> 00:00:08,646
after a comment made
by a marriage agency staff

4
00:00:08,713 --> 00:00:09,681
begins to change.

5
00:00:09,747 --> 00:00:11,783
Love and revolution.

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,819
His love interest, Saku Sakuta,
is a middle school teacher.

7
00:00:14,886 --> 00:00:16,020
Saku’s student,

8
00:00:16,087 --> 00:00:18,256
Hotaru Kusunoki,
shows up carrying 30 million yen.

9
00:00:18,323 --> 00:00:19,824
Party A’s mother, Tomoe Kusunoki,

10
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:22,660
is wanted for embezzlement
from her company and is on the run.

11
00:00:22,727 --> 00:00:24,996
-Not wanting to see Hotaru suffer,
-Please.

12
00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:27,499
Genichi decides to pose as her father.
But…

13
00:00:27,565 --> 00:00:28,700
I'm Jin Ichigaya.

14
00:00:28,766 --> 00:00:30,735
Your stage name is Genichi Hatano?

15
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:33,404
…to the police,
he tells a lie far too big to sustain.

16
00:00:34,372 --> 00:00:35,773
-Hey.
-That lie is then

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,942
exposed instantly
when Hotaru's real dad appears.

18
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:39,410
You’ve been lying all this time?

19
00:00:39,477 --> 00:00:41,146
And finally, a confession.

20
00:00:41,212 --> 00:00:42,514
I like you.

21
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,015
Meanwhile, Hotaru’s mom

22
00:00:44,082 --> 00:00:47,085
continues her runaway journey,
wandering across Japan.

23
00:00:47,152 --> 00:00:49,053
I won’t be coming home for a while.

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,022
-I'll be back.
-Excuse me!

25
00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:51,990
Yes?

26
00:00:53,992 --> 00:00:54,993
TAMOTSU’S LITTLE GIFT SHOP

27
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:56,294
The day before yesterday,

28
00:00:56,361 --> 00:00:57,795
or maybe the day before that,

29
00:00:57,862 --> 00:01:00,565
I think, I sent a letter to Tokyo.

30
00:01:00,632 --> 00:01:02,600
-Right.
-Has it arrived by any chance?

31
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:04,235
Did you send it out by mistake, perhaps?

32
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:06,671
Why do you ask?

33
00:01:06,738 --> 00:01:07,906
You sound like you wished
it wasn't sent out.

34
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,142
Ah, no…

35
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:12,677
I’m not sure.

36
00:01:13,578 --> 00:01:14,946
Maybe I did send it to the wrong place.

37
00:01:17,248 --> 00:01:19,584
I honestly don’t know myself too.

38
00:01:23,988 --> 00:01:24,989
I said…

39
00:01:27,058 --> 00:01:28,026
I like you!

40
00:01:28,092 --> 00:01:29,093
Huh?

41
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:30,895
Because I like you.

42
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:32,330
Saying to use a house as a "clamp"

43
00:01:32,397 --> 00:01:34,299
and accompanying you to the viewing…

44
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:37,302
I did those things…

45
00:01:37,368 --> 00:01:38,636
because…

46
00:01:39,771 --> 00:01:40,605
I like you.

47
00:01:42,407 --> 00:01:43,408
But more importantly…!

48
00:01:43,474 --> 00:01:44,475
What's more important?

49
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:46,778
We’re talking about Hotaru.

50
00:01:46,844 --> 00:01:47,979
If exposed, you’ll be arrested.

51
00:01:48,046 --> 00:01:48,980
Right.

52
00:01:49,047 --> 00:01:52,116
What if her biological dad
decides to report you?

53
00:01:52,183 --> 00:01:53,117
That’d be bad.

54
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:56,521
You even lied to the police.

55
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:59,557
You told Ms. Matsu
your name was Jin Ichigaya.

56
00:01:59,624 --> 00:02:02,360
That "Genichi Hatano" was a stage name
when you were aiming to be

57
00:02:02,427 --> 00:02:03,261
a musician and stuff.

58
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:04,996
-That part is true.
-What?

59
00:02:05,063 --> 00:02:07,131
I did aim to be a musician.

60
00:02:07,198 --> 00:02:09,233
That's beside the point!

61
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:12,403
Using a fake name is the real problem, no?

62
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,305
Pull yourself together!

63
00:02:14,806 --> 00:02:16,507
Are you still going to act as her parent?

64
00:02:16,574 --> 00:02:18,042
I already signed the contract.

65
00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:19,877
Come on…

66
00:02:19,944 --> 00:02:22,146
What’s this? A strategy meeting?

67
00:02:22,647 --> 00:02:24,816
‎-Got you!
‎-Something like that.

68
00:02:24,882 --> 00:02:26,818
No, it’s not!

69
00:02:26,884 --> 00:02:29,487
He's definitely gonna show up again.

70
00:02:29,554 --> 00:02:31,823
-I’ll keep an eye out too.
-You're fine with this?

71
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:33,358
-Huh?
-You're his accomplice then.

72
00:02:33,424 --> 00:02:34,392
You know…

73
00:02:34,892 --> 00:02:36,694
That's actually kinda cool!

74
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:39,130
What? Come on!

75
00:02:39,197 --> 00:02:41,599
-Okay.
-Your hand.

76
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,568
For Hotaru’s sake,

77
00:02:43,635 --> 00:02:45,837
we’re in this together!

78
00:02:45,903 --> 00:02:47,272
Y-Yeah…

79
00:02:47,972 --> 00:02:49,340
You need to be more enthusiastic!

80
00:02:49,907 --> 00:02:50,975
-One more time.
-Okay.

81
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:53,177
-For Hotaru’s sake,
-For Hotaru’s sake,

82
00:02:53,244 --> 00:02:55,647
-let's do this together!
-let's do this together.

83
00:02:55,713 --> 00:02:56,881
That’s different from just now.

84
00:02:56,948 --> 00:02:58,816
‎-"Let’s do this together."
‎-Again?

85
00:02:58,883 --> 00:03:01,319
‎-Say, "Let’s do this together."
‎-Yes, "Let’s do this together."

86
00:03:01,386 --> 00:03:02,220
TO HOTARU KUSUNOKI

87
00:03:02,287 --> 00:03:03,354
Let's do this together… Got it.

88
00:03:03,988 --> 00:03:06,724
Let's do this together!

89
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,994
-One last time. Now, hold this.
-This?

90
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:11,996
-Give it your all.
-Yes.

91
00:03:12,063 --> 00:03:14,766
Let's do this together!

92
00:03:18,903 --> 00:03:20,505
Wait for me!

93
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:28,613
MAY I ASK A QUESTION?

94
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,649
IF A COMPLETE STRANGER PRETENDS TO BE
A MINOR’S PARENT, IS THAT A CRIME?

95
00:03:31,716 --> 00:03:32,550
IN SOME CASES, THIS MAY BE CONSIDERED
A CRIMINAL OFFENSE

96
00:03:32,617 --> 00:03:33,451
YOU MAY BE CHARGED WITH FORGERY
VIOLATION OF THE CHILD WELFARE ACT

97
00:03:33,518 --> 00:03:34,485
YOUTH PROTECTION LAWS
THE MINOR OFFENSES ACT, ETC.

98
00:03:34,552 --> 00:03:35,953
POSSIBLE APPLICABLE OFFENSES ARE…

99
00:03:38,556 --> 00:03:39,724
Mr. Sakuta.

100
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:40,858
One moment, please.

101
00:03:40,925 --> 00:03:41,826
Yes?

102
00:03:44,495 --> 00:03:45,630
What's the matter?

103
00:03:45,697 --> 00:03:47,498
That man’s been loitering around,
hasn’t he?

104
00:03:52,203 --> 00:03:53,638
Why are you here today?

105
00:03:53,705 --> 00:03:56,207
THIS IS THE REAR GATE. PLEASE USE
MAIN ENTRANCE. NO UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLES

106
00:03:56,274 --> 00:03:58,810
To see my daughter. Is there an issue?

107
00:03:58,876 --> 00:04:01,279
Is this about the money?

108
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,948
She's definitely hiding it.

109
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:07,385
There’s no way my ex-wife
would embezzle money just for herself.

110
00:04:07,452 --> 00:04:08,853
She’s too much of a coward.

111
00:04:09,354 --> 00:04:10,655
If she really did it,

112
00:04:10,722 --> 00:04:12,423
then it had to be for Hotaru.

113
00:04:12,924 --> 00:04:14,959
So, do you know anything about it?

114
00:04:15,026 --> 00:04:16,361
No.

115
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:20,164
What about that man, then?

116
00:04:21,532 --> 00:04:23,735
The fool that's calling himself her dad.

117
00:04:24,736 --> 00:04:26,804
I found out on that day too

118
00:04:26,871 --> 00:04:28,406
that he’s not really her dad.

119
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,714
Could it be

120
00:04:37,448 --> 00:04:38,850
you swing that way too?

121
00:04:40,618 --> 00:04:42,987
That guy is gay, right?

122
00:04:43,054 --> 00:04:45,323
So, I thought maybe
you're in on it with him.

123
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:48,159
Are you going to report him then?

124
00:04:49,327 --> 00:04:50,928
No way.

125
00:04:51,896 --> 00:04:53,431
If he gets arrested,

126
00:04:53,931 --> 00:04:56,000
I have to take care of Hotaru then.

127
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:57,668
Never in hell.

128
00:05:00,605 --> 00:05:01,539
So, you really…

129
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:04,375
All you really care about
is the money, huh?

130
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:06,544
What else could there be?

131
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:08,479
Then could you please stop coming here?

132
00:05:08,546 --> 00:05:10,548
Oh, come on. I'm her dad.

133
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:12,650
She didn’t come to school today.

134
00:05:13,217 --> 00:05:14,252
Please leave.

135
00:05:20,158 --> 00:05:21,159
Thank you!

136
00:05:21,225 --> 00:05:22,193
PARFAIT

137
00:05:31,035 --> 00:05:32,637
-Mr. Hatano!
-Hello.

138
00:05:32,703 --> 00:05:33,771
THE SETTING SUN

139
00:05:33,838 --> 00:05:35,540
I love the parfaits here.

140
00:05:35,606 --> 00:05:36,908
I come every now and then.

141
00:05:36,974 --> 00:05:38,042
SHOPS & REST HOUSE FOOD

142
00:05:38,109 --> 00:05:39,110
Me too.

143
00:05:39,777 --> 00:05:41,412
It’s a treat to myself for doing well.

144
00:05:43,381 --> 00:05:44,782
Um, what's that?

145
00:05:47,952 --> 00:05:50,788
"Love and revolution"…

146
00:05:50,855 --> 00:05:52,557
I was wondering what it meant.

147
00:05:53,391 --> 00:05:55,860
The other day, I just randomly quoted

148
00:05:56,594 --> 00:05:58,429
from 10 Quotes That Touch Your Heart.

149
00:05:58,496 --> 00:06:00,631
It's a short video I came across,

150
00:06:00,698 --> 00:06:02,099
and I just said it to you as-is.

151
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,534
I see now.

152
00:06:03,601 --> 00:06:06,737
At work, I tend to say things
just to look cool.

153
00:06:08,272 --> 00:06:09,507
Sorry about that.

154
00:06:10,241 --> 00:06:11,375
Don't worry about it.

155
00:06:11,876 --> 00:06:13,377
-That's why you're reading that?
-Yes.

156
00:06:13,444 --> 00:06:14,679
For my own learning.

157
00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:15,913
Right.

158
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,782
Have you not read it?

159
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,785
I did a long time ago.

160
00:06:21,752 --> 00:06:22,854
What was it about again?

161
00:06:24,155 --> 00:06:27,458
To put it simply,
it’s like fighting old morals.

162
00:06:28,526 --> 00:06:30,995
I get how the characters feel,

163
00:06:31,062 --> 00:06:32,663
but their actions make no sense.

164
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,233
The heroine's "love and revolution"
basically means

165
00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:37,702
having a child with a married man

166
00:06:37,768 --> 00:06:39,637
and raising it herself.

167
00:06:40,505 --> 00:06:42,139
That’d make headlines these days.

168
00:06:42,206 --> 00:06:43,641
Right?

169
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,978
But…

170
00:06:47,945 --> 00:06:49,847
maybe that's just how things
are meant to be.

171
00:06:49,914 --> 00:06:53,150
Everyone has their own
"love and revolution", I guess?

172
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:55,553
Really?

173
00:06:56,921 --> 00:06:59,924
How’s your "love and revolution" going,
Mr. Hatano? Any progress?

174
00:07:00,558 --> 00:07:03,594
-I guess so?
-What?

175
00:07:03,661 --> 00:07:04,762
I confessed my love.

176
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:05,763
Really?

177
00:07:07,098 --> 00:07:10,668
He doesn’t seem
all that interested, though.

178
00:07:10,735 --> 00:07:13,204
Then make him interested.

179
00:07:13,271 --> 00:07:14,305
How?

180
00:07:14,372 --> 00:07:16,107
Convince him it’s fate.

181
00:07:18,476 --> 00:07:21,746
We met at the agency,
then again at the park?

182
00:07:22,713 --> 00:07:24,348
That's all fate, right?

183
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,417
Wait, both of us?

184
00:07:27,118 --> 00:07:28,219
Something like that!

185
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,755
-Right.
-Yeah.

186
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:36,594
Is that also some kind of quote
or something?

187
00:07:36,661 --> 00:07:37,495
Oh, no.

188
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:41,198
This is from a book called
100 Foolproof Love Techniques.

189
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:45,369
Don’t you think
the number of fences increased?

190
00:07:46,504 --> 00:07:47,538
Did it?

191
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,708
It used to only go this far.

192
00:07:51,776 --> 00:07:53,511
Now that you mention it…

193
00:07:54,011 --> 00:07:55,279
What if they keep adding more,

194
00:07:55,346 --> 00:07:57,481
and there's nowhere left for us to go?

195
00:07:57,548 --> 00:07:58,816
Even fill the roads with fences?

196
00:07:59,317 --> 00:08:00,818
Like all over the place.

197
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,219
What do we do if we're surrounded?

198
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:04,789
Coming.

199
00:08:06,057 --> 00:08:07,425
-What's wrong?
-Just for a bit.

200
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,161
Could it be your dad came again?

201
00:08:10,227 --> 00:08:12,496
Nope, he didn't.

202
00:08:12,563 --> 00:08:14,031
Then you must be hungry.

203
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:15,433
Oh, before I forget.

204
00:08:19,337 --> 00:08:21,272
Here. A spare key.

205
00:08:22,073 --> 00:08:23,808
Just in case your dad shows up again.

206
00:08:24,508 --> 00:08:25,810
Or, you know,

207
00:08:25,876 --> 00:08:26,944
if you ever get hungry,

208
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:29,380
feel free to grab anything
from the fridge.

209
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:34,885
Then…

210
00:08:35,586 --> 00:08:37,788
I’ll water the plants in return.

211
00:08:38,923 --> 00:08:39,824
Thank you.

212
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:46,998
Did Mr. Sakuta agree to help too?

213
00:08:47,064 --> 00:08:47,898
What?

214
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,201
You two talked about it yesterday, right?

215
00:08:51,002 --> 00:08:52,803
I didn’t say it outright,

216
00:08:53,304 --> 00:08:56,240
but I feel like Sakuta would understand.

217
00:08:58,142 --> 00:09:00,645
It's easier for me
if I think positively anyway.

218
00:09:01,946 --> 00:09:03,981
-Thinking positively, you say?
-Yeah.

219
00:09:06,384 --> 00:09:08,686
I’m starting the laundry first,

220
00:09:08,753 --> 00:09:10,588
so you'd have to wait
before dinner is ready.

221
00:09:11,622 --> 00:09:12,456
Okay.

222
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:27,805
Yes?

223
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,243
Now? I'm doing laundry…

224
00:09:33,077 --> 00:09:33,911
Sorry about this.

225
00:09:34,745 --> 00:09:36,380
No, it's fine.

226
00:09:36,447 --> 00:09:38,382
Did her dad come by again, by any chance?

227
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:39,950
No.

228
00:09:40,017 --> 00:09:42,319
He came to the school today.

229
00:09:42,386 --> 00:09:44,221
What happened then?

230
00:09:44,288 --> 00:09:47,491
-I told him Hotaru was absent and he left.
-Okay.

231
00:09:47,558 --> 00:09:49,727
She's his daughter, and yet that guy

232
00:09:50,227 --> 00:09:52,396
really doesn’t seem to care about her.

233
00:09:53,831 --> 00:09:55,833
If I were Hotaru, I’d probably
just, you know,

234
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,035
hate everything.

235
00:09:58,536 --> 00:10:00,237
Her mom’s gone somewhere,

236
00:10:00,304 --> 00:10:02,006
and her dad’s like that.

237
00:10:02,873 --> 00:10:03,808
But…

238
00:10:04,308 --> 00:10:06,844
when I was deceived into thinking
you were her dad…

239
00:10:06,911 --> 00:10:08,746
Sorry about that.

240
00:10:08,813 --> 00:10:10,181
To be frank,

241
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:12,616
I did feel you were unreliable.

242
00:10:13,117 --> 00:10:14,418
Still, I was glad.

243
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:18,189
That she had a dad
who was trying his best.

244
00:10:18,255 --> 00:10:20,157
I was really happy for her.

245
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:23,494
So… Well, it may be wrong.

246
00:10:23,561 --> 00:10:25,362
No, it's wrong on all levels.

247
00:10:26,864 --> 00:10:28,299
But for the effort she's putting in,

248
00:10:28,365 --> 00:10:30,234
I'd like to respect it.

249
00:10:30,835 --> 00:10:31,836
Does that mean…

250
00:10:32,336 --> 00:10:34,071
I support you
in pretending to be her parent.

251
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,341
Are you sure that's okay?

252
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:41,078
-What?
-I mean, you're a teacher.

253
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:42,546
If this gets exposed,

254
00:10:43,414 --> 00:10:44,882
wouldn't you be forced to resign?

255
00:10:45,983 --> 00:10:47,485
Well…

256
00:10:48,285 --> 00:10:49,487
I'm fine with that.

257
00:10:50,054 --> 00:10:51,956
I don't even like school to begin with.

258
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,391
And yet you became a teacher?

259
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,861
I wanted to be a teacher
who doesn’t like school.

260
00:10:56,927 --> 00:10:57,895
Wow.

261
00:10:58,763 --> 00:11:01,098
It's weird, right?

262
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:04,335
No, being who you want to be

263
00:11:04,401 --> 00:11:05,236
is impressive.

264
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:09,673
I hated school too.

265
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,608
Hold up.

266
00:11:13,944 --> 00:11:15,780
-Isn’t this fate?
-Huh?

267
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,915
Fate.

268
00:11:18,415 --> 00:11:19,950
-What is?
-Never mind.

269
00:11:20,484 --> 00:11:22,586
It's nothing. Sorry.

270
00:11:23,721 --> 00:11:26,423
Anyway, the next strategy meeting.

271
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,491
I'll be there.

272
00:11:27,558 --> 00:11:28,425
Okay.

273
00:11:31,128 --> 00:11:32,429
Sorry to keep you waiting.

274
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:36,834
What's wrong?

275
00:11:57,188 --> 00:11:59,256
-Hey. Get in.
-What do you want?

276
00:11:59,924 --> 00:12:00,825
-Don't touch me.
-Huh?

277
00:12:00,891 --> 00:12:02,493
Sit tight.

278
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:06,163
Wait, what? Huh?

279
00:12:07,832 --> 00:12:09,033
What in the world?!

280
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:13,671
-It's a kidnapping! Call the police!
-Kidnapping?

281
00:12:13,737 --> 00:12:15,472
But it's her biological dad.

282
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:16,807
Even if we call the police…

283
00:12:16,874 --> 00:12:18,542
I-Is that so?

284
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:20,611
I'm not sure.

285
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,881
What's that?

286
00:12:23,948 --> 00:12:25,182
A letter?

287
00:12:25,716 --> 00:12:27,518
-From Hotaru?
-Did she run away from home?

288
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:28,686
"To Hotaru.

289
00:12:28,752 --> 00:12:30,688
Let's meet at Lakeside Café.

290
00:12:30,754 --> 00:12:31,755
Make sure

291
00:12:31,822 --> 00:12:33,924
to bring the money with you.

292
00:12:34,558 --> 00:12:35,459
From Tomoe Kusunoki."

293
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:37,895
That's Hotaru's mom.

294
00:12:37,962 --> 00:12:39,697
Is it really her, though?

295
00:12:41,098 --> 00:12:42,800
Asking her to bring the money?

296
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,702
It could be the work of her dad.

297
00:12:44,768 --> 00:12:46,971
If that's the case,
then it's unforgivable!

298
00:12:47,037 --> 00:12:49,106
Hotaru thinks it's her mom, right?

299
00:12:49,173 --> 00:12:51,375
But I feel like she’d be able
to see through it.

300
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:52,776
Ah, on the back.

301
00:12:52,843 --> 00:12:53,611
FROM HOTARU KUSUNOKI

302
00:12:55,412 --> 00:12:57,815
"So, I'll be taking the suitcase back.

303
00:12:58,782 --> 00:12:59,950
From Hotaru Kusunoki."

304
00:13:00,551 --> 00:13:01,619
Sorry, make way.

305
00:13:07,224 --> 00:13:08,525
It's gone…

306
00:13:12,563 --> 00:13:14,098
I can go on my own.

307
00:13:14,164 --> 00:13:16,533
It's okay. I'll take you there.

308
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,102
To Lakeside Café.

309
00:13:18,168 --> 00:13:19,436
How did you know about it?

310
00:13:19,503 --> 00:13:21,038
I checked your mailbox.

311
00:13:21,105 --> 00:13:23,974
If she were to contact anyone,
it'd be you.

312
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:27,044
I went ahead and read it.

313
00:13:27,111 --> 00:13:29,513
So, you did have the money
with you all along.

314
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:34,551
MR. SAKUTA

315
00:14:30,174 --> 00:14:31,241
Oh, uh…

316
00:14:31,308 --> 00:14:32,943
-Sorry!
-No, I'm sorry!

317
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,545
I'm really sorry about this!

318
00:14:34,611 --> 00:14:37,081
-Wait, I thought this place was…
-I'm sorry!

319
00:14:37,147 --> 00:14:38,615
-Sorry.
-I'm really sorry!

320
00:14:38,682 --> 00:14:40,851
-What's wrong?
-I'm so sorry!

321
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:44,688
If you just want the money,
why not just grab this and scram?

322
00:14:44,755 --> 00:14:46,490
After I drop you off.

323
00:14:46,557 --> 00:14:47,958
Do you want to see Mom?

324
00:14:48,492 --> 00:14:49,994
Of course not.

325
00:14:50,494 --> 00:14:51,495
Aren't you doing this for the money?

326
00:14:51,562 --> 00:14:54,765
-I am.
-Then I don't get this entire situation.

327
00:14:54,832 --> 00:14:57,601
They don't have a car, right?

328
00:14:57,668 --> 00:14:59,870
-Who, Mom?
-No.

329
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:01,939
My current dad?

330
00:15:03,507 --> 00:15:06,377
Since you probably haven’t been
out anywhere, you're happy, right?

331
00:15:06,944 --> 00:15:10,147
Back when the three of us
used to go out together.

332
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:11,882
Here, both of you can share these.

333
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:12,983
Thank you!

334
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,285
We're not going out on a field trip.

335
00:15:15,352 --> 00:15:17,621
Oh, this is nostalgic!

336
00:15:17,688 --> 00:15:18,989
My parent's home always had this.

337
00:15:19,056 --> 00:15:22,059
Stuff like this
might disappear eventually.

338
00:15:22,126 --> 00:15:24,962
They stopped selling a lot
of these recently, right?

339
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:26,096
Enjoy it while you can.

340
00:15:26,797 --> 00:15:28,599
Thank you. We'll be off now.

341
00:15:28,665 --> 00:15:29,533
INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS

342
00:15:32,136 --> 00:15:34,238
Have a safe trip!

343
00:15:34,304 --> 00:15:35,406
These days,

344
00:15:35,472 --> 00:15:37,474
there’s been a lot of talk
about vacant houses.

345
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:41,512
Our company is actually looking to expand
into that kind of business.

346
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:43,847
Um, you'll be reporting me
to the police, right?

347
00:15:43,914 --> 00:15:44,748
The police?

348
00:15:45,516 --> 00:15:47,317
Ah, you did trespass.

349
00:15:48,118 --> 00:15:49,520
Well, yeah.

350
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,155
You don’t have a home?

351
00:15:51,855 --> 00:15:53,223
It’s complicated.

352
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:57,361
I'm really, really in a pinch.

353
00:15:57,428 --> 00:16:00,364
Please, I’m begging you…
Just don’t report me.

354
00:16:01,498 --> 00:16:03,667
Oh! I’ll give you this in return.

355
00:16:04,468 --> 00:16:06,336
Take whichever ones you like…

356
00:16:06,403 --> 00:16:08,138
Oh, I have oranges too.

357
00:16:08,205 --> 00:16:09,373
And this.

358
00:16:09,873 --> 00:16:12,176
You can take them all if you want.

359
00:16:12,242 --> 00:16:13,077
‎Yeah.

360
00:16:15,345 --> 00:16:16,547
Are you perhaps…

361
00:16:18,816 --> 00:16:19,950
a backpacker?

362
00:16:20,017 --> 00:16:21,018
What?

363
00:16:21,652 --> 00:16:24,922
So, you’re using this place
as a sort of lodging, huh?

364
00:16:25,656 --> 00:16:27,791
-Sorry about this.
-So, how was it living here?

365
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,060
-What?
-Well…

366
00:16:30,127 --> 00:16:32,463
I'm asking because we’re about
to put it on the market.

367
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:34,698
Is there anything you liked about it?

368
00:16:34,765 --> 00:16:37,701
Hmm…

369
00:16:37,768 --> 00:16:39,002
Nothing?

370
00:16:39,503 --> 00:16:40,838
Well…

371
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:45,776
Oh, yes!

372
00:16:48,512 --> 00:16:50,614
You haven’t noticed, right?

373
00:16:51,748 --> 00:16:52,583
Sorry, what?

374
00:16:54,151 --> 00:16:55,152
Never mind.

375
00:16:55,219 --> 00:16:56,820
Here, take your pick.

376
00:17:03,727 --> 00:17:05,395
You've been using that car ever since?

377
00:17:06,396 --> 00:17:07,965
What's wrong with that?

378
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:13,170
Mom said it’s a waste,
with just the three of us.

379
00:17:14,204 --> 00:17:15,372
Did she?

380
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,074
And then the argument started.

381
00:17:19,276 --> 00:17:20,377
Do you like that car?

382
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:24,982
The old commercial they did was awesome.

383
00:17:25,048 --> 00:17:26,617
The husband, wife, kids,

384
00:17:26,683 --> 00:17:29,186
grandparents, even a big dog,

385
00:17:29,253 --> 00:17:30,287
they all go to the beach.

386
00:17:30,354 --> 00:17:32,389
Seeing the whole family goofing around,

387
00:17:32,456 --> 00:17:34,491
the dad just casually
takes off his sunglasses

388
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:36,260
and goes,

389
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,629
"This is a man’s happiness!

390
00:17:39,496 --> 00:17:41,698
A man’s car is this and whatnot."

391
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:45,636
It was a wonderful ad.

392
00:17:46,436 --> 00:17:47,704
Want something to drink?

393
00:17:48,472 --> 00:17:50,107
I'll have some later.

394
00:17:50,174 --> 00:17:51,141
Okay.

395
00:17:56,813 --> 00:17:58,882
-How about some snacks?
-I said later!

396
00:17:58,949 --> 00:18:00,717
Oh, okay.

397
00:18:03,787 --> 00:18:06,423
Fine, I’ll take the jelly.

398
00:18:07,424 --> 00:18:08,325
Sure.

399
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,963
I like these too.

400
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:17,701
-Is this fate?
-Huh?

401
00:18:17,768 --> 00:18:19,436
Sorry. Forget what I said.

402
00:18:19,503 --> 00:18:20,637
Here you go.

403
00:18:21,138 --> 00:18:22,306
Thanks.

404
00:18:25,576 --> 00:18:27,244
-So, Hatano…
-Yes?

405
00:18:27,911 --> 00:18:29,213
How open are you about it?

406
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:31,715
You mean, coming out?

407
00:18:31,782 --> 00:18:32,950
Hotaru’s dad

408
00:18:33,016 --> 00:18:35,052
confronted me and asked,

409
00:18:35,118 --> 00:18:36,620
"You swing that way too?"

410
00:18:38,121 --> 00:18:41,124
That’s because he saw us together.
Sorry about that.

411
00:18:41,191 --> 00:18:43,260
Oh, no. I might’ve mentioned this before,

412
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,462
but I don’t really hide it.

413
00:18:46,096 --> 00:18:49,333
I’m a bit careful at school,
since it'd be a hassle.

414
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,003
But I was wondering
how you handle it, Hatano.

415
00:18:53,737 --> 00:18:56,907
Personally, my family back home knows,

416
00:18:56,974 --> 00:18:58,375
and my best friend…

417
00:18:58,442 --> 00:19:00,544
-The property agent?
-Yes.

418
00:19:00,611 --> 00:19:02,512
And lastly, Hotaru.

419
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:04,348
That's about it.

420
00:19:04,848 --> 00:19:05,782
Well…

421
00:19:06,516 --> 00:19:09,152
If we’re talking about people
I’m close with, that is.

422
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,856
I only tell those I trust.

423
00:19:13,357 --> 00:19:14,191
Okay.

424
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:16,893
Oh, but Yoshida too.

425
00:19:18,462 --> 00:19:19,630
Along with…

426
00:19:19,696 --> 00:19:23,300
Hotaru's dad. It couldn't be helped.

427
00:19:28,238 --> 00:19:29,506
We’ve got time. Let's check it out.

428
00:19:29,573 --> 00:19:30,607
NO PLANS FOR DISCHARGE

429
00:19:30,674 --> 00:19:32,376
It says no water release today.

430
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:35,746
Why does it have to be him?

431
00:19:35,812 --> 00:19:36,680
Huh?

432
00:19:38,348 --> 00:19:39,349
He's gay, right?

433
00:19:40,884 --> 00:19:42,619
You're one to talk.

434
00:19:45,555 --> 00:19:47,724
I realized I was gay
when I touched his beard.

435
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:48,825
Really?

436
00:19:48,892 --> 00:19:50,560
He was my senior from middle school.

437
00:19:50,627 --> 00:19:53,730
When I looked closely,
I noticed he had hair under his chin.

438
00:19:53,797 --> 00:19:57,668
It was just a few,
but it was definitely there.

439
00:19:59,703 --> 00:20:01,438
When I got to touch it,

440
00:20:01,505 --> 00:20:03,373
strangely, my heart raced like crazy.

441
00:20:05,108 --> 00:20:07,611
That’s when I realized,
"Oh, so this is love."

442
00:20:08,812 --> 00:20:12,182
But that senior said he was going
to shave it immediately.

443
00:20:12,249 --> 00:20:14,017
So, before he did, I asked for a strand.

444
00:20:14,084 --> 00:20:14,918
You what?

445
00:20:14,985 --> 00:20:16,953
After that, I would put
that strand by my pillow

446
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,623
when I went to sleep.
I wrapped it in a tissue.

447
00:20:20,257 --> 00:20:23,293
But they thought it was trash
and threw it away.

448
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,829
I was so sad.

449
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,398
It was proof of my first love after all.

450
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:33,503
Of course, I couldn’t confess
to him that I liked him.

451
00:20:34,037 --> 00:20:36,440
For me, that tiny hair

452
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,343
was the only proof that I loved someone.

453
00:20:41,545 --> 00:20:43,246
I cried my eyes out.

454
00:20:43,747 --> 00:20:46,416
I drove every adult around me nuts.

455
00:20:48,952 --> 00:20:50,987
When the strand was gone,

456
00:20:51,488 --> 00:20:55,158
it felt like the part of me
that loved him disappeared too.

457
00:20:55,992 --> 00:20:58,462
But if it was gone,

458
00:20:58,528 --> 00:21:00,197
that also means it existed.

459
00:21:01,832 --> 00:21:04,901
That strand of hair did exist.

460
00:21:06,903 --> 00:21:10,774
And so did that love.

461
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:13,543
Yeah.

462
00:21:14,945 --> 00:21:17,147
What about you, Hatano? Your first love.

463
00:21:18,815 --> 00:21:21,985
There was this kid in middle school too

464
00:21:22,052 --> 00:21:23,954
that I really liked.

465
00:21:24,988 --> 00:21:26,323
I was the same as you.

466
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,892
Couldn’t confess, of course,

467
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:31,228
but we got close as friends.

468
00:21:31,294 --> 00:21:34,398
His name is written as "carp"
and "ascend", pronounced as "Koito".

469
00:21:35,132 --> 00:21:36,500
That's a cute name.

470
00:21:36,566 --> 00:21:37,734
I know, right?

471
00:21:38,702 --> 00:21:42,339
We were always together.
In fact, so much so,

472
00:21:42,406 --> 00:21:44,708
we were teased by our classmates.

473
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:46,710
"I bet you guys are gay!"

474
00:21:46,777 --> 00:21:49,846
I got scared of being found out.

475
00:21:50,347 --> 00:21:51,648
I get how you feel.

476
00:21:52,816 --> 00:21:55,852
So, I joined in and teased Koito about it.

477
00:21:56,353 --> 00:21:57,421
That was how we ended.

478
00:21:58,522 --> 00:21:59,856
Oh…

479
00:21:59,923 --> 00:22:02,325
I hurt the person I loved

480
00:22:03,427 --> 00:22:04,461
and ran away.

481
00:22:04,528 --> 00:22:07,964
My first love and my best friend…

482
00:22:08,498 --> 00:22:11,301
I lost both at once.

483
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:16,840
But the fact they’re gone

484
00:22:18,074 --> 00:22:20,243
means they did exist…

485
00:22:23,713 --> 00:22:24,748
At the very least,

486
00:22:24,815 --> 00:22:27,384
that’s what I want to believe.

487
00:22:31,621 --> 00:22:33,256
One thing I liked…

488
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,793
There’s a kamidana here.

489
00:22:38,094 --> 00:22:40,464
I never felt lonely,

490
00:22:40,964 --> 00:22:43,066
even spending a week alone
in such a big house.

491
00:22:43,133 --> 00:22:46,169
I guess it’s because of this.

492
00:22:46,236 --> 00:22:48,171
Well noted.

493
00:22:49,072 --> 00:22:50,874
The house I used to live in had one too.

494
00:22:51,441 --> 00:22:53,977
Every morning,
I’d pray with my grandmother.

495
00:22:54,044 --> 00:22:56,146
But when she passed away,

496
00:22:56,213 --> 00:22:58,248
the kamidana was thrown out.

497
00:22:58,315 --> 00:23:00,784
That's the norm these days.

498
00:23:00,851 --> 00:23:01,751
Back then,

499
00:23:01,818 --> 00:23:04,287
the security and safety
people used to pray to the gods for

500
00:23:04,354 --> 00:23:06,723
can now be bought with insurance.

501
00:23:08,258 --> 00:23:09,526
It's becoming less common.

502
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,127
Kamidana, that is.

503
00:23:11,628 --> 00:23:14,798
So, they’ll just keep disappearing?

504
00:23:14,865 --> 00:23:18,201
Better burn it into my memory while I can.

505
00:23:19,536 --> 00:23:20,704
Let’s do that.

506
00:23:41,024 --> 00:23:42,025
Take this!

507
00:23:42,726 --> 00:23:43,527
What do you want?

508
00:23:45,095 --> 00:23:46,796
I'm so sorry!

509
00:23:46,863 --> 00:23:48,565
I didn't know you’re with the police.

510
00:23:48,632 --> 00:23:51,801
Good to see you’re security-conscious.

511
00:23:52,402 --> 00:23:53,236
Today, you're here for?

512
00:23:53,303 --> 00:23:56,640
The other day, together
with Hotaru Kusunoki and her dad,

513
00:23:56,706 --> 00:23:58,441
we had a session.

514
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:00,577
Her dad?

515
00:24:00,644 --> 00:24:03,246
Yes, uh… Mr. Jin Ichigaya.

516
00:24:04,481 --> 00:24:06,683
His stage name is Genichi Hatano?

517
00:24:09,486 --> 00:24:11,755
He said he had pursued
a career as a musician.

518
00:24:12,722 --> 00:24:14,057
What is he like?

519
00:24:14,991 --> 00:24:16,092
What do you mean?

520
00:24:17,627 --> 00:24:19,429
He's unusual, isn't he?

521
00:24:19,496 --> 00:24:20,330
Oh, no.

522
00:24:20,397 --> 00:24:24,000
He really comes across as a good dad.

523
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:25,402
Is that right?

524
00:24:28,939 --> 00:24:29,906
Oops.

525
00:24:35,912 --> 00:24:38,014
Have you heard him sing?

526
00:24:38,081 --> 00:24:39,616
Mr. Hatano’s songs.

527
00:24:40,717 --> 00:24:42,619
Oh, yes.

528
00:24:42,686 --> 00:24:44,120
What kind of songs does he sing?

529
00:24:44,187 --> 00:24:46,389
About not having a home,
or something like that.

530
00:24:46,456 --> 00:24:47,457
Does he not have a home?

531
00:24:47,524 --> 00:24:49,426
Uh, well…

532
00:24:49,926 --> 00:24:51,394
He does have a home.

533
00:24:51,895 --> 00:24:53,797
He lives with Hotaru, after all.

534
00:24:54,397 --> 00:24:55,865
Is it a dark song?

535
00:24:57,334 --> 00:24:58,268
No,

536
00:24:58,335 --> 00:25:00,704
it's more on the passionate side, I’d say.

537
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:05,308
-I see.
-Is there a problem?

538
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,210
No, I was just curious.

539
00:25:07,277 --> 00:25:08,278
Okay.

540
00:25:09,212 --> 00:25:10,046
That's good.

541
00:25:11,014 --> 00:25:11,848
What's good?

542
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:14,451
Ah, no, it’s nothing.

543
00:25:14,517 --> 00:25:15,585
Really nothing.

544
00:25:16,086 --> 00:25:17,721
Welcome!

545
00:25:17,787 --> 00:25:21,091
We'll have two sets of dam curry.

546
00:25:21,157 --> 00:25:22,125
Okay, two sets.

547
00:25:22,192 --> 00:25:23,827
-That'd be 2,000 ye--
-What about Mom's?

548
00:25:24,327 --> 00:25:25,962
-What?
-Mom's portion.

549
00:25:28,598 --> 00:25:30,567
Make it three sets of dam curry.

550
00:25:30,634 --> 00:25:32,869
Doesn't it feel nostalgic?

551
00:25:32,936 --> 00:25:35,005
The three of us went out
on drives together.

552
00:25:35,071 --> 00:25:37,607
Until I got carsick, threw up,
and got yelled at.

553
00:25:38,842 --> 00:25:39,776
But oh.

554
00:25:39,843 --> 00:25:42,479
The dam release!
It was so impressive that you--

555
00:25:42,545 --> 00:25:43,747
I was so scared, I cried.

556
00:25:43,813 --> 00:25:44,848
The dam curry.

557
00:25:44,914 --> 00:25:46,449
You were saying how good it was!

558
00:25:46,516 --> 00:25:49,552
I got grumpy midway
and went back to the car early.

559
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:52,522
You and Mom ate the leftover curry
and got so stuffed.

560
00:25:54,557 --> 00:25:56,926
Why do you only remember those parts?

561
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:00,964
What about today? Are you having fun?

562
00:26:02,699 --> 00:26:04,100
Were you trying to make it fun?

563
00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:06,002
I'm better, right?

564
00:26:12,275 --> 00:26:15,011
I handle things like a dad better, right?

565
00:26:15,845 --> 00:26:18,014
I thought you didn’t
want to take care of me.

566
00:26:19,182 --> 00:26:20,150
You're right.

567
00:26:20,216 --> 00:26:21,451
So, why?

568
00:26:21,518 --> 00:26:23,119
I don’t get you, seriously.

569
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,624
But if I don’t do better than him,

570
00:26:27,691 --> 00:26:29,459
I would lose, and that's just not right.

571
00:26:29,526 --> 00:26:31,094
What are you competing for?

572
00:26:35,265 --> 00:26:36,866
You’ve got a new family now,

573
00:26:36,933 --> 00:26:38,968
so just go and be their dad.

574
00:26:40,904 --> 00:26:43,273
That’s long gone.

575
00:26:44,174 --> 00:26:45,608
We divorced.

576
00:26:45,675 --> 00:26:48,511
I lost everything and am totally broke.

577
00:26:52,615 --> 00:26:53,850
What an idiot.

578
00:26:56,152 --> 00:26:57,587
You’re the idiot here!

579
00:26:58,254 --> 00:27:00,090
I'm the one who wrote that letter.

580
00:27:01,925 --> 00:27:04,094
Sorry for the wait!

581
00:27:07,297 --> 00:27:09,332
Just hand it over!

582
00:27:16,873 --> 00:27:19,743
DAM CURRY

583
00:27:24,581 --> 00:27:26,382
What the hell are you doing here?

584
00:27:26,449 --> 00:27:27,817
Please give that back!

585
00:27:27,884 --> 00:27:28,818
It’s not yours!

586
00:27:28,885 --> 00:27:30,153
It’s hers!

587
00:27:30,653 --> 00:27:32,021
Even the teacher is here?

588
00:27:32,088 --> 00:27:33,690
Stop giving me more work!

589
00:27:33,757 --> 00:27:35,191
Let go!

590
00:27:35,258 --> 00:27:36,559
Sakuta!

591
00:27:36,626 --> 00:27:38,128
Please give us three sets of dam curry!

592
00:27:38,194 --> 00:27:39,229
Three? Got it.

593
00:27:39,295 --> 00:27:41,798
-I'm hungry!
-I know, since we walked a lot!

594
00:27:41,865 --> 00:27:44,300
-I can't wait to eat!
-You're really hungry, huh?

595
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:46,035
You love curry.

596
00:27:46,102 --> 00:27:47,470
Dam curry for everyone!

597
00:27:47,537 --> 00:27:48,605
Where are you running to?

598
00:27:50,373 --> 00:27:51,474
A slope?

599
00:27:59,215 --> 00:28:00,350
Wait!

600
00:28:06,156 --> 00:28:07,223
Let go of me!

601
00:28:09,793 --> 00:28:10,660
Got it!

602
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,698
-This is my money!
-You're wrong.

603
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:18,234
It's embezzled money!

604
00:28:18,301 --> 00:28:21,104
Which means it’s not yours either!

605
00:28:21,604 --> 00:28:24,374
Hey, Sakuta! Saku-- Huh?

606
00:28:26,042 --> 00:28:26,943
What's going on?

607
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,745
-Dang it!
-That letter

608
00:28:28,812 --> 00:28:30,747
was written by you, wasn't it?

609
00:28:30,814 --> 00:28:31,915
Such a horrible lie!

610
00:28:32,482 --> 00:28:35,819
You lied too, saying the money
was not with you!

611
00:28:35,885 --> 00:28:38,888
Are you really that desperate for money?

612
00:28:38,955 --> 00:28:40,390
I’m going to start all over!

613
00:28:40,456 --> 00:28:41,357
What?

614
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:43,426
A completely different life!

615
00:28:43,927 --> 00:28:45,128
What do you mean by that?

616
00:28:45,195 --> 00:28:46,496
Different means different, duh!

617
00:28:46,563 --> 00:28:47,664
Huh?

618
00:28:48,164 --> 00:28:50,099
Anyway, just different, you idiot!

619
00:28:50,934 --> 00:28:53,236
-I don’t understand what you’re saying!
-Damn it!

620
00:28:54,737 --> 00:28:56,105
What does a gay guy even know?

621
00:28:58,942 --> 00:29:00,677
You can’t even have kids!

622
00:29:02,645 --> 00:29:05,682
Why would Hotaru want someone like you?

623
00:29:05,748 --> 00:29:07,550
Why does she want a gay guy?

624
00:29:07,617 --> 00:29:09,018
Meanwhile, I'm normal.

625
00:29:09,953 --> 00:29:11,421
And she's my daughter!

626
00:29:12,488 --> 00:29:15,525
And yet I can’t even be a proper dad!

627
00:29:15,592 --> 00:29:17,360
Why can’t I be a man?

628
00:29:17,427 --> 00:29:18,728
It's always like this! Always!

629
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,332
-What, got a problem?
-No.

630
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:23,132
What is it?

631
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:25,268
What's your deal? Move it!

632
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,371
Sakuta!

633
00:29:30,907 --> 00:29:32,575
Okay, nicely done.

634
00:29:41,584 --> 00:29:42,452
Oh, come on!

635
00:29:50,226 --> 00:29:51,361
Sakuta!

636
00:29:52,095 --> 00:29:55,031
Sorry, but I'm leaving the rest to you!

637
00:29:55,565 --> 00:29:56,532
W… Wait…

638
00:30:00,136 --> 00:30:01,471
This can't be happening…

639
00:30:02,205 --> 00:30:03,439
It's coming. Just wait.

640
00:30:03,506 --> 00:30:06,709
-Here you go. Sorry for the wait!
-It's here.

641
00:30:06,776 --> 00:30:08,411
This is the dam curry.

642
00:30:08,478 --> 00:30:10,647
-It really does look like a dam.
-It looks yummy!

643
00:30:10,713 --> 00:30:12,582
-Wow!
-Thank you.

644
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:13,883
Kusunoki…

645
00:30:14,617 --> 00:30:15,818
Hotaru!

646
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,453
Mr. Sakuta.

647
00:30:19,756 --> 00:30:22,191
-Why are you here?
-I came with your dad.

648
00:30:23,826 --> 00:30:25,929
Hatano, I meant.

649
00:30:25,995 --> 00:30:26,896
Uh-huh.

650
00:30:28,364 --> 00:30:29,399
Um…

651
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,503
-Your mom…
-She won't be coming, right?

652
00:30:34,003 --> 00:30:34,837
I know.

653
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:40,376
You may eat it.

654
00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:44,280
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

655
00:30:48,618 --> 00:30:49,519
Here.

656
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,759
-I'm digging in.
-Likewise.

657
00:30:57,894 --> 00:30:59,963
Let's dig in!

658
00:31:02,598 --> 00:31:04,300
Oh, it's so cool!

659
00:31:04,367 --> 00:31:06,035
-It really is!
-Wow.

660
00:31:06,102 --> 00:31:07,303
Amazing!

661
00:31:08,071 --> 00:31:10,440
-That's a big piece.
-Can you eat it?

662
00:31:10,506 --> 00:31:12,809
Am I… eating this the right way?

663
00:31:20,984 --> 00:31:22,785
He’s a terrible dad.

664
00:31:26,756 --> 00:31:28,758
There are so many bad memories.

665
00:31:31,527 --> 00:31:34,263
But there were also memorable ones.

666
00:31:41,371 --> 00:31:43,039
They’re all gone now.

667
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,376
I can't even get to see Mom.

668
00:31:50,013 --> 00:31:51,381
Everything’s gone.

669
00:31:56,052 --> 00:31:58,021
If it’s gone…

670
00:32:00,123 --> 00:32:01,691
that means it once existed.

671
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,461
Well…

672
00:32:06,562 --> 00:32:08,297
That's what Hatano said.

673
00:32:12,268 --> 00:32:13,202
Right.

674
00:32:32,622 --> 00:32:35,725
Thank you for today.

675
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:36,692
Don't worry about it.

676
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:38,494
I got this in return, so…

677
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:40,663
You’re really kind.

678
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,265
You're giving me too much credit.

679
00:32:42,331 --> 00:32:43,533
Thank you.

680
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:46,736
Honestly, it’s just that reporting you
to the police would be a huge hassle.

681
00:32:46,803 --> 00:32:50,006
Besides, I find backpackers
kinda interesting.

682
00:32:51,641 --> 00:32:54,811
For a long time,
I couldn’t really go anywhere.

683
00:32:54,877 --> 00:32:56,245
I was living in Tokyo,

684
00:32:56,312 --> 00:32:59,582
and I'd just go see the nearby dam.
I've been living that kind of life.

685
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:02,585
And, well, it was fine, but…

686
00:33:05,922 --> 00:33:07,657
Never mind. Forget what I said.

687
00:33:07,723 --> 00:33:08,891
Enjoy yourself.

688
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:10,660
And good luck finding a place to stay!

689
00:33:11,394 --> 00:33:13,196
-Thank you.
-Well then.

690
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,304
Thank you for having me.

691
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,271
No, not at all.

692
00:33:22,338 --> 00:33:24,307
-I’ll come again.
-To listen to his songs?

693
00:33:24,373 --> 00:33:25,241
Yes.

694
00:33:25,975 --> 00:33:28,044
No, to check on things.

695
00:33:28,678 --> 00:33:29,779
See you.

696
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:31,414
I'll take my leave.

697
00:33:35,785 --> 00:33:37,553
Are you sure I can
have them all to myself?

698
00:33:38,788 --> 00:33:40,123
Yeah, no need to hesitate.

699
00:33:45,561 --> 00:33:46,863
Where's my dad?

700
00:33:48,564 --> 00:33:49,732
Which one?

701
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:53,035
Both.

702
00:33:53,736 --> 00:33:55,004
I spilled a bit.

703
00:33:56,005 --> 00:33:57,306
It's fine.

704
00:33:57,974 --> 00:33:59,275
Sorry.

705
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:04,013
You good for the restroom?
Need me to stop at a roadside station?

706
00:34:04,514 --> 00:34:05,982
I'm good.

707
00:34:06,949 --> 00:34:10,419
You can't do this. I said no.

708
00:34:10,486 --> 00:34:13,089
Ouch! You're hurting me!

709
00:34:13,156 --> 00:34:14,991
What are you doing?

710
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,394
Damn it!

711
00:34:32,308 --> 00:34:33,142
‎INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS

712
00:34:37,013 --> 00:34:38,347
Were you okay?

713
00:34:40,716 --> 00:34:42,218
Where's Hatano?

714
00:34:42,285 --> 00:34:43,886
He went to retrieve the suitcase.

715
00:34:43,953 --> 00:34:45,188
He left the rest to me, he said.

716
00:34:45,254 --> 00:34:46,923
What? Will he be okay?

717
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,158
He really didn't have to go

718
00:34:49,225 --> 00:34:51,294
that far for just a suitcase.

719
00:34:54,697 --> 00:34:55,965
Wait, what did you just say?

720
00:34:57,833 --> 00:34:58,668
Huh?

721
00:35:02,104 --> 00:35:03,506
Hey!

722
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,474
-Hey, um…
-Sorry.

723
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:07,543
What… Come on!

724
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,711
I'm really sorry, but…

725
00:35:08,778 --> 00:35:10,012
-Will you get off?
-No, sorry.

726
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,148
Hey!

727
00:35:12,682 --> 00:35:13,516
-Get off--
-No.

728
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,984
The money…

729
00:35:15,551 --> 00:35:17,153
What are you going to do with it?

730
00:35:18,487 --> 00:35:19,522
What?

731
00:35:21,057 --> 00:35:22,625
What do you want?

732
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,494
A house, maybe?

733
00:35:25,561 --> 00:35:26,495
Why a house?

734
00:35:26,562 --> 00:35:27,697
Buying a house

735
00:35:28,397 --> 00:35:30,566
and using it as a "clamp"
is my personal goal.

736
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:32,835
A "clamp"?

737
00:35:32,902 --> 00:35:36,305
That's "love and revolution".

738
00:35:36,372 --> 00:35:37,873
You're creeping me out.

739
00:35:38,841 --> 00:35:39,809
Huh?

740
00:35:41,377 --> 00:35:43,679
Are you sure we can just enter?

741
00:35:43,746 --> 00:35:44,914
Yeah.

742
00:35:45,982 --> 00:35:46,949
It should be fine.

743
00:35:48,684 --> 00:35:50,319
Please excuse me.

744
00:36:02,465 --> 00:36:05,401
We're already in Tokyo!
Just get off already!

745
00:36:05,468 --> 00:36:06,736
Never!

746
00:36:06,802 --> 00:36:08,604
Not until I bring this back with me.

747
00:36:08,671 --> 00:36:10,473
This is something precious to her!

748
00:36:15,011 --> 00:36:15,945
What?

749
00:36:16,012 --> 00:36:17,046
Huh?

750
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:20,416
So, you knew?

751
00:36:20,483 --> 00:36:23,286
The letter wasn’t from your mom.

752
00:36:23,352 --> 00:36:25,187
It doesn’t even look like her handwriting.

753
00:36:25,921 --> 00:36:29,058
I wonder who’s really the idiot here.

754
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:31,794
But you went anyway.

755
00:36:31,861 --> 00:36:33,763
I just thought about thinking positively.

756
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:35,431
Thinking positively?

757
00:36:35,498 --> 00:36:37,099
Maybe,

758
00:36:37,166 --> 00:36:38,634
just maybe,

759
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:40,503
Mom will come.

760
00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:41,904
Maybe I’ll get to see her.

761
00:36:41,971 --> 00:36:43,139
So, that's how it is.

762
00:36:43,205 --> 00:36:44,040
Yeah.

763
00:36:51,247 --> 00:36:52,415
Do you wanna go for a walk?

764
00:36:53,149 --> 00:36:55,284
Did it not get to go out for a walk?

765
00:36:55,885 --> 00:36:57,653
Probably…

766
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,607
You did it because you were asked to?

767
00:37:19,608 --> 00:37:20,910
Yes.

768
00:37:20,976 --> 00:37:22,011
To act as her parent?

769
00:37:22,078 --> 00:37:23,813
You must have a screw loose.

770
00:37:23,879 --> 00:37:25,948
I just want to do what I can right now.

771
00:37:26,515 --> 00:37:27,583
Huh?

772
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:30,386
You said

773
00:37:30,453 --> 00:37:32,388
you can't be a proper dad.

774
00:37:33,222 --> 00:37:36,292
Well, I’ve got a lot I can’t do too.

775
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:38,794
To begin with, I’ve failed at more things

776
00:37:38,861 --> 00:37:41,230
than most people. That's what I feel.

777
00:37:42,131 --> 00:37:45,401
So, all I can do is what I'm able
to do every day.

778
00:37:47,536 --> 00:37:48,637
And what do you know?

779
00:37:49,138 --> 00:37:51,907
Things somehow turn out alright.

780
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:54,443
How so?

781
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,344
How should I put it?

782
00:37:56,145 --> 00:37:57,313
It's like being alive…

783
00:37:58,647 --> 00:37:59,849
feels good.

784
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:01,784
What are the things

785
00:38:02,351 --> 00:38:03,419
you're able to do?

786
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,622
Like walking the dog every day.

787
00:38:06,689 --> 00:38:08,157
Do they perhaps remember the route?

788
00:38:08,224 --> 00:38:09,792
-Hello!
-Hello!

789
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:10,726
Smiling and greeting.

790
00:38:10,793 --> 00:38:11,694
Hello.

791
00:38:11,761 --> 00:38:14,497
-The dogs are so cute!
-Go ahead.

792
00:38:14,563 --> 00:38:16,732
Giving way to others.

793
00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:21,203
A grasshopper.

794
00:38:22,171 --> 00:38:23,939
Releasing a bug back into the wild.

795
00:38:25,007 --> 00:38:26,809
Huh? A bug?

796
00:38:26,876 --> 00:38:29,278
It doesn’t have to be anything big.

797
00:38:29,779 --> 00:38:31,213
Just stick to what you can handle.

798
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,916
I recommend it. Little by little,
that’s how you do it.

799
00:38:33,983 --> 00:38:35,084
What?

800
00:38:35,151 --> 00:38:36,485
Everyone has their own

801
00:38:37,153 --> 00:38:38,554
"love and revolution", I guess.

802
00:38:39,655 --> 00:38:41,123
What does that even mean?

803
00:38:44,393 --> 00:38:46,061
Even for a person like me,

804
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,697
is there anything I can do?

805
00:38:49,765 --> 00:38:50,599
Of course!

806
00:38:50,666 --> 00:38:52,067
Will being alive

807
00:38:53,235 --> 00:38:54,069
feel good?

808
00:38:54,737 --> 00:38:56,772
Yeah, totally!

809
00:39:00,242 --> 00:39:01,811
Don’t make it sound so easy!

810
00:39:08,651 --> 00:39:10,052
Ah, wait… Hey!

811
00:39:25,534 --> 00:39:26,669
Hello!

812
00:39:30,706 --> 00:39:32,174
Okay, here.

813
00:39:33,008 --> 00:39:34,743
Here you go.

814
00:39:35,578 --> 00:39:38,113
-This is a souvenir from my business trip.
-Thank you.

815
00:39:39,114 --> 00:39:41,283
I got this as a gift,
but share it with Genichi.

816
00:39:42,384 --> 00:39:45,120
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

817
00:39:45,187 --> 00:39:46,355
Welcome back!

818
00:39:46,856 --> 00:39:49,158
-Welcome back!
-I'm back.

819
00:39:49,225 --> 00:39:50,092
INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS

820
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:51,126
You walked the dogs?

821
00:39:51,193 --> 00:39:52,561
They asked us to.

822
00:39:52,628 --> 00:39:53,963
Thanks.

823
00:39:54,029 --> 00:39:55,397
He returned the suitcase?

824
00:39:55,464 --> 00:39:56,599
Look,

825
00:39:57,266 --> 00:39:59,802
could you please let me know
what's inside beforehand?

826
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:01,437
It was exhausting.

827
00:40:02,238 --> 00:40:04,573
That's why I said I'm taking the suitcase.

828
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,308
Didn't I?

829
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:07,776
Is that what you meant?

830
00:40:08,777 --> 00:40:10,513
How'd you expect me to get it?

831
00:40:13,115 --> 00:40:14,683
Sorry you had to take them out.

832
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,085
Oh, it's okay.

833
00:40:18,821 --> 00:40:20,623
There's a grasshopper on your foot.

834
00:40:23,325 --> 00:40:25,027
It must've followed me from earlier.

835
00:40:25,094 --> 00:40:26,028
What?

836
00:40:26,095 --> 00:40:28,731
It was about to get stepped on,
so I let it back into the grass.

837
00:40:32,735 --> 00:40:34,770
You have a grasshopper on you too.

838
00:40:41,443 --> 00:40:42,912
Isn't this fate?

839
00:40:46,482 --> 00:40:48,183
Yeah, it's fate.

840
00:40:50,419 --> 00:40:51,320
Huh?

841
00:40:53,522 --> 00:40:54,890
What did you just say?

842
00:41:00,029 --> 00:41:01,597
DRIED SALMON

843
00:41:01,664 --> 00:41:04,066
Okay, over here.

844
00:41:04,767 --> 00:41:05,968
Please write your name.

845
00:41:09,972 --> 00:41:12,641
-Do I have to?
-Yes.

846
00:41:14,476 --> 00:41:15,411
Okay.

847
00:41:17,846 --> 00:41:18,714
SAKU SAKUTA

848
00:41:18,781 --> 00:41:22,318
Oh, by the way, I asked the landlord,

849
00:41:22,384 --> 00:41:23,619
and I borrowed an empty unit.

850
00:41:23,686 --> 00:41:25,220
-What?
-Really?

851
00:41:25,287 --> 00:41:26,889
Until I find a new place to move.

852
00:41:26,956 --> 00:41:28,290
Please treat me well.

853
00:41:33,462 --> 00:41:34,296
Okay!

854
00:41:34,363 --> 00:41:39,702
PARTY C - SAKU SAKUTA

855
00:41:42,037 --> 00:41:44,840
The garden shovel

856
00:41:44,907 --> 00:41:47,509
Was wet all day

857
00:41:48,077 --> 00:41:51,213
Then the rain stopped

858
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,383
And I sneezed

859
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,352
After the beep tone,

860
00:41:56,418 --> 00:41:59,154
please leave your name and message.

861
00:41:59,221 --> 00:42:01,090
Hello, Mom?

862
00:42:01,156 --> 00:42:02,424
Hey, Mom.

863
00:42:02,491 --> 00:42:04,426
Remember that time the three of us
went to the dam?

864
00:42:04,493 --> 00:42:05,294
NO PLANS FOR DISCHARGE

865
00:42:05,361 --> 00:42:06,795
On the way back, in the car,

866
00:42:06,862 --> 00:42:09,231
we all sang at the top of our lungs.

867
00:42:09,832 --> 00:42:11,600
I can’t remember what song it was,

868
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:14,069
but I had so much fun.

869
00:42:15,437 --> 00:42:19,274
We’ll probably never
go out together like that…

870
00:42:19,341 --> 00:42:19,942
DAM CURRY

871
00:42:20,009 --> 00:42:22,111
…never eat curry together,
or sing like that ever again.

872
00:42:22,177 --> 00:42:24,913
But that timeline… It really existed.

873
00:42:26,115 --> 00:42:28,817
Someday, tell me more
about your memories, Mom.

874
00:42:29,418 --> 00:42:30,753
Talk to you soon.

875
00:42:36,525 --> 00:42:39,495
The fresh laundry…

876
00:42:39,561 --> 00:42:40,429
Thank you.

877
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:44,099
If you came all this way,
you must've not found a house yet.

878
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:45,367
I think it'll be soon.

879
00:42:45,434 --> 00:42:46,802
Oh yeah?

880
00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:48,370
I thought maybe
you had lingering feelings.

881
00:42:49,038 --> 00:42:52,007
-No, not at all.
-Really?

882
00:42:55,444 --> 00:42:57,880
-Yeah, nope.
-A bit cold, huh?

883
00:42:59,048 --> 00:43:01,216
La la la

884
00:43:01,283 --> 00:43:04,086
A rainbow, a rainbow

885
00:43:04,153 --> 00:43:06,889
Stretched across the sky

886
00:43:06,955 --> 00:43:09,625
And your, your

887
00:43:09,692 --> 00:43:12,494
Mood cleared up too

888
00:43:12,561 --> 00:43:15,497
Surely tomorrow

889
00:43:15,564 --> 00:43:18,267
Will be a clear sky

890
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:21,236
Surely tomorrow

891
00:43:21,303 --> 00:43:24,673
Will be a clear sky

892
00:43:26,075 --> 00:43:28,277
Nacchi!

893
00:43:28,343 --> 00:43:29,445
Hey, what's up?

894
00:43:29,511 --> 00:43:30,846
Hey, Nacchi.

895
00:43:33,115 --> 00:43:34,383
-What are you doing?
-She's crazy.

896
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:35,484
I'm studying.

897
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,385
What?

898
00:43:36,952 --> 00:43:38,654
Koinobori!

899
00:43:38,721 --> 00:43:39,788
-One plus one?
-How do I solve this?

900
00:43:39,855 --> 00:43:41,323
-Which one?
-What's two plus…

901
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:42,424
-This.
-Make yourself at home.

902
00:43:42,491 --> 00:43:44,259
-Okay.
-You can sit wherever.

903
00:43:44,326 --> 00:43:45,661
-Got it.
-Thanks.
