00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,473
<i>Gentle-hearted gay man Genichi Hatano</i>

2
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:08,408
<i>and his partner, Saku Sakuta,</i>

3
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,643
<i>struggles to find a home</i>
<i>to serve as a "clamp."</i>

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,446
<i>Hotaru has finally found a dream</i>
<i>in making guitars,</i>

5
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,582
<i>but their fake relationship</i>
<i>is discovered by the police,</i>

6
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,951
<i>and she’s sent to a child guidance center.</i>

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,487
<i>Meanwhile, Hotaru’s mother, Tomoe,</i>

8
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:23,923
<i>had her bag stolen,</i>
<i>along with all her keychains.</i>

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,925
<i>Her dad, Jin Ichigaya, though,</i>

10
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:28,228
<i>has made off with the 30 million</i>
<i>from Genichi’s apartment.</i>

11
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,665
It’s gone! The 30 million yen…

12
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:34,401
Stop following me!

13
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:35,802
This is a crime!

14
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,704
- You’re gonna get arrested!
- Shut up!

15
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,606
Hey!

16
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:41,574
- Coming through!
- Watch out!

17
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:43,977
Get out of our way!

18
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,013
Huh?

19
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:48,581
Hey!

20
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,517
Where did he go?

21
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,852
Where are you?

22
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,121
Hold it right there!

23
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:00,794
Red means stop.

24
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,430
You seem to be on the run.

25
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:04,831
What?

26
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:08,234
May I check what's inside?

27
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:10,136
No.

28
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,905
- Let me see it.
- I said no!

29
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:14,107
Do you have any sort of ID on you?

30
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,743
I’m not a suspicious person.

31
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,844
Here you go.

32
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,779
JIN ICHIGAYA

33
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:22,115
- Mr. Jin Ichigaya.
- That's right.

34
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,253
And your ex-wife’s name is Tomoe Kusunoki?

35
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:31,491
Your daughter’s name is Hotaru Kusunoki?

36
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:33,226
‪What?

37
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:36,629
If this little one is here,

38
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,298
then he must be the one who did it.

39
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:39,566
He's not picking up.

40
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:40,667
Everything is exposed,

41
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,535
and on top of that,
the 30 million was stolen?

42
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,904
I didn’t lock up properly.
I’m really sorry.

43
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,073
It’s just 30 million yen.
Don’t have to apologize.

44
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,408
"Just"?

45
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,276
The one at fault is my dad.

46
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,312
And the one who embezzled is my mom.

47
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,813
You don’t have to force yourself.

48
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,882
I'm not though.

49
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:56,916
Sorry to interrupt.

50
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:59,452
Did you forget something?

51
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,154
No. Hotaru?

52
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:02,722
Yes?

53
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:04,958
Please come out already.

54
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:07,894
What?

55
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,596
After stopping by here,

56
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,865
I questioned this man.

57
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,766
He goes by the name Jin Ichigaya,

58
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,870
so I thought he might be Hotaru’s dad
and brought him here.

59
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:20,173
He’s not my dad.

60
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,574
He’s a thief.

61
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,675
A thief?

62
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:23,776
No, I'm not!

63
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,478
Please give that back!

64
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,647
What? Does it belong to you, Mr. Sakuta?

65
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,349
Well, uh…

66
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:30,717
It’s mine. Mine. It’s mine!

67
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:31,918
But it's not, right?

68
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,020
In any case, he’s not my dad.

69
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,489
Is that right?

70
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,727
- That’s a shame.
- What?

71
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:44,297
If your real dad were here,
then we won’t need to question you

72
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,332
or report this to the school
or child guidance center.

73
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,233
Really?

74
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,601
- Oh?
- Oh my!

75
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,936
Truly unfortunate.

76
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,177
Looking closely, he is my dad.

77
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,444
Huh?

78
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,412
He's my dad after all.

79
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,147
- What's this all of a sudden?
- Dad!

80
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,615
W-What is it?

81
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,451
Why have you been leaving her
alone all this time?

82
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,253
Hotaru has been living here by herself,

83
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,622
asking strangers to pretend
to be her parents!

84
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,158
- She's the one wh--
- I just didn’t contact him!

85
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,462
Are you willing to take care
of Hotaru from now on?

86
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,198
- Uh…
- Yes.

87
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:19,732
I think he will, right?

88
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,701
Play along, or I’ll tell her you stole it.

89
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,238
What will it be?

90
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,308
I’ll take care of her.

91
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:33,246
As her father,
I’ll properly look after Hotaru.

92
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,915
Are you sure this is okay?

93
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:41,721
Thank you so much for bringing him here.

94
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:44,924
Okay.

95
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,028
- That's great to hear.
- Yes!

96
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:50,897
Yeah, good for her.

97
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,201
What?

98
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,004
Did you two manage to make up?

99
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,474
Ah! Well, yeah.

100
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,778
I’ll consider the situation
resolved for now.

101
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,181
From here on, please look after

102
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,516
Hotaru as her neighbors.

103
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,318
- Okay.
- Okay.

104
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,155
- I’m trusting you on this.
- Thank you.

105
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:17,156
I'll excuse myself.

106
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,132
- After looking closely, you're not my dad.
- Huh?

107
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,734
Please give that back.

108
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,469
- I don't wanna!
- Give it back!

109
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,137
I said no!

110
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,039
Then give me back my rabbit!

111
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,441
Stop aiming for my lower body!

112
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,143
- Stop--
- I'll be taking that from you.

113
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:38,745
Excuse me!

114
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,547
- Yes?
- The 30 million…

115
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,383
The money my mom embezzled.

116
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,352
What happens if the total was returned
without any of it being used?

117
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,388
- Do you have the 30 million with you?
- Oh, no.

118
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,291
Just hypothetically speaking.

119
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,926
I’m not sure of the exact verdict,

120
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,495
but chances of a lighter sentence

121
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:58,298
or a reprieve would likely increase,
I believe.

122
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:59,365
Is that right?

123
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,335
You sure you don’t want me
to call the police?

124
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,569
Yeah.

125
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,306
I’m fine, really.
There's no need for the police.

126
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,107
But your bag…

127
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,877
There wasn’t anything important in it.

128
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:12,345
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

129
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,381
The person who stole them

130
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,685
might be freaking out now
with all the keychains spilling out.

131
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,254
If you're fine with that. Wait here, okay?

132
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:23,723
DRAFT BEER

133
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,091
Here's a little freebie!

134
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,125
Thank you.

135
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,427
Cheer up.

136
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,929
My wallet was in my pocket.

137
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,764
Then you can get home!

138
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,033
Yes.

139
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,937
I’m… going home.

140
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,876
Oh, come on!

141
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,146
- Please give it back!
- It’s not your money!

142
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,748
It’s not yours either!

143
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,516
- Give it back!
- Give it back?

144
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,051
It’s embezzled cash!

145
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,786
- What?
- I was safekeeping it!

146
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,121
So, it’s mine for now!

147
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,389
We guarded it together,

148
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,690
so it’s mine too!

149
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,759
That’s right! We’re in this together!

150
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:00,760
Accomplice?

151
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,028
Why are you so obsessed wi--

152
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,297
Because I can't bear to give them up!

153
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:06,632
A big car…

154
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,634
with my wife and daughter…

155
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:12,238
and my parents and a big dog…
Everyone together at the beach.

156
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:13,740
And by doing this…

157
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,676
Taking off my sunglasses and looking cool…

158
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,779
That’s a man’s happiness!

159
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,118
So, this time…

160
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:26,753
I’m gonna do things right…

161
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,455
Oh, why are you here?

162
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,824
Oh, um… I saw him

163
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,860
running away with the suitcase

164
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,829
and chased him but lost him,
so I came back here,

165
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,364
and well, this is where I am.

166
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,633
I see. Thanks.

167
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,669
So, about this money…

168
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:47,173
You were all hiding the embezzled cash
the entire time?

169
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,508
Well, yeah.

170
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:52,445
If we return it unused,
Mom might not get arrested.

171
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,715
That police officer said so.

172
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:00,920
Are you hungry?

173
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,022
Huh?

174
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,192
Do you have somewhere warm to sleep?

175
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,328
Don't worry. You can stay here tonight.

176
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:12,198
As if I'm gonna stay
in this rundown place!

177
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,666
Good luck sleeping on the streets then.

178
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,435
What?

179
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,670
Here.

180
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,039
Eat up and have some hot tea.

181
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,776
We still haven’t gotten
the money back though.

182
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,012
He’s too cowardly

183
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,280
to actually spend it.

184
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,282
I sure hope that's the case.

185
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:32,385
You’re not calling the police?

186
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,555
- Hey!
- I won't call them, okay?

187
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:39,058
But… Wow.

188
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,762
Pretending to be a parent is already bad,

189
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,330
but hiding embezzled money too?

190
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,332
You guys are absolutely insane.

191
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,266
Sorry.

192
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,973
I'm such a bore, aren't I?

193
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,074
What?

194
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,510
I don’t think I’m in the wrong here.

195
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,079
But still, it’s boring, I guess?

196
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,282
What's gotten into you? Are you alright?

197
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,283
Yeah.

198
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,953
Looking at animals helps.

199
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,855
- Huh?
- When you’re down.

200
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,957
I'm not exactly feeling down, though.

201
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:12,625
Sorry.

202
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,163
I'm taking my leave.

203
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,401
Okay, that’s it for today.

204
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:23,636
- Okay.
- Okay.

205
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:33,946
Right after New Year’s, we have
the final parent teacher meeting.

206
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,983
You’ll be making your final decisions
about your career paths,

207
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,418
so make sure to discuss things
with your guardians.

208
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:40,319
WRITTEN NOTICE

209
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,556
With that said, I’ll hand out the notices.

210
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,332
- What now.
- Want some?

211
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,369
New Year’s soba?

212
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:57,837
It’s still early for that, no?

213
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,405
If you don’t want it, that’s fine.

214
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,341
- I’ll eat it.
- Here you go.

215
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,680
Huh?

216
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,016
What the hell is this? It's all in lumps.

217
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,317
The landlady's handmade soba.

218
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,020
It used to be her hobby.

219
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,690
Camping was also her hobby,
so she has this tent.

220
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,293
She didn’t stick with either though.

221
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,896
Do you want the money that badly?

222
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:24,830
Yeah.

223
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,667
A man’s gotta have heaps of cash.

224
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:42,548
What?

225
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,554
NAKAYOSHI PLAZA

226
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:49,689
Oh, welcome!

227
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,992
Because you said I should look at animals.

228
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:53,893
Ah, right.

229
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,529
It's not that I’m not feeling low, okay!

230
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,331
Got it.

231
00:09:58,397 --> 00:09:59,799
NAKAYOSHI PLAZA

232
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,068
Why does looking at animals help

233
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,536
when I'm feeling low?

234
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,307
Because they all live however they want.

235
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,009
It’s encouraging.

236
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:10,977
Really?

237
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,012
Some run around,

238
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,580
some stay still.

239
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,682
Some stick together,

240
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,184
some play alone.

241
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,586
They are all different, but all cute.

242
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,056
You kind of live
however you want too, Hatano.

243
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,825
What, me?

244
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,427
I wonder how you manage to do that.

245
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,397
Is there something you want to do?

246
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:33,966
I don’t know.

247
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,772
Maybe observe really closely?

248
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,174
Our landlady said that

249
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:45,645
when she draws, if she really observes,
she starts noticing all sorts of things.

250
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,949
So, maybe you should
really observe yourself?

251
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:51,684
And I mean with your eyes.

252
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,687
Really observe, with your very own eyes.

253
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:57,523
Well then.

254
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,463
ANIMALS ILLUSTRATION CONTEST

255
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,732
<i>It’s a joint contest</i>
<i>run by all zoos in Tokyo.</i>

256
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,601
When I gave this to the landlady earlier,

257
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,003
she said she’s aiming for the grand prize!

258
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:13,506
Done.

259
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,809
Should I be going
to the parent-teacher meeting?

260
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,744
The contract lasts until graduation.

261
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:19,879
Well, that's true.

262
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,615
What about your career plans?
Have you decided on what exactly?

263
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:26,152
- Well…
- Come on now…

264
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,622
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back.

265
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,057
I'm back.

266
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,928
- Is that <i>osechi?</i>
- Yeah, I pre-ordered it.

267
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,964
But more importantly, something
even more exciting is coming, right?

268
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,833
Don't get ahead of yourself.

269
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,735
About your house?

270
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,504
After New Year's,
we’re going to the property agency.

271
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,940
Have you decided on the type of house?

272
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,209
One that proves our love has meaning.

273
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,744
We want that kind of house.

274
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,046
One that will serve as a "clamp."

275
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:55,915
A house of "love and revolution."

276
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,050
What kind of house is that?

277
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,252
Somewhere in Tokyo, around this area,

278
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,188
under 55 million yen,

279
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,156
a home we can live long-term,
that retains its value,

280
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,891
is no more than ten years old,

281
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,860
at least 50 square meters,

282
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,895
has proper privacy,

283
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,931
and a neighborhood
we can get along with well.

284
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:13,833
That’s specific.

285
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:18,304
INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS

286
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:27,046
It’s time for the harvest.

287
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,381
Here we go.

288
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,451
Amazing!

289
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:34,720
So, that's…

290
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,491
the happiness a man
is unable to give up on?

291
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:39,725
Why do you care?

292
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,360
It’s cold outside, right?

293
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,429
You can use a room if you want.

294
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,165
After the New Year,
I’ll find a place and move out.

295
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,501
Here, a homemade New Year’s <i>osechi</i>
from the landlady.

296
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,273
GREAT LUCK

297
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,541
Happy New Year.

298
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,644
- Usami. Wanna eat?
- You named it Usami?

299
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,513
What do you guys call it then?

300
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,149
I haven’t thought about it.

301
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:04,183
What about Usamaru?

302
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,918
- Usamaru?
- Usamaru?

303
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,988
Alone…

304
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,390
but not lonely!

305
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,058
GOAL THIS YEAR: ALONE, BUT NOT LONELY!

306
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,226
I can do it.

307
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,132
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year.

308
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:40,419
- The prize money is 300,000 yen?
- Yeah, and I want this.

309
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,621
That's cool.

310
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,123
What are you gonna draw?

311
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,294
- An animal, duh.
- What kind?

312
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,463
Are there animals around here?

313
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,633
Animals, huh.

314
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,843
I see how it is.

315
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:10,049
Observe closely, huh?

316
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,956
As for one that meets all your conditions,

317
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,691
we don’t quite have it right now.

318
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,593
You only have one job!

319
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:21,794
Well…

320
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,365
If you don’t mind paying a bit more…

321
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,266
I do mind.

322
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,068
Or a smaller place?

323
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,903
I said no!

324
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,273
Welcome!

325
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,908
We’ve been expecting you.

326
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:37,610
Please have a seat.

327
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,513
What's with that look?

328
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,618
Please come by again
with updated conditions.

329
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,020
- Sorry for the inconvenience.
- Geez.

330
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,823
Alright. So…

331
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,593
I found a few promising properties.

332
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,062
If you like any,
we can schedule a viewing.

333
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,130
- Okay!
- Please do.

334
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,131
Great.

335
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,734
First, this one.

336
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,668
48 MILLION YEN

337
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,170
Within your budget, 48 million.

338
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,306
Fifty square meters and 2LDK.

339
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,808
Built 55 years ago,
but it's refurbished inside.

340
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,645
A vintage house?

341
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:16,181
I was hoping for something
that could hold its value, you know?

342
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,852
If you want to prioritize asset value…

343
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,087
Here’s another option.

344
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,390
Sixty square meters,
two minutes from the station,

345
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,558
and only ten years old.

346
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,826
Seventy million, though…

347
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,163
For both of you, the monthly repayment

348
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,333
would be around 200,000 yen.

349
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,901
Manageable if you budget carefully.

350
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,170
Sounds good. You two
could handle a modest life.

351
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,806
But life would get pretty tight then, no?

352
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,442
If we want to prioritize budget?

353
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,945
This is a 20-year-old house.

354
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,913
Forty-four point eight million.

355
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,183
- Where is this?
- Saitama prefecture.

356
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,853
It’s going to take a while
to get to work then.

357
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,156
Just commuting alone will wear you out.

358
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:00,059
And it’s 20 years old, huh?

359
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,697
Sorry, I forgot to ask.

360
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,732
What are your priorities?

361
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,600
Longevity? Investment value?

362
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,569
Size? Privacy?

363
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,409
Since we’re buying a house,

364
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,478
I want a good one
that meets our conditions.

365
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,748
Same here. I don’t want
to compromise too much.

366
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,019
Well then, could you all

367
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,988
come with me for a moment?

368
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,760
- Um, how much longer--
- Please don’t move!

369
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,728
Sorry.

370
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,031
- Hello!
- Hello.

371
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:40,532
- Hello.
- Huh?

372
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:41,767
Hello.

373
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,503
- Who are you?
- Our model.

374
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,338
- What model?
- This.

375
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,742
She just happened to be passing by.

376
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,710
- Sorry about this.
- Ah, it’s fine.

377
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:54,413
I just came on my lunch break
to buy some roasted sweet potatoes

378
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,414
and I got scouted.

379
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,449
I scouted her.

380
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,252
Wait, are you even supposed
to draw humans?

381
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,186
ANIMALS ILLUSTRATION CONTEST

382
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,489
Are you a school teacher?

383
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:04,623
Are they your students?

384
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,959
I’m with Nikomado
from the Niko Consultation Desk.

385
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,328
My name is Koito.

386
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,131
We’re all from different schools.

387
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,699
This is the only place we meet.

388
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,067
But we’re really good friends.

389
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,269
You too, Koinobori. Don't you agree?

390
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,038
We're friends?

391
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,172
Are we not?

392
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,475
You're not wrong.

393
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,612
Are you guys keeping up?

394
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,148
Is there a nice property
up ahead or something?

395
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,749
- Are we there yet?
- Hey!

396
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,985
- You've got to be picking on us, no?
- Sorry.

397
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,053
We're almost there.

398
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,356
Nice view!

399
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,425
You're right.

400
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:42,094
I like it here. Sometimes
I come up to take a breather.

401
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,532
See that brown apartment
along the main street?

402
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:47,933
- The huge one?
- Right.

403
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,837
The people living there
stretched their finances

404
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,338
to buy a condo over their budget.

405
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,306
But

406
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,542
the side job they started
to make ends meet

407
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,610
ended up doing better than their main job.

408
00:17:58,677 --> 00:17:59,678
Really?

409
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:03,649
And that house
with the orange roof over there.

410
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,417
It's near a park,

411
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,119
so bugs sometimes get into the rooms,

412
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,954
but in autumn, you can hear the crickets,

413
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,190
and they enjoy the seasonal charm.

414
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,626
That condo over there has thin walls,

415
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,462
but they say it makes them
feel less alone,

416
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:19,198
so they can binge horror movies
even when alone.

417
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,000
Okay?

418
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,469
So, why drag us all the way here?

419
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,839
Because… Listen,

420
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:29,308
I get wanting ideal conditions

421
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,377
and not wanting to compromise.

422
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,214
But giving something up…

423
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:39,351
isn’t always a bad thing.

424
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,919
That's what I wanted to convey.

425
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,124
It's the same with our place.

426
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,227
It’s pretty old,
and honestly, it’s falling apart.

427
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,495
The rooms are cramped,

428
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,498
the washing machine is outside,
and the stairs break too.

429
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,900
Don’t roast that place too hard.

430
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,437
But we get to live with animals,

431
00:18:58,504 --> 00:18:59,371
the landlady is funny,

432
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,840
and I met Hotaru there.

433
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,276
And Sakuta.

434
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,978
Is that our place?

435
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:07,513
What?

436
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,482
Isn't that the complete
opposite direction?

437
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,751
Nah, it’s this way. I'm sure of it.

438
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,621
Okay, done!

439
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,237
I forgot the ring.

440
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:39,912
I see now…

441
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,917
I wanted to take it off all along.

442
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,720
BODYWORK & PAINT

443
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,095
250,400 YEN

444
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,301
Thank you, miss!

445
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,570
- Thanks!
- Thanks!

446
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:05,771
Don’t mention it.

447
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,372
Get home safe!

448
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,774
- Okay!
- Bye!

449
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,042
How awesome are we?

450
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,144
It was fun being a model for them.

451
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:17,316
They’re all pretty much alone
at school and at home.

452
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:19,985
But here, they’re not alone.

453
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:25,357
So, it’s hard telling them not to come
to a place like this.

454
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,230
This… It’s gotten a little cold,
but if you'd like…

455
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,532
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

456
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,000
Just a little something to share.

457
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,242
Welcome back.

458
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,377
I'm back.

459
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:46,979
There, a little something for you.

460
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,018
- Is that a seagull?
- What?

461
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,487
You could tell?

462
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:57,823
What kind of seagull is that?

463
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,559
There are 50 species
of seagulls in the world.

464
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,761
What, that many?

465
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,363
You don't even know that?

466
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,764
Hell, why do you even know that?

467
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,867
Seagulls are a man’s dream.

468
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,070
That's gotta be Jin Ichigaya's dream.

469
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:16,341
I mean, I’ve never heard anyone
say seagulls are a man’s dream.

470
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,777
Jin Ichigaya’s dream?
What’s that even supposed to mean?

471
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:23,682
Hey, sit over there for a sec.

472
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,917
What, why?

473
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,720
What's this about?

474
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,259
Come on…

475
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,532
SHAPING THE SOUNDS OF THE FUTURE

476
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,076
NO EXPERIENCE NEEDED! CRAFTSMEN WANTED

00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,012
CONTACT INFORMATION

478
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,247
ADDRESS: NAGANO PREFECTURE

479
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,356
Alright, let’s make this nice and clean.

480
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,094
How’s the new home?

481
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,064
Are you glad this is your home?

482
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,168
What even is a home?

483
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,570
I don't even know anymore.

484
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,040
What do you think?

485
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,042
- What?
- Huh?

486
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,481
Who's that?

487
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,583
Who knows? At my age,

488
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,018
I’ve seen it all already.

489
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,922
Um, what are you doing here?

490
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,057
CURRENTLY CROWDFUNDING!

491
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,459
I couldn’t go home.

492
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,195
In the end…

493
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:47,532
I didn’t manage to collect
all the keychains.

494
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,837
I was chasing some silly dream,
thinking that if it came true,

495
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:56,108
I could be Hotaru’s mom again.

496
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:58,777
I…

497
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:01,980
clung to that dream like an idiot,
and in the end…

498
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:03,815
I failed.

499
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,551
I'm still…

500
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,354
a useless mom.

501
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:13,558
Maybe…

502
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,560
we might as well

503
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,295
give it all up, together.

504
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,298
What?

505
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,199
Right now,

506
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:23,935
I’m trying to buy a house with my partner,

507
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,938
but finding one that fits
all our conditions is tough.

508
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,675
Just once.

509
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,879
I was thinking maybe we should try
giving up in a positive way.

510
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,448
Want to try it together?

511
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,885
On three… two, one, together.

512
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,189
Whether it's an ideal home
or an ideal mom…

513
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,160
Let’s try giving up for real,
but in a positive way.

514
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,129
How so?

515
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,298
Then maybe

516
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,801
things will turn out better than expected.

517
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:00,639
What do you say?

518
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,012
Hotaru…

519
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:09,347
She is waiting for you.

520
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,083
Please come home to her.

521
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:21,960
We'll be waiting.

522
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,137
Wow, it looks just like him.

523
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,173
Even the worn-out look.

524
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,409
It's like he hasn’t showered in days.

525
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:39,411
It’s winter, so who cares?

526
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,714
But it doesn’t really feel
quite like Jin Ichigaya's dream, you know?

527
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,885
How about this?

528
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,791
What about this?

529
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:59,164
This has gotta be it, right?

530
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,770
Why don't we add one more man catcher?

531
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,442
Got it!

532
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:12,844
What?

533
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,181
Please forgive me!

534
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,049
Why are you running away!

535
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:20,952
Huh?

536
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,692
- What is he doing?
- I wonder…

537
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:30,795
Sorry!

538
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:32,864
I'm sorry!

539
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,735
I have a lot to say…

540
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,171
but welcome back, I guess.

541
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:42,741
Yes.

542
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:45,844
- He's staring at it.
- Right.

543
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:47,512
Yeah.

544
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,158
Didn't I just welcome you back?

545
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,229
- Welcome back!
- Welcome back!

546
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,666
Welcome back.

547
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,239
Remember our promise?

548
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,111
Three, two, one…

549
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,618
You're coming back home?

550
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,421
Yes.

551
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,828
Thank you for…

552
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:38,763
taking care of Hotaru.

553
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:41,299
It’s nothing.

554
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:45,337
I'm…

555
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:47,939
really thankful.

556
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:49,841
Don't mention it.

557
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:58,883
Everyone…

558
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,587
I’m really sorry for…

559
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:04,856
the inconvenience I caused.

560
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:12,263
Welcome home.

561
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,204
I'm back.

562
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:24,843
Miso soup…

563
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,212
There’s some left over from yesterday.

564
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:32,117
I'll have it.

565
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:48,299
Um, Sakuta.

566
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:51,036
What is it?

567
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,972
Can we talk for a moment?

568
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,943
- Let's eat.
- Thank you.

569
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:15,827
It's good.

570
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:18,229
I added in the secret ingredient.

571
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,433
TRUE MIRIN

572
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,835
I went shopping with Mr. Hatano.

573
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:28,473
I didn’t know you had to be 20
to buy true mirin. I was surprised.

574
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,753
I’m sorry…

575
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,528
I'm really…

576
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:53,998
sorry.

577
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,073
In the end…

578
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,811
I couldn’t even collect all the keychains…

579
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,246
Huh?

580
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:10,215
My bag was stolen
and so were the keychains.

581
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,086
And now…

582
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,956
I'm only left with just this.

583
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,324
NARA

584
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,725
I see.

585
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:23,294
With Nagano,

586
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,064
it would’ve been complete.

587
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:30,969
I won’t forgive you.

588
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:33,938
I love you, Mom,

589
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,074
but embezzling,

590
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:39,110
running away by yourself,
and never coming back?

591
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:41,112
I won't forgive you for that.

592
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,116
Just saying, "Have a good day"
every morning,

593
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:49,120
drinking miso soup
while saying, "It's good,"

594
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:53,191
or chatting and laughing before bed
about how our day went.

595
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,962
I’m happy…

596
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:00,932
just with that.

597
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:08,673
Sorry…

598
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:13,878
I'm sorry.

599
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:18,817
I really am…

600
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:28,159
Mom…

601
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:32,430
Your glasses…

602
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,132
You had them, right?

603
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,184
This will soak up all your tears.

604
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:54,452
What is this?

605
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:02,427
About the house…

606
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:04,329
What about it?

607
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:08,800
Maybe we should rethink it
from the beginning.

608
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,869
Why?

609
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:16,341
I realized that rather
than the house itself,

610
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:19,277
how we live together matters more.

611
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,914
Before we talk about
the house being a "clamp."

612
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,483
Is that really coming from you, Hatano?

613
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:30,421
Until now, I was so focused on buying
a house to keep us together.

614
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,624
I had to use the house as a "clamp"…

615
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,659
My head was full of thoughts like that.

616
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:38,897
But I absolutely don’t want to break up.

617
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:39,797
I won’t.

618
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,433
Okay.

619
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:47,872
We’ve already had plenty
of "clamps" in place anyway.

620
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,308
Such as our partnership,

621
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:52,810
the memories we made together,

622
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,680
this place, Inokashira Apartments,

623
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:00,118
and Hotaru.

624
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,053
Those things…

625
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,455
already exist.

626
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:07,258
I agree.

627
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,726
So, to feel at ease for once,

628
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,763
in a positive way…

629
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:13,631
I want to try giving things up.

630
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:17,735
Thank you for the food.

631
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,507
I’ve been thinking about that
for a while now…

632
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:29,147
Mr. Hatano plays the guitar,

633
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,649
and I came to like it
when I saw him do so.

634
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:34,986
So…

635
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,854
I tried making one myself.

636
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:39,090
You made this?

637
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,263
You’re a genius.

638
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:49,968
- You're exaggerating.
- No, really.

639
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:53,438
This is a masterpiece!

640
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:57,875
Are you going to give up
on the keychains, Mom?

641
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:02,680
Okay.

642
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,119
Yes?

643
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:12,023
What do you want?

644
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:16,427
Wait, why do you have that?

645
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,100
Huh?

646
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:26,204
If we just return it as is,
she won’t get arrested, right?

647
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,707
- Are you fine with that?
- Yeah, I’m tired.

648
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,075
I give up.

649
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,946
The car, the money, being a dad, or a man…

650
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,382
It’s all too much.

651
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,052
Somehow, I feel so light!

652
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,056
You didn’t use the money?

653
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,357
Nah.

654
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:47,859
Neither did I…

655
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:50,795
or anyone else.

656
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,800
- Is that how it is?
- Well then.

657
00:33:58,102 --> 00:33:59,137
Wait, Dad!

658
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:03,674
I meant, former dad.

659
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,277
What is it?

660
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:09,313
You too, Mom.

661
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,716
I have…

662
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:13,684
one last request.

663
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:15,787
Good boy…

664
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:19,057
This feels more like home after all,

665
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:20,024
isn't that right?

666
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:24,128
- Um, maybe I shouldn’t be here after all.
- Please stay.

667
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:25,863
Together with me.

668
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,032
Okay.

669
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:30,735
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

670
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:31,969
- Take care on the way out.
- Yes.

671
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,175
Next…

672
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:42,346
<i>What's going on?</i>

673
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:44,415
This is my mom,

674
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,018
former dad,

675
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:49,654
and my dad.

676
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,888
You're not wrong, but…

677
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,023
They’re all my guardians.

678
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:57,228
Okay then, before we get
to the main topic,

679
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:58,930
could you share your plans going forward?

680
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,765
- Right.
- Yes.

681
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:01,833
Uh-huh.

682
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:03,468
YEAR 3 CLASS 4 PARENT-TEACHER MEETING

683
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:06,537
Ma’am, what are your plans?

684
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:10,975
For now, I’m thinking
of turning myself in.

685
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,477
And after that?

686
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,447
I honestly have no idea what will happen.

687
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:19,083
But I did come to realize one thing.

688
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,719
- And what's that?
- Maybe

689
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:26,057
I can live just fine,
even without a dream.

690
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,758
Instead of chasing what I don’t have,

691
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:31,162
if I can cherish what I already have,

692
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,665
maybe that’s all I really need.

693
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,334
What kind of logic is that?

694
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,169
And what about you, sir?

695
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,706
I’m quitting being a dad.

696
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,408
You already did when we divorced.

697
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,910
You've never been a dad.

698
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,011
Details don’t matter.

699
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,447
I've got no money, nothing.

700
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,650
I’m done chasing a man’s dreams.

701
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:55,286
From now on,
I’ll chase Jin Ichigaya’s dream.

702
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,257
- Isn't that right?
- What do you even mean by that?

703
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:01,492
I still don’t really get it…

704
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:04,395
but, for starters, you know? That.

705
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:05,930
- What?
- What do I need to do again?

706
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,665
So that being alive feels good.

707
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,735
Ah, doing things
like smiling and greeting.

708
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:13,771
- Hello!
- Huh?

709
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,839
Like that, right?

710
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,708
- Hello!
- Hello!

711
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:19,477
- Hello!
- Hello!

712
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,179
- Hello.
- Hello!

713
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:22,780
You're doing great!

714
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:23,848
Don't mess with me!

715
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,819
Very well.

716
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,023
And you, Mr. Hatano?

717
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:35,126
Me? Uh, I…

718
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:38,529
want to buy a house
with Mr. Sakuta, someday.

719
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,833
Yeah, someday… Who knows when.

720
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,538
So, he's Hatano’s partner?

721
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,074
Yes, that's me.

722
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,475
So that's how it is.

723
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,078
We met thanks to Hotaru.

724
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,513
Really?

725
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:59,016
Is that right?
Hotaru brought you two together.

726
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:03,788
Well then, let’s get to the main topic.

727
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,191
It's about Hotaru’s career plans.

728
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:09,360
Have you decided on something?

729
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:12,263
I’m going to Nagano.

730
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,531
- Huh?
- What?

731
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:15,132
- Huh?
- Really?

732
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,601
CRAFTSMEN WANTED

733
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,469
I want to make guitars.

734
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,371
I want to work here.

735
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,006
So, you're not going to high school?

736
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,341
I don't know.

737
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:24,742
What do you mean?

738
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,078
In any case, I want to try this out first.

739
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,814
Even if I fail,
even if I end up on my own,

740
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,583
I think I can actually manage somehow.

741
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,652
Because even to a total stranger like me,

742
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,588
there are adults who are kind,
who help you,

743
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:39,624
who understand how you feel,

744
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,126
who care, I learned that.

745
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:44,829
You know,

746
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,298
all of you are completely
ridiculous adults.

747
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:52,570
One committed embezzlement

748
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:55,273
and left their kid alone
for some silly dream.

749
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,607
And here she is now,

750
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:59,577
claiming she can live
even without a dream.

751
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:01,379
One ignored me for years

752
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,648
and only acts like a dad
when it's convenient,

753
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,616
just for him to end up taking in a rabbit.

754
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:08,519
There are also those who might get fired,

755
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:09,987
might even get arrested,

756
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,056
but still pretended to be my parent.

757
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,627
I've come to learn that the world
has all kinds of weird adults.

758
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:20,264
Because of that…

759
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,301
I feel like I can become anything,

760
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,805
and I feel like I’ll be fine on my own.

761
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:33,511
No matter what happens,
I feel like I can pull through.

762
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:37,014
So…

763
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:39,483
To everyone here,

764
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,253
thank you very much.

765
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,725
I…

766
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:50,628
After graduating,

767
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,531
I’m going to Nagano by myself.

768
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,167
Feels a bit lonely, doesn’t it?

769
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,169
It's a bit early to say that.

770
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:02,940
But good for Hotaru, huh?

771
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:05,543
Yes.

772
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:07,411
Good for her.

773
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:11,215
We got called ridiculous adults, huh?

774
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:15,519
- You seem happy about it.
- Yes.

775
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,323
Just because I’m gay,

776
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,825
I’ve been living timidly

777
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:22,960
and held myself back.

778
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,096
And now,

779
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:28,032
getting called ridiculous?
Somehow, that makes me happy.

780
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:31,335
In the past,

781
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,272
I used to imagine

782
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,475
what life would’ve been like

783
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,810
if I weren’t gay.

784
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:42,947
Sakuta,

785
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:46,417
have you ever imagined what life
would be like if you weren’t gay?

786
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,520
Well…

787
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,156
Yeah, I have.

788
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:54,291
And?

789
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,728
I’m not telling.
Why are you asking all of a sudden?

790
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,066
Well, I was just remembering

791
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,436
something Hotaru asked me before.

792
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,139
"Is being gay hard?"

793
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:09,740
"Are you glad you’re gay?"

794
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,176
And what did you say?

795
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:15,413
"I want to believe I am,"

796
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:16,747
was what I said.

797
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:18,249
Okay.

798
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,419
And now…

799
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,422
I think I really am glad.

800
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:26,957
Me too.

801
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:28,759
Glad to hear that.

802
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:33,297
Yeah.

803
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,168
How cute!

804
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:39,403
Next.

805
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,472
- Huh?
- What?

806
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,374
A human?

807
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,709
Seems like it, yeah.

808
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:48,078
Humans indeed.

809
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,113
Another human.

810
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,315
- The same human?
- Looks like it.

811
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:53,017
But they aren't animals, right?

812
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,252
Well, humans are living creatures, though.

813
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,555
Okay then.

814
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,056
Yeah.

815
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,394
What, another human!

816
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,729
This person seems happy about something.

817
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,664
You're right.

818
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:08,899
Something good must've happened.

819
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:12,870
Yet another human.

820
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:16,207
- But there's a rabbit.
- Two…

821
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:18,008
living creatures then.

822
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,424
"I’m off to chase

823
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,125
Jin Ichigaya’s dream."

824
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:39,263
Make sure not to forget anything.

825
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:43,567
Good luck with the police today.

826
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,837
I might not be able to return for a while,

827
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,508
but I’ll cook meals
and put them in the fridge.

828
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:52,009
See you.

829
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:52,910
You too, Hotaru.

830
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,012
See you.

831
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:56,881
I’m off.

832
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:00,050
Nagano is really far after all.

833
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,720
Will she be okay alone?

834
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:04,455
Will she be eating proper meals?

835
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:07,091
Will she skip school
or walk around late at night?

836
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:12,196
Just thinking about it
makes my chest tight with worry.

837
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:14,598
She's just there
to check things out today.

838
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:16,166
You're right.

839
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:24,675
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION FORM

840
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:25,876
‪The food is ready.

841
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,012
Coming.

842
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,281
I’m ready!

843
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:31,682
- I'll be off now.
- See you.

844
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:32,616
- Bye!
- See you.

845
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:33,517
- See you.
- Then,

846
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:34,418
- I'm counting on you.
- Sure.

847
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:40,090
- Matsumoto City, Nagano Prefecture…
- Okay.

848
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,560
- Sasaga.
- Are you sure?

849
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:44,795
- Yes.
- Take care.

850
