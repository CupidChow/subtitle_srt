3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,475
I like you!

‪PREVIOUSLY ON <i>‪CHOSEN HOME</i>

00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,811
<i>His love interest was fresh off a breakup,</i>

6
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:13,246
<i>a middle school teacher, Saku Sakuta.</i>

7
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:14,981
You seem to be enjoying yourself.

8
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:17,550
<i>Saku’s troublesome student,</i>
<i>Hotaru Kusunoki,</i>

9
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,552
<i>offered 30 million yen</i>
<i>embezzled by her mom,</i>

10
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,454
<i>pleading Genichi to pose as her dad.</i>

11
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:24,891
<i>But when Hotaru’s real dad shows up</i>
<i>for the money…</i>

12
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,126
I'm her dad.

13
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,827
A gay person calling himself
a dad is weird.

14
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:29,696
It's not weird at all!

15
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:32,399
I borrowed an empty unit.

16
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:34,300
I support you
in pretending to be her parent.

17
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,570
<i>Now, with Saku drawn into the fake family,</i>

18
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,339
<i>Genichi’s love life takes off!</i>

19
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:41,908
Convince him it’s fate.

20
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,510
<i>Yeah, it's fate.</i>

21
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:46,546
<i>Meanwhile, Hotaru’s mother, Tomoe,</i>

00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:52,452
We're distributing free samples!

00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,721
‪Please take your time
‪and move forward in line.

26
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,156
Here you go.

27
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,028
Do you know it tastes better
if you add true mirin?

28
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:05,098
To miso soup. It makes the flavor milder.

29
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,300
I’ll have some ready next time.

30
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:10,003
Really? Thank you so much.

31
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,907
Hey, hey.

32
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,675
is true mirin added in this?

33
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,976
No.

34
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:18,812
Come on. That’s the least you could do!

35
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,349
Is it a trend now?

36
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,553
- Sorry to trouble you with so much stuff.
- No worries.

37
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,856
We’re officially neighbors now.

38
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,525
Guess so.

39
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,295
Um…

40
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,199
If I ever make too much food,
I’ll bring some over.

41
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,202
You sound all too prepared to doing that.

42
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,103
Not at all.

43
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,472
The car is getting cramped,

44
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:48,308
and I want to take my time
finding a new place, hence I moved in.

45
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:49,776
Right.

46
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,578
Once your furniture arrives, I’ll help

47
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:52,745
put it together.

48
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,048
You sure you should be doing that?

49
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,417
- Huh?
- Hotaru.

50
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,286
Her finals start tomorrow.

51
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,231
What do you want?

52
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:14,767
- I heard you’ve got exams coming up.
- Yeah.

53
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,402
Whatever career you decide on,

54
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,037
isn't it better to study for it?

55
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:19,072
I hate tests.

56
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,641
- You still gotta take them.
- Why?

57
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:23,810
For your future.

58
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,778
Do I even have one?

59
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,413
Shall I help you study?

60
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,215
You're annoying.

61
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,097
- You sure I can come in?
- You said you'll help.

62
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,499
- Well then.
- Wait!

63
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,302
Wipe your feet first.

64
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,240
Okay, let’s start with a question.

65
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,643
The test is gonna have stuff
that’s not in the textbook.

66
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:57,610
What?

67
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,546
Your teacher is really mean, huh?

68
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:01,347
It's Mr. Sakuta, though.

69
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,449
I'm sure some of it will be from the book.

70
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,119
- Who knows?
- Okay, next.

71
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,088
"When the Moon passes
between the Earth and the Sun

72
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:11,491
and the Sun is completely hidden
by the Moon,

73
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:15,195
what’s that phenomenon called?"

74
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:16,829
Despair.

75
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,132
Well, it does get dark,

76
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,501
so you may feel that way,

77
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:23,102
but it's called "total solar eclipse".

78
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:27,073
Next question. "The next
total solar eclipse visible in Japan

79
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,742
will be in what year?"

80
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,011
Some ridiculously far-off year.

81
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:36,015
You're right, but the answer is year 2035.

82
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,653
Next. "When one celestial body
revolves around another,

83
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,721
what is it called?"

84
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:42,622
I don't know.

85
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,824
- Revolution.
- Is it getting better?

86
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,326
Hmm? Getting better?

87
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,362
Ah, revolution, as in not changing
for the better,

88
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,064
but in terms of orbiting.

89
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,436
"The motion of a celestial body spinning
around its own axis is called?"

90
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:57,303
Being alive!

91
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,440
That’s fine. I like that answer,

92
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,075
but the answer is rotation, okay?

93
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,444
"In outer space, all stars

94
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,445
are doing what?"

95
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,514
- I don't know anymore!
- Hint is the same as before.

96
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:10,250
- Being alive!
- Rotation.

97
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,388
Sorry for interrupting!

98
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,691
I’ve been practicing photography lately.

99
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,827
Mind being my models for a bit?

100
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,429
Say cheese!

101
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:25,665
There you are.

102
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,834
About the gas supply, Ms. Landlady…

103
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,371
- Perfect, you join in too!
- Yeah.

104
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,506
- What's going on?
- Stand here.

105
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:34,407
‪Yeah.

106
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,378
Okay, say cheese!

107
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,113
Thank you.

108
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:41,781
What's this about?

109
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,583
- You were saying gas supply?
- Yes.

110
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,321
- Come this way.
- Huh?

111
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,933
What, you going somewhere?

112
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,468
- For a bit.
- A bit?

113
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,205
I’ve studied enough. Thanks for your help.

114
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,942
You won’t get into high school
at this rate.

115
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,444
I don’t even know if I’ll go.

116
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,813
- Are you planning to work?
- I don't know.

117
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,748
You can’t just not know!

118
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,417
It’s not my fault.

119
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,185
I really don’t know, that's why.

120
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,620
I don’t know anything!

121
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,727
Well, in a situation like this…

122
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,830
We can't really blame her, huh?

123
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,165
We really can't.

124
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:35,335
That doesn’t make it okay, though.

125
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,136
If only she comes back soon.

126
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:38,971
Her mom, that is.

127
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,507
Even if she does, she’s a criminal!

128
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,142
Maybe she was falsely accused.

129
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,744
You’re way too optimistic.

130
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:45,945
Leave it to me.

131
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,147
In any case, I'm heading out.

132
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,519
T-To where?

133
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,188
COULD WE MEET?

134
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,823
JUST THE TWO OF US

135
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,358
BY TOMOE KUSUNOKI

136
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,360
This is a huge mission…

137
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,730
Welcome!

138
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,439
Which questions
will be on the science test?

139
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:18,144
Let me see… That'd be page fif--
As if that's something to be shared!

140
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,314
Hello!

141
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:22,749
Saku!

142
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:24,550
He's here.

143
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,159
Seriously? No way…

144
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,999
- What's the meaning of this?
- Huh?

145
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,501
You broke up with him, right?

146
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,203
We did. I just thought
more hands would help.

147
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,239
There are plenty of other people…

148
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,007
- Besides, I like it.
- What?

149
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,709
The part where he reads manuals.

150
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,379
- That's a rare breed.
- Right?

151
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,548
Hey, mind giving me a hand with this?

152
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,450
Sure!

153
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,154
It’s been a while.

154
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,289
Are you sure you don't
need disguises or anything?

155
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,992
The news isn’t even featuring it anymore.

156
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,928
What’s the business today?

157
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,097
Welcome.

158
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,301
Have you decided on your order?

159
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,871
- Iced coffee, please.
- Very well.

160
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,176
So, what’s the matter?

161
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,046
I was surprised by the letter.

162
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:31,150
We never really had
a proper conversation before.

163
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,886
I thought it might’ve been meant
for Hotaru by mistake.

164
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:36,823
These…

165
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,926
I want you to give these to Hotaru.

166
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:40,993
These, you mean?

167
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,229
She’ll understand once she sees it.

168
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,400
Did you really do it?

169
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,904
That's why I ran away.

170
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,307
I see. Okay…

171
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:55,942
Got it.

172
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,444
Thank you for waiting.

173
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:02,448
Cream soda and iced coffee.

174
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,050
Please enjoy.

175
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,520
Probably not the best time for this order.

176
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,460
I came here today

177
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,029
to bring you back with me.

178
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,505
At first, I thought you two
would be living together.

179
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,240
I was like, "Wow, that escalated fast."

180
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,908
Are you curious?

181
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,444
Nah, I’m the type

182
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,913
who can go back to being friends
with an ex.

183
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,214
I think Saku is too.

184
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,550
I usually just cut off contact.

185
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:41,387
- Makes sense. No surprise there.
- What do you mean?

186
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,655
- Go a little right.
- Right?

187
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,191
Ah, not that side! People normally go
the opposite way.

188
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,760
Your normal and my normal are different!

189
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,162
When people say right or left
in this situation,

190
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,865
wouldn't the other party assume
it's their right or left?

191
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,967
Then you should've just said so.

192
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,669
Yeah, yeah. My bad.

193
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:57,870
What a grumpy old man.

194
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,573
- Did you just call me old?
- I'm 33 years old.

195
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,575
- You're young.
- See?

196
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,611
That proves you’re the old man.

197
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,613
Could you hurry up, please?

198
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,881
Could you hurry?

199
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,182
Yeah, yeah.

200
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,418
What's this?

201
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:14,887
Buttercream sandwich I reserved.

202
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,155
You really love it, huh?

203
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,724
Don’t you dare eat them!
I waited three months for it!

204
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:19,859
Yeah, yeah.

205
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,863
Alright, first step…

206
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,264
Before that,

207
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,533
aren’t you a little hungry?

208
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,504
You don't want anything to eat?

209
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,972
What about a sandwich?

210
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,942
Being on the run costs money too.

211
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,610
Oh, right.

212
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,246
All the money is with Hotaru.

213
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,347
Yes.

214
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,748
So, it was for Hotaru after all?

215
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,818
You embezzled for Hotaru's sake?

216
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:47,320
No,

217
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,355
that's not it.

218
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:52,892
I did it for myself.

219
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:59,131
- Koinobori.
- What's wrong?

220
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,701
- I don’t get this part.
- Which part?

221
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,637
I'm kinda craving fries.

222
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,239
- Look!
- No way!

223
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,842
A coupon where you can get fries for free!

224
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,111
- Awesome!
- I'm so hungry!

225
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,045
- Let's go now.
- I'm excited!

226
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,347
- Already?
- Yeah, let's go.

227
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,481
Nacchi, you too!

228
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:17,350
Huh?

229
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,051
We're going to get free fries.

230
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,821
I'll pass.

231
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,389
Why don't you join them?

232
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,991
Studying is more important.

233
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,660
Are you going to high school?

234
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,629
- Yeah.
- And after that?

235
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,263
What do you mean?

236
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,432
Let's go, Hotaru!

237
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,805
I wonder why Nacchi
suddenly started studying.

238
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,108
Maybe she wants to be rich?

239
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,310
Wait. Is Nacchi’s family poor?

240
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,311
Not sure.

241
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,381
What's her last name?

242
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,182
I don't know.

243
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,518
What school does she go to?

244
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:53,786
No idea about that too.

245
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:54,754
What, you curious?

246
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,089
I just realized I don’t actually
know anything about her.

247
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,359
Delicious!

248
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,128
This is absolute bliss.

249
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,130
You like it that much?

250
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,265
He used to take me to pizza places a lot.

251
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,101
Ah, that place in Meguro?

252
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,638
We can't go there anymore though.

253
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:13,839
What? Why?

254
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,043
I went there recently with a friend,

255
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,544
who's another gay guy.

256
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,614
We were drinking wine

257
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,049
and got carried away.

258
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,652
I think everyone overheard us
talking about our love lives.

259
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:30,923
I did notice people glancing at us,

260
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,892
but then, this guy at the next table goes,

261
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,895
"What are gays doing here?"

262
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:37,496
What the heck?

263
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,332
Maybe he thought we only hung out
in the gay district or something?

264
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,570
Anyway, everyone else was staring too,

265
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,206
and I didn’t want to cause
any more trouble, so we left.

266
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:51,143
After that, we couldn’t go back there.

267
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,845
You don’t get stuff like that?

268
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:56,215
Not so blatant lately,

269
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,984
but yeah, that happened a lot
back in the day.

270
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,154
"Gay people are contagious!" and such.

271
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,758
Feels like, from way back then until now,

272
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,860
people have just been looking down on us.

273
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:11,297
I realized I was being looked down on.

274
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,364
By who?

275
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,667
Society as a whole, I guess?

276
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,868
That's a grand picture.

277
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,037
Back when I was job hunting,

278
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,939
it was the employment ice age.

279
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,275
I really, truly had no job prospects.

280
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,077
No matter how big the company was,

281
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,546
it seemed like they were only hiring
two or three people

282
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:28,914
as full-time employees.

283
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,082
I mean,

284
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,184
who could even pass?
It just felt impossible.

285
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,320
Those were rough times.

286
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,688
I ended up as a contract staff

287
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,290
doing accounting.

288
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:41,427
- The same company the entire time?
- Yes.

289
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,529
You must be really competent.

290
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,632
No, actually, I was pretty much useless.

291
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,068
The reason my contract wasn't terminated

292
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,470
was because I wasn’t "troublesome".

293
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,372
What do you mean?

294
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:57,176
You know how women who oppose
or have a strong sense of justice

295
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,811
are often called "troublesome"?

296
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,747
"This contract clause is weird."

297
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,083
"Can we do something about the pay?"

298
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,718
That’s considered "troublesome".

299
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:10,589
I was just spacing out,
not thinking about anything.

300
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,325
After Hotaru was born,

301
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:14,927
I had even less time to think.

302
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,329
I had to buy the discounted tomatoes,

303
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:20,266
check when my points expire, etc.

304
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,867
My head was full of stuff like that.

305
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,738
With the company, I’d just say,
"Okay, okay, got it."

306
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,274
That wasn’t "troublesome" in their books.

307
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,744
That’s probably why
my contract got renewed.

308
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,046
Everyone else who joined at the same time,

309
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:37,516
seniors, juniors, and peers alike,
if they were "troublesome",

310
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,318
they either left or got replaced.

311
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,853
- Welcome.
- A table for one.

312
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,087
Have a seat over there.

313
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,088
Thank you.

314
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,490
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

315
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:48,594
It’s a bit cold, so could you
turn up the heat?

316
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,196
Certainly.

317
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,333
She might think I'm "troublesome".

318
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:58,604
I was cold too, so I’m glad
you said something.

319
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,672
Thanks.

320
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,275
Sorry, I just kind of

321
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,044
let it all out.

322
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:06,879
You’d been holding it in?

323
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,517
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

324
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:15,988
Do you have anything with a bit of a kick?

325
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,189
I want to be pumped.

326
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,792
So… Where was I again?

327
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,927
Why did you do it?

328
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,667
A year ago,

329
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,570
a young man joined as a contract staff,

330
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,506
and he became a full-time employee.

331
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:39,478
Something neither the other women
nor I could achieve, even after decades.

332
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,380
And he did it in just one year.

333
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,381
Why was that?

334
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,583
Exactly!

335
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,385
Why, right?

336
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:50,489
I couldn’t keep from being
"troublesome" any longer,

337
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,657
so I asked for the reason.

338
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,261
And that was "15 minutes".

339
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,495
Huh?

340
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,098
That person

341
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:02,234
came in 15 minutes earlier
than me every morning

342
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,303
and left 15 minutes later than me.

343
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,239
His dedication was evaluated.

344
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,509
- What?
- I was like, "What the hell?"

345
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,347
And if "15 minutes"…

346
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,083
If that was truly the reason…

347
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,319
My extra 15 minutes in the morning was for

348
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,289
those idiots who said things like,
"Looking pretty is part of your job,"

349
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:24,823
so I had to put on foundation.

350
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,558
The 15 minutes I left early…

351
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,194
were for Hotaru.

352
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,030
I had to make her meals.

353
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,133
So, the young man

354
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,035
was wearing makeup?

355
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,103
Was he told to look pretty?

356
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:41,440
Did he have kids?

357
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,708
Did he have to do housework?

358
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,110
I figured.

359
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:48,480
Most men probably wouldn’t understand
what those 15 minutes mean.

360
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,115
That’s when I realized…

361
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,186
I’d been looked down on
just because I’m a woman, all along.

362
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,022
Once I got bothered about one matter,

363
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,791
I started noticing everything.

364
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:02,227
When I looked into it using my decades
of accounting experience,

365
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,863
there was a wage gap
between men and women.

366
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,032
Five hundred and four yen per hour.

367
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,801
As for why there was a difference,

368
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,437
there was no proper reason for it.

369
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:16,909
Contract roles were mostly filled
by women to begin with.

370
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,811
Even women who had been
full-time employees

371
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:21,213
and left due to marriage or pregnancy

372
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,216
couldn’t return as full-timers,
and they ended up working temp jobs.

373
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:25,818
At the end of the day,

374
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:30,055
if you have kids,
your schedule couldn’t be flexible,

375
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,991
and that was frowned upon too.

376
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,226
But none of this was our fault.

377
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,763
So, I tried calculating it.

378
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:41,266
The money I didn’t get
because I was a contract staff.

379
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,036
The money I didn’t get
because I was a woman.

380
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:45,771
My money…

381
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:47,673
all added up to…

382
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,310
32,261,570 yen.

383
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,946
Did you embezzle that amount?

384
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,147
No.

385
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,549
Well, yes…

386
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:00,552
But that’s not why I calculated it.

387
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,322
I just thought,
"Wow, that’s how much it comes to."

388
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,524
But I couldn’t do anything about it.

389
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:06,925
Then why?

390
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,861
The career sheet.

391
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,230
- Hotaru's?
- Yes.

392
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:15,401
When she brought it home,

393
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,370
she asked, "Can I go to high school?

394
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:21,073
Is there a cheap one?"

395
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:23,575
I assured her

396
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,780
that for now, we don't have to pay
tuition fees, and there are subsidies,

397
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,548
so she doesn't have to worry.

398
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,216
I just laughed it off.

399
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,152
But somehow…

400
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,054
it stings.

401
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,490
What she wanted to do,

402
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,092
what she liked,

403
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,627
which high school she wanted to go to…

404
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,362
More than those things,

405
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,365
seeing Hotaru worry about money instead

406
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,567
made me feel awful.

407
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:50,836
Then, bam!

408
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,105
Suddenly, the number

409
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:56,341
32,261,570

410
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,511
popped into my head.

411
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,047
And…

412
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,917
I just kinda got furious.

413
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,253
At first,

414
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,623
I took the 170 yen sitting
on my boss’s desk

415
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,492
on a whim.

416
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,128
I didn't get caught.

417
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:18,864
After that,

418
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,065
I couldn’t go back.

419
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,501
Hundred and seventy yen

420
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:25,504
or 32,261,570 yen… It’s all the same!

421
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,507
No, it's not.

422
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,008
I wanted to be

423
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:33,946
the kind of mother who never made
her child worry about money.

424
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,747
I wanted to.

425
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:36,782
I really did.

426
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,518
That was why I stole…

427
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,753
the money.

428
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,924
I did it for myself.

429
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,027
- When?
- Some time in the future.

430
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:50,629
- Future, huh?
- Oh, that's Nacchi.

431
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,265
What? You're right.

432
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,502
"Amazingly sharp"?

433
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,737
RAZOR FOR 199 YEN

434
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:34,606
No, that’s the wrong one!
That goes over here, right?

435
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,874
Okay.

436
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,643
Then, this screw goes here?

437
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,145
- No, both of you are wrong!
- We're both wrong?

438
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,714
How can you both look at the same diagram
and still be lost?

439
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,149
Are you guys seeing different things?

440
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:45,584
Forget it. Hand it over! Ow!

441
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:51,123
Guess that’s the consequence
of not trying to talk it out.

442
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,724
You yanked it too hard.

443
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,394
It’s because you can’t even read
the instructions properly.

444
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,295
It hurts…

445
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:58,664
Here you go.

446
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,332
Thanks.

447
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,535
What is it this time?

448
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:06,305
- My ring is missing.
- What ring?

449
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,472
See?

450
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,741
- Oh, the dummy one.
- Right!

451
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,546
It's not here…

452
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:15,781
Is it in this room?

453
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,717
- Probably.
- There’s always that

454
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:21,453
one person who loses things
in the weirdest ways, no?

455
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,756
Do you usually pretend you're married?

456
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:25,891
Yes.

457
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,960
Well, especially at work.

458
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:31,797
It’s convenient.

459
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,966
It’s an easy sign.

460
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,802
People don’t directly ask,
"Do you have a girlfriend?"

461
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,271
or "Do you plan to get married?"

462
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,673
It's basically
a little transformation tool.

463
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:46,178
- What do you mean?
- You know, like a Rider Belt.

464
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,080
Or a Magic Compact.

465
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,683
An item that lets you be a normal person.

466
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,620
It makes you feel like
you fit in with society.

467
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,656
Maybe that’s why you never really fit in?

468
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,859
- What?
- Because you hide and lie about it,

469
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,261
so nothing ever changes.

470
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:06,865
It’s not like it’s something
we need to publicize.

471
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,468
If all of us just said we're gay
when asked,

472
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:12,437
maybe the world would change,
is what I think sometimes.

473
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,141
To begin with, maybe people don’t know
we’re just everywhere.

474
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,143
That's why prejudice exists, I think.

475
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,079
Because we're often hurt by it
to begin with,

476
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:23,448
so people don’t say anything.

477
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,654
Not here!

478
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:30,889
The ring is gone.

479
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,125
It's a cheap one anyway. No issues.

480
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,027
Thank you.

481
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,628
Let's assemble the bed!

482
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,865
Just from being a woman myself,

483
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,967
I’ve had those "Excuse me?" moments too.

484
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:42,901
Right.

485
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,805
Back in my day, it was the opposite
of your experience, Tomoe.

486
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:49,408
I just happened to be born at a good time.

487
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,276
The economy was booming.

488
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,012
I graduated from a commercial high school

489
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,581
and landed a job at a company
in those huge office buildings.

490
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,785
I was so thrilled. I felt like I was going
to be those stylish office ladies.

491
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,087
That's nice. Full of sparkle.

492
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,557
But then, there were those
training sessions,

493
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,860
and we were separated by gender.

494
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:09,895
Yeah.

495
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:13,498
Men got manuals and classroom learning.

496
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,969
And guess what the women had to do?

497
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:21,573
- What was it?
- On everyone's mugs,

498
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,942
we had to write names. By hand.
One by one.

499
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:25,677
Huh, what?

500
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:28,013
All the mugs were the same white ones.

501
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:34,119
So, "Aoki", "Katsumata",
"Tanaka", "Watanabe",

502
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,387
and so on…

503
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:37,956
That makes no sense at all.

504
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,358
I know, right?

505
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:41,493
They told us, "This is your first task,

506
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,195
so give it your all."

507
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:44,830
Ridiculous.

508
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:48,100
"If young girls write the names

509
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,268
and even remember them too,

510
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,971
it’d motivate the male employees,"

511
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,206
was what the boss said.

512
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:55,974
Disgusting.

513
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,410
Even after that first task,

514
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,545
they said women are just more thoughtful

515
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,013
and kept dumping chores on us.

516
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,116
Being thoughtful or not
depends on the person.

517
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,183
Exactly.

518
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,853
Oh, did you ever get that?

519
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,422
Like, "We’d like
a woman’s perspective on this."

520
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:11,990
That depends on the person too, no?

521
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,325
Exactly!

522
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,928
Guess things haven’t changed much
since my time.

523
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,830
- Right?
- But…

524
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:23,702
I can't say I can fully empathize
with what you've been through.

525
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,376
Thank you for waiting.

526
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:32,811
That's huge!

527
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,279
Please enjoy.

528
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,452
Let's do this!

529
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,693
I quit my job after three months.

530
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,431
It wasn’t the office life I imagined.

531
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:54,933
I wanted to do more meaningful work

532
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,335
and be recognized and praised for it.

533
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:59,104
I wanted to do stuff like that,

534
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:00,205
but I couldn't.

535
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,706
What did you do after quitting?

536
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,708
My parents ran an apartment building.

537
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,777
I helped out there a bit

538
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,479
and spent my time doing what I liked.

539
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:08,680
I see.

540
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:11,550
I had that feeling I had to make
something out of myself,

541
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,085
so I tried doing all sorts of things.

542
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,988
But in the end, I didn’t become anything.

543
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:20,091
No marriage. No kids.

544
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:23,528
You see, my family
had a decent amount of money,

545
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,030
so I could live like that.

546
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,567
I never really held a grudge
against that company

547
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,468
or acted dangerously…

548
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:34,005
or get involved in any crimes. Nothing.

549
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,142
I lived a quiet life.

550
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:40,579
That's why I could never say,
"I totally get you."

551
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,315
And you probably wouldn’t
want to hear it from me.

552
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,985
And one more thing.

553
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:50,422
I felt I had to say this
ever since I got the letter.

554
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,124
- What is it?
- It's about Hotaru.

555
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,996
If I were in your shoes,
I’d never leave her behind.

556
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,799
Even if I had to run,
I’d take her with me.

557
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,869
I think she’s a capable child.

558
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,872
She seems perfectly fine.

559
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,273
But

560
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:12,911
betrayal by the people they trust most…

561
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,713
You can’t let a child experience that.

562
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,349
Even if it means leaving money
behind or not.

563
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:19,985
I understand.

564
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:22,287
No, you don't. That's why
you don't come back, right?

565
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,289
Why do you keep running?

566
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:58,356
This person from the apartment
has been kind to Hotaru,

567
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,458
and this is her teacher.

568
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,894
He's also going to be living with us.

569
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,974
Can't you return?

570
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:22,013
There’s something I absolutely have to do.

571
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,982
Really?

572
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,250
I…

573
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:29,354
In order to become a proper mom
to Hotaru again,

574
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,157
there's something I must do.

575
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:33,825
Hotaru…

576
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:37,596
When she receives these keychains,
she’ll understand.

577
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:40,999
I need more time…

578
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:42,934
Please.

579
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:46,371
Does it have anything to do
with what you have to do?

580
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,772
Just a little longer.

581
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:49,708
I'm begging you.

582
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,577
Really? Just a little more?

583
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,880
- Yes.
- You'd better keep your promise.

584
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:00,285
Or I’ll have the police come.

585
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:03,855
P-Police?

586
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:07,058
They came to the apartment to ask about
things, just in case something happens.

587
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:11,963
I'll keep my promise.

588
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,769
In the meantime, I’ll take care of Hotaru.

589
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,239
Am I your accomplice now?

590
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:24,509
Maybe you are.

591
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,478
This is starting to get exciting.

592
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:30,815
Um…

593
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:34,486
I’ve been wondering
about that for a while.

594
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,688
That.

595
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:43,828
Is she calling us?

596
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,231
Seems like it.

597
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:55,173
- Too late for that now.
- Yeah, I know.

598
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,374
Did you follow me?

599
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:00,211
You want to go to this high school?

600
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:01,946
Well, it’s on my list, I guess.

601
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,983
You really think about your future, huh?

602
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,584
My future…

603
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,254
I don’t really know about that, but…

604
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:14,559
Look! The people walking over there,

605
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,227
the people running over there,

606
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,129
and the people throwing balls over there…

607
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,031
Everyone’s eyebrows are thin, no?

608
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,635
- Huh, eyebrows?
- I want to shave mine.

609
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,437
What's stopping you?

610
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:27,605
Well, my middle school doesn't allow it.

611
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:29,774
Then, I heard a rumor.

612
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,509
High-score schools

613
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,845
and smart companies
let you shave your eyebrows.

614
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:36,781
Their rules are loose.
You're free to do what you want.

615
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:38,583
That’s why you study?

616
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,454
I just want to shave my eyebrows freely
without getting into trouble for it.

617
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,788
That’s the career path I chose.

618
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,293
- Hey!
- Sorry.

619
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:50,829
Is that why you were staring
at that razor?

620
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,398
You saw that?

621
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,600
If I study little by little,

622
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,702
maybe I can get thin eyebrows.

623
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,838
By the time my eyebrows are thin,

624
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,373
my parents and money and stuff
will get better,

625
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,043
and you, Bayashiko, and Myoga,
will be doing great too.

626
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,513
It’d be great if we could all sing,
dance, and have a party.

627
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,981
Wouldn't that be nice?

628
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,382
So…

629
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,185
I’m going to study hard for my tests.

630
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,223
Yay!

631
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,024
We're finally done!

632
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,292
Shall we carry it?

633
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,094
In one, two…

634
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:27,766
How long has it been
since you slept in a bed?

635
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:30,001
About six months.

636
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:32,337
- Aren't you excited?
- You can say that again!

637
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:36,775
Nice and done.

638
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:37,909
Okay!

639
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,611
Good.

640
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:42,747
What's the matter?

641
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:44,783
Something fell.

642
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,851
From where?

643
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:51,356
No idea.

644
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:54,392
Maybe a spare?

645
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,327
Those are in the bags.

646
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:57,929
Uh, whatever.

647
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:00,698
- Won’t it get shaky later?
- Just forget it.

648
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,000
I’m tired.

649
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,872
Isn’t it a perfect substitute
for you-know-what?

650
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,176
- For what?
- Your left ring finger.

651
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,253
Doesn't it look awkward?

652
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,422
Oh, no. An avant-garde design, I’d say.

653
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,057
You think so?

654
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:28,726
You know what? I'll buy myself a ring,
like a normal person.

655
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:29,894
Isn’t that a waste?

656
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:33,231
Years from now, you won’t need it, right?

657
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:34,666
The dummy ring.

658
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:37,936
We'll be in that kind of era?

659
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,938
Will it come that fast?

660
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:42,106
I don't know.

661
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,808
It’ll come one day.

662
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:45,310
I just know it.

663
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,016
I hope you're right.

664
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:03,027
Sorry for making you share a jumbo parfait
with a complete stranger.

665
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:05,597
It’s my first time eating one this big.

666
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:08,733
Same here. It’s amazing.

667
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,235
- It's a first for me too.
- What?

668
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:13,071
I just wanted to psych myself up,
so I ordered it.

669
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:15,273
But there’s no way I could eat this alone.

670
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:20,612
Oh, I'm so sorry!

671
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,981
Sorry!

672
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,617
- Oh, dear me…
- Don't worry about it.

673
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,320
Psyching yourself up
for apartment hunting?

674
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:31,923
Sorry, I didn't mean to see it.

675
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,993
I’m thinking of buying a condo.

676
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,996
So, I’m working hard,

677
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,697
trying my best to save up.

678
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:42,100
That's impressive.

679
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,202
Yes, very respectable.

680
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,105
Today, I was checking out
some condos I’m interested in

681
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:48,172
while walking around.

682
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,841
I see.

683
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:52,110
Huh?

684
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,245
- Isn't this wrong?
- Huh?

685
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:57,148
"Nakano Station, 15 hours away on foot."

686
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,716
They meant minutes, not hours, right?

687
00:31:58,783 --> 00:31:59,817
You're right!

688
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,152
Fifteen hours?

689
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:04,088
I was actually kind of interested
in this place.

690
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:07,358
Well, even if it were true,
it’s not impossible to get there, right?

691
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,060
- Just have to walk.
- Yeah.

692
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,094
If you keep walking.

693
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,132
Assuming you could keep walking, though.

694
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,301
Thank you!

695
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,175
I’m heading home after tossing this.

696
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:30,448
A little something for you.

697
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:31,449
Really?

698
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,151
Just my way of saying thanks for today.

699
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:34,852
I appreciate it.

700
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,323
There’s a pizza place near that shop.

701
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:42,160
It had a pretty long line,
so it might even be better than Meguro's.

702
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:45,630
Thanks.

703
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:47,532
Bye.

704
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,000
Bye.

705
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,370
Are you going to buy a house?

706
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:53,771
- Huh?
- With Saku.

707
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,241
I thought it could become the "clamp".

708
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,276
Clamp?

709
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:01,145
Something for us
so we can be together forever.

710
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:04,649
Well, I know we’re not even dating yet,
so I know it sounds crazy.

711
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,053
Let me know when you buy a house.

712
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,122
Why?

713
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,691
You two have zero talent

714
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,259
for putting together furniture.

715
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:17,061
I’ll come help again.

716
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,397
And eat pizza together again?

717
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:22,600
Yeah. I don’t really order pizza alone.

718
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,204
- Alright.
- Okay, see you.

719
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,172
See you.

720
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:37,582
I'm fine now.
I can manage the rest myself.

721
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:38,950
Don’t you need some of this?

722
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,785
These are just things I don't use anymore.

723
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,653
Doesn’t the room feel too bare

724
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,022
and uncomfortable?

725
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:50,995
‪FIRST LOVE

726
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,096
What's this?

727
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,398
Oh, that's…

728
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,167
Did you make it yourself?

729
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:58,936
Yeah. It was the first song I ever wrote
back in middle school.

730
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,705
I want to hear it.

731
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:04,108
No way… It's too embarrassing.

732
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:05,510
What’s it about?

733
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,246
It’s exactly what it says.

734
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:09,747
A song about first love.

735
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,484
You know I mentioned that guy, Koito?

736
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,721
I liked him so much back in middle school,

737
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:20,792
but when we were
always together as friends

738
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,527
and we were teased for that,

739
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:24,929
I was way too scared of getting caught,

740
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,264
so I went along with it

741
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,300
and said things like,
"Don't touch me, gay!"

742
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:32,904
Fact is though,
I really wanted to touch him.

743
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:33,938
Well,

744
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:37,241
if you ever feel like singing,
I’ll listen anytime.

745
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:38,709
Come on, now.

746
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:40,611
No way.

747
00:34:44,048 --> 00:34:45,650
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back.

748
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,118
You’re late. Where have you been?

749
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,253
Koinobori was helping me with my studies.

750
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,355
- Koinobori?
- Who's that?

751
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,524
Anyway, I’m off to study now.

752
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,496
Middle schoolers sometimes…

753
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:00,098
I just don’t get them.

754
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,208
It came out…

755
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,577
<i>When the Moon passes</i>
<i>between the Earth and the Sun</i>

756
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:15,213
and the Sun is completely hidden
by the Moon,

757
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,048
<i>what’s that phenomenon…?</i>

758
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:21,419
What was it again?

759
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:31,362
END-OF-TERM EXAM
HOTARU KUSUNOKI

760
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,578
Sorry, do you have a moment?

761
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:52,250
- Yes?
- I was supposed to give back the tests,

762
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,185
but Hotaru didn't come to school today.

763
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,086
- What?
- Here.

764
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,222
- Could you pass it to her?
- Okay.

765
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,458
Tell her she did well.

766
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,661
- Did she score well?
- See you.

767
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:07,732
See you.

768
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,607
Is this praiseworthy though?

769
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,575
SECOND-TERM FINALS

770
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:23,981
"When the Moon passes
between the Earth and the Sun…"

771
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:25,116
Wait, isn't this…

772
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,555
DESPAIR, RIDICULOUSLY FAR-OFF YEAR
TO LIVE

773
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:31,756
This is no good then.

774
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,226
"Revolution". Nice.

775
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:44,769
"Despair"?

776
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:46,904
Sure.

777
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:51,042
But "in some ridiculously far-off year",

778
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:54,145
I'm sure things will "get better",

779
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:56,781
so I have to keep "being alive".

780
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:00,551
"Keep going!"

781
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:08,192
"Despair? Sure.

782
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,127
But in some ridiculously far-off year,

783
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:11,862
I'm sure things will get better,

784
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:13,531
so I have to keep being alive."

785
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:15,666
"Keep going!"

786
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,571
Keep it up!

787
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:24,041
KEEP GOING

788
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:30,681
Welcome back.

789
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,184
What do you want?

790
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:38,022
This was entrusted to me by Mr. Sakuta.

791
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:41,459
He said to pass it to you.

792
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,961
Okay, goodnight.

793
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,497
Goodnight.

794
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,175
Can't believe he scribbled on it.

795
00:37:58,242 --> 00:37:59,510
KEEP GOING
YOU DID WELL

THIS IS WHAT I WANTED, WHAT I LOVE
AND WHAT I CHOSE FOR MYSELF

798
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,289
Was I being too loud?

799
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:19,657
No.

800
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:22,793
The dogs were asleep,

801
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,162
so I didn’t want to wake them.

802
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:26,297
Right.

803
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:35,673
Usually…

804
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:38,943
I sing to relieve stress,

805
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:41,512
but I guess even when I’m happy,
I do it too.

806
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,148
Did something happy happen?

807
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,117
Her test.

808
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:49,954
Want to hear it?

809
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,988
Yeah.

810
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:01,699
<i>Today my heart</i>

<i>Hidden away</i>

813

<i>So no one sees</i>

814
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,551
<i>Tomorrow it’ll rest</i>

815
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:24,021
<i>Deep inside my pocket</i>

816
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:30,327

818
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:42,106
<i>I’m sure it’s not love</i>

<i>It can’t be, it’s different</i>
<i>From everyone else.</i>

820
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:51,282
<i>I’m sure it’s not love</i>

821
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:55,753
<i>So I’ll just leave it here and say goodbye</i>

822
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,955

823
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:00,791
<i>please leave your name and message.</i>

<i>Hello, Hotaru?</i>

825
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,862
<i>It's been a while.</i>

826
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,730
<i>I’ve been listening to your voicemails.</i>

827
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,200
<i>Doesn’t feel fair</i>
<i>for only you to reach out,</i>

828
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:13,270
<i>so I thought maybe I’d talk a little</i>
<i>about what’s been going on with me lately.</i>

829
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,073
This has to be a mistake, right?

830
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,441
Oh, sorry about that.

831
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,810
It’s a 15-minute walk, not 15 hours.

832
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:23,647
<i>The other day, I met this young woman</i>
<i>who's planning to buy a condo.</i>

833
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:25,749
Could you tell me
why you’re buying the condo?

834
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,384
I don’t want to be looked down on.

835
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:30,621
I want people to think I’m cool.

836
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,022
‪Oh, no.

837
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,624
That’s not what I meant.

838
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,861
<i>She kind of reminded me of you, Hotaru.</i>

839
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,229
<i>She was working so hard.</i>

840
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:49,139

Is that "First Love"?

850
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:15,966
Yeah. Since I found the tape,

851
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,868
and it’s been a while
since I heard the name.

852
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:18,936
Whose name?

853
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:21,805
Hotaru mentioned the name
Koinobori the other day.

854
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:25,609
Koito's name is written with the kanji
for Koinobori,

855
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:26,877
but read as Koito.

856
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:29,613
Everyone used to call him Koinobori.

857
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,982
I doubt it's really him though.

858
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,584
Aren’t you going to see for yourself?

859
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:36,220
Oh, no. That’d be…

860
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,755
cruel.

861
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,501
You're not a dog, you know?

862
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,271
Don't give me a "shake" or "paw".

863
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,474
Then…

864
00:42:58,676 --> 00:42:59,510
Like this.

865
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:03,981
Okay.

866
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:19,263
I did bring true mirin.

00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,266

Mr. Koi… Koinobori?

869
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,007
It's Koito. It's written as Koinobori,
but read as Koito.

00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,643
Here. That way.

You know,

876
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,668
maybe I should go see him.

877
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:02,206
Koito.

878
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:07,778
Are you seriously…

00:44:07,845 --> 00:44:10,414
saying that in this situation?
