1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,473
- Ready, set, go!
- <i>Gentle-hearted gay man Genichi Hatano</i>

2
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:08,408
<i>and his partner Saku Sakuta</i>

3
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,977
<i>begin searching for a home</i>
<i>to serve as a "clamp".</i>

4
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:13,613
I want to make guitars.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,616
<i>Hotaru finally discovers</i>
<i>something she truly loves.</i>

6
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,819
<i>The trio’s "Parent-Child Contract"</i>
<i>continues.</i>

7
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:21,154
- <i>But then,</i>
- It's a tortoise.

8
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:22,989
- <i>Genichi’s pet tortoise escapes,</i>
- Mr. Hatano?

9
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,891
<i>and when he reports it to the police,</i>

10
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,927
<i>things start to take a sketchy turn.</i>

11
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:32,432
<i>Genichi then ends up</i>
<i>being taken in by the police.</i>

12
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,200
SUGINAMI CENTRAL POLICE

13
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:39,939
This way.

14
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:46,312
First time in a police car?

15
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,347
Yes.

16
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,450
I figured getting you here fast
would be best.

17
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,753
I didn’t expect to come in a police car.

18
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:57,657
The little tortoise looked miserable.

19
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,959
I’m just glad you found it.

20
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:01,428
- This is ridiculous.
- Huh?

21
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:04,597
Picking someone up in a police car?
That just isn't right.

22
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:07,333
- Figured.
- Come on. You were out on patrol anyway.

23
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,036
We’ll get in trouble for this.

24
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:13,073
- Oh, and speaking of which, Mr. Hatano…
- What?

25
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:16,543
You wrote your stage name
on the lost tortoise report, right?

26
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,545
That’ll get you in trouble!

27
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:22,015
Oh, I didn’t even realize.
I usually write my real name,

28
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,017
not my stage name.

29
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,151
What stage name?

30
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:28,054
Mr. Hatano here used to aim
to become a musician

31
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,190
and still goes by that stage name,

32
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,860
which is Genichi Hatano.
His real name is Mr. Jin Ichigaya.

33
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,064
- Ah, you’ve got your ID, right?
- Huh?

34
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,133
You’ll need it when picking up
your tortoise.

35
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,669
I can do the explanation
about your stage name.

36
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:46,506
Oh, no. I know you’re busy, Ms. Matsu.
Really, I'm fine by myself.

37
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,775
Ah, no worries.
It'll be quick anyway. This way.

38
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:53,213
No, no, no. I can do this myself, really.
Thank you. Sorry for the trouble.

39
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,514
What?

40
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,250
I thought he was busted.
Him pretending to be my parent and all.

41
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,119
He just went to pick up his tortoise.

42
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,122
We won't be arrested if caught, right?

43
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,926
"Could be charged
with violation of Child Welfare Act,

44
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:09,696
youth protection law,
local development ordinance,

45
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,432
or Minor Offenses Act."

46
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,668
So, we may become serious criminals?

47
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,973
- Did you manage to pick it up properly?
- Yes.

48
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,275
Thank you. I'll be leaving now.

49
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,946
The person with the tortoise earlier…

50
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:29,149
Ah, yes. Mr. Genichi Hatano.

51
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,084
Was the ID name the same?

52
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,219
- His ID.
- Yes.

53
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,826
I'm back.

54
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,728
Good thing you found it.

55
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,196
It might not be, actually.

56
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,097
Why?

57
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,665
Well…

58
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,433
Ms. Matsu might’ve figured something out.

59
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,770
It's fine. If they find out,
I’ll explain everything.

60
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,506
I’ll beg them to not arrest you,
Mr. Hatano.

61
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:54,741
I'll get arrested?

62
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,744
I’ll appeal to them too
that you're not a criminal.

63
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,778
I'm a criminal?

64
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,780
I’m your accomplice anyway.

65
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,782
- Sakuta…
- Yes?

66
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:04,651
Let's break up.

67
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:06,853
Huh?

68
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,588
Because you're a teacher.

69
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,723
And Hotaru,
you can just blame it all on me.

70
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,225
- No!
- Are you stupid?

71
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:15,061
- That's mean.
- Which of us is being mean here?

72
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,997
Say "let’s break up" one more time,
and we're done for good.

73
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,466
No. I don't want that.

74
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,203
Then I don't want to hear that
from you ever again.

75
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,872
Okay. I'm sorry.

76
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,819
You’re terrible at staking out,
you know, Ms. Matsu?

77
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:40,887
You're in the open.

78
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,990
- Ms. Inokashira.
- Yes?

79
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,325
Were you aware of it?

80
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,559
About what?

81
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:47,961
Genichi Hatano…

82
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,030
He isn’t Hotaru Kusunoki’s father, is he?

83
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:01,074
Lying or hiding information
can lead to charges, just so you know.

84
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:01,975
Okay.

85
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,078
Were you pretending
to be Hotaru’s guardian too?

86
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:05,979
Not at all.

87
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:08,014
You and Mr. Sakuta turned a blind eye

88
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,150
to the fact that Mr. Hatano
was acting as her parent, right?

89
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,885
Yes.

90
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,189
- Did Hotaru give you anything in return?
- No.

91
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,157
Are you in contact with her mom?

92
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:20,126
Yes and no.

93
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,266
Do you know
where the embezzled money went?

94
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:27,800
Yes and no.

95
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,404
Well, if you’re hiding money for her,

96
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,740
that’s definitely a crime.

97
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:34,907
About Hotaru,

98
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:38,244
is there any chance Mr. Hatano
is abusing or threatening her?

99
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:39,579
Not at all.

100
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,447
How can you be so sure?

101
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,349
You can tell just by watching them.

102
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,817
But sometimes you can’t, right?

103
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,820
But first, you’ve got
to actually observe, right?

104
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,590
For example, their eyes can sometimes look

105
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,358
almond-shaped or perfectly round.

106
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,628
Or you may notice that the insides
of their ears and noses are a cute pink.

107
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,563
Even the unexpected things

108
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,499
become clear if you really pay attention.

109
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:01,934
What are you talking about?

110
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,406
It’s about goats.

111
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,473
Why goats?

112
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,909
Oh, right!

113
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,744
Want this? I’ll lend it to you.

114
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,884
Do you think Hatano will get arrested?

115
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,918
Hard to say.

116
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,322
Keep today’s discussion between us.

117
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,257
For legal reasons, you know.

118
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:26,059
Yes and no.

119
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:28,928
<i>You told her everything?</i>

120
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,831
Her pressure was insane. What could I do?

121
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,533
The police really are something.

122
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:34,934
Even about my mom?

123
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,803
I told her "yes and no" for that.

124
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,204
What?

125
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,874
I gave an ambiguous answer
to skate things around.

126
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,311
Don’t let Hatano know about this.

127
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,514
If he finds out, he’ll probably
do something unnecessary.

128
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,317
Leave Ms. Matsu to me, then.

129
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,452
What do you mean?

130
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,254
Aren't you excited?

131
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,622
You mean, for Christmas?

132
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,557
For the reserved cake.

133
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,992
Ah, right. I need to pick it up.

134
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,361
Yeah.

135
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:07,633
How is it?

136
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:09,802
What are you doing here?

137
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,472
- I’m assisting the investigation.
- No, thanks.

138
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,842
- I’ll just talk to them directly.
- Wait!

139
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,510
Observe properly first.

140
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,212
If you do, you’ll understand.

141
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,179
Trust me.

142
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,585
What are they to each other?

143
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,453
Isn’t it obvious from what you see?

144
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,190
- Partners in crime?
- You should go with just what you see.

145
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:33,726
MILK

146
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,095
He grabbed the milk from the front

147
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,231
and put it in the basket.

148
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:41,234
Would a bad person
really take milk from the front?

149
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,516
I hope Koito and his partner made up.

150
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,084
I’m sure they did!

151
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,552
Aren’t you standing really close?

152
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,287
We’re partners, remember?

153
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,389
Well, yeah.

154
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,226
We should think about
that kind of stuff too, you know.

155
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,127
What?

156
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,096
About what to put in a notarized contract.

157
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:13,666
Things like property,
or what happens if we get sick…

158
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,636
Let's leave that to the professionals.

159
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:19,906
More like how Koito and his partner
have their "hard-boiled egg" rule.

160
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,775
For example, "always drink milk
in the morning"?

161
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,177
I drink coffee.

162
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,211
Noted.

163
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,514
Why don’t we try doing a simulation?

164
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,116
A simulation?

165
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,787
Nice!

166
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:35,988
What's your verdict?

167
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:37,390
They’re…

168
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,492
building something?

169
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,361
What are you doing?

170
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:43,262
Yes?

171
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,697
You were staring…

172
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:46,599
at the kids. Am I wrong?

173
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,101
I’m with the police. My name is Matsu.

174
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,270
I’m the landlady, Inokashira.

175
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:55,107
Oh? From that apartment
where I had the roasted sweet potatoes?

176
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,743
- Thank you for coming.
- Don't mention it.

177
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,946
Why are you with the police, landlady?

178
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,647
You are…?

179
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:05,985
I’m with an organization called Nikomado.
My name is Koito.

180
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,053
I see.

181
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,322
- And you know those kids?
- Yeah.

182
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,691
They’re always around.

183
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,494
- Thank you for looking after her.
- Don't mention it.

184
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,996
They’re… handcrafting something.

185
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,698
Not what you expected?

186
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,634
People call them "Toyoko Kids",

187
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:25,238
but of course, there’s no one
actually by that name.

188
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:28,908
Even if they’re in the same place,
they’re all different kids.

189
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:32,912
Naturally, there are also kids
who are just having fun.

190
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,018
I’m heading back for now.

191
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,121
‪If you'd excuse me.

192
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:43,856
See you.

193
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:48,828
RESERVATION SLIP

194
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,163
Have you made any reservations recently?

195
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,833
Recently… No.

196
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,569
- Why not?
- There’s just been too much going on.

197
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,571
Sorry about this.

198
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,505
TOOTHPASTE

199
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,141
Okay then,
for drafting the notarized contract,

200
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:06,145
we’ll start the joint-living simulation.
I appreciate the cooperation.

201
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,079
No problem.

202
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,982
Um, what should we do?

203
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,217
Shall we cook a meal?

204
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,486
Yeah. Then…

205
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,587
- Curry!
- How about stew?

206
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:28,301
KOKUUMA CREAM STEW, KOKUUMA CURRY

207
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,412
You're fine with stew?

208
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,981
I’m older, so I’ll yield to you.

209
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,021
Huh?

210
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,823
Hey!

211
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,359
Stop worrying about your age!

212
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,460
I'm sorry.

213
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:56,062
Good.

214
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,700
We can write "no worrying about age"
on the notarized contract.

215
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,668
There's no need to write that!

216
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,403
I'm sorry.

217
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,072
Good.

218
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,375
What dish is this, exactly?
Does it have a name?

219
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,611
Curry Cream Stew? Cream Stew Curry?

220
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,849
- Let's dig in.
- Yeah.

221
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:24,957
It's delicious!

222
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,971
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

223
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,673
- Sorry for doing this without asking…
- Not at all.

224
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,541
I toasted some bread. Want some?

225
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,143
Yeah, sure.

226
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:59,091
- You drink milk, right?
- Ah, yes.

227
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:02,561
- Wait.
- Huh?

228
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,864
How about a café au lait?

229
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,165
Sounds good.

230
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,601
MILK

231
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,883
Today, let’s try simulating
an actual budget for buying a house

232
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:25,751
and see what we get.

233
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,287
Based on that,
I'll find you appropriate properties.

234
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,321
Okay.

235
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,491
We’re actually doing
a simulation right now too.

236
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,226
- What simulation?
- Our cohabitation life.

237
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,162
Wow, you two are so lovey-dovey!

238
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,930
I’m really happy for you!

239
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,365
I feel like I might cry.

240
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,267
You're being over the top.

241
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,235
Well, we're lovey-dovey, though.

242
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:49,542
Um, could we start the budget simulation?

243
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:51,510
Sorry.

244
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,013
First, you two want a joint loan, yes?

245
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,482
That's right. We want it
in both our names,

246
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,784
so we’re both responsible.

247
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,721
We want to split it evenly too,
and each own the house 50/50.

248
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:05,291
Very well. Then let’s start
with your annual income.

249
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,961
- About 4.5 million.
- 6.5 million yen.

250
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,297
What, really?

251
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,399
I think that's about right.

252
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,467
Ah…

253
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,636
I feel kind of pathetic, you know?

254
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:22,408
Judging someone by how much money
they make is so outdated.

255
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:23,876
I'm sorry.

256
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:27,480
We can write "no grudges over money"
in the notarized contract.

257
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,281
- There's no need for that.
- Okay.

258
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:32,084
By the way, for the loan period,

259
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,853
the maximum age is 80.

260
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,989
Based on Genichi’s age,
we could manage at most…

261
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,424
30 years.

262
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,495
It's all because I'm so old…

263
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,997
Stop worrying about your age!

264
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,666
We should write this
in the notarized contract aft--

265
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,401
- I said no!
- Okay.

266
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,104
- Sorry.
- No worries.

267
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,975
Alright, what about monthly repayments?

268
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,110
Would around 150,000 yen be the limit?

269
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,080
That’s 75,000 yen each.

270
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:04,583
Based on that, a rough estimate
of the maximum loan amount

271
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,318
is 51 million yen.

272
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,154
How much are you thinking
for down payment?

273
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,923
About two million each,
as we discussed the other day.

274
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,593
- Yes.
- So, that adds up to 55 million yen.

275
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,530
Properties around this range
would be appropriate.

276
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,266
- Fifty-five million yen, huh…
- Give me a moment.

277
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,403
Recommendations within your budget…

278
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:25,905
Here are a few.

279
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,573
Let's see…

280
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,141
What do you think?

281
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,311
Let's try putting
the budget aside for a bit

282
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,281
and start with the conditions first.

283
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,715
Sure, no problem.

284
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,319
- Start with the area you want to live in.
- Within the 23 wards of Tokyo?

285
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,355
I’d like it to be close to work,
so this area would be good.

286
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,356
What about size?

287
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,025
Around 60 square meters is ideal.

288
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:49,261
The dogs will be with us too,
and we’d like separate rooms.

289
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:53,032
Sixty square meters, 2LDK,

290
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,266
and pet-friendly.

291
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,369
And within a 15-minute walk
from the station.

292
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,405
I’d like the place
to be less than ten years old.

293
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:00,339
Oh, and a parking lot.

294
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,574
Got it.

295
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,677
And, if possible, one more room.

296
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,179
Right.

297
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,981
Understood.

298
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,282
Please give me a moment.

299
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:15,120
Have a look.

300
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,089
- Let's see…
- Take your time.

301
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:19,925
75,800,000 YEN

302
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,193
<i>So expensive.</i>

303
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,261
80,800,000 YEN

304
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,700
You guys need to be realistic.

305
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,768
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

306
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,171
This is today's breakfast.

307
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,039
Thank you.

308
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,909
Sakuta has been making it lately.

309
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,845
- Good morning.
- Why are you here again?

310
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,047
I might have a talent for tailing people.

311
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,148
What?

312
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,251
Never mind that. Just observe carefully.

313
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,621
- Don't tell him, okay?
- So, you prefer dried sardine rice ball?

314
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,690
- See you.
- See you.

315
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:58,063
Okay, let's go.

316
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:01,400
So, how was it? Do you get it now
after observing thoroughly?

317
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,370
Picking the milk in front…

318
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,739
Having fun…

319
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:08,774
Seeing her off…

320
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:10,576
It was all normal.

321
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:12,778
- See?
- But I don't get it.

322
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:14,680
- Huh?
- You know,

323
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,616
I think sometimes just observing
isn’t enough to understand.

324
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:22,554
Well, thank you for your cooperation
in the investigation. If you'd excuse me.

325
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,628
After deducting handling fees,

326
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,031
that comes to 123,000 yen.

327
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,633
If you’re fine with that, please sign

328
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,001
and seal here.

329
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:39,371
Mr. Ichigaya?

330
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,140
Yes?

331
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,709
I'll do it, yeah!

332
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:47,379
JIN ICHIGAYA

333
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,281
I didn’t have a choice.

334
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,816
I didn’t want to sell it either,

335
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,419
but supporting this little guy
isn’t cheap.

336
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,956
So, you’re looking for a new place
to start fresh?

337
00:15:57,022 --> 00:16:00,225
Somewhere cheap where I can live
with him. Somewhere decent.

338
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,794
In that case,

339
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,662
the one I showed you before

340
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,464
is the only place I can recommend.

341
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,299
I don’t want to live in such a place.

342
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,500
Is that so?

343
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,437
For now…

344
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,138
I guess I can check it out.

345
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:14,740
Understood.

346
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,344
INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS VIEWING
FOR MR. ICHIGAYA

347
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,244
FOR THURSDAY THE 25TH

348
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,348
I wonder if there’s a school
that teaches how to make guitars.

349
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,616
What made you want to make guitars?

350
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,186
I don't know.

351
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,421
Right.

352
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,025
So, I thought, maybe I’ll try making one.

353
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,260
That sounds fun.

354
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:39,298
Not that I’m gonna show anyone,
even if it’s finished.

355
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,501
What, not even to Hatano?

356
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:43,902
Nope.

357
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,237
He'd cry. I'm telling you!

358
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,844
I’ll do some research on my end too.

359
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,279
Thank you.

360
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:00,519
Mr. Sakuta.

361
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:07,459
So, there’s no doubt
you helped Mr. Hatano?

362
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:09,628
Yes.

363
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:11,430
Why did you?

364
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,433
I wonder why myself.

365
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,535
As a teacher, that’s already wrong.

366
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:21,040
But what would the right thing
for a teacher to do be?

367
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,644
Mr. Sakuta,

368
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,213
why did you want to become a teacher?

369
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,154
There was this science teacher
whose little stories were fun.

370
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,023
The way he explained the concept of time…

371
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,592
He said that the passage of time

372
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,661
is like things mixing together.

373
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:47,299
Like how coffee and milk mix
into café au lait.

374
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,902
Once they mix, they don’t separate again.

375
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,270
That’s what time is.

376
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,540
Learning things
you don’t understand is fascinating.

377
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,476
So, you looked up to that teacher
and decided to be one?

378
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:58,744
I also thought…

379
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,747
there should be a variety of teachers.

380
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:03,749
What do you mean?

381
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,517
Such as teachers who don't like school,

382
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,253
teachers who aren't good at teaching,

383
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,723
and teachers who feel uncomfortable
in the classroom.

384
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:13,759
Even teachers who are gay.

385
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,330
With Mr. Hatano…

386
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:20,432
Are you dating him?

387
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,070
I know you’ve been keeping an eye
on us the whole time.

388
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,806
You’re not very good at stakeouts.

389
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:33,278
But I think it’s okay
to have clumsy police officers too.

390
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:39,184
I’ll report back
to the school another day.

391
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,621
Okay.

392
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,390
So, what did you think of the place
after checking it out?

393
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,428
It satisfies most of your criteria.

394
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,063
I’m not sure anymore.

395
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,099
- Huh?
- I’ve seen so many places

396
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,503
that I’m forgetting
what really matters to me.

397
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,606
What kind of home
do I actually want to live in?

398
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:04,009
Why don't you try
a different perspective for once?

399
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,110
What do you mean?

400
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,312
Let’s see some properties

401
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,915
that don’t match your criteria at all.

402
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,584
Okay, let's do just that.

403
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,485
Very well.

404
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,653
INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS VIEWING
FOR MS. MOMOSE

405
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:17,389
Done!

406
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,324
- We did it!
- Yay!

407
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:21,960
- Yay!
- Yay!

408
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,028
Well then,

409
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,363
- I'm going to play it.
- Okay.

410
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:27,065
Wow!

411
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:29,668
- You're amazing!
- It does produce sounds!

412
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:30,903
It's kinda funny.

413
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,007
- This is a masterpiece.
- You're the best.

414
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,009
Look over here, Hotaru!

415
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,110
It's kinda cool!

416
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:54,626
Does Coffee catch your eye?

417
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,596
- What?
- Ah, my bad.

418
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,431
That’s the name of this guitar.

419
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,634
Because it’s made
with the color of coffee,

420
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,604
they call it Coffee.

421
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,807
I didn't know guitars actually have names.

422
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,411
This one’s called Cherry.

423
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,846
It's made using cherry blossom wood.

424
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:17,049
That over there is Maple.

425
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,685
They're all made
by the same guitar workshop,

426
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:23,922
but they give them these unique names.

427
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:27,359
What about yours?

428
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,194
What do you call it?

429
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:49,781
<i>Today my heart</i>

430
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,819
<i>Tucked in the bottom of my bag</i>

431
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:55,887
<i>Hid…</i>

432
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,125
- Um!
- Yes?

433
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,159
There's something…

434
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,729
What?

435
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,931
I noticed something during our simulation.

436
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:10,869
Okay.

437
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,238
Your singing.

438
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,741
What, you hate music?

439
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,609
No, I love it.

440
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:21,046
And I guess because I do…

441
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:25,517
I don’t mind listening
to your singing, Hatano.

442
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,654
But anything else, it distracts me…

443
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:31,089
No, that’s not quite right.

444
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,992
It makes my feelings all over the place.

445
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,632
Sorry.

446
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,200
I'm happy to hear that.

447
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,136
- Huh?
- Because you don’t

448
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:46,605
really talk much about yourself.

449
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,273
I'm just not good at it.

450
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,241
So,

451
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:53,078
living together and getting to know you

452
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,546
makes me really, really happy.

453
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,582
So, when I want to sing,

454
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,751
I’ll ask if it’s alright with you, okay?

455
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:03,855
Are there certain times
you feel like singing?

456
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,590
Yeah. All sorts of times.

457
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,493
When I want to understand
my own feelings, I guess?

458
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,296
What do you mean?

459
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:14,666
I realized that back during my first love,
I used to write songs too.

460
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,535
That’s how I knew I was in love!

461
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:19,371
When you understand your own feelings,

462
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:20,939
it puts you at ease.

463
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,445
Welcome!

464
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,550
You’re in luck!

465
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,653
- Huh?
- We still have Christmas cakes.

466
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,921
Well, uh…

467
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:37,456
I'm sure your wife

468
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,624
or kids would be pleased!

469
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:43,095
Oh, that’s good. Lucky me, really.

470
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,262
That's right…

471
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,765
I also recommend this one.

472
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,600
It even has floor heating.

473
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:52,738
Will floor heating make me happy?

474
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:54,306
To some extent.

475
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,809
Warm floors do make life a little happier.

476
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,512
I’ve just been feeling…

477
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,315
unsettled lately.

478
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,384
- Is that so?
- Even though I’m single…

479
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,219
I went and bought a huge cake.

480
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,056
You get to enjoy a whole cake on your own!

481
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,960
Ah, sorry.
That’s probably not what you meant.

482
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,630
How do I find my happiness?

483
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,901
Tomorrow, I’m going to check out
an interesting property.

484
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,838
You may find something
while looking at different places.

485
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,840
Maybe even what you consider happiness.

486
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,610
Then, I’ll leave it to you.

487
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:32,511
Okay.

488
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,513
INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS VIEWING
FOR MR. YOSHIDA

489
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,814
INOKASHIRA APARTMENTS

490
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,150
Hello.

491
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:39,818
Hello.

492
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:43,255
- This is the apartment we'll be viewing.
- Right.

493
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,024
Mr. Yoshida.

494
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,494
- Mr. Yoshida is tagging along as well?
- Um…

495
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,263
- Is this the place?
- Yes.

496
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,198
It's called Inokashira Apartments.

497
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,701
This place might not be
the one for me. Sorry.

498
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:57,836
Wait, why?

499
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:58,937
- Ah!
- Uh…

500
00:23:59,004 --> 00:23:59,938
Everyone!

501
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,840
Welcome!

502
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,708
This is the landlady, Ms. Inokashira.

503
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:08,180
- This is Mr. Yoshida…
- Mr. Yoshida, nice to meet you.

504
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:09,514
Likewise.

505
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,083
I'm Momose. Nice to meet you.

506
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,186
Ah, you're from the parfait place!

507
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:18,757
Ah, you're from that day!

508
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,592
Thank you for that day.

509
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,127
- You know each other?
- Yes.

510
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,161
I see.

511
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,463
There's one more person.

512
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:26,631
It's this person.

513
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,567
You're from that day.

514
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,101
Hello.

515
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:32,370
So, you’ve decided to look after Hotaru?

516
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:33,872
You know each other too?

517
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,207
He's Kusunoki's dad.

518
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,242
- What?
- Who's Kusunoki?

519
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:40,545
You're from the stakeout!

520
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:42,214
What stakeout? Why?

521
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,982
- She's with the police.
- What?

522
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,017
- Is there a case?
- Hello.

523
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,085
Hello.

524
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,521
I'm hoping we can properly speak today.

525
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,590
Okay. Right this way, please.

526
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,726
What?

527
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:56,027
What case is this about?

528
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:57,062
Stakeout?

529
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:58,864
What do you mean by that?

530
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:06,438
Coming!

531
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,140
- Hello.
- Huh?

532
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:11,977
- What's going on?
- Mr. Hatano?

533
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,879
Genichi, did you do something?

534
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:15,547
Genichi Hatano.

535
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,649
I came by to hear what you have to say.

536
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,189
And since you all appear
to know one another,

537
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:26,525
would it be alright
if I spoke with you collectively?

538
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:33,498
I'm Matsu from Suginami Central Police,
Community Safety Division.

539
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,133
For the past few days,

540
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,469
I’ve been looking into Mr. Hatano

541
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,371
and those around him.

542
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,406
What?

543
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,607
Ms. Inokashira

544
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,910
and Mr. Sakuta,
I've already spoken to them.

545
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:46,545
You knew about this?

546
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:48,747
Yes.

547
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:07,632
Mr. Hatano.

548
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,468
You’re pretending
to be Hotaru Kusunoki’s dad,

549
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:11,436
is that right?

550
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:17,375
- Yes.
- Kusunoki is only 15 years old, a minor.

551
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:21,279
Since there could be a case involved,
we’ve been investigating.

552
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:24,215
Now, starting from you.

553
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,284
Please tell me about your relationship
with Mr. Hatano.

554
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,687
My name is Okabe.

555
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,122
I'm Genichi’s friend

556
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:32,591
and a property agent.

557
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,193
My name is Momose.

558
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,697
Can I tell her about that?

559
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:40,899
Well, yes.

560
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,035
I'm a consultant at a partner agency.

561
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,537
What's that?

562
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,673
It's a marriage consultation agency
for gay people.

563
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:50,508
I see.

564
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,715
And you are?

565
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,550
Please be honest.

566
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,386
Is it okay to say it too?

567
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,455
It's fine.

568
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:05,957
If you're okay with it.

569
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:08,994
My name is Yoshida.

570
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:10,595
Uh…

571
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:14,899
He's my ex-boyfriend,
and he's his current boyfriend.

572
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,902
- Wait, what?
- Oh, I see how it is.

573
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:18,970
A love triangle?

574
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,405
Is that true?

575
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,940
We've already broken up amicably.

576
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,241
So,

577
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,177
did you know about Mr. Hatano
and Kusunoki’s relationship?

578
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,448
I've heard about it briefly.

579
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:32,784
They're really not involved in this.

580
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:34,386
Why did you do this?

581
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:35,887
I asked him to.

582
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,123
Really?

583
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:39,557
He isn’t making you say this?

584
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:40,992
I’m speaking for myself.

585
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,961
Has he done anything you didn’t like?

586
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,630
He made dinner for me without asking,

587
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:47,732
helped me prepare for my test,

588
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,402
and nagged about me being home late.

589
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:51,503
I didn’t like those things.

590
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:55,774
Even if it was purely for Hotaru’s sake,

591
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,742
there were other ways to handle it, no?

592
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,612
So, why did you go out of your way
to pretend to be her parent?

593
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,783
Did you want to try raising a child?

594
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,388
- Huh?
- Because the two of you…

595
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:11,856
can’t have one, yes?

596
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:12,924
Ms. Matsu!

597
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:15,527
I apologize if I come off as rude,

598
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,162
but what’s the truth of it?

599
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,935
I can’t say for sure that…

600
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,404
that wasn’t the case.

601
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,308
So, that was your intention, then?

602
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,343
- Is that a bad thing?
- What?

603
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,679
It doesn’t matter
what Mr. Hatano’s motives were.

604
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,515
I appreciated his help.

605
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:38,683
I’m just glad about that.

606
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,518
Maybe that’s true for now.

607
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:43,755
No matter what happens from here on,
I’ll feel the same. I'm sure about it.

608
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,390
You can’t really know that, can you?

609
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,926
Uh, Genichi is just a meddling,

610
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,929
music-loving old man.

611
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,665
I agree! Saku

612
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,633
has a good eye for men,

613
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,269
and he’s with this person.

614
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:00,338
What do you mean?

615
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,439
Um…

616
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:03,274
Love and revolution!

617
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,810
- Huh?
- I think why Mr. Hatano and the others

618
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:06,811
acted as her parents

619
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:10,048
was probably for love and revolution.

620
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:11,616
What's that?

621
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:15,687
I'm not sure how to explain it. Um…

622
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:17,922
Love…

623
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:19,891
is like finding someone

624
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,559
or something you care about.

625
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,194
And rebelling against people who try

626
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,230
to push you around, or society in general,

627
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:28,633
and then becoming free,

628
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,502
living life the way you want.

629
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,038
- I don't really get it.
- In any case,

630
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:38,343
we live for love and revolution!

631
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:39,477
What a cool thing to say!

632
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:43,014
Oh, no. Please stop.

633
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,150
The one that's cool is Dazai.

634
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,085
Love and revolution, huh?

635
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:51,322
LOVE AND REVOLUTION

636
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:09,107
Will Mr. Hatano be arrested?

637
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:12,210
If what everyone here said is true,

638
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:14,179
then probably no.

639
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:17,782
He hasn’t done anything wrong
to you, Hotaru.

640
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:19,851
Thank goodness…

641
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:23,087
But he will be questioned voluntarily,

642
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,490
and, of course, the school
and child guidance center

643
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:26,925
will be notified.

644
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:29,260
Why is that?

645
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,262
I’m fine with this,

646
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,898
and so is Mr. Hatano and Mr. Sakuta.

647
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:35,033
They're fine with it.

648
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:38,436
What if you were to get sick
in the future?

649
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:43,141
Or during exams, when you need
to fill out important documents?

650
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,243
Think about it realistically.

651
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,346
Right now, relying properly
on the systems in place

652
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,081
is far safer and more reassuring.

653
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,450
This is so you won’t suffer later.

654
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,019
Please rely on them.

655
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:57,789
That’s what I’m here for.

656
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:04,796
Um…

657
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,231
Yes?

658
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,936
Let’s break up, Sakuta.

659
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:15,173
- What?
- Huh?

660
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:21,479
I said if you say that again,
I’d really break up, didn't I?

661
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:24,249
Yes.

662
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:25,650
You're okay with that?

663
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,051
- That can't be good.
- Yeah.

664
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:28,286
That's not good.

665
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:29,387
I'm okay with it.

666
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:32,924
Sakuta…

667
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:38,129
I don’t want you
to be held responsible at school.

668
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:42,433
Neither do I want you
to be questioned by the police.

669
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,103
It’s all my fault.

670
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:47,138
Please break up with me.

671
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:50,174
I did this because I wanted to.

672
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,576
Sakuta and I…

673
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,645
are strangers.

674
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:56,514
We're not married and can never be.

675
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:00,518
So, please do not mention his name

676
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,421
to the police, the school, or anyone else.

677
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,156
I'm begging you!

678
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:08,893
- Well…
- Please!

679
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,096
Um…

680
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:18,536
That's all you need to know
for today, am I right?

681
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,605
- Yes.
- We will excuse ourselves now.

682
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:23,975
What?

683
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,211
Hey!

684
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,924
Is this my fault?

685
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:41,759
- Just get in!
- Okay.

686
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,195
Um…

687
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:46,030
I was thinking
if there’s anything I can do to help.

688
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:48,833
Sorry, this is our problem.

689
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:51,636
- Okay.
- Thanks, though.

690
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:03,414
- What?
- Huh?

691
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,690
Here. I'll give you this,

692
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:14,492
so don't tell anyone I stole this.

693
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,994
What? You stole it?

694
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,161
Huh?

695
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:18,229
I thought you saw me.

696
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,766
What? Hey!

697
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:23,634
Ah, you dropped something.

698
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,603
Hey!

699
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,172
Shall we postpone the viewing
to another day?

700
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,507
Yes.

701
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:34,545
You're not leaving?

702
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,182
Well, I got curious.

703
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:40,184
About Genichi and Mr. Sakuta?

704
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,486
It's not exactly that

705
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,589
I want those two to break up.

706
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:50,061
That being said, I don't really understand
Mr. Hatano and the others.

707
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:51,929
- I get you.
- What?

708
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:52,964
Oh,

709
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,366
I can relate for not understanding them.

710
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,669
All kinds of people come to me.

711
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,640
By that, I really mean all kinds.

712
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,811
But, well, that’s what makes
my job interesting.

713
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,215
I'll take my leave now.

714
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,087
- Bye.
- Bye.

715
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,496
Here you go.

716
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,063
RESERVATION SLIP

717
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,865
- Please wait a moment.
- Okay.

718
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,270
- Is this the item you reserved?
- Yes.

719
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:37,909
How’s this apartment? Do you like it?

720
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:42,346
Do you live here too, Ms. Inokashira?

721
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,582
I live alone, just behind here.

722
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,552
But you're not alone, right?

723
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:48,986
You're right.

724
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:52,123
It might be too lively
to really call it living alone.

725
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,926
People who aren't married
are called "single", right?

726
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:58,029
Being single or currently living alone?

727
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:58,963
Yes.

728
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:00,665
I’m alone too.

729
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:01,766
Same, me too!

730
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,435
But you’re not really alone.

731
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:06,971
Yeah.

732
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,641
I want to aim for that too.

733
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:13,411
Me?

734
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,483
Make sure you reconcile properly.

735
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:21,319
Adults shouldn’t sulk like this.

736
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:26,257
Sorry for the wait.

737
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,093
Can you hold this for me?

738
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,661
Okay.

739
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:34,599
It looks delicious!

740
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:36,434
Sorry, that's meant to be taken elsewhere.

741
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,602
To where?

742
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,038
Weren’t you looking forward to it?

743
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,944
I already have something else
to look forward to.

744
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:51,182
Even more so than Christmas cake
or New Year’s food.

745
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,250
Something much exciting.

746
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,489
Hey, wait up!

747
00:35:58,556 --> 00:35:59,757
Shut up!

748
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,492
How long are you going to follow me?

749
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,861
That’s stealing! It’s a crime!

750
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,329
You dropped this!

751
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:08,232
- Ah, give that back!
- Huh?

752
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,467
Hey!

753
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:11,335
You’ll get arrested!

754
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:12,470
What?

755
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:16,107
People will think you’re a bad man!

756
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,808
Stones will be thrown at you

757
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,177
from people around you.

758
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:21,145
Who cares about that!

759
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:22,613
I’m doing things my way!

760
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,749
Ah, hey!

761
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:32,623
- What's this place?
- This is a facility

762
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,625
where I grew up until high school.

763
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,995
CHILDREN’S HOME: HOSHINOOKA HOUSE

764
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:42,099
If you'd like,
please share this with everyone.

765
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:44,035
- Are you sure? Thanks.
- Of course.

766
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:45,336
They’ll love it!

767
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,705
And they are?

768
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:48,706
Let me introduce them.

769
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,409
Kanata and Micchan are fighting!

770
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:54,845
- Yume spilled her juice!
- Not again…

771
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,814
Sorry, can you wait a moment?

772
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,482
- We’ll return another time then.
- Oh, but…

773
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,951
I came by to pass you this cake.

774
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:01,352
Sorry about this.

775
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,287
I'll see you again
when it's not so chaotic.

776
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,089
- Yes.
- I'm so sorry.

777
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,325
Hey, Kanata.

778
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:11,162
- Come on now. Give that back.
- GIve it back!

779
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,530
- It's mine!
- No…

780
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,206
I'll try singing.

781
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:32,083
<i>I, I have a dream</i>

782
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:37,922
<i>A dream of you and me</i>

783
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:44,128
<i>We're flying high above</i>

784
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:51,002
<i>We're soaring over the sea</i>

785
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:55,940
<i>Bless me, bless me with wings</i>

786
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:02,413
<i>For I, so want to fly</i>

787
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:07,818
<i>These precious white wings</i>

788
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:15,559
<i>Will take me soaring high</i>

789
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:24,268
<i>To the sun that lights the day</i>
<i>To the clouds that drift away</i>

790
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:29,807
<i>Only then will I be free</i>

791
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:37,048
<i>Past the city lights and haze</i>
<i>Through the autumn trees ablaze</i>

792
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:42,520
<i>In the sky I am truly free</i>

793
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:47,625
<i>Just you and me</i>

794
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:57,635
This is the song everyone sang for me
when I left this facility.

795
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:01,906
You said it would help me understand
my feelings if I sang, Hatano.

796
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:04,175
How did you feel?

797
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:07,778
I’m excited.

798
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:09,447
Excited?

799
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:13,517
The life at the facility was lively,
and everyone got along.

800
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:17,355
We weren’t family,
but it felt like we really were.

801
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:21,092
Still, by the rules at the time,

802
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:24,362
we had to leave
once we graduated high school.

803
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:27,698
When I left, I bawled my eyes out.

804
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,102
That’s how much I loved…

805
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:33,204
this place.

806
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:38,075
So, I thought that someday

807
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:41,312
I’d want to make a home like this myself.

808
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:47,852
I knew it’d be tough since I’m gay.

809
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:49,186
But even so…

810
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,257
You know, to tell the truth,
I was a little…

811
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,159
thrilled…

812
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:59,330
when you said let's buy a house
and make it our "clamp".

813
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:01,532
Even now,

814
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,869
the fact that you're seriously
trying to buy a house

815
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,606
makes me happy.

816
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:10,408
More than I’ve ever been

817
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,943
about any other reservation.

818
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,615
I'm really looking forward to it!

819
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:21,852
I'm sorry.

820
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,490
I won’t say anything
like "let’s break up" anymore.

821
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:29,727
Let’s buy…

822
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:31,829
a house for us both!

823
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:36,167
What do you want?

824
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:37,601
To reconcile.

825
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,004
No, I don't want to do that here.

826
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,639
No one’s watching.

827
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:52,383
There’s something I want you to see.

828
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,584
What is it?

829
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:56,220
- I’ll come to your room later.
- Okay.

830
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:59,490
I wonder what it is…

831
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:00,624
Who knows?

832
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:10,167
What's that?

833
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:14,538
"I didn’t really understand
you two at all,

834
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,507
but it was incredibly interesting.

835
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:20,211
So, please get along with each other."
It's from Ms. Matsu.

836
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:21,312
What?

837
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:27,117
Um, how about writing something like this
in the notarized contract?

838
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:30,187
- What?
- "Even if we don’t understand each other,

839
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:31,655
let’s enjoy it…

840
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,557
and get along."

841
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,062
Okay.

842
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:40,264
<i>After the beep tone,</i>

843
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,567
<i>please leave your name and message.</i>

844
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:44,668
Hello.

845
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:46,570
Mom, guess what?

846
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:47,271
MOM

847
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,874
I tried making a guitar out of cardboard…

848
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,176
but it turned out weird.

849
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,547
I’m not even sure if it’s a guitar or not.

Yes.

- Yes.

00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,124
Yeah.

879
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:16,860
It really looks like a guitar!

880
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,762
It’s really cute.

881
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:20,864
Was this really
your first time making one?

882
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:24,969
Yes. Even if I end up
in a child guidance center,

883
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:27,271
I want to be someone who makes guitars.

884
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,843
Yeah, you definitely can! I know you can.

885
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,112
You made something this amazing after all.

886
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:38,682
Wait, did you decide the shape yourself?

00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:40,784
- Yes. Also…
- Hey.
