00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,773
<i>Gentle-hearted gay man Genichi Hatano</i>

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,707
<i>and his crush,</i>

3
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:10,010
<i>Saku Sakuta,</i>
<i>find themselves growing closer</i>

4
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:11,444
<i>under the same roof.</i>

5
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,246
I support you
in pretending to be her parent.

6
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:14,981
<i>The "Parent-Child Contract"</i>
<i>previously made with Hotaru</i>

7
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:16,449
<i>now has Saku's name too.</i>

8
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,517
<i>Koito…</i>

9
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:19,753
<i>I liked him so much back in middle school.</i>

10
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:23,490
<i>Genichi finally puts an end to the regrets</i>
<i>lingering from his first love.</i>

11
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:25,325
I bought a house with my partner.

12
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:28,061
<i>Maybe the partnership stuff</i>
<i>should come first?</i>

13
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,596
<i>As both of their feelings align,</i>

14
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:31,331
<i>they start searching for a home.</i>

15
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:34,367
- Are we buying it or not?
- We are. Let's buy it!

16
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,037
I want to know how you and your partner

17
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:38,471
bought your home, Koito.

18
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,873
And the required documents.

19
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:41,875
And the required documents

20
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,109
<i>that you needed for the loan.</i>

21
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:44,411
Got it!

22
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:47,313
I think I kept them all together,
so I’ll look for it later.

23
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,515
Really? Thanks.

24
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:51,851
My partner
is looking forward to meeting you.

25
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:55,422
Wait.

26
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:56,990
So you two are dating now?

27
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,292
<i>Things escalated quickly, huh?</i>

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,494
Ah, yeah. Well…

29
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,563
Okay, talk to you later. Bye.

30
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,265
How’d it go?

31
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,567
Next time, when we
go over to Koito’s place,

32
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,335
he said he'll show us

33
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,637
the loan documents and stuff.

34
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,940
Okay, we can talk about that
when that time comes.

35
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,443
About the partnership,
we need to make an appointment

36
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:17,944
and go to the city office.

37
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,579
Do you have any off days for work?

38
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,116
And I’d like to meet your parents too.

39
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,785
Are you really okay with this?

40
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,888
- Huh?
- The partnership with me and all that…

41
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,724
It just makes things easier
when you’re renting a place

42
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:34,394
or getting a mortgage.

43
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,196
It proves our relationship is legitimate.

44
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,364
That’s not what I meant.

45
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:44,370
- Are you planning for a breakup soon?
- Oh, no.

46
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,940
- I thought you wanted a "clamp".
- Yes, I do.

47
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,809
- A "clamp" in the form of a house.
- Okay, then.

48
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,312
Let’s call your parents.

49
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,915
Sorry I kept it from you.

50
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,318
That’s everything Tomoe told me.

51
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,920
Isn’t she being super selfish? My mom.

52
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:02,155
It's getting on my nerves.

53
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,691
It's all talk, saying she loves me.

54
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,632
- What are you doing?
- They expire today.

55
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,335
They’re safe to eat raw that period.

56
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:18,037
If you cook them,
they’ll last a bit longer.

57
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:19,772
- What?
- Yeah.

58
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:26,579
Whatever, I feel like stress-eating.

59
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,482
Oh! Two yolks!

60
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,985
I'm sure something good
is going to happen!

61
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,219
Because it’s a double yolk?

62
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:36,289
Yeah. When you get a double yolk,

63
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,159
or when you see someone
with a bouquet walking around,

64
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,127
something lucky happens after.

65
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:44,597
- Right…
- You don’t seem to believe me.

66
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,074
Perfect!

67
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,044
Nicely taken.

68
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:03,950
Hey,

69
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,052
you can clock out a bit early today.

70
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,021
Thank you.

71
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:09,155
Is something going on?

72
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,424
My mom is coming to Tokyo from Hokkaido.

73
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,394
Think of taking care of your parents
as part of your job

74
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,929
while you and they are still around.

75
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,463
While they are still around?

76
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,233
Even the boar that died

77
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,367
had way too much energy

78
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,703
and was kind of a nuisance.

79
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:25,405
Yeah.

80
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,073
Being alive also means

81
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,209
you could die anytime.

82
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,457
- Oh, how lovely!
- What?

83
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,492
I'm Hatano’s mother.

84
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,595
Thank you for looking after my son.

85
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,498
I’m Inokashira, the landlady.

86
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,368
Do you do art?

87
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,972
It's from quite a long time ago, though.

88
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:00,073
May I have a look?

89
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,475
Oh my.

90
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,278
It’s interesting.

91
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,780
This kind of… fantasy creature.

92
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:08,748
Isn't that right?

93
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,885
Thank you. Anyway, if you'd excuse me.

94
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,490
What fantasy?

95
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,594
You need to knock

96
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,664
three times, then bow,
and say, "Excuse me."

97
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,366
MOCK INTERVIEW FOR CLASS 4

98
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,801
Wait until they tell you to sit.

99
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:29,802
Okay.

100
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,572
- Don't give me "okay".
- Okaaay.

101
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,275
HOTARU KUSUNOKI

102
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,509
Here.

103
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,779
High school brochures
that I think might suit you.

104
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,814
You really need to decide soon!

105
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,286
- I’m going to live how I want from now on.
- What?

106
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,555
Like how my mom collects those keychains.
I’ll do whatever I want too.

107
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,725
- Such as?
- I’ll figure that out as I go.

108
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,095
- Huh?
- Well, if you'd excuse me.

109
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,698
Wait!

110
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,467
Hatano’s mother is coming today.

111
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,771
What? So, you two are officially together?

112
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:07,106
This is like greeting the in-laws, right?

113
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,542
Uh, well…

114
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:11,811
‪I guess so.

115
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,346
When did you fall for him?

116
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,249
- Huh?
- What do you like about him?

117
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,851
I'm the interviewer here, mind you?

118
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,554
Oh?

119
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:25,758
- I wrapped up work early.
- Ah, thank you.

120
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:29,896
Your mom’s here, right? Should I hide?

121
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,231
No, it’s fine.

122
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,200
Just please don’t make things complicated.

123
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,268
What do you mean?

124
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,404
You know, the whole
pretending-to-be-your-dad thing.

125
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,206
Oh, and the 30 million yen matter.

126
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,208
Okay.

127
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:47,547
<i>Please, I beg you</i>

128
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:50,950
<i>Remember those days</i>

129
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:51,851
Coming!

130
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,656
- Welcome back!
- I'm back.

131
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,257
It’s been a while.

132
00:05:58,324 --> 00:05:59,792
I could hear you all the way out.

133
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,528
Nice to meet you. I’m Sakuta.

134
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,932
You must be the one…

135
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:08,768
And she is?

136
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,076
- How does it taste?
- It's great.

137
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,314
- Do you like it too?
- Yes, very.

138
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,250
I'm so glad to hear that!

139
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,786
- Eat as much as you like!
- Aren't you glad?

140
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:28,688
I am.

141
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,289
Such wonderful neighbors you have.

142
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,692
I feel like I'm the daughter here.

143
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,094
Age-wise, okay?

144
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,530
Then, from my perspective,

145
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,232
she's like my granddaughter?

146
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,368
By the way,

147
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,937
we’re going to the city office
together, Sakuta and I.

148
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,608
To apply
for the partnership certificate, yes?

149
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,042
You know about it?

150
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,211
Of course.

151
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,581
Are you two going to live together here?

152
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,784
We’re thinking about buying a place.

153
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,252
Yes, together.

154
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,187
That’s wonderful!

155
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,090
But what about the property agency?

156
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,992
Should I come along?

157
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,994
How old do you think I am?

158
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,997
Someone Hatano knows
is quite knowledgeable.

159
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,733
Next time, we’ll visit their place
and learn from them.

160
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:15,968
It's Koito.

161
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,604
Koito?

162
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,307
Oh! From middle school?

163
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,442
Your friend, yes?

164
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:23,810
You remember well.

165
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,012
- I want to come too.
- What?

166
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:29,315
Regarding Sakuta's parents,

167
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,851
maybe I could meet and greet them once

168
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,119
was what I was thinking.

169
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,722
They weren't around since I was born.

170
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,825
- Is that how it is?
- Yes.

171
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,465
Though, I get why you'd be curious…

172
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:51,204
You really do look like him.

173
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,006
- What?
- Ko from <i>3Happy.</i>

174
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,075
- Who's that?
- Oh, come on!

175
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,344
It's this I'm talking about!

176
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,780
Haven’t you heard
of <i>Three Steps to a Happy Ending?</i>

177
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,216
In short, <i>3Happy.</i>

178
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,718
It’s a boys' love manga, actually.

179
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,987
Two guys quit their toxic jobs,

180
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,323
use their meager severance

181
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,325
and unemployment money to travel,

182
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,993
and somehow go from rock bottom

183
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,196
to totally in love and a happy ending.

184
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,031
I couldn’t stop swooning!

185
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:22,201
‪See?

186
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,671
This is Ko.
Don’t you think he looks similar?

187
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:26,706
Really?

188
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:27,940
He does.

189
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,276
Right? You think so too?

190
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,946
So, try smiling a little like him.

191
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:34,847
Huh?

192
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,222
You look just like him!

193
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,158
Oh, whatever shall I do?

194
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,496
There’s this line I want him to say.

195
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:53,633
This is Iwai. There’s a scene
where Iwai and Ko

196
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,468
hug each other.

197
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,669
See? Over here.

198
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:57,403
‪YOU FINALLY SAID IT.

199
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,574
- So, why don’t you pretend to be Iwai
- What?

200
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,809
and hug each other here?

201
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,144
Come on now.

202
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,280
Don't be shy! Go on.

203
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,982
- Get a little closer. Snuggle up more!
- We're not doing it.

204
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,252
What's the harm? You're such a spoilsport.

205
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,889
- What?
- Oh? Hotaru.

206
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,024
Are you interested too?

207
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,428
Hey, wanna go
to the signing event together?

208
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,831
- What signing event?
- Ah… So that’s why you came.

209
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,501
Might as well since I'm here, you know.

210
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,702
Besides…

211
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,271
I also had to stop by the hospital.

212
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,675
- The hospital?
- They say I don't have much time left.

213
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,313
It seems I’m going to die.

214
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,515
What?

215
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,584
I was given a terminal diagnosis.

216
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,153
I have four months left.

217
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:50,122
Well, I’m going to get it checked
at the hospitals here too,

218
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,493
but the outlook isn't great.

219
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,697
But hey, you don’t need to worry
about any of that.

220
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,966
Your dad is around, after all.

221
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:00,866
Soon,

222
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,236
I’ll be moving into a local facility
where my friends are.

223
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,506
I find it hard to believe.

224
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,443
Even I'm shocked.

225
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,047
- Is that right?
- Surprisingly calm, huh?

226
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:16,882
I am worried, though.

227
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,085
It’s fine. Don’t worry about me.

228
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:20,620
Just leave me be.

229
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,355
I’d feel bad if you fussed over me.

230
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,193
I’m not exactly young anymore.

231
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,194
I'm somewhat…

232
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,196
prepared for it.

233
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,397
Oh my!

234
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:33,499
How reassuring!

235
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,505
VOICEMAIL SERVICE

236
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,707
<i>No new messages.</i>

237
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,845
Shouldn't you be staying with her?

238
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,449
She told me to leave her be.

239
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,618
She’s a stubborn one.

240
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,920
Once she proposes something,
she won’t listen.

241
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:56,722
Ah…

242
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,524
Only "ah" from you?

243
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,460
I was thinking "like mother, like son".

244
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,562
<i>Shine</i>

245
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:07,833
<i>We shall shine together</i>

246
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,369
I think so too.

247
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,339
- Did she always like it?
- What?

248
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,442
Did your mom always like
boys' love manga, that is.

249
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,878
Oh, no. I was surprised.

250
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:20,246
Romance between guys…

251
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:21,814
I thought she couldn’t handle it.

252
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:22,948
Really?

253
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,850
When I was 20,

254
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,385
I told my mom about my sexuality.

255
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,422
She cried.

256
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,124
She looked so distressed…

257
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:33,793
so it was a surprise.

258
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,062
Well, manga isn’t reality.

259
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:36,962
Yeah.

260
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:42,501
I'm done filling the forms.
Partnership certificate,

261
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:45,438
confirmation form, card application…

262
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:46,338
Wait.

263
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:48,474
What's this?

264
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,444
It's for including a child’s name
if we have one.

265
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,248
Are you considering Hotaru?

266
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,551
Yes…

267
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,722
<i>If Hotaru hadn’t been a part of this,</i>

268
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:03,723
<i>I'm sure</i>

269
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,357
<i>none of this would have happened.</i>

270
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:07,793
Yes.

271
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,798
Ah, hey!

272
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,735
Stop it, Chan! Ah, Chasu…

273
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,336
Don't do that.

274
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,871
‪Come on…

275
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,440
- Hello?
- <i>Sorry for calling so late.</i>

276
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,742
Is something up?

277
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,243
<i>This Saturday…</i>

278
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,345
That pizza place you told me about.

279
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,414
Wanna go there together?

280
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,349
Calm down, guys.

281
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,351
I’ve been kind of busy lately.

282
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,421
Got it. Alright, maybe another time then.

283
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,123
<i>Okay.</i>

284
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,024
U-Um--

285
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,929
Calm down, buddy!

286
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,999
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, can you help…

287
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,201
- Careful…
- Take this.

288
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,736
Hey, now!

289
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,037
- Slowly now…
- Oof.

290
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,339
Okay!

291
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,607
Everything is alright now.

292
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,177
HOKKAIDO SOUVENIR

293
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,179
Okay, now.

294
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,384
Don’t make things complicated, okay?

295
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,019
Koito’s partner will be there too.

296
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,521
I know!

297
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,624
- Welcome!
- Thanks for having us.

298
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,992
- Please come in!
- Okay.

299
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,226
Nice to meet you.

300
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,763
This is my partner, Ryogo Yagura.

301
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,099
And this is Hatano, Sakuta,

302
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,834
and Hotaru Kusunoki.

303
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,736
Thank you for inviting us.

304
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,204
Here, if you'd like.

305
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:28,207
Thank you! I’ll make some tea.

306
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,375
Thank you.

307
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,477
Please feel free to make yourself at home.

308
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:32,878
Is there anything I can help with?

309
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,748
Oh, don't worry about it!
The kitchen is messy.

310
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,649
Sorry.

311
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,751
Have a drink if you'd like.

312
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,955
- It's a nice place.
- I know, right?

313
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,256
We stretched ourselves hard.

314
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,192
Places are crazy expensive these days, no?

315
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:49,662
But when you consider the future,
you'd want one, right?

316
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,530
Especially for people like us.

317
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:56,235
And this. For the loan,

318
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:58,370
you'd need the partnership certificate…

319
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,406
We’re going to the city office soon.

320
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,441
- Oh, prior?
- Yeah.

321
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,044
That makes explaining
various things easier.

322
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,478
Sounds good.

323
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,081
And this is the notarized contract.

324
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:10,916
What's that?

325
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,318
It’s like a super contract

326
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,854
that protects our future.

327
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,056
Have it drafted by a legal professional

328
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,424
and file it at the city office.

329
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,192
It's going to cost time, effort,

330
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,794
and quite a sum of money, though.

331
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,364
This document here says

332
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,032
we can live together as a family.

333
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,969
And here, it says if something happens
to either of us,

334
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,172
the other can take care
of living arrangements and property.

335
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:36,642
Without this, if one of you
were to pass away,

336
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,245
you can’t leave your property or assets
to the other person.

337
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,414
Marriage would make this unnecessary.

338
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,316
That’s really important, huh?

339
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,185
Party A and Party B

340
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,587
are considered equivalent
to a de facto married couple

341
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:49,955
living in a shared household.

342
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,725
- Kinda sounds like something I wrote once.
- What?

343
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:54,793
It's nothing.

344
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,231
"Article 5, Living Rules."

345
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,434
You can also write rules
the both of you have agreed on together.

346
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:03,669
I see…

347
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:07,873
"Until both Party A and Party B
have finished bathing,

348
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,975
neither parties may use the futon."

349
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,644
Oh, I see how it is with you guys…

350
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:16,649
"Party B may not use
more than half of the eggs

351
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:20,185
in the refrigerator

352
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,153
to make hard-boiled eggs?"

353
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,521
I don't get it.

354
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,891
I’m party A, this person is party B.

355
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,927
I’d go out and buy a pack of eggs.

356
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:28,861
The one with ten.

357
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,330
And this person turns them all
into boiled eggs.

358
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,364
Without asking!

359
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,937
Boiled eggs are the best for working out,

360
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,738
and they keep you full and all that.

361
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,407
But, you know,

362
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,142
some days I want a fried egg,

363
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,278
or egg on rice, or a rolled omelet,

364
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,247
eggs benedict, an omelet,

365
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,015
or even poached eggs…

366
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,817
If you had to eat boiled eggs every day,

367
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,852
wouldn't you get sick of it?
Don't you agree?

368
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,725
- Somewhat.
- Even this morning, right?

369
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:03,262
I thought I’d make a fried egg,
so I cracked one open, but it was boiled.

370
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,163
All of them!

371
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:08,734
So that was why the kitchen sink
was covered in eggshells…

372
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,668
What do you think?

373
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:11,870
Since you guys are here,

374
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,206
I want to get a third-party opinion.

375
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,675
- What opinion?
- Well, you see…

376
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,612
the "half" rule was kind of vague.

377
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,315
Sometimes you don’t use
any eggs at all, Ryogo.

378
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,883
And when I made many boiled eggs,

379
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,986
there were times you didn't say anything…

380
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,522
Just because I was silent, does that mean
it’s okay to break our promise?

381
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,561
What matters more? Me or the boiled eggs?

382
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,735
Both.

383
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,608
Ask whatever you need from him here on.

384
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,876
Sorry about this.

385
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,378
- What?
- No way.

386
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,278
Really?

387
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,949
You should chase after him, Koito.

388
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,451
- Huh?
- Quick!

389
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,688
- Will they be okay?
- They'll be fine.

390
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,089
Ah, he caught up.

391
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,626
‪I can buy more eggs
‪if that's what you want.

392
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,402
I hope everything’s okay.

Looking for a nice place?

NICE PROPERTIES AVAILABLE!

397
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,453
Find me and this little guy a place,

398
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,723
a place where things feel right,

399
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,125
a place where I can be reborn
as a better person.

400
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,795
- Understood.
- Do such places exist?

401
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,564
Whether you believe me or not…

402
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,533
that’s up to you, sir.

403
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,903
That was a joke, really.

404
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,038
There’s no way I’d believe that!

405
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,213
Ah! It's a tortoise!

406
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,016
I don't think so.
It's definitely a turtle!

407
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:04,983
It's a tortoise.

408
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,885
It's a turtle, for sure!

409
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,360
A bird's legs…

410
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:17,830
Two, huh?

411
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:22,334
I wonder if a house
really can act as a "clamp"?

412
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,203
They’ll make up quickly, I’m sure.

413
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,438
You think so?

414
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,009
I'm back.

415
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:33,679
What?

416
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:36,782
Huh?

417
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:38,784
Where's Dora?

418
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,387
Even at this hospital…

419
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,623
It seems I really have…

420
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,693
until March!

421
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,394

What do you think this looks like?

425
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,604
Cute little flamingos!

426
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:10,749
Welcome back. Have you seen the tortoise?

427
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,284
What tortoise?

428
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,520
It seems to have gone missing
from Hatano’s place.

429
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:15,721
Oh my!

430
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:19,424
Found it?

431
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,560
I searched that area already,
but it isn't there.

432
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,797
- Found it?
- No.

433
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,534
I see. Same here.

434
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,904
If you see a double-yolk egg…

435
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:35,507
or see someone with a bouquet,

436
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,342
good things happen.

437
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,512
- What's that about?
- The landlady told me that.

438
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,316
I had a double-yolk egg the other day.

439
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,051
Everything will be fine.

440
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:48,420
Thanks.

441
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,055
It wasn't in the yard too.

442
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,223
Is that so?

443
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:54,426
You'll find it in no time.

444
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,328
Don't you think so too?

445
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:59,031
It'll be alright!

446
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,766
Oh, this!

447
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,902
At Suginomori Zoological & Botanical Park,

448
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,171
there was a contest
to design the mascot character.

449
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,574
That was ages ago though,

450
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,576
but I actually won a special prize,

451
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:11,910
and it ended up as a keychain.

452
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,745
Is that how it was?

453
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:16,448
It’s charming and cute.

454
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:17,683
What's the drawing of?

455
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:20,385
It’s a Tokyo bird, the black-headed gull.

456
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,621
The mascot is a gull shaped like Tokyo.

457
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:23,622
A gull, you say?

458
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:24,890
Gull, huh?

459
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,191
Now that you mention it…

460
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,759
Although for a gull,

461
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:30,562
it has a few too many legs, no?

462
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,764
I'm ashamed,

463
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,566
but the fact that birds have two legs

464
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,568
is something I only realized today.

465
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,337
- That's a flamingo.
- A flamingo, indeed.

466
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,505
I drew while carefully observing it.

467
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:44,042
And then all kinds of things
started to become clear.

468
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,013
It’s really fun!

469
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,882
Please fill out this lost property report.

470
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:51,984
Okay.

471
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,654
Ah, Mr. Ichigaya.

472
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,159
Mr. Hatano.

473
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,162
- Hello.
- What's the matter?

474
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,565
My tortoise disappeared.

475
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:08,200
- A tortoise?
- Yeah.

476
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,002
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

477
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,036
I'll take my leave now.

478
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:14,306
Tortoise, huh?

479
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,542
Genichi Hatano?

480
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:22,648
Look forward to it! I'm gonna hang up now.

481
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:23,682
Alrighty.

482
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:27,653
HAPPY STORE

SAKU

484
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,501
- He’s not picking up.
- Perhaps he's busy.

485
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,369
This is my first time doing
something like this.

486
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:45,737
How do I put it?

487
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,905
Going against the flow?

488
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,674
Whether a relationship is starting

489
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,309
or ending,

490
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,576
I usually let it play out.

491
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,911
Isn’t that a good thing?

492
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:54,646
- Well then,
- What?

493
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,782
I'll need to do prep work before going
to the property agency,

494
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,250
as well as many other things.

495
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,152
- Um, is it regarding your condo?
- Yes.

496
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,088
I'd like to go to the property agency too.

497
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,489
Pardon?

498
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,058
Please come back!

499
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,927
I’ll limit myself to three…

500
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,663
no, five boiled eggs a day.

501
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,131
So, please!

502
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,569
Come on, Super Contract!

503
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,145
You’re taking the afternoon off today,
right, Hatano?

504
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:28,680
Yes, that's right.

505
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,349
Are you going somewhere with your mom?

506
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,552
It's for something else.

507
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,024
What’s wrong?

508
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,226
If you had known the boar
was going to die,

509
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,261
what would you have done for it?

510
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,932
I guess I'd pet it a lot,

511
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:49,601
smile at it, maybe sing…

512
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:51,303
or dance?

513
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,072
Words don’t reach animals, right?

514
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:55,474
So,

515
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,610
I’d do anything to show them I’m grateful.

516
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:03,115
Family register… Driver’s license…

517
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,349
Sakuta!

518
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,418
Sorry to keep you waiting.

519
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,587
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

520
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:13,258
Um… Are you really, truly okay with this?

521
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,927
- Are you chickening out?
- Yes, I am.

522
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,929
You’re the one who said we should do it.

523
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:20,065
But a partnership

524
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,833
is like getting married, right?

525
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,569
I don’t really think of it as marriage.

526
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:27,239
- What?
- We have to submit it!

527
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,275
Well, even if we do,

528
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:34,312
things rarely go smoothly for couples
like us, so it's just for the sake of it.

529
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:38,016
- That’s very procedural.
- It's important, no?

530
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,854
Hey, mind if we stop here?

531
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:43,789
Not at all.

532
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,157
So, are those two…

533
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:47,926
- getting along well?
- Huh?

534
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:50,195
Genichi and Sakuta.

535
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:54,900
Yes, very. All things considered,
they're lovey-dovey all the time.

536
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,101
Really?

537
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:58,970
They just can’t hide
their lovey-dovey vibes, both of them.

538
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,640
Is that how it is?

539
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:03,909
Really now…

540
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,577
When I said, "We’re here to submit

541
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,813
a partnership registration,"

542
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,347
didn’t they make a weird face?

543
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:10,682
You’re overthinking it.

544
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,323
Are you really, really,
really sure about this?

545
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,791
You're being persistent.

546
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,860
- Sorry for the wait.
- Yes.

547
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,328
Please wait a little more over there.

548
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,964
THREE STEPS TO A HAPPY ENDING

549
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,569
Ms. Umou,

550
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,405
let’s sign lots and get everyone excited!

551
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,141
Do people even want my autograph?

552
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,943
Of course!

553
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,177
After all,

554
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,346
things like a "Happy Ending" and such,

555
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,816
when there are so many people
in the world who aren’t happy,

556
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,586
it feels a bit shallow…

557
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:51,590
- I'm taking it now.
- Set it to burst mode, okay?

558
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,691
- Burst mode.
- Yes.

559
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:53,859
Got it.

560
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,300
How's this?

561
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,138
Perfect!

562
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:09,374
Thanks!

563
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:14,145
What got you into boys' love manga?

564
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,449
When Genichi…

565
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,851
told me he was gay,

566
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,887
I thought I'd try learning about it.

567
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:24,890
Of course, I read proper books
with words too, you know.

568
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:26,358
But in the middle of all that…

569
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,561
I discovered boys’ love manga.

570
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:32,163
After reading all sorts of them,

571
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,099
I got totally hooked!

572
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,968
And now <i>3Happy</i> is my favorite.

573
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,670
So, that's how it is.

574
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:40,472
Do you have something you like, Hotaru?

575
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:46,978
It's a secret.

576
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,382
If it’s a secret,

577
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:52,250
that means you do have one.

578
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,887
First, regarding the partnership system,

579
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:58,456
please allow me explain it again.
This system

580
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:01,893
is for couples where both, or either one,
identify as a sexual minority.

581
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,895
As life partners to each other,

582
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:07,399
they respect each other's rights,
continuously support one another,

583
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:10,001
and promise to live together.
Only such couples

584
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,736
are able to register under this system.

585
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:14,472
- Okay.
- We'll start with identity verification.

586
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:17,676
Mr. Genichi Hatano, please show your ID.

587
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:23,949
Hatano!

588
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:26,184
Ah, sorry.

589
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,218
Are you okay?

590
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:30,288
I don’t know. I’m kind of scared.

591
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:31,289
Scared of what?

592
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,758
I’m feeling so happy, it's scary.

593
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,195
Sorry, please continue.

594
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,030
Please move forward and close the gap.

595
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,569
Oh my God!

596
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:47,072
I’m so glad I’m alive!

597
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:49,874
It’s like getting to meet God.

598
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,477
And I’m not even dead yet.

599
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:56,147
- Oh dear me! What do I do!
- Please calm down.

600
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:57,549
Sorry.

601
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:02,020
If you dissolve the partnership or move,

602
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,755
you'll need to return the certificate.

603
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,257
Do you want an acceptance certificate
for the card?

604
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:07,826
Yes, please.

605
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:10,729
Very well. By presenting
this card or certificate,

606
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,231
you’ll be able to access
various administrative services.

607
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,801
You can use it for public housing,
childcare, welfare,

608
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:20,605
and more hospitals are starting
to accept it too, so feel free to use it.

609
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:21,506
Okay!

610
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,808
Now, let’s check the documents.

611
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:27,445
Here you go.

612
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:32,317
Alright. We’ll issue the certificate,
so please wait a moment.

613
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:33,585
Thank you!

614
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,624
Are you really, really, really, truly

615
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:40,558
okay with this?

616
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,293
You're really annoying, okay?

617
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:45,630
Calling a house a "clamp"…

618
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:47,666
is honestly kind of just talk.

619
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,301
Even if it’s just talk or a lie…

620
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,606
if you truly believe it,
it will become real.

621
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:57,776
‪Okay.

622
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:01,546
There you have it.

623
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,115
- Hello.
- Hello.

624
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,083
These are for you.

625
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:07,752
I appreciate it.

626
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:12,657
May I please have your autograph?

627
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,666
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

628
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,370
Could we shake hands?

629
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,006
Yes, if you don’t mind…

630
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,377
- Um…
- Yes?

631
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:34,879
My son…

632
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:37,716
He's gay.

633
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:42,253
When my son came out to me,

634
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,655
telling me he was gay,

635
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,224
I cried, thinking
he was such a poor thing.

636
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,026
As you know…

637
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,695
the world is harsh to people like him.

638
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,867
But I tried to come to terms with it
in my own way,

639
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,802
and in front of my son,

640
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:00,171
I wanted to be a good mom.

641
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,706
Still…

642
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,576
I couldn’t fully be at ease.

643
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,778
I always believed that two men

644
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,047
couldn’t truly be happy together.

645
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,749
I was a firm believer of that.

646
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:13,585
But look at Iwai and Ko.

647
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,887
They’re so happy together, aren’t they?

648
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,523
And that’s when it hit me!

649
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,559
No matter who you fall in love with,

650
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,395
people can be happy.

651
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,831
So, even my son

652
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:29,134
is by no means unhappy.

653
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,769
Something as obvious as that

654
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:32,570
is what I've only just realized.

655
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,140
From the bottom of my heart…

656
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:37,976
I'm really…

657
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,645
I'm so grateful to you!

658
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,349
H-How is he, really?

659
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:50,455
- What do you mean?
- Is your son happy?

660
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:52,891
Well…

661
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:57,595
It seems he is! Isn't that right?

662
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,531
Yes. Incredibly so.

663
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,567
A happy ending?

664
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,537
Yes. I’d say it’s a happy ending for me!

665
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:09,374
Is that so?

666
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:12,443
If that's the case,

667
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:14,112
that’s good to hear!

668
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:15,146
Yes.

669
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,049
Alright, I’m taking it now…

670
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:20,218
Three, two, one!

671
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:22,554
Looks good.

672
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,723
U-Um, could we try a different pose?

673
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,624
Sure!

674
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:28,426
Let’s jump, Sakuta.

675
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,795
- Why?
- Ready, set, go!

676
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,530
Smile!

677
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:33,531
- Okay.
- Ready, set, go!

678
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:34,933
Nice!

679
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,100
Smile, okay?

680
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,435
Ready, set, go!

681
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,171
So, you’ve decided to believe in it?

682
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,340
None of your business.

683
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:44,609
I just really need something
to latch onto right now.

684
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,877
I recommend one place.

685
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:49,047
It’s old, but pets are allowed,

686
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:51,249
and the landlord is a really nice person…

687
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:52,684
Are you sure about that?

688
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,320
Have a look.

689
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:56,321
Hello.

690
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:58,289
Hello!

691
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,925
- Uh…
- This is Mr. Yoshida.

692
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:02,894
He wants to consult you, Mr. Okabe.

693
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:06,364
Welcome. Please have a seat.

694
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:09,567
Are you looking for a house?

695
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:10,602
- Yes.
- Okay.

696
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:11,669
Please give me a moment.

697
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:16,274
What kind of house are you looking for?

698
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:20,245
Well, one that can act as a "clamp".

699
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:21,079
- Huh?
- What?

700
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:22,347
- Really?
- What?

701
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:23,948
Wait, is that a trend now?

702
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:26,351
- I've heard about it before too.
- Is it a trend?

703
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,254
- I might have started the trend.
- What?

704
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,390
I suggested to someone
that if they wanted to stay together,

705
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:35,126
perhaps they would need a "clamp".

706
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:36,361
After hearing that,

707
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:39,030
they proposed buying a house
for their partner.

708
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:41,833
Does that person wear glasses?

709
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,334
- Do they own a dog?
- Do they sing?

710
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:45,503
Uh…

711
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,940
Ah! See? It's this place!

712
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,541
That person lives here!

713
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:51,743
I knew it!

714
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:53,845
- Right.
- What?

715
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,822
No one’s here right now.

716
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:06,991
Yeah.

717
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,004
Huh?

718
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,941
A tortoise?

719
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,143
Huh.

720
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:32,784
<i>When the rugosa roses</i>

721
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:37,088
<i>Bloom</i>

722
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:41,859
<i>On the Cape of Shiretoko…</i>

723
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,796
Hotaru.

724
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,497
Will you play for me?

725
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:48,700
I can't play the guitar.

726
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,602
Just give it a try.
You don't have to be perfect.

727
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:00,845
Sorry,

728
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:03,214
I'd like to have a talk with Saku.

729
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,429
- Oh, welcome back.
- I'm back.

730
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,566
Hotaru's got more talent than you do.

731
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:23,401
Maybe so.

732
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,770
Hey, I heard you two

733
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,638
are getting along nicely?

734
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:29,974
Hotaru has told me all about it.

735
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:30,908
That’s how I see it.

736
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:32,977
Come on.

737
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,246
Tell me about it!

738
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,414
I'll use it as material.

739
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:38,082
What material?

740
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:40,451
I’m thinking of drawing it myself.

741
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,486
A boys' love manga.

742
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:43,988
Please don't.

743
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:45,523
It's going to be my posthumous work!

744
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,624
Really now…

745
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,660
You’re always such a spoilsport!

746
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:52,764
Never mind.

747
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,567
I'll tell you.

748
00:33:58,102 --> 00:33:59,070
I'll tell you anything.

749
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,472
Anything, huh?

750
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,574
Is there anything else I can do?

751
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:05,977
Not really.

752
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,247
There’s nothing, really!

753
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,117
In that case, I'll sing.

754
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:17,855
- I’ll sing, so just listen.
- Huh?

755
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,224
Let’s start over.

756
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:22,927
Huh?

757
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:24,462
This time,

758
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:27,065
I’ll seriously think about
how we can stay together.

759
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,199
HOME FOR SALE

760
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,003
- Sorry.
- Huh?

761
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,573
I went with Hatano to file
our partnership registration,

762
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:38,276
and we plan to buy a house together.

763
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,346
You're really in love…

764
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,215
with that guy, huh?

765
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,652
I'm not sure if it's love or not,
be it a "clamp"

766
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:50,154
or "love and revolution"…

767
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:53,257
But I thought maybe
I could believe in that.

768
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:57,562
That just means you're
head over heels for him.

769
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:02,767
We’ll be happy our way,

770
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,802
so you do your thing and be happy too.

771
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,939
This isn't your happy ending, right?

772
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,276
- What's my happy ending?
- I don't know.

773
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:21,419
After playing the 5th fret,
press the 3rd fret.

774
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,421
Repeat the sequence three times.

775
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,655
That's it.

776
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:28,826
Your son will sing now.

777
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,496
"The Tortoise Song".

778
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:32,697
Ready, set, go!

<i>Snail-y, snail-y, shell so tough</i>
<i>Tip-tap, tip-tap, slow but rough</i>

784
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:59,123
<i>Sloshy, sloshy, wiggly feet</i>
<i>Scurry, scurry, tiny beat</i>

785
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:03,461
<i>Shell is hard, I’m feeling proud</i>

786
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:08,232
<i>Gonna live long, shout it loud</i>

787
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:12,770
<i>Snail-y, snail-y, stretch my neck</i>
<i>Tip-tap, tip-tap, what the heck</i>

788
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:17,074
<i>Sloshy, sloshy, wiggly feet</i>
<i>Scurry, scurry, tiny beat</i>

789
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:21,612

00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:26,284
<i>Gonna live a long, long time</i>

791
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:31,289
<i>Where am I? Oh, look around</i>

792
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,859
<i>What a lovely place I've found</i>

793
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:46,270
You did well, Hotaru.

794
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:02,820
<i>"It’s scary to put into words.</i>

795
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,723
<i>Because I didn’t believe</i>

796
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,960
<i>But I…</i>

797
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,229
<i>met you.</i>

798
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:17,401
<i>I love you.</i>

799
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,172
<i>Together, surely…"</i>

800
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:26,077
<i>"Finally…</i>

801
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,613
<i>you said it."</i>

<i>THREE STEPS TO A HAPPY ENDING</i>

803
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,525
Where's the convenience store?

804
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,893
- I'd like to go there.
- Okay.

805
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,228
Is it this way?

806
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,063
Do you need something?

807
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:49,300
I found a tortoise.

808
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:52,803
Ah! Okay.

809
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,538
- Please head this way.
- Okay.

GUARDING SMILES & PEACE OF MIND

811
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:59,510
Are you sure you can go home by yourself?

812
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:01,512
Yes, I'm sure.

813
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,014
Really?

814
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:06,751
Yes. I'm fine by myself from here.

815
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:07,852
Thank you.

816
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:14,158
I thought you were prepared for it, no?

817
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,127
I was, but…

818
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:19,463
No need to worry.
I’ll be in touch with you again.

819
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,600
Oh, last thing.

820
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,636
Can you just say this line here

821
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:26,904
for me?

822
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:29,874
No.

823
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:32,576
Spoilsport.

824
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:37,048
I'm sorry.

825
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:42,019
I'm sorry…

826
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,754
for everything.

827
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,160
Your mom…

828
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,697
is really happy now, you know?

829
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,037
Okay then.

830
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:02,506
Good luck.

831
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:06,377
See you.

832
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:26,897
I have something to announce.

833
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:28,866
Okay.

834
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,471
We’re officially partners now.

836
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:35,940
Uh…

837
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:38,542
Congratulations.

838
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:40,845
Since you’ve helped so much,

839
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:41,979
I thought we'd let you know.

840
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:43,681
Yeah.

841
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:46,684
About what's going forward…

842
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:48,652
Yes?

843
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,525
…I'll continue to act as your parent.

844
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:58,462
You can plan your future, and everything
beyond it, with peace of mind.

845
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:02,466
Whatever you decide,
Hatano and I have agreed to cooperate.

846
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:06,103
And, of course, as your teacher,
I’ll support you too.

847
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:12,276
- So, you’re not spending the 30 million?
- Nope.

848
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:15,746
You'd be violating the contract.
Are you sure about this?

849
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:18,783
If it wasn't for you, Hotaru, we probably

850
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:21,752
wouldn’t have become partners.
Me and Sakuta, that is.

851
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,089
So, thank you.

852
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,893
I hope we can continue from here on out.

853
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:31,695
Yes, please.

854
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,540
Alright, let’s decide
on your career path then.

855
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,276
- Already?
- What are you talking about?

856
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:47,978
The parent-teacher meeting
was two months ago!

857
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:49,513
- Right.
- Um…

858
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,483
I also have something to announce.

859
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,318
What is it?

860
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:56,821
I found…

861
00:40:57,354 --> 00:41:00,157
what I love and what I want to do freely.

862
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:03,894
And that is?

863
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,665
The guitar.

864
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:11,101
I love guitars.

865
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,139
Really?

866
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,775
I don't know why, but I'm happy about it.

867
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,711
Oh wow. What do we do,

868
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,780
- Sakuta?
- You're way too excited.

869
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:25,015
If you'd like,

870
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:27,918
I can teach you anytime,
as much as you want.

871
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,220
I don't mean the playing part.

872
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,255
- What?
- Huh?

873
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,690
I mean the making part.

874
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:36,126
I want to make guitars.

875
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,530
So, until my mom comes back,

876
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:41,532
I’ll be in your care.

881
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,046
<i>But it’s a little scary.</i>

882
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,115
<i>When I have things I love,</i>

883
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,385
<i>people who matter to me,</i>
<i>or my own happiness,</i>

884
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,921
<i>I keep thinking about</i>
<i>what would happen if I lost them.</i>

885
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,924
- Let’s eat together.
- Yeah!

00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:16,367

888
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:17,768
What do you think of here?

889
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:18,903
This condo here…

890
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:23,240

00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:51,635
- Ah, thank you.
- Please enjoy.

904
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,976
Doesn't this place look nice?

905
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,344
It has big windows too.

906
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,712
It faces west, though.

907
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,881
Life is going to be hell
in the late afternoons.

908
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:04,882
Is that right?

909
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:08,285
How about this one?

910
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:10,287
Which one?

911
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,658
I forgot you have poor eyesight.

912
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:17,828
It’s just the text is small.

913
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:22,099
Wait, this one is amazing!

914
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,443
Huh?

915
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,013
You’ll die one day too, right, Hatano?

916
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:40,451
I love you, Hatano.

917
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:45,122
You finally said it.

00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:53,397
