00:00:08,746 --> 00:00:10,515
The man he fell for

00:00:10,582 --> 00:00:12,050
is a gay middle school teacher,

Saku Sakuta.

7
00:00:13,084 --> 00:00:15,286
I broke up with my partner
and ended our cohabitation.

8
00:00:15,353 --> 00:00:16,721
I was spending the night in my car.

9
00:00:16,788 --> 00:00:18,556
What do you think about buying a house?

10
00:00:18,623 --> 00:00:20,091
Could you not come any closer?

11

Hotaru Kusunoki,

13
00:00:23,695 --> 00:00:25,296
is a 15-year-old Toyoko regular.

14
00:00:25,864 --> 00:00:27,532
That is when…

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,434
-What the?
-I'm buying you.

Party A’s mother, Tomoe Kusunoki,

19
00:00:35,206 --> 00:00:38,109
is wanted for embezzlement
from her company and is on the run.

20
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,111
Since then, I’ve been on my own.

21
00:00:40,178 --> 00:00:42,814
After hearing Hotaru's story,

22
00:00:42,881 --> 00:00:44,949
Genichi decides to pose as her dad.

23
00:00:45,016 --> 00:00:45,917
I'm Jin Ichigaya.

24
00:00:45,984 --> 00:00:47,452
Meanwhile, her actual dad…

25
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:48,853
Did Mom call you?

26
00:00:49,721 --> 00:00:52,824
…seems to be plotting something.

27
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:55,126
I left a suitcase.

28
00:00:55,193 --> 00:00:58,196
What’s inside belongs to us.

29
00:00:58,696 --> 00:01:00,165
I’m leaving it in your care.

30
00:01:00,231 --> 00:01:01,399
I'll be back.

Morning.

41
00:01:43,274 --> 00:01:46,077
I made too much breakfast.

42
00:01:46,144 --> 00:01:47,278
I always skip breakfast.

43
00:01:47,345 --> 00:01:49,547
I've got salmon, seaweed, kelp,

44
00:01:49,614 --> 00:01:51,149
-sesame and salt.
-Listen.

45
00:01:51,216 --> 00:01:53,051
-Pick whichever--
-I'm good.

46
00:01:53,117 --> 00:01:54,686
Oh, by any chance,

47
00:01:54,752 --> 00:01:57,789
are you one of those people
who can’t eat food made by others?

48
00:01:57,855 --> 00:01:59,324
That's not it.

49
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,959
You can rest assured.

50
00:02:01,025 --> 00:02:03,428
I wrapped them in cling film
before shaping them.

51
00:02:03,494 --> 00:02:04,629
As I said,

52
00:02:05,496 --> 00:02:07,732
-I don’t need any!
-Oh, I get it.

53
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,667
You wouldn't want anything

54
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:11,970
from an old guy like me.

55
00:02:12,036 --> 00:02:12,804
Right?

56
00:02:15,306 --> 00:02:16,274
May I have kelp, please?

57
00:02:16,341 --> 00:02:17,308
No need to force--

58
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,243
One kelp, please!

59
00:02:20,578 --> 00:02:22,547
-I'm starting to get hungry.
-Is that right?

60
00:02:22,614 --> 00:02:23,715
Then, here's your kelp.

61
00:02:27,385 --> 00:02:30,288
You really don’t have to mind me.
Once I find a place, I’ll move out.

62
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:34,225
If you want, I can introduce you
to a property agent.

63
00:02:34,292 --> 00:02:36,794
I've got a friend who works as one.

64
00:02:36,861 --> 00:02:39,264
-I'm sure he'll help you out.
-Oh, shoot!

65
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,599
Sorry, I'm running late.

66
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:42,634
Okay.

67
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,534
Sorry about this.

68
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:44,869

-Pick one you like.
-Hm?

74
00:02:55,513 --> 00:02:56,381
Your breakfast.

75
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:57,382
I'm fine with any.

76
00:02:58,049 --> 00:02:59,651
That's the hardest to work with.

77
00:02:59,717 --> 00:03:01,252
-Pick one--
-Salmon!

78
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,854

-Morning.

Go ahead.

00:03:06,224 --> 00:03:07,825
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

82
00:03:07,892 --> 00:03:09,560
Thank you!

83
00:03:11,529 --> 00:03:12,664
What's that?

Scavengers have been appearing lately.

85
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:17,035
They’re probably just hungry,

86
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:19,103
so I put this here to keep the crows away.

87
00:03:20,805 --> 00:03:22,040
Both of you should get going!

88
00:03:22,106 --> 00:03:23,241
-See you.
-See you.

00:03:25,576 --> 00:03:26,878
You can eat at least two, yes?

91
00:03:30,848 --> 00:03:33,117
You only need to act like my dad
when I ask you to.

92
00:03:33,184 --> 00:03:34,018
Huh?

93
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:35,820
Please don't get too involved.

00:03:36,354 --> 00:03:37,255
Bye.

95
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,930
But make sure you don't expose yourself
in front of my teacher!

96
00:03:45,997 --> 00:03:46,998

97
00:03:47,865 --> 00:03:49,500

A female employee is currently on the run.

On the second of this month,

in a company located in Suginami, Tokyo,

108
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:06,110
around 30 million yen

109
00:05:06,177 --> 00:05:08,780
was discovered missing.

00:05:08,846 --> 00:05:10,448
-Old news, huh?
-It was found that employee

111
00:05:10,515 --> 00:05:12,183
-What?
-Tomoe Kusunoki, age 43…

112
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,352
-I knew it. I've seen it before.
-Hey!

113
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:16,053
It was in the news a while back.

114
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,856
-Thirty million, eh? How nice.
-Police say the suspect, Kusunoki,

115
00:05:18,923 --> 00:05:22,560
has been missing
since the case came to light.

116
00:05:25,897 --> 00:05:26,898

Oh, come on now!

123
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:46,517
You were with him at the crepe place.

Weirdly confident.

186
00:08:10,094 --> 00:08:11,662
Anyone can tell you're a minor.

187
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:13,898
You should've told me before I queued up!

188
00:08:13,965 --> 00:08:14,865
Oh, Bayashiko!

189
00:08:14,932 --> 00:08:16,200
-Yo!
-What's up!

190
00:08:16,267 --> 00:08:17,802
What are you all doing?

191
00:08:17,868 --> 00:08:19,637
A game. Have a look!

192
00:08:20,338 --> 00:08:22,340
That cashier is crazy with the age checks.

193
00:08:22,406 --> 00:08:24,475
No matter how adult-like you act,
you can’t get past him.

194
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:26,310
Apparently, no one has ever succeeded.

195
00:08:26,377 --> 00:08:29,080
So, we're trying to see
who's able to succeed first.

196
00:08:29,146 --> 00:08:31,949
-Huh? What a dumb game!
-Thank you.

197
00:08:32,016 --> 00:08:33,217
What about that guy?

198
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:36,954
-No way he's a teen.
-Do you have something to prove your age?

199
00:08:37,021 --> 00:08:38,456
He's got to be an uncle.

200
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:39,724
I'm clearly an adult.

201
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,525
He looks every bit an old man.

202
00:08:43,394 --> 00:08:44,895
Sorry, sir,

203
00:08:44,962 --> 00:08:47,498
you’re under 20,
so I can’t sell you alcohol.

204
00:08:47,565 --> 00:08:49,800
-What? He's a minor?
-How did he know?

205
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:52,770
This is going to be a tough battle.

206
00:08:53,337 --> 00:08:54,939
We just gotta act like an adult, right?

207
00:08:55,606 --> 00:08:57,174
Like, worry about health exam results.

208
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:58,476
Or raise our voices on the phone.

209
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:00,277
Or talk endlessly about our younger days!

210
00:09:00,344 --> 00:09:01,812
That's it!

211
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,314
What are you all up to?

212
00:09:04,448 --> 00:09:05,883
-Or grow a beard.
-What?

213
00:09:06,651 --> 00:09:09,153
In any case, it's getting late.

214
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,054
Or being a busybody.

215
00:09:10,755 --> 00:09:12,790
Oh, this is such a stupid game!

216
00:09:13,491 --> 00:09:14,358
What's going on?

217
00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:17,762
REAL ESTATE SITE

218
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:19,730
Good evening.

219
00:09:20,297 --> 00:09:21,966
Sorry for intruding.

220
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:24,402
Oh, not at all.
Please make yourself at home.

221
00:09:24,468 --> 00:09:26,103
Not that I have any right to say so.

222
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,509
It was delicious. The rice ball, I meant.

223
00:09:32,643 --> 00:09:33,711
That's great to hear!

224
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:43,888
Sorry, but about my daughter…

225
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,158
What about her?

226
00:09:47,224 --> 00:09:49,427
How much do you know about her mom's case?

227
00:09:49,493 --> 00:09:52,329
Nothing beyond what’s in the news.

228
00:09:53,064 --> 00:09:53,898
Right.

229
00:09:53,964 --> 00:09:55,966
Did they not ask you for any details?

230
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:58,335
The police, I mean.
Since you’re her ex-husband.

231
00:09:59,804 --> 00:10:00,905
Well…

232
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,140
REAL ESTATE SITE

233
00:10:05,109 --> 00:10:08,112
About the property agent
I told you this morning…

234
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:09,580
I'm good, really.

235
00:10:09,647 --> 00:10:11,115
But…

236
00:10:11,182 --> 00:10:13,551
I’ve been depending on you a bit too much.

237
00:10:13,617 --> 00:10:16,253
I feel this isn’t really appropriate.

238
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,855
After all, we're teacher and parent.

239
00:10:17,922 --> 00:10:19,323
But that property agent…

240
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,524
Didn't you hear what I said?

241
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:23,461
Distance. Keep your distance.

242
00:10:23,527 --> 00:10:25,963
But this is really for your sake, Sakuta.

243
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,398
What does that mean?

244
00:10:27,465 --> 00:10:29,366
He’s really a great guy.

245
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:30,468
He even takes guys

246
00:10:30,534 --> 00:10:33,838
like us into account
when looking for a place.

247
00:10:34,872 --> 00:10:35,873
I'm good.

248
00:10:37,608 --> 00:10:39,110
You’ve already got a place in mind?

249
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:42,813
Not… yet.

250
00:10:43,614 --> 00:10:44,782
Then…

251
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,051
Okay?

252
00:10:48,552 --> 00:10:49,854
Very well.

253
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:52,289
-Please go ahead with it.
-Alright.

254
00:10:54,024 --> 00:10:55,126
See you.

255
00:10:55,926 --> 00:10:56,761
I'm home, Dad!

256
00:10:56,827 --> 00:10:58,262
Oh, welcome home.

257
00:10:58,329 --> 00:10:59,330
You're late.

258
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:02,500
Good night.

259
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,937
Good night…

260
00:11:10,574 --> 00:11:11,609
Good night!

261
00:11:14,044 --> 00:11:15,913
I met your dad today.

262
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,748
The real one.

263
00:11:17,815 --> 00:11:18,649
Where?

264
00:11:19,216 --> 00:11:20,351
The park.

265
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:21,519
It was purely coincidence.

266
00:11:21,585 --> 00:11:22,686
Did you guys talk?

267
00:11:22,753 --> 00:11:23,854
Not much.

268
00:11:23,921 --> 00:11:26,757
We just talked about the time
at the crepe place, and that's about it.

269
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,428
You'll still be here for a while, right?

270
00:11:31,996 --> 00:11:32,863
Yes.

271
00:11:33,731 --> 00:11:35,432
Until my teacher sleeps.

272
00:11:37,434 --> 00:11:39,670
Okay then, let's have dinner.

273
00:11:40,738 --> 00:11:42,239
Here you go.

274
00:11:45,242 --> 00:11:46,777
What do you usually eat?

275
00:11:46,844 --> 00:11:50,881
Discounted supermarket bento.

276
00:11:50,948 --> 00:11:53,284
And sometimes I make miso soup myself.

277
00:11:54,318 --> 00:11:57,321
Really? Okay, let's eat. Have a seat.

278
00:11:59,657 --> 00:12:02,259
Let's dig in!

279
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:04,762
Thank you…

280
00:12:13,437 --> 00:12:14,672
What, it doesn't taste good?

281
00:12:15,472 --> 00:12:16,340
No…

282
00:12:16,874 --> 00:12:18,442
It just tastes different.

283
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:19,410
What do you mean?

284
00:12:20,077 --> 00:12:20,911
From my mom's.

285
00:12:21,612 --> 00:12:22,446
How does hers taste?

286
00:12:22,513 --> 00:12:24,548
-She had a secret ingredient.
-Yeah?

287
00:12:24,615 --> 00:12:25,716
And it makes the soup mild.

288
00:12:25,783 --> 00:12:28,886
I see. What's the secret ingredient?

289
00:12:29,987 --> 00:12:31,455
-A secret.
-Figured.

290
00:12:33,057 --> 00:12:35,860
-What kind of person was your mom?
-Hm?

291
00:12:35,926 --> 00:12:38,462
Well, you know… It’d be weird
not to know, right?

292
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:41,532
Like her hobbies, personality, quirks…

293
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:45,436
-Are they similar to yours?
-Not at all.

294
00:12:45,502 --> 00:12:46,637
Be it looks or personality.

295
00:12:46,704 --> 00:12:47,771
Is that so?

296
00:12:50,808 --> 00:12:53,043
She just seemed like someone
who works really hard.

297
00:12:54,345 --> 00:12:55,546
She was doing her best

298
00:12:55,613 --> 00:12:57,147
at lots of things, I think.

299
00:12:57,214 --> 00:12:59,083
Then both of you are similar.

300
00:13:04,154 --> 00:13:05,256
I don't know.

302
00:13:08,392 --> 00:13:09,493
Wait, wait… Huh?

303
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,962
You’re going to pretend to be
that Kusunoki girl's parent

304
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:14,798
and her homeroom teacher
is on his way now? Huh?

305
00:13:14,865 --> 00:13:17,034
Sorry for dragging you into this.

306
00:13:17,101 --> 00:13:19,003
-This is entertaining!
-What?

307
00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:20,170
Leave it to me.

308
00:13:20,237 --> 00:13:21,272
I’ll help with anything.

309
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:24,875
Also, I’m supposed to go by my stage name.

310
00:13:24,942 --> 00:13:26,176
What stage name?

311
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:28,612
When I was aiming to be a musician…
Go along with it, okay?

312
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:30,381
Stage name…?

313
00:13:30,447 --> 00:13:31,382
Welcome!

314
00:13:32,483 --> 00:13:33,550
Over here.

315
00:13:34,184 --> 00:13:35,853
Hello. Nice to meet you.

316
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,154
Nice to meet you.

317
00:13:37,855 --> 00:13:39,657
I’m from Hibino Real Estate…

318
00:13:40,758 --> 00:13:41,592
and my name is Okabe.

319
00:13:43,093 --> 00:13:44,194
I'm Sakuta.

320
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:46,397
-Pleased to meet you.
-Same here.

321
00:13:46,463 --> 00:13:47,331
Have a seat.

322
00:13:47,398 --> 00:13:48,232
-Here.
-Thank you.

323
00:13:49,767 --> 00:13:50,601
Some water too.

324
00:13:52,202 --> 00:13:53,604
He roughly knows the situation.

325
00:13:55,606 --> 00:13:58,108
You're Kusunoki's homeroom teacher, right?

326
00:13:58,175 --> 00:13:59,243
Yes.

327
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,379
And I'm borrowing the yard
at Inokashira Apartments.

328
00:14:02,446 --> 00:14:03,714
Sorry for the late notification.

329
00:14:03,781 --> 00:14:06,884
No issues. As long as you’ve spoken
with the landlady,

330
00:14:06,951 --> 00:14:08,052
we’re fine.

331
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:09,687
-Thank you.
-Don't worry about it.

332
00:14:14,124 --> 00:14:16,794
Were both of you classmates
or something like that?

333
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,028
Oh, no.

334
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:20,998
It started when Genichi
was busking at the station…

335
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:23,434
So, people do call him by his stage name!

336
00:14:24,168 --> 00:14:25,169
Pardon?

337
00:14:26,203 --> 00:14:28,872
Yeah! Of course!

338
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:32,776
Right. His stage name…

339
00:14:33,444 --> 00:14:34,511
Genichi.

340
00:14:37,114 --> 00:14:38,582
Well then, let's get started right away.

341
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:39,850
Right.

342
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:42,619
Let’s start by hearing your requirements.

343
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,588
Okay.

344
00:14:44,655 --> 00:14:46,991
‎Please give me a moment.

345
00:14:50,194 --> 00:14:51,028
Um…

346
00:14:51,996 --> 00:14:53,397
I'm fine by myself from here on.

347
00:14:54,331 --> 00:14:55,366
Just in case, you know…

348
00:14:55,432 --> 00:14:57,701

BAYASHIKO IS TRYING
TO BYPASS THE AGE-CHECK TODAY!

351
00:15:10,447 --> 00:15:11,949
ALL TO GATHER AT THE CONVENIENCE STORE!

352
00:15:16,687 --> 00:15:19,223
-You scared me!
-My bad.

353
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:20,524
What is it?

354
00:15:20,591 --> 00:15:21,792
The other day,

355
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:25,562
some middle-aged man came by.

356
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:26,463
A man?

357
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,931
I don't know how to put it,

358
00:15:27,998 --> 00:15:29,033
but he had a shady vibe.

359
00:15:32,703 --> 00:15:34,638
-What's that?
-I'll leave this with you.

360
00:15:34,705 --> 00:15:36,440
Use this when things go south.

361
00:15:36,507 --> 00:15:37,408
-Huh?
-Take it.

362
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:40,511
Restrain him like this, okay?

363
00:15:40,577 --> 00:15:41,412
Hey, wait!

364
00:15:48,018 --> 00:15:50,454
DAD

365
00:15:53,624 --> 00:15:57,094
Based on your requirements,

366
00:15:57,728 --> 00:15:59,396
it’d be these few apartments.

367
00:15:59,463 --> 00:16:00,664
Thank you.

368
00:16:00,731 --> 00:16:02,099
Oh?

369
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,701
Is there any place that catches your eye?

370
00:16:04,768 --> 00:16:06,737
Let me see…

371
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:08,238
This one, maybe.

372
00:16:08,305 --> 00:16:09,740
I'm not asking you, Genichi.

373
00:16:09,807 --> 00:16:10,707
Right.

374
00:16:10,774 --> 00:16:14,678
Is there a place where I wouldn’t
have to run into the other residents?

375
00:16:14,745 --> 00:16:15,612
Huh?

376
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,915
I don’t really like people prying
into my business.

377
00:16:17,981 --> 00:16:19,883
Oh, okay.

378
00:16:21,752 --> 00:16:23,053
Is he aware of that?

379
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,288
No. I'll leave that to you.

380
00:16:25,989 --> 00:16:27,658
Well, uh…

381
00:16:27,724 --> 00:16:28,926
I'm gay as well.

382
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,361
Is that so?

383
00:16:31,962 --> 00:16:33,964
So, you’d prefer to avoid seeing people?

384
00:16:34,031 --> 00:16:35,432
At my previous place,

385
00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:37,868
I lived with my partner.

386
00:16:38,402 --> 00:16:41,238
People stared at us a lot
when we were together.

387
00:16:41,905 --> 00:16:43,507
This time, I’m living alone,

388
00:16:43,574 --> 00:16:45,509
so it’s fine as long as I’m careful.

389
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,312
I just thought I’d mention it,

390
00:16:49,613 --> 00:16:51,782
since I heard
you’re understanding about it.

391
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,917
I’m sure you already know,

392
00:16:53,984 --> 00:16:56,787
but these days, some properties
call themselves LGBTQ-friendly,

393
00:16:56,854 --> 00:16:59,756
and they don't discriminate
based on sexuality.

394
00:16:59,823 --> 00:17:01,592
There are a few places like that around.

395
00:17:01,658 --> 00:17:03,360
With your requirements however,

396
00:17:03,427 --> 00:17:05,896
there aren’t really any
I can recommend at the moment.

397
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:07,764
Based on what I've heard, though,

398
00:17:07,831 --> 00:17:10,367
the places that don’t seem discriminatory

399
00:17:10,434 --> 00:17:14,171
and seem like comfortable environments
are this… and this.

400
00:17:14,238 --> 00:17:16,840
What do you think?
Any you’d like to go see?

401
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,476
Let me think.

402
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,712
Hey, does this have rooftop access?

403
00:17:21,778 --> 00:17:24,314
Oh, yes. There's no balcony,
but in place of that…

404
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:27,284
Airing out the futon there
would feel so nice.

405
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:28,585
You could even stargaze, right?

406
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:30,921
Oh, that’s so nice. Don't you think so?

407
00:17:30,988 --> 00:17:32,156
This one too!

408
00:17:32,222 --> 00:17:33,857
You seem to be enjoying yourself.

409
00:17:34,424 --> 00:17:37,094
Sorry, I got too carried away.

410
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:41,899
Let’s check this one out
for the time being.

411
00:17:41,965 --> 00:17:44,334
Very well. Please wait a moment.

412
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,272
Your previous place

413
00:17:49,006 --> 00:17:50,574
was where you lived with Yoshida?

414
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:51,808
That's right.

415
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,810
He might still be living there alone.

416
00:17:54,545 --> 00:17:55,746
How are things since then?

417
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,548
What do you mean?

418
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:00,651
Well, between you and Yoshida.

419
00:18:01,318 --> 00:18:04,388
-Nothing happened, unfortunately.
-Unfortunately?

420
00:18:04,454 --> 00:18:06,290
You were hoping
we'd get back together, no?

421
00:18:06,957 --> 00:18:10,460
Oh, no. You shouldn't get back together.
Just let things move forward as they are.

422
00:18:11,828 --> 00:18:12,763
Huh?

423
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:15,232
We're able to do a viewing this weekend.
Does that work?

424
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,968
Hold on…

425
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:20,404
This weekend…

426
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:22,172
This weekend works.

427
00:18:24,274 --> 00:18:25,409
Huh?

428
00:18:26,043 --> 00:18:26,877
What?

429
00:18:26,944 --> 00:18:28,545
How was the parent-teacher meeting?

430
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:30,981
Have you decided on your path?

431
00:18:34,484 --> 00:18:35,752
Are you studying hard for exams?

432
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:38,355
Didn't I say not to interfere?
What's with you?

433
00:18:38,956 --> 00:18:40,624
No, you didn't.

434
00:18:40,691 --> 00:18:42,626
Please stop coming to my apartment too.

435
00:18:42,693 --> 00:18:44,361
450 YEN FOR CREPE

436
00:18:44,428 --> 00:18:45,295
You came, didn't you?

437
00:18:49,766 --> 00:18:50,934
The 30 million yen.

438
00:18:51,868 --> 00:18:52,836
Where did you hide it?

439
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,672
You must know something, right?

440
00:18:56,273 --> 00:18:57,140
No, I don't.

441
00:18:57,207 --> 00:19:00,210
But it’s weird
that it hasn’t been found yet.

442
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:01,778
Mom must've taken it and ran off.

443
00:19:01,845 --> 00:19:04,014
Or she may have hidden it somewhere.

444
00:19:07,017 --> 00:19:08,752
-Let me in your unit.
-Hell no.

445
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:10,721
I just need some cash.

446
00:19:11,455 --> 00:19:13,457
The police already searched
the entire place.

447
00:19:13,523 --> 00:19:16,326
Then what’s the problem?
I just want to check for myself.

448
00:19:16,393 --> 00:19:19,229
I just don’t like strangers
going inside my house.

449
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,398
What stranger?

450
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:23,767
You stopped being my dad, didn’t you?

451
00:19:25,602 --> 00:19:29,439
I still think of myself as your dad.

452
00:19:29,506 --> 00:19:30,674
Oh, shut up.

453
00:19:30,741 --> 00:19:33,076
Stop contacting me too.

454
00:19:44,154 --> 00:19:46,823
Thank you. Welcome.

455
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,592
Here.

456
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:49,793
Will it work?

457
00:19:57,734 --> 00:19:59,970
Do you have something to prove your age?

458
00:20:00,737 --> 00:20:02,205
I forgot to bring it with me.

459
00:20:02,272 --> 00:20:04,241
That totally failed, huh?

460
00:20:06,143 --> 00:20:07,311
Hey, Hotaru?

461
00:20:12,182 --> 00:20:13,050
What's wrong?

462
00:20:13,784 --> 00:20:15,085
-I'm buying this.
-Huh?

463
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,322
-Welcome.
-Here.

464
00:20:18,388 --> 00:20:19,489
‎TRUE ‎MIRIN

465
00:20:20,223 --> 00:20:22,159
Do you have something to prove your age?

466
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,663
True mirin contains alcohol,
so it can’t be sold to anyone under 20.

467
00:20:27,564 --> 00:20:28,398
No way.

468
00:20:29,032 --> 00:20:31,368
SAKUTA'S HOUSE VIEWING DATE

469
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:37,607
Sock?

470
00:20:37,674 --> 00:20:40,677
Yeah. It fell behind the washing machine.
The Santa-patterned one.

471
00:20:41,678 --> 00:20:44,614
Also, your mail is still coming here.

472
00:20:45,115 --> 00:20:46,416
Haven’t you set up forwarding?

473
00:20:46,983 --> 00:20:49,619
-Nope.
-I'll send them to you. Where do you live?

474
00:20:50,187 --> 00:20:51,288
I've got no address.

475
00:20:51,355 --> 00:20:53,557
-Huh?
-I’m sleeping in my car.

476
00:20:54,057 --> 00:20:55,359
You what?

477
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:56,626
Yeah.

478
00:20:56,693 --> 00:20:59,863
But it’s been two to three months
since you left.

479
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,199
I’ll let you know when I find a place!

480
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:04,668
Okay.

481
00:21:04,735 --> 00:21:05,569
Well then.

482
00:21:05,635 --> 00:21:07,437
SAKUTA

483
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:16,446
Was this on purpose?

484
00:21:26,723 --> 00:21:28,725
Do you live in this apartment?

485
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:29,926
Yeah, I guess.

486
00:21:29,993 --> 00:21:32,696
Do you know who lives
in the second-floor apartment?

487
00:21:32,763 --> 00:21:33,663
Or when they'll be back?

488
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:36,299
Not really.

489
00:21:36,366 --> 00:21:37,200
I see.

490
00:21:40,904 --> 00:21:42,172
-Ran away from home?
-What?

491
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,676
I get it. I really do.
Guys don’t have a place at home.

492
00:21:46,743 --> 00:21:48,945
That’s when you just retreat to the car.

493
00:21:50,914 --> 00:21:51,782
Well…

494
00:21:51,848 --> 00:21:53,917
Anyway, I’ll just be there waiting.

495
00:21:59,723 --> 00:22:01,958
-I can’t wait to be an adult!
-I know!

496
00:22:02,025 --> 00:22:03,693
I can then buy true mirin.

497
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,629
You really wanted that?

498
00:22:06,163 --> 00:22:07,397
What’ll you do first as an adult?

499
00:22:07,464 --> 00:22:08,365
Drink alcohol.

500
00:22:08,432 --> 00:22:09,433
Seriously?

501
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:11,868
I'M WAITING AT YOUR APARTMENT - DAD

502
00:22:14,871 --> 00:22:15,739
What's wrong?

503
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,242
It's nothing.

504
00:22:55,178 --> 00:22:57,280
Ouch…

505
00:23:00,484 --> 00:23:01,718
It's me.

506
00:23:01,785 --> 00:23:02,752
Coming.

507
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,489
-Good morning.
-I'm back.

508
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,958
You just came back?

509
00:23:08,024 --> 00:23:09,926
Mr. Sakuta has already woken up.

510
00:23:10,594 --> 00:23:12,829
Hey, where were you?

511
00:23:14,498 --> 00:23:15,565
Toyoko?

512
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:18,535
Is everything okay?
Isn't that place dangerous?

513
00:23:19,102 --> 00:23:20,270
I never asked.

514
00:23:20,971 --> 00:23:23,406
I never asked you to worry
or make me meals.

515
00:23:23,473 --> 00:23:25,375
Stop acting on your own and getting mad.

516
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:27,611
What?

517
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:31,515
Did any suspicious person come by?

518
00:23:32,415 --> 00:23:33,350
Suspicious person?

519
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,285
Never mind.

520
00:23:36,253 --> 00:23:37,954
I’ll head back to my room soon.

521
00:23:44,961 --> 00:23:47,163
UNIFORM

522
00:23:49,432 --> 00:23:51,902
TOMOE KUSUNOKI EMBEZZLEMENT WITNESS

523
00:23:51,968 --> 00:23:54,170
NO RESULTS FOUND FOR THOSE KEYWORDS

524
00:24:00,043 --> 00:24:02,879
-Sakuta.
-Yes?

525
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:06,616
Being a parent… It’s hard.

526
00:24:07,183 --> 00:24:09,119
Whether I make her meals
or worry about her,

527
00:24:10,253 --> 00:24:12,155
she said it’s none of my business.

528
00:24:12,222 --> 00:24:15,759
Oh, that’s exactly what I imagined.

529
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,794
What?

530
00:24:17,861 --> 00:24:18,929
Of a parent-child fight.

531
00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:23,567
‎Really?

532
00:24:25,068 --> 00:24:27,837
Ah, sorry for the wait.
I’ll unlock it now.

533
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,838
Thank you.

534
00:24:28,905 --> 00:24:30,874
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

535
00:24:32,108 --> 00:24:33,343
Are you siblings?

536
00:24:34,277 --> 00:24:36,446
-No.
-Friends?

537
00:24:36,513 --> 00:24:38,682
Two people might find it a bit small.

538
00:24:38,748 --> 00:24:40,617
Oh, no. I’m just accompanying him.

539
00:24:41,184 --> 00:24:43,286
This is Mr. Sakuta,
the one interested in the unit.

540
00:24:43,353 --> 00:24:44,821
Oh, sorry about that.

541
00:24:44,888 --> 00:24:46,289
Feel free to look around.

542
00:24:46,923 --> 00:24:48,758
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

543
00:24:49,392 --> 00:24:52,228
It’s about 30 square meters.

544
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,665
It’s an old place,

545
00:24:55,732 --> 00:24:57,434
but it’s been renovated a few times,

546
00:24:58,068 --> 00:24:59,736
so the bath and kitchen areas are clean.

547
00:24:59,803 --> 00:25:00,937
Oh, you're right.

548
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,442
It's nice that it’s got a dryer.

549
00:25:05,508 --> 00:25:06,810
Isn't that the best?

550
00:25:07,477 --> 00:25:10,113
The kitchen faces the entrance,

551
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,548
so you may find it a bit cramped.

552
00:25:12,148 --> 00:25:13,116
Well…

553
00:25:13,183 --> 00:25:15,452
I mostly eat out, so it's totally fine.

554
00:25:15,518 --> 00:25:17,854
Yeah, no problem at all.

555
00:25:17,921 --> 00:25:18,989
That's great to hear.

556
00:25:24,427 --> 00:25:27,030
This is apparently
the landlord’s favorite color.

557
00:25:27,931 --> 00:25:29,566
It's quite unique, to say the least.

558
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:31,835
Yeah, a little, isn’t it?

559
00:25:31,901 --> 00:25:33,670
That’s a nice color!

560
00:25:33,737 --> 00:25:34,971
Yeah, yeah, really nice.

561
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:35,905
Which is it?

562
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,779
I think it’s very cute.

563
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,683
I find it a bit unsettling.

564
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,851
Right.

565
00:25:48,451 --> 00:25:52,022
The room in the back
is the only one that has tatami flooring.

566
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:54,591
Oh, tatami!

567
00:25:54,658 --> 00:25:56,359
Ah, sorry.

568
00:25:56,426 --> 00:25:57,927
-One moment.
-Sure.

569
00:26:02,532 --> 00:26:03,733
Tatami, huh?

570
00:26:04,267 --> 00:26:06,002
Isn't tatami nice?

571
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,005
My parents' home had tatami flooring.

572
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,307
Back then,

573
00:26:11,374 --> 00:26:14,711
I envied my friends'
shiny hardwood floors,

574
00:26:14,778 --> 00:26:15,879
but in the end,

575
00:26:15,945 --> 00:26:18,915
it’s just so comforting.
The smell and all.

576
00:26:18,982 --> 00:26:19,883
Is it a detached house?

577
00:26:19,949 --> 00:26:21,084
Yep.

578
00:26:21,618 --> 00:26:23,653
-Was it a "clamp"?
-What?

579
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,923
I was wondering if using the house
as a clamp actually worked.

580
00:26:27,724 --> 00:26:29,826
My dad and mom are still together.

581
00:26:29,893 --> 00:26:32,529
Whether it’s thanks to the house,
I’m not sure, though.

582
00:26:32,595 --> 00:26:33,663
Okay.

583
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,800
What was your parents' home like, Sakuta?

584
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:42,038
It had lots of rooms.
I guess it was a lively place.

585
00:26:42,872 --> 00:26:44,407
Oh, so you had, like, a big family?

586
00:26:44,474 --> 00:26:46,142
No, I grew up in a facility.

587
00:26:46,209 --> 00:26:48,211
I didn't have parents
ever since I was born.

588
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,647
I was raised in a nursery,

589
00:26:50,714 --> 00:26:52,749
then I went straight to an orphanage.

590
00:26:53,983 --> 00:26:55,185
It was fun.

591
00:26:55,985 --> 00:26:58,421
I had many close friends,

592
00:26:59,222 --> 00:27:00,957
and the food was amazing.

593
00:27:01,958 --> 00:27:02,959
Um…

594
00:27:04,194 --> 00:27:05,428
You've been through a lot, huh?

595
00:27:05,495 --> 00:27:06,629
Not really.

596
00:27:07,363 --> 00:27:08,765
Everyone's been through stuff, no?

597
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:11,935
Hotaru, and even you, Hatano.

598
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:14,137
My situation is nothing special.

599
00:27:14,871 --> 00:27:16,973
Me? I didn't really…

600
00:27:21,411 --> 00:27:22,345
What's the matter?

601
00:27:23,613 --> 00:27:26,049
There's people flirting out there.

602
00:27:28,017 --> 00:27:30,820
If we can see their flirting from here,

603
00:27:30,887 --> 00:27:33,223
that means the flirting on this side

604
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:35,091
can be seen by them too, right?

605
00:27:35,158 --> 00:27:38,194
What, do you have plans to flirt?

606
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:46,002
I wonder how we look
from their point of view.

607
00:27:47,003 --> 00:27:47,837
Huh?

608
00:27:47,904 --> 00:27:49,038
The two of us.

609
00:27:49,105 --> 00:27:50,440
Even earlier,

610
00:27:50,507 --> 00:27:52,842
we were mistaken for siblings and friends.

611
00:27:55,345 --> 00:27:57,881
If a guy and a girl are together,
people just assume

612
00:27:57,947 --> 00:27:59,916
they’re a couple, right?

613
00:28:00,483 --> 00:28:02,652
So, why is it different for two guys?

614
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:04,954
But we’re not actually dating.

615
00:28:05,922 --> 00:28:07,957
Well, yeah. That’s true,

616
00:28:08,024 --> 00:28:11,494
but I can’t help feeling a little jealous.

617
00:28:18,434 --> 00:28:19,969
The door color…

618
00:28:20,036 --> 00:28:22,806
It's starting to look kind of cute now.

619
00:28:30,046 --> 00:28:32,582
Sorry for the wait. How’s it looking?

620
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:35,251
-Oh, sorry. I wanted to ask…
-Yes?

621
00:28:35,318 --> 00:28:38,888
About the security deposit…

622
00:28:42,392 --> 00:28:45,628
HIGH SCHOOL PAMPHLET

623
00:29:02,078 --> 00:29:03,413
-Hey.
-What the?

624
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:04,747
Can I come in for a sec?

625
00:29:04,814 --> 00:29:05,682
No.

626
00:29:05,748 --> 00:29:08,318
I just want to check if the money
is in there or not.

627
00:29:08,384 --> 00:29:09,219
Please leave.

628
00:29:09,285 --> 00:29:10,820
Come on. It'll be quick.

629
00:29:11,788 --> 00:29:13,623
-Leave!
-Be quiet.

630
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,959
-Leave!
-Hey, let me in, will you?

631
00:29:16,025 --> 00:29:17,126
-Come on!
-No!

632
00:29:17,193 --> 00:29:18,528
Hey, you! What are you doing?

633
00:29:19,562 --> 00:29:21,331
No, it's nothing.

634
00:29:21,397 --> 00:29:23,833
Use the man catcher, Kusunoki!
The one I gave you!

635
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,802
You're misunderstanding.
Don't raise your voice.

636
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:27,503
It's really nothing.

637
00:29:28,271 --> 00:29:29,305
Hey, that's dangerous!

638
00:29:29,372 --> 00:29:30,840
What's wrong with you?

639
00:29:31,374 --> 00:29:32,909
Hey, it's dangerous!

640
00:29:34,677 --> 00:29:36,012
And what's with those cries?

641
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,313
Stop shouting!

642
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,549
Hey! Stop! Ouch!

643
00:29:39,616 --> 00:29:41,584
-Am I doing it right?
-Ouch!

644
00:29:41,651 --> 00:29:43,720
Yes! What should I do?

645
00:29:43,786 --> 00:29:46,055
Stop going for my shank!

646
00:29:46,122 --> 00:29:47,090
What's your deal?

647
00:29:47,891 --> 00:29:50,393
Will you be looking at other places too?

648
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,195
I'd like to decide
after seeing a few more.

649
00:29:52,862 --> 00:29:53,863
Sounds good.

650
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,365
-What should I do…?
-Huh?

651
00:29:56,332 --> 00:29:58,902
-What's wrong?
-Come with me, quick!

652
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:00,737
Okay.

653
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:06,075
Why are you like this?
I'll leave after seeing it for myself.

654
00:30:06,142 --> 00:30:07,911
This is Mom’s and my home!

655
00:30:08,745 --> 00:30:11,748
You're hiding it, right? Give me the key.

656
00:30:11,814 --> 00:30:13,483
-Hey!
-Coming through!

657
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:15,418
-Excuse me! Coming through!
-Hey!

658
00:30:15,485 --> 00:30:16,686
Stop this!

659
00:30:17,954 --> 00:30:19,589
-Hey!
-What's this?

660
00:30:25,028 --> 00:30:26,963
-The key.
-What?

661
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,765
Just pass me the key!

662
00:30:31,534 --> 00:30:32,835
Come on.

663
00:30:32,902 --> 00:30:34,103
Leave.

664
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:36,306
-What's going on?
-He's a suspicious person.

665
00:30:36,372 --> 00:30:37,674
-Who're you calling that!
-Hey, now.

666
00:30:38,274 --> 00:30:39,475
What now?

667
00:30:39,542 --> 00:30:41,878
Um… Who may you be?

668
00:30:45,048 --> 00:30:46,249
I'm her dad. Why?

669
00:30:48,017 --> 00:30:49,385
-What?
-Oh my.

670
00:30:50,353 --> 00:30:52,488
You know her mom's case, right?

671
00:30:53,456 --> 00:30:54,324
Well…

672
00:30:55,191 --> 00:30:56,225
‎Yeah.

673
00:30:56,292 --> 00:30:58,094
I’m looking for the stolen money.

674
00:30:59,128 --> 00:31:00,630
If she’s hiding it,

675
00:31:01,197 --> 00:31:02,899
I’ll need to report it to the police.

676
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,201
And I’m worried about her.

677
00:31:06,202 --> 00:31:09,238
Sorry for the ruckus.
This is a private family matter.

678
00:31:09,305 --> 00:31:11,074
You all can leave now.
And remove this too.

679
00:31:13,543 --> 00:31:14,444
Then,

680
00:31:15,244 --> 00:31:16,713
why didn’t you come until now?

681
00:31:17,347 --> 00:31:18,181
What?

682
00:31:18,715 --> 00:31:21,684
-You're just her neighbor, right?
-No.

683
00:31:22,385 --> 00:31:24,787
Are you perhaps
from the child guidance center?

684
00:31:24,854 --> 00:31:25,989
No.

685
00:31:26,055 --> 00:31:27,857
Oh, then you must be her teacher.

686
00:31:27,924 --> 00:31:29,959
Ah, that'd be me.

687
00:31:30,026 --> 00:31:30,860
Right.

688
00:31:30,927 --> 00:31:32,095
Then, you're the landlord?

689
00:31:32,161 --> 00:31:33,229
That'd be me.

690
00:31:33,296 --> 00:31:35,031
Okay. Then…

691
00:31:39,836 --> 00:31:40,803
I'm her dad.

692
00:31:42,672 --> 00:31:43,806
Huh?

693
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,542
I'm her dad!

694
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,244
Huh?

695
00:31:50,613 --> 00:31:52,482
He's my new dad.

696
00:31:52,548 --> 00:31:54,784
She's right. He's her dad.

697
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:56,552
Nice to meet you. I'm her dad.

698
00:31:58,187 --> 00:31:59,956
What kind of crap are you pulling?

699
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:04,827
-I mean, you're gay, no?
-Hey!

700
00:32:06,295 --> 00:32:08,231
A gay person calling himself
a dad is weird.

701
00:32:08,297 --> 00:32:09,332
Come on!

702
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:11,701
-It's not weird at all!
-Huh?

703
00:32:11,768 --> 00:32:14,037
What’s wrong with a gay dad?

704
00:32:14,103 --> 00:32:15,338
-Am I right?
-Yes.

705
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,740
It's not weird. It's awesome.

706
00:32:18,741 --> 00:32:20,910
Look, we’re blood-related here.

707
00:32:21,411 --> 00:32:23,780
Well, I’ve been
to a parent-teacher conference,

708
00:32:23,846 --> 00:32:25,748
spoken to the police,

709
00:32:26,282 --> 00:32:28,284
eaten ice cream together, shared shishamo,

710
00:32:28,351 --> 00:32:30,019
miso soup and rice balls…

711
00:32:31,354 --> 00:32:32,688
Whether to scold her or not,

712
00:32:32,755 --> 00:32:34,357
I wondered about that,
and I worried for her.

713
00:32:35,691 --> 00:32:37,527
I've been told I didn’t have to do that,

714
00:32:37,593 --> 00:32:38,961
so what does that make me?

715
00:32:39,662 --> 00:32:40,663
Nothing, duh.

716
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:43,032
I'm the one who seems
more like a parent, no?

717
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:44,267
Yes, you very much do!

718
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:45,334
Isn't that right?

719
00:32:45,968 --> 00:32:47,170
What?

720
00:32:47,236 --> 00:32:49,405
That's not the point here.

721
00:32:49,472 --> 00:32:52,075
Then what is?
This kind of stuff matters, right?

722
00:32:53,276 --> 00:32:55,578
So, you’re after the 30 million too?

723
00:32:55,645 --> 00:32:56,746
Too?

724
00:32:56,813 --> 00:32:59,248
You guys are in on it too?

725
00:33:00,016 --> 00:33:01,717
Planning to split it all, huh?

726
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:03,586
That's not it.

727
00:33:03,653 --> 00:33:06,089
Then what's the deal?
You’re a teacher, right?

728
00:33:06,155 --> 00:33:07,890
You're letting this guy do what he wants?

729
00:33:10,426 --> 00:33:12,862
Okay, I'm calling the police.

730
00:33:12,929 --> 00:33:13,796
Huh?

731
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,498
-What?
-Um…

732
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:18,334
Wait, please!

733
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:24,140
Fine.

734
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,243
Give me the key,
and I won’t call the police.

735
00:33:32,882 --> 00:33:33,749
Huh?

736
00:33:34,283 --> 00:33:37,386
Whatever. Look as much as you want.

737
00:33:37,453 --> 00:33:38,287
But…

738
00:33:38,921 --> 00:33:40,456
It's for your sake, Dad.

739
00:33:40,523 --> 00:33:42,625
-What did I say?
-I'm not referring to you.

740
00:33:43,226 --> 00:33:44,460
It's him I'm talking about.

741
00:33:46,262 --> 00:33:47,363
Is that so?

742
00:33:53,836 --> 00:33:54,670
Will it be alright?

743
00:33:54,737 --> 00:33:55,905
Sorry about this.

744
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:57,373
You sure about this?

745
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,409
There’s no money in my unit anyway.

746
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:05,114
In other words, it's somewhere else?

747
00:34:05,181 --> 00:34:06,382
Is that true?

748
00:34:06,949 --> 00:34:10,052
So, that person earlier was Jin Ichigaya?

749
00:34:13,089 --> 00:34:15,057
You’ve been lying all this time?

750
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,594
Can both of you

751
00:34:19,362 --> 00:34:23,299
give me some explanation?

752
00:34:48,224 --> 00:34:49,825
What the hell?

753
00:34:55,464 --> 00:34:57,400
CHASU

754
00:34:57,466 --> 00:34:59,335
CHAN

755
00:35:02,238 --> 00:35:03,272
What do I do with this?

756
00:35:04,407 --> 00:35:06,609
PARTY A: HOTARU KUSUNOKI
PARTY B: GENICHI HATANO

757
00:35:06,676 --> 00:35:07,743
PARENT-CHILD CONTRACT

758
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,046
Parent-Child Contract?

759
00:35:10,112 --> 00:35:12,415
Landlady, were you aware of this too?

760
00:35:14,884 --> 00:35:16,819
Yeah. About pretending to be her parent.

761
00:35:17,453 --> 00:35:18,788
The 30 million yen though…

762
00:35:19,755 --> 00:35:20,656
surprised me.

763
00:35:32,268 --> 00:35:33,402
Dang it!

764
00:35:33,469 --> 00:35:35,404
BANKBOOK

765
00:35:39,008 --> 00:35:40,276
Found nothing, right?

766
00:35:40,843 --> 00:35:42,478
Please don’t ever come back again.

767
00:35:44,247 --> 00:35:45,448
Remember, I'm your dad.

768
00:35:46,749 --> 00:35:48,117
Are you hungry, by any chance?

769
00:35:48,184 --> 00:35:49,051
Huh?

770
00:35:49,118 --> 00:35:52,221
Hunger can make you do bad things.
Like crows.

771
00:35:52,855 --> 00:35:54,323
Don’t compare me to them!

772
00:35:55,992 --> 00:35:57,093
Bye!

773
00:36:02,064 --> 00:36:04,133
-Has your dad left?
-Yes.

774
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,905
What, the cash is in there?

775
00:36:15,778 --> 00:36:16,812
Well…

776
00:36:16,879 --> 00:36:19,148
It's not really what I expected.

777
00:36:19,215 --> 00:36:20,683
I imagined gold coins.

778
00:36:21,484 --> 00:36:24,086
Okay, you can put that away now.

779
00:36:24,153 --> 00:36:25,354
Okay.

780
00:36:28,257 --> 00:36:29,458
The man catcher…

781
00:36:30,092 --> 00:36:32,161
I'll prepare more of them.

782
00:36:32,962 --> 00:36:34,063
Have a good rest.

783
00:36:45,508 --> 00:36:46,342
Here.

784
00:36:51,013 --> 00:36:52,448
Sorry about this.

785
00:36:53,816 --> 00:36:56,319
-What?
-I made you lie.

786
00:36:57,053 --> 00:36:59,322
It's not really your fault.

787
00:37:00,756 --> 00:37:03,059
I don’t have parents,

788
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:04,627
and I like guys.

789
00:37:04,694 --> 00:37:05,728
Huh?

790
00:37:05,795 --> 00:37:08,364
I used to make up fake parents
and fake girlfriends

791
00:37:08,431 --> 00:37:09,999
and tell my friends about them.

792
00:37:10,499 --> 00:37:13,336
Then, it got exhausting.

793
00:37:14,704 --> 00:37:18,007
I even kept a notebook
to keep my lies consistent.

794
00:37:19,975 --> 00:37:20,843
But…

795
00:37:21,811 --> 00:37:25,348
I lost track of what I said to who,
and everything started falling apart.

796
00:37:25,915 --> 00:37:27,783
So, I just stopped hiding it.

797
00:37:28,851 --> 00:37:30,920
But at school…

798
00:37:31,754 --> 00:37:33,356
no one knows, right?

799
00:37:34,156 --> 00:37:37,526
I’m not hiding it,
I just choose who I tell.

800
00:37:38,961 --> 00:37:39,862
I see.

801
00:37:41,464 --> 00:37:43,432
So, I'm sorry.

802
00:37:45,034 --> 00:37:47,169
I get how hard it is
to keep up appearances.

803
00:37:48,437 --> 00:37:50,239
So, Mr. Hatano knows too?

804
00:37:51,006 --> 00:37:52,808
Yeah.

805
00:37:55,044 --> 00:37:57,580
Why did you ask for Hatano's help?

806
00:37:57,646 --> 00:37:58,481
Huh?

807
00:37:59,348 --> 00:38:01,050
Is it because he lives here too?

808
00:38:03,352 --> 00:38:05,421
Or is it because he's gay?

809
00:38:10,025 --> 00:38:11,894
I thought he's similar.

810
00:38:12,628 --> 00:38:13,562
What do you mean?

811
00:38:14,363 --> 00:38:15,431
His looks?

812
00:38:19,368 --> 00:38:20,669
How he's doing his best.

813
00:38:32,782 --> 00:38:35,951
Mr. Sakuta said he's got the gist of it,
so he'll think it over.

814
00:38:36,652 --> 00:38:37,653
Think what over?

815
00:38:39,121 --> 00:38:41,757
I also heard he didn't have parents
and that he's gay.

816
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:44,960
-From Sakuta?
-Yes.

817
00:38:47,863 --> 00:38:50,332
Right, dinner.

818
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,702
The cat's already out of the bag,
so I'm returning to my unit.

819
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:54,837
Oh, okay.

820
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,974
But…

821
00:39:00,743 --> 00:39:02,545
-As my current dad,
-Yes?

822
00:39:02,611 --> 00:39:04,213
I've got a favor to ask of you.

823
00:39:07,383 --> 00:39:08,417
Welcome.

824
00:39:08,484 --> 00:39:09,218
TRUE MIRIN

825
00:39:09,285 --> 00:39:10,119
Here.

826
00:39:12,755 --> 00:39:14,190
I’m with my dad today.

827
00:39:17,593 --> 00:39:18,427
Hi.

828
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:23,332
451 yen, please.

829
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:24,733
Glad you could buy it!

830
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,602
You did it!

831
00:39:26,669 --> 00:39:30,306
Yay!

832
00:39:30,372 --> 00:39:32,174
Though, that's a little unfair.

833
00:39:32,241 --> 00:39:33,375
COFFEE TO GO

834
00:39:33,442 --> 00:39:35,211
We'll be going first.

835
00:39:35,277 --> 00:39:37,179
Having a parent is convenient after all.

836
00:39:37,246 --> 00:39:39,348
How nice to be you.
It does seem convenient.

837
00:39:40,015 --> 00:39:41,884
Can you pretend to be my dad too?

838
00:39:41,951 --> 00:39:42,885
What?

839
00:39:42,952 --> 00:39:44,553
I'm just joking.

840
00:39:45,754 --> 00:39:47,256
Hey, you don't have a dad?

841
00:39:48,424 --> 00:39:50,793
I do, but it's, like, better
if he’s not around.

842
00:39:52,595 --> 00:39:53,662
Wanna keep playing?

843
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,232
Nah. I’m heading home. See you.

844
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,302
TRUE MIRIN

845
00:40:01,136 --> 00:40:03,939
Hey, is that your mom’s secret ingredient?

846
00:40:04,673 --> 00:40:06,275
Yes, that's right.

847
00:40:06,876 --> 00:40:08,644
Hey, are you always hanging out here?

848
00:40:10,045 --> 00:40:11,313
This place is awful, isn’t it?

849
00:40:11,814 --> 00:40:12,681
Huh?

850
00:40:12,748 --> 00:40:14,717
It's dirty and scary.

851
00:40:16,018 --> 00:40:17,353
But somehow, it mattered to me.

852
00:40:17,987 --> 00:40:20,489
I kept wondering why.

853
00:40:20,556 --> 00:40:21,457
Uh-huh.

854
00:40:21,524 --> 00:40:23,292
And maybe it's because I chose it myself.

855
00:40:28,864 --> 00:40:29,765
I see.

856
00:40:35,804 --> 00:40:38,407
TRUE MIRIN

857
00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:46,181
After the beep tone,

858
00:40:46,248 --> 00:40:48,951
please leave your name and message.

859
00:40:49,652 --> 00:40:51,153
Hello, Mom?

860
00:40:51,887 --> 00:40:54,590
I need to start deciding on my future.

861
00:40:54,657 --> 00:40:56,492
Like, which high school to go to.

862
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,395
Choosing is hard, isn't it?

863
00:40:59,461 --> 00:41:01,363
Even stuff like what goes in my rice ball

864
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,766
or who I tell my secrets to.

865
00:41:03,832 --> 00:41:05,267
It’s really tough.

866
00:41:06,201 --> 00:41:07,436
Coming.

867
00:41:07,503 --> 00:41:08,671
-But…
-Yes?

868
00:41:08,737 --> 00:41:10,239
I’ll do my best to choose carefully.

869
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,543
So I can take care
of everything around me.

870
00:41:16,278 --> 00:41:18,581
Starting with
today’s miso soup ingredients.

871
00:41:21,116 --> 00:41:22,918
Talk to you soon. Bye.

872
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,854

It's a draw.

00:41:47,109 --> 00:41:48,844
Excuse me!

876
00:41:48,911 --> 00:41:49,812
Yes?

877
00:41:49,878 --> 00:41:51,714
Sorry.

878
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,681
Uh…

879
00:41:53,282 --> 00:41:54,917
The day before yesterday,

880
00:41:54,984 --> 00:41:58,787
or maybe the day before that, I think,
I sent a letter to Tokyo.

881
00:41:58,854 --> 00:42:00,756
-Right.
-Has it arrived by any chance?

882
00:42:00,823 --> 00:42:03,726
Normally, it should be there by now.

883
00:42:04,593 --> 00:42:05,427
Is that right?

884
00:42:05,494 --> 00:42:07,363
Did you send it out by mistake, perhaps?

885
00:42:07,429 --> 00:42:08,330
Why do you ask?

886
00:42:08,397 --> 00:42:10,099
You sound like you wished
it wasn't sent out.

887
00:42:10,165 --> 00:42:12,334
Ah, no…

00:42:13,135 --> 00:42:13,969
I’m not sure.

890
00:42:15,537 --> 00:42:16,972
Maybe I did send it to the wrong place.

891
00:42:19,308 --> 00:42:21,677
I honestly don’t know myself too.

892
00:42:26,248 --> 00:42:27,950
-I thought about it,
-Uh-huh.

893
00:42:28,517 --> 00:42:31,420
and honestly, I don’t know what to do.

894
00:42:31,487 --> 00:42:32,621
Right.

895
00:42:32,688 --> 00:42:34,490
Why did you pretend to be her parent?

896
00:42:34,556 --> 00:42:35,557
Huh?

897
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:39,795
I mean, there are the police,
the child guidance center, and so on.

898
00:42:39,862 --> 00:42:42,264
There are many places out there
to support Hotaru.

899
00:42:42,865 --> 00:42:46,802
And yet, you still went out of your way
to act as her dad.

900
00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:48,170
I really don’t get it.

901
00:42:50,305 --> 00:42:52,141
Are you in it for the money?

902
00:42:52,207 --> 00:42:53,876
-What?
-The 30 million yen.

903
00:42:53,942 --> 00:42:56,412
Oh, not at all. I don't know if that money

904
00:42:56,478 --> 00:42:57,613
was from embezzlement, but…

905
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,548
I'm sure it's meant for Hotaru.

906
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,351
Then…

907
00:43:03,185 --> 00:43:05,354
is there another reason?

908
00:43:06,088 --> 00:43:08,524
Because I was asked to pretend
to be her parent.

909
00:43:09,124 --> 00:43:11,193
Do you do everything someone asks?

910
00:43:12,394 --> 00:43:13,228
She was in a fix.

-Are you always like this?
-What?

912
00:43:16,231 --> 00:43:18,067
This is not the first time
this has happened.

913
00:43:18,133 --> 00:43:19,635
Whether it's using a house as a clamp,

914
00:43:19,702 --> 00:43:21,437
introducing me to this place,

915
00:43:21,503 --> 00:43:22,471
or finding an apartment--

916
00:43:22,538 --> 00:43:24,940
That's… different.

917
00:43:25,007 --> 00:43:25,908
How so?

918
00:43:28,944 --> 00:43:31,246
That's because I was worried.

919
00:43:32,748 --> 00:43:36,318
Yeah, because I was in a fix, right?

920
00:43:36,385 --> 00:43:37,219
Oh, no.

921
00:43:37,886 --> 00:43:39,788
That's not exactly it.

922
00:43:39,855 --> 00:43:41,056
Then, what is it?

923
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:44,760
Look…

924
00:43:45,461 --> 00:43:46,895
I won't know if you don't tell.

925
00:43:48,897 --> 00:43:50,299
I like you.

926
00:43:52,534 --> 00:43:53,802
Sorry, what?

927
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:54,870
I said…

928
00:43:57,172 --> 00:43:58,240
I like you!

929
00:44:03,512 --> 00:44:04,379
Huh?

930
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,449
