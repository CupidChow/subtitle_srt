Lord or God, neither is related.

19
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,870
I told you that anything sufficiently weird
must be fishy.

20
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,870
If you ask me, it's really like
a pyramid scheme I cracked before.

21
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,150
The mental state is similar.

22
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,590
Shen Yufei must have been brainwashed.

23
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,000
I think Yang Dong's death...

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,150
Yes.

25
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,680
Our only finding
is concerning Yang Dong.

26
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,080
Yang Dong didn't kill herself
when she should.

27
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,680
But she did it when she seemed
unlikely to do it.

28
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,710
What happened during that period?

29
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,870
We can only make a breakthrough
after we find the key point.

30
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,560
I think we should see Ding Yi.

31
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,430
Again?

32
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,030
Yeah.

33
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,630
We need to know in detail
what Yang Dong did

34
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,280
(Large Particle Collider)

35
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,190
between the experiment and her suicide.

36
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,680
We mustn't overlook any detail.

37
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,240
Isn't it inappropriate for me
to talk about Yang Dong

38
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,360
with Ding Yi again and again?

39
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,080
You think too much.

40
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,590
You don't even know her.

41
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,080
You just want to know her.

42
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,080
It's really inappropriate.

43
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,910
You don't have to go.

44
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,910
I have ten people at my disposal.

45
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,750
I asked Dr. Ding to recall some details.

46
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,910
I've organized them
in chronological order.

47
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,590
As for the contact of
Yang Dong and her colleagues

48
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,400
with other people,
I'm still investigating.

49
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,430
Well done! You're great.

50
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:40,000
Generally, weddings are
very important for women.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,710
But Yang Dong didn't even

52
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,430
(Ding Yi went out to buy invitations)
choose her own wedding invitations.

53
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:50,800
As a woman, she didn't even like shopping
and only bought black and white outfits.

54
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,710
She used to buy
several suits at one time.

55
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,630
Yes.

56
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:07,940
In my mind, she was really simple.

57
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:13,300
(The couple went to a mall,
shopping for clothes and shoes)

58
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,710
Wait.

59
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,310
No.

60
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,830
The first time
I went to Dr. Ding's house,

61
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:25,070
I saw a red dress on a hanger.

62
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,190
Yes.

63
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,430
I also saw several bright dresses
when I went there,

64
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,720
which were fashionable with tags on.

65
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,920
He told me that
they shopped for the dresses together.

66
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,360
As a woman
who only paid attention to physics

67
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,920
and never cared about her life,
Yang Dong would drop her research,

68
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,000
decorate the house with Ding Yi,
and prepare for their wedding.

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,040
Isn't it weird?

70
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,700
Don't you feel like going to a concert?

71
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,860
Besides physicists' names,
can you tell me the name of any singer?

72
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,240
I don't know any of them.

73
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,560
But we should start to know.

74
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,750
The album you often play
while driving isn't bad.

75
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,920
I've played it for years.

76
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,360
I think your research...

77
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,830
Shall we ask a fortune teller to
designate a lucky day for our wedding?

78
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,360
Do you like it? I had a manicure lately.

79
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,190
It's good.

80
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,480
The bed is comfy.

81
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,390
Let's order this one.

82
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,190
As Shen Yufei said,
Yang Dong started to enjoy life.

83
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,750
At least since then,

84
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:06,560
after Yang Dong contacted Shen Yufei,
she had shown signs of change.

85
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,190
It's just normal
for ordinary women to do those things.

86
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,920
- But Yang Dong was different.
- So, what do you mean?

87
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,720
It isn't normal for a female physicist
to do such things, is it?

88
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,070
That day, she went to
a furniture mall with Ding Yi.

89
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:32,510
She stayed there all day long
without mentioning anything about physics.

90
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,120
I like this one.

91
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,750
It's special.

92
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:42,390
According to Ding Yi, Yang Dong abnormally
didn't discuss physics with him.

93
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:47,800
And from that day on, she seldom exchanged
academic information with him.

94
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,830
Shall we get a tub?

95
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,480
Then we can take
a flower bath every night.

96
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,800
That might be another sign of despair.

97
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,120
Yeah.

98
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,900
But she seemed very happy.

99
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,600
Look, this is her photo at that time.

100
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,270
She seemed relaxed

101
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,240
in a completely different state
from when you took the photo of her.

102
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,310
It feels good.

103
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:06,560
If you like, we can come here often.

104
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,040
I didn't expect that we could
enjoy such leisure time.

105
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,040
We can live like this in the future.

106
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,630
Shi Qiang,
I really don't know what you want to do.

107
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,320
You asked me to stop my work, come here,

108
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,030
and review all the things about
Ding Yi and Yang Dong with you.

109
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,030
Isn't it absurd?

110
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,030
You guys do one thing

111
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,360
over and over again
in scientific research.

112
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,270
- Isn't it absurd?
- We were doing experiments.

113
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,600
We have to seek proof repeatedly.

114
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,840
When we detectives review the path
that victims and suspects have taken,

115
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,200
we're also seeking proof.

116
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,920
Why do you get heated?

117
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,320
Why do you get heated
every time I mention Yang Dong?

118
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,760
Enough, I can't outargue you.

119
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,030
Why don't you get heated
on hearing Shen Yufei's name?

120
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,960
Did you really meet Yang Dong just once?

121
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,840
All right. We've reviewed
everything again.

122
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,480
Have you drawn any conclusions?

123
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:41,200
The conclusion is that
after Shen Yufei contacted Yang Dong,

124
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,080
Yang seemed to
have given up scientific research.

125
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,090
She wanted to be a housewife.

126
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,720
She chose to be a carefree turkey.

127
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,390
If she was carefree,
why did she commit suicide?

128
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,840
Only Lord knows.

129
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,910
Shen Yufei's Lord?

130
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,240
Obviously Pan Han and his people
are against us,

131
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,600
especially for our attitude
towards Wang Miao.

132
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,720
Commander, does it make any sense to
win over Wang Miao in this way?

133
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:35,580
(Does redemption make sense
or destruction?)

134
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,600
Yes.

135
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,750
They did many things
in a more extreme way than us.

136
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,120
They targeted at scientists directly

137
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,240
and even destroyed
many scientific research bases.

138
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,750
But I have to say,

139
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,720
their actions have a greater impact
than ours.

140
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:13,700
(People can see destruction, but
most of them can't see redemption.)

141
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,270
Welcome to discuss with us
the significance

142
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:37,240
of the existence of science
at this meeting.

143
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,320
It's important to find out
someone's behavior.

144
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,870
Look, by reviewing Yang Dong's behavior,

145
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,870
we can find that after the failure
of Liangxiang experiment

146
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:06,340
and the suicide of Professor Munphy,
she found that physics might not exist.

147
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,200
Then she contacted Shen Yufei.

148
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,750
She was sure that physics didn't exist.

149
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,390
Yang Dong's words were,
"Physics has never existed."

150
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,480
Is there any difference?

151
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,270
Of course there is.

152
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,600
If physics doesn't exist, there may be
a problem with our fundamental theory.

153
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,720
If physics has never existed,
it would overthrow human's

154
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,600
understanding of the entire earth
for thousands of years,

155
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,390
whether in the macro world
or in the micro world.

156
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,550
How could they be the same?

157
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,840
Fine, I agree with you, OK?

158
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,480
I agree with you.

159
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,960
Then, well...

160
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,550
She, well, well, then she would...

161
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,120
She would choose
to be a carefree turkey, right?

162
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,670
Then she prepared to live a normal life.

163
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,150
She accepted Ding Yi's proposal,

164
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,750
(Decorate the new house Apply for a job)
bought a house and began to decorate it

165
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,720
till she found a new job.

166
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,790
Is it right, Xu Bingbing?

167
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,240
I inquired about it
at the Institute of Applied Physics.

168
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,720
The head there said that they really
hoped an expert in fundamental physics

169
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,870
like Yang Dong would work there.

170
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:10,240
Yang Dong herself was also
very enthusiastic about her new job.

171
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,390
But unfortunately, on the third day
after she accepted the offer,

172
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:17,150
she killed herself.

173
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,600
The people of the Institute
were deeply regretted too.

174
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,910
They didn't know the reason.

175
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,550
Yeah.

176
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,360
That's the problem.

177
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,270
The last three days are the point.

178
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,960
What did she do?

179
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,840
Suicide note.

180
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,390
She should have written the note
during that time.

181
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,080
Yeah.

182
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,510
If in the last three days,

183
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:43,790
she found out that
physics had never existed,

184
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:48,200
how did she find it
without contacting Shen Yufei?

185
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,360
Had she straightened out her thinking,
then in the last two days,

186
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,360
she was confused again?

187
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,840
Xu Bingbing.

188
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,150
There was a countdown
in front of my eyes too.

189
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,960
I've also seen the universe flicker.

190
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,290
- I was really desperate at that time.
- (OS: Tell me what will happen)

191
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,120
(OS: at the end of the countdown!)

192
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,670
I might have thought of suicide,
but more likely,

193
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,720
I was going to live negatively,
give up my research,

194
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,270
be a teacher,
and muddle along the rest of my life.

195
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,510
But suddenly one day,

196
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,000
there was another countdown
in front of my eyes,

197
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,240
or something else that shocked me.

198
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,440
I can't imagine

199
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,510
how great the shock was
to make me give up my life.

200
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,270
Are you clear?

201
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,720
Yes.

202
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,840
Clear enough.

203
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,480
Let me tell you the rest.

204
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,600
During that period, Yang Dong
was about to start a normal life blithely.

205
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:58,390
But the weird thing is,
Yang Dong's mother,

206
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:02,240
Professor Ye Wenjie,
seems to have never mentioned

207
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,440
any changes of Yang Dong in this period.

208
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,630
It doesn't seem right.

209
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,550
As a mom, why doesn't she
care about her daughter at all?

210
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,600
Are you suggesting that
Professor Ye has never cared about

211
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,440
(Ye Wenjie Professor of Tsinghua University) 
her daughter, right?

212
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
No.

213
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,320
Unlike you, Professor Ye
doesn't spend all her days on research.

214
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,270
She is a retired old lady.

215
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,150
If she has time to take care of
her neighbors' children,

216
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,720
how could she not notice
such a big change

217
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,300
that happened to her own daughter?

218
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:40,120
So, I think you should find some time
to have a good talk with Professor Ye.

219
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,960
Don't you like talking with her?

220
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:49,150
You'll get more information talking to her
than I question her directly.

221
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,200
All this mess you make me do
occupies lots of my research time.

222
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,440
Professor Wang,
if physics has never existed,

223
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,120
what's the point in your stupid research?

224
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,840
I, uh, I just, I...

225
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,750
I, I...

226
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,840
I just...

227
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,360
What did I just say that offended him?

228
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,150
You scientists are
all childish, aren't you?

229
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,030
Oh, right.

230
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,440
You're a cop.

231
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,150
Don't take his side.

232
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:34,480
I consulted experts
about the universe flicker.

233
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,550
What did you get?

234
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,910
Tell me about the results
of your investigation first.

235
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,440
The investigation has
reached an impasse.

236
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,000
Wang Miao and Sha Ruishan
both mentioned that

237
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:55,000
they might have put a large screen
in the air very far from the earth,

238
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,320
a very large screen,
like playing a movie.

239
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,720
I haven't found out more than you have.

240
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,350
You know what,
your metaphor is very vivid.

241
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:11,000
Put a large screen in the air,
just like playing a movie.

242
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,310
I can hardly contradict that.

243
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:18,920
The only thing I can contradict is
humans can't do that.

244
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,070
Yeah.

245
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,270
Fishy.

246
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:27,750
Just because humans can't do it,
does that mean nothing will happen?

247
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,880
Chang, what do you mean?

248
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,720
Is Shen Yufei an alien?

249
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,270
Did you hear...

250
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,350
Did you hear what I told you?

251
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,350
Alien!

252
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,680
Did you hear what I told you?

253
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
Alien!

254
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,550
That's a possibility.

255
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,960
Do you mean you believe it?

256
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,720
Like the fishy things you often say,
alien is just a byword.

257
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,830
When we face supernatural phenomena
and things that science can't explain,

258
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,400
we can impute them to aliens.

259
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,830
But what are aliens?

260
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,240
We have no idea.

261
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,350
But now,
everything is really happening before us.

262
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,240
I don't care if it's
an alien's trick or a fishy thing.

263
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,920
I want to explore what it really is,
what form it exists in,

264
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,000
what kind of power it has
and what its purpose is.

265
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,510
I think it's the greatest value for us
if I puzzle all these problems out, right?

266
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I was right about you.
You're definitely not an average turkey.

267
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:53,930
Then what's the difference between
aliens' tricks and fishy things?

268
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:58,030
I also have the right to think.

269
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,480
(Tsinghua University)

270
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,920
This is nanomaterial.

271
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,000
Let's call it a day today.

272
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,540
Thanks for listening.

273
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,190
Let's go.

274
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,090
Let's go now.

275
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,510
Hurry up.

276
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:26,830
- Professor, goodbye.
- Bye.

277
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,680
Wang.

278
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,400
Ms. Ye.

279
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,750
Thank you.

280
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,750
I know you managed to take time

281
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,030
out of your busy research
in order to give my students

282
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:40,030
a lecture on applied physics.

283
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:45,160
I'm so happy to meet with
your approval.

284
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:50,750
Though I'm retired,
I'm still interested in academics.

285
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:57,750
Sometimes, when they hold such an event,
I'll come to attend.

286
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:04,110
The research in our life
needs successors.

287
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,680
By the way, Ms. Ye,

288
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,920
some things have happened recently
in the Frontiers of Science.

289
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,310
The investigation team asked me
to assist in their work.

290
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:20,240
Recently, I read some files
about your past experience.

291
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,160
A part of them seem to
not have been declassified yet.

292
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,680
Yes.

293
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:34,920
It was really a special experience.

294
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:41,240
In fact, there's no secret anymore.

295
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,640

297
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,920

Chop the branches down.

309

Back then, the administration sent
educated youths to the countryside.

310
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:01,720
I was assigned to
the Greater Khingan Mountains.

311
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,070
Come on!

312

00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:35,480
We can shoulder an entire mountain.

314
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,070
Hurry up.

315
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,960
Comrade, move!

316
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,510
Go ahead.

317
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,310
Next one.

318
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:59,000
Ma Gang, come here.

319
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,030
Can I help you, Mr. Bai?

320
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,510
Let me ask you a question.

321
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:10,790
Do you know how old this tree was?

322
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,590
You can count the rings.

323
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,470
I did.

324
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:19,240
Most of the trees here
are over 300 years.

325
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,420
How long it took you to saw through it?

326
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,530
No more than ten minutes.

327
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:28,220
Let me tell you, I'm the fastest
chain saw operator in the company.

328
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,460
Whichever squad I'm with,

329
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,500
the red flag for model workers
follows me.

330
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,380
More than three hundred years.

331
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,420
A dozen generations.

332
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,860
When this tree was but a shrub,
it was still the Ming Dynasty.

333
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:48,660
During all these years,
how many storms it had weathered?

334
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,860
How many events it had witnessed?

335
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,580
But in a few minutes, you cut it down.

336
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,500
You really felt nothing?

337
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,060
What do you want me to feel?

338
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,180
It's just a tree.

339
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,420
The only things we don't lack
around here are trees.

340
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:10,700
There are plenty of trees
much older than this one.

341
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,140
Alright. Go back to work.

342
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:26,140
Mr. Bai, can I be featured
in the Great Production News?

343
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:37,100
Intellectuals always
make a fuss about nothing.

344
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,140
Hello.

345
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,100
Are you Ye Wenjie?

346
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,860
I'm a reporter for
the Great Production News, Bai Mulin.

347
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,460
I saw you when you borrowed books
from the production team.

348
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,180
I know you.

349
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,580
I've read your articles.

350
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,140
I can tell how you're feeling.

351
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:16,140
The two of us are the only ones
who feel this way.

352
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,660
Come and take a rest.

353
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:34,180
I visited this region a year ago.

354
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,740
I remember arriving around noon,

355
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,460
and my hosts told me that
we'd have fish for lunch.

356
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:47,380
I looked around the bark-lined hut
and saw only a pot of water being boiled.

357
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,460
No fish.

358
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:59,780
Then, as soon as the water boiled,
the cook went out with a rolling pin.

359
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:03,620
He stood by the brook
that passed before the hut,

360
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:09,500
struck the water with the rolling pin,
and dragged big fish out of the water.

361
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,380
What a fertile place!

362
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,620
But look at that brook now.

363
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,760
It's just dead,
muddy water in a ditch.

364
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:31,220
I really don't know if they're engaged in
construction or destruction.

365
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,860
Where did you get these thoughts?

366
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:48,230
I just read a book,
and it really moved me.

367
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:51,300
Can you read English?

368
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:05,700
This was published in 1962
and was very influential in the West.

369
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,380
Silent Spring, Rachel Carson.

370
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,100
Where did you get this?

371
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,940
The book attracted the attention
of the higher-ups.

372
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,780
They want to use it
for internal reference.

373
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,620
I'm responsible for translating
the part about forests.

374
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,040
What does the book tell about?

375
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,460
Pesticides and the environment?

376
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,940
There's something deeper.

377
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,500
I want to write to
the central leadership

378
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:41,180
and inform them the bad phenomena.

379
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,260
Keep it if you want to read it.

380
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,580
But don't let anyone see it.

381
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,620
This kind of book, you know...

382
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,860
OK.

392
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:31,340
The book dealt only
with a limited subject,

393
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:37,260
the negative environmental effects
of excessive pesticide use.

394
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:50,340
But the description in the book
shook me to the core.

395
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,220
(Chairman Mao wrote in On Practice,)

396
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,040
(Marxists regard)

397
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:21,090
(man's activity in production as the
most fundamental practical activity,)

398
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:24,050
(the determinant of
all his other activities.)

399
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,260
(Man's knowledge)

400
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,360
(depends mainly on his activity
in material production,)

401
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,780
(through which he comes gradually
to understand the phenomena,)

402
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,020
(the properties
and the laws of nature...)

00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,020
Keep up. Don't lag behind.

408
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:52,180
Pack up the firewood piled in the west
and move it into the warehouse.

409
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,100
Yes!

410
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,020
Take a break in your huts.

411
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,740
Gather in five minutes for the meeting.

412
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,900
Wenjie.

413
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,640
Did you work today?

414
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,060
(OS: Next.)

415
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,380
I've been with the company for so long.

416
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,380
I can't just walk around doing nothing.

417
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,540
Have to participate in labor.

418
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,700
That's the spirit of the revolution.

419
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,300
Your name?

420
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,540
Bai Mulin.

421
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,100
A chain saw.

422
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,660
A rod.

423
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,660
- OK. Go ahead.
- Thanks.

424
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,460
I worked near Radar Peak.

425
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,620
The trees there were so dense.

426
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:32,500
I sank into the rotting leaves
up to my knees.

427
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,780
I fear I'll get sick from the miasma.

428
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,220
Radar Peak?

429
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:48,700
The regiment urgently assigns us
to clear out a warning zone

430
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,020
around it by cutting down trees.

431
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,740
What's this place?

432
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,460
It's said to be a military base.

433
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,980
According to the folks,
when it was built three years ago,

434
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:10,300
the military mobilized a lot of people
to string a power line

435
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:16,500
along the peak and to construct a road
leading to the top.

436
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,820
Tons of supplies
were transported up the mountain.

437
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:26,260
It seems to be an important place.

438
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:31,540
But after the completion of the base,
the road was destroyed.

439
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,780
What's the sound?

440
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,500
Look.

441
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:44,180
The antenna appears.

442
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,420
What is that?

443
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,620
The peak was nameless before.

444
00:33:53,620 --> 00:34:02,220
It got its moniker from the large
parabolic antenna dish at the top.

445
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,780
What is it used for?

446
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:08,060
It doesn't look like a radar antenna.

447
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,220
I don't know.

448
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:16,660
Though its orientation always changes,
it's never moved in a continuous manner.

449
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,260
Let's go.

450
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:35,100
I've been here for so long,
but I never noticed it.

451
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,380
The antenna isn't always visible.

452
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:43,500
But when it's extended,
many strange things will occur.

453
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,820
Animals in the forest become
noisy and anxious.

454
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:52,060
Birds erupt from the woods,
and people will suffer nausea and dizziness.

455
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,820
Also, those who live near Radar Peak
tend to lose their hair.

456
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:01,660
According to the folks, these only began
after the antenna was built.

457
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,860
Radioactive rays?

458
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,420
It's more than that.

459
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,220
One time, when it was snowing,
the antenna was extended,

460
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:13,500
and the snow instantly turned to rain.

461
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,900
Sometimes, when the antenna
was extended,

462
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,820
a clear day would turn to
thunder and lightning,

463
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:25,680
and strange lights
would appear in the night sky.

464
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,380
It's a forbidden area.

465
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:31,180
Before I came here, I was told to
avoid approaching the place,

466
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:34,620
or the patrols were allowed to
shoot without warning.

467
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:40,900
Do you remember the two men who were
reprimanded last week?

468
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:46,420
No sooner than they chased a deer
to the foot

469
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:51,540
of Radar Peak, the sentries stationed
halfway up the peak shot at them.

470
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,900
They were so terrified
and turned to run.

471
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,940
(Military Zone)

472
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,580
Luckily, the forest was so dense
that they weren't hurt,

473
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:02,580
though one of them peed in his pants.

474
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:08,060
When they returned to the company
the next day, both were reprimanded.

475
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:13,940
Maybe it was because of this incident,
we were directed to create a warning zone.

476
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:18,580
Could the base issue
labor assignments to us?

477
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:24,420
I hear it has great political power.

478
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,740
I have to go now.

479
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,220
OK.

480
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:37,890

486
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,420
Come in.

487
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,940
Wenjie.

488
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,620
I'm here to return your book.

489
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,860
I was going to look for you.

490
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,460
You're just in time.

491
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:49,150
I'll show you the letter I wrote.

492
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,700
Letter?

493
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,420
Yes.

494
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,380
I told you last time that

495
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,940
I was going to write to
the central leadership.

496
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,700
Take a seat.

497
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,260
Sorry.

498
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,460
My handwriting is sloppy.

499
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:28,530
It's beautiful.

500
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,620
The Taihang Mountains have turned from

501
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:35,660
a historically fertile place to the
barren wasteland due to deforestation.

502
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,780
The Yellow River's silt
is rising rapidly now.

503
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,180
The great reclamation
in the northern tree farm

504
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,700
will lead to severe consequences.

505
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:48,260
The content is informative
and tightly argued.

506
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,020
OK.

507
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,660
I'll make a clean copy of the draft.

508
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,580
Don't burn yourself.

509
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:27,660
My hands are trembling
due to frequent use of the chain saw.

510
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:32,620
(Respected)

511
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,860
Perfect.

512
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,700
This sheet is wasted.

513
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,580
Why don't I copy it for you?

514
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,820
The chain saw is too heavy.

515
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,700
No wonder your hand is trembling.

516
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,700
Let me copy it for you.

517
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,900
OK.

518
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,060
Thanks a lot.

519
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:24,340
(Respected)

520
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:27,540
You have pretty handwriting.

521
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,740
You studied physics?

522
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,500
Astrophysics.

523
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,500
Useless now.

524
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,140
Astrophysics?

525
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,500
So you study the stars.

526
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,860
How can that be useless?

527
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,660
Colleges have reopened recently,

528
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,740
but they're not taking
graduate students.

529
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:48,020
A highly educated talent like you
has been sent to this place...

530
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,700
It's a shame.

531
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:59,660
I didn't tell him that I was fortunate enough
to be sent to the northern tree farm.

532
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:03,670
(50,000 educated youths
all over the country...)

533
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:08,740
At the moment,
the hut was quiet.

534
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:16,340
I could hear the sound of pen nib
scratching against paper,

535
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:24,700
and smell the fragrance of the sawdust.

536
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:36,820
Since my father died, I hadn't felt relaxed
and experienced warmth for a long time.
