We still don't know
what those math guys are doing, right?

11
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,480
They were asked

12
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,950
to solve certain problems
within the allotted time.

13
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,430
As for what that was for,
they had no idea.

14
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,430
Shen Yufei went to such great lengths
to help Wei Cheng for her own purpose, I guess.

15
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:15,120
Couldn't it be for love?

16
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,870
No one's in.

17
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,680
Let me. I got this.

18
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,430
Maybe we can come again some other time.

19
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,430
Move.

20
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,430
Captain Shi,
trespassing isn't allowed.

21
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,560
I'm not breaking in.

22
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,960
I'm trying to make some noise.

23

27
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,590
I nailed it!

28
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,870
Party time.

29
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,750
Let's celebrate.

30
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,160
Here you go.

31
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,830
Thanks.

32
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,560
It's the variable, not the constant.

33
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,070
I thought it was the constant,
but it's the variable.

34
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,120
So, you...

35
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,240
Probability.

36
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,160
Yes, probability.

37
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,800
So, you've got the result?

38
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,000
No.

39
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,360
This is only the first step.

40
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,240
How many are they?

41
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,950
More than 100 steps, maybe.

42
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,870
Or more.

43
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,160
Isn't it too soon to celebrate?

44
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,720
Wrong!

45
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,920
If you're going in the wrong direction,
all those steps will lead you nowhere.

46
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,270
But I'm certain that I am right on track.

47
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:43,750
And that's worth another drink.

48
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,390
What are you calculating anyway?

49
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,920
What is it?

50
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,000
An evolutionary algorithm.

51
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,360
Evolutionary algorithm.

52
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,120
What's that?

53
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,920
Hey, dude, stay with me.

54
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,390
What algorithm?

55
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,190
What's it for?

56
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,310
Wake up.

57
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,310
Let's drink.

58
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,120
Come on, man.

59
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,680
Drink with me.

60
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,390
He can't drink.

61
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,510
I... I...

62
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,360
I didn't ask him to.

63
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,270
What do you want now, Captain Shi?

64
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,160
Nothing. Just making small talk.

65
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,920
Your husband found the right path.

66
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,270
So, the path to what?

67
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,480
Why do you care?

68
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,870
He's into math.

69
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:53,310
If he's doing one plus one makes two,
would you be interested?

70
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:01,270
In this world,
no one truly understands him.

71
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,800
Math is his one and only passion.

72
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,800
He's got no other hobbies.

73
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,560
To help him with his pursuit,
I hired an army to work with him.

74
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,800
I'm so glad that his work
has finally come to fruition.

75
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,240
Still, what is he working on?

76
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,560
He can't take in alcohol.

77
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,800
I said it wasn't me.

78
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,950
Captain,

79
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,510
Shen Yufei and Wei Cheng
don't look like a married couple.

80
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,310
I agree.

81
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:03,800
With her husband on the floor,
she picked up the cushion first.

82
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,430
Would you call that place home?

83
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,870
It's filled with piles of used paper,
computers, and office supplies.

84
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,680
I'd call it a studio.

85
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,950
They're more employer-employee
than husband-wife.

86
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:21,360
Are all scientists like that?

87
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,720
When Wei Cheng was in high school,

88
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,910
he won first place
in the IMO in Budapest

89
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,620
and was accepted by Fudan's math program

90
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,000
(Fudan University Admission Letter)
without taking the entrance exam.

91
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,480
But he didn't put too much effort

92
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,910
into his Bachelor's, Master's,
or Doctor's degrees.

93
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:44,150
After graduation,
he didn't have much of a career

94
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,600
and went back to teach at a college.

95
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,150
Yet he couldn't survive there, either.

96
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:57,670
He was muddling along
until he met Shen Yufei

97
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,320
and married her soon after.

98
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:10,030
Financially, she provided for him
and helped with his calculation.

99
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,000
When you put it like that,
love can be ruled out for sure.

100
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,360
Shen Yufei did all that for herself.

101
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,240
Or why would she choose such a loser?

102
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,670
Maybe in her eyes,
he's some sort of a genius.

103
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,320
You mean
it's switched into the standby mode.

104
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,440
Yes.

105
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,030
A few key parts are still running
to store the completed data

106
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,670
and maintain basic operations

107
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:35,440
to prepare the computer to reenter
the compute mode anytime.

108
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,270
Also, that's more economical.

109
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,080
Yes, as it should be.

110
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,390
It's been running for 16 long months.

111
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:50,080
Your Majesty, the first phase of
the computation  was complete.

112
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,030
The results precisely
described the orbits

113
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:57,790
of the three suns
for the next two years.

114
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,080
Tell me about it.

115
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,550
My great Emperor,
the calculations show

116
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,270
that the long night is about to be over.

117
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:13,750
We'll soon welcome the first sunrise
of a long Stable Era.

118
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,750
You mean the sun is about to rise?

119
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,670
Yes.

120
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:21,240
And this Era will last over a year.

121
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,510
Judging by the orbital parameters,
the climate will be mild and comfortable.

122
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:28,080
Please let your empire be rehydrated!

123
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,200
Rehydrate.

124
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:40,790
In just five seconds, Your Majesty,
prepare to receive your glory!

125
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,840
Your Majesty, I'm afraid
the calculations were in error.

126
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,720
Disaster is about to befall us!

127
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,120
What are you babbling about?

128
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,440
You, a mere astrologer, are questioning
His Majesty's grand computer?

129
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,200
Don't you see that the sun is rising
at the exact moment

130
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,790
predicted by our precise calculations?

131
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,670
But how many suns do you see?

132
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,240
How many?

133
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,870
Need you ask?

134
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,000
Astrologer,
you must at least know how to count.

135
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,720
Of course, there's only one sun.

136
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,270
And the temperature is perfect.

137
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:27,030
No, Your Majesty.

138
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,440
There are three.

139
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,240
The other two are behind that one!

140
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,030
Are you out of your mind?

141
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,200
The Imperial Observatory has confirmed

142
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,910
that the three suns are in a
straight line, moving around our planet

143
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,120
at the same angular speed!

144
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,670
This is extremely rare!

145
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,480
A Tri-solar Syzygy.

146
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,550
Thus, our planet and the three suns

147
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:58,150
are in a straight line
with our world at the end of this line!

148
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,000
Are you sure about this?

149
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,910
Absolutely!

150
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,390
The observation was conducted

151
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,670
by the Western astronomers
of the Imperial Observatory,

152
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,510
including Kepler and Herschel.

153
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:14,600
They're using the largest telescope
in the world, imported from Europe!

154
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:20,790
My greatest, most honorable Emperor,
this is the most propitious sign!

155
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:24,510
Now that the three suns
are orbiting around our planet,

156
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,030
your empire becomes
the center of the universe.

157
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,750
This is God's reward for our efforts.

158
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,440
Let me double-check the calculations.

159
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,510
I'll... I'll prove this!

160
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,790
Von Neumann,
what do you think about this phenomenon?

161
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:49,240
Your Majesty, it wasn't included
in any of the previous calculations.

162
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,320
I'll try to...

163
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,080
Report!

164
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,150
What now?

165
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,030
Sir Newton stole a horse and left.

166
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,510
We lost track of him.

167
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,200
What?

168
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,720
That rat!

169
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,510
How dare he flee!

170
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,480
He's a good-for-nothing!

171
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,480
A coward, a chicken!

172
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,630
Your Majesty,
please unsheathe your sword.

173
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,910
What for?

174
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,870
Please try to swing it.

175
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,500
Why is it so light?

176
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,600
The game's V-suit can't simulate
the feeling of diminished gravity.

177
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,480
Otherwise, we'd feel that
we're much lighter as well.

178
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,360
Look! Down there!

179
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,960
Look at those men!

180
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,720
And the horses!

181
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,150
So, what's going on here?

182
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,670
Your Majesty,
the three suns are over our planet

183
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,000
in a straight line,

184
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,960
so their gravitational forces
are added together...

185
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,120
What's next?

186
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,080
Acceleration?

187
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,270
Are the mountains transparent?

188
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,600
They aren't mountains.

189
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,360
They were formed from the ocean
attracted into space.

190
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,840
I figured it out! Electronic elements!

191
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,510
Use them to make gate circuits
and combine them into computers!

192
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:56,630
Such computers will be much faster!

193
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,240
(Tri-solar Syzygy.)

194
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:23,000
(Because the atmosphere was gone,
there was no more sound.)

195
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:29,240
(I was seeing the other two suns.)

196
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,240
(Civilization No. 184 was destroyed
by the stacked gravitational attractions)

197
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,390
(of a Tri-solar Syzygy.)

198
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,670
(This civilization had advanced
to the Scientific Revolution)

199
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,670
(and the Industrial Revolution.)

200
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,910
(In this civilization, Newton established
nonrelativistic classical mechanics.)

201
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,720
(At the same time,)

202
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,870
(due to the invention of calculus
and the Von Neumann)

203
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,510
(architecture computer, the foundation was set for
the quantitative mathematical analysis)

204
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,870
(of the motion of three bodies.)

205
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:58,440
(After a long time, life and
civilization will begin again,)

206
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,030
(and progress once more through
the unpredictable world of Three-Body.)

207
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:06,750
(We invite you to log on again.)

208
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,400
Yes?

209
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,200
Hello.

210
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,480
First, thanks for giving us
your real number.

211
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm a system administrator
for the Three-Body game.

212
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,590
Please tell me your name, education,
occupation, and position.

213
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,880
You left them blank during registration.

214
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,240
What do they have to do with the game?

215
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,440
Now that you've reached this level,
we need such information from you.

216
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,160
If you refuse, Three-Body will
shut you out permanently.

217
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,240
Name: Wang Miao.

218
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,110
Education: Doctorate.

219
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,400
Occupation: Chief Engineer
of the National Nanomaterial Center.

220
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,680
Thank you, Dr. Wang.

221
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:52,070
You're qualified for
continuing in Three-Body.

222
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,440
May I ask you a question?

223
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,030
Sorry, sir.

224
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,590
As a system administrator, I'm unauthorized
to answer any questions.

225
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,000
There will be a meet-up
for the players soon.

226
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,030
You're welcome to attend
if you're gonna continue playing.

227
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:08,310
We'll send you the information by email
once your identity checks out.

228
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,590
Please check your mailbox.

229
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,510
Are you saying either you go
to the meet-up or you're out?

230
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,240
I suppose.

231
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,750
- Have you received the email?
- Not yet.

232
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,350
They'll verify my profile
before sending it.

233
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:36,000
But this new trial in the game
has given me another idea.

234
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,240
What is it?

235
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,440
The Three-Body Problem is about physics,

236
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,160
but maybe it can be solved
by calculation.

237
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,270
So math?

238
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,200
Yes.

239
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,110
A mathematical model.

240
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,510
We're gonna need a complex one.

241
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:56,830
Someone thought so, too,
but beat you to it by a few months.

242
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,550
You know who it was?

243
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,160
Who?

244
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,480
(Shen Yufei)

245
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,110
Shen Yufei.

246
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,920
Guess she's been
working on a solution

247
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,790
to the Three-Body Problem in the game.

248
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,960
To think that she let you in,
half-knowing.

249
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,960
Listen, she's hired over 100 experts,
including her husband, Wei Cheng,

250
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,000
(Wei Cheng)
to calculate day and night.

251
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,720
I didn't know what they were working on,

252
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,030
but given what you said,
it must be the Three-Body Problem.

253
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:34,400
Shen Yufei is more than she shows.

254
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,640
A scientist
trying to solve the Three-Body Problem

255
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,880
doesn't prove anything.

256
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,920
I know that.

257
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,590
Considering what you two are doing,

258
00:19:53,590 --> 00:20:02,680
I mean, are you gonna be
a mathematician next?

259
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,400
Let me ask you something.

260
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,640
Are you and your wife close?

261
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,590
What... what I'm saying is
if you and your wife...

262
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,400
if you two, you know...

263
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,510
I mean, if your wife got drunk
and she was under the couch,

264
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,750
there you were... uh...

265
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,310
She didn't throw up, though.

266
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:29,510
She knocked the cushion to the floor.

267
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:33,310
At this point,
well, normally, she wasn't like that.

268
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,510
So, what would you...

269
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,880
My wife never drinks.

270
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,440
Sure.

271
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,030
I know she, uh, she doesn't drink.

272
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,070
Normally, she doesn't.

273
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,270
It's me.

274
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,640
Send me the clips if they're done.

275
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,750
I'll edit them.

276
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,400
OK. Gotta go. Bye.

277
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,680
I turned off your monitor.

278
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,030
You freaked me out!

279
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,680
A few days ago,
a lab in Y City, Country M

280
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,720
suffered a blast in an accident.

281
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,110
Four scientists, including a Nobel laureate,
were killed.

282
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,310
I know.

283
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,400
I read the news.

284
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,270
Yes.

285
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,830
That's what the news said.

286
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,550
But it's not true?

287
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:20,880
The four scientists were there
for their monthly bridge day.

288
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,000
They didn't do any experiments,
so the explosion was only a cover.

289
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,680
Someone is behind all that

290
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,240
to bury the truth
and run the made-up story.

291
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,920
But that's not your job to find out.

292
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,960
Someone else will.

293
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,000
The hidden truths must be uncovered.

294
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,200
What should we do now?

295
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:48,960
Shen Yufei and I
don't always see eye to eye,

296
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,400
but we're forced
to take the same path.

297
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,790
Is there really a so-called "farmer"?

298
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:26,750
Are you aware of the Hadza, a primitive tribe
in the wilderness of Africa?

299
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:33,760
They're still a hunter-gatherer society
living in the caves

300
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,720
and treating the sick
with ground herbs.

301
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,350
(The Last Hunter-gatherer Tribe in Africa)
And then you show up with antibiotics

302
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,510
to cure them.

303
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:51,590
You give them seeds
so that they'll have food to eat.

304
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:55,920
You teach them calendar
and architecture

305
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,440
to build houses outside the caves.

306
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,070
Because of you, they have a lamp.

307
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:06,550
Now, in their eyes, you're their Lord.

308
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,270
Let me get this straight.

309
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:12,480
So we're living in a world where there are
more advanced technologies

310
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,160
than we know.

311
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,400
You want people to resist
technological development

312
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,590
because however it develops,
it's nowhere near Lord's level.

313
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,920
Is that so?

314
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,070
And it does more harm than good.

315
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,920
That's true.

316
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,030
It's polluting everything.

317
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:39,640
Water, light, air,
wildlife habitat, and our habitat.

318
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,880
Come to think of it,
in a way, technology is advancing

319
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,000
at the cost of our lives.

320
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,550
Wind and solar power generation
have been well-developed,

321
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,440
but why are they yet to be widely used
for residential power?

322
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,880
Because in that case,

323
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,510
the group that originally controls
the resources will lose

324
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:06,110
some of their interests forever.

325
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:14,110
I can be their Lord,
but what's my goal?

326
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,960
Who are you? A martyr?

327
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,400
Or a clown?

328
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,550
How did you get in?

329
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:59,480
Wasn't the door closed?

330
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,830
Terminate your calculation.

331
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,750
Not now.

332
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,350
I've just found my way.

333
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,200
There are many more steps to take.

334
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,200
I said stop it.

335
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,030
It's meaningless.

336
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,000
I don't care.

337
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,960
This is my passion.

338
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:21,510
Wait outside for Shen Yufei.

339
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:44,070
Your toy gun looks so real.

340
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,880
Stop it. It's boring.

341
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,200
No, it's not saved!

342
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,200
It's gone!

343
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,070
I said

344
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:16,310
stop it right now.

345
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:25,030
So, uh, it's not a toy, is it?

346
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:27,750
It's... it's the real deal.

347
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,070
You know what? You're right.

348
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:36,790
My... my calculation is meaningless.

349
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,160
Are you gonna kill him in my face?

350
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:46,270
Although we do things differently,
you should know I'll shoot if I have to.

351
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,270
Call the cops.

352
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,640
Call the cops.

353
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,270
Call the cops.

354
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,640
Cops?

355
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,310
Even God can't save you.

356
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:58,070
Commander was blind
to allow devils like you

357
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:01,200
to join the organization.

358
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,590
Can you tell which side

359
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,920
Commander is on?

360
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,160
Wei Cheng, go back to your room.

361
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,680
OK.

362
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,880
But... but this is... this is my room.

363
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,960
I... I'm going upstairs.

364
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,270
Meaningless.

365
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,750
Wei Cheng was lost for a long time
until recently, he made a breakthrough

366
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:46,000
and found a way.

367
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,350
I wasn't sure if it was right,
but your reaction told me it is.

368
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,590
And so what?

369
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:59,400
Maybe it'll take decades from there
or to no avail.

370
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,920
You're keeping Lord from coming.

371
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,790
I'm saving it.

372
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,720
Does Lord need your redemption?

373
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,400
Do the shooter and the farmer need consolation
from two-dimensional creatures or turkeys?

374
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,790
You aren't Lord.

375
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,590
You can't speak for it.

376
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:24,310
Shen Yufei,
were you able to hear Lord's voice?

377
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:35,510
We know Lord is there
and it's been guiding us.

378
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:42,030
But what have you done?

379
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:47,200
You've been separating Lord from us
so that it only communicates with you,

380
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,880
and then you tell us what to do
in Lord's name.

381
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,310
Don't I have the right to question
if your rendering is faithful?

382
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,920
Wei Cheng has only taken one small step.

383
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,960
No one knows
if that's right, including you,

384
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:08,480
but I know, because Lord has told me so.

385
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,590
Lord knows everything.

386
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,160
Lord shouldn't be your leverage.

387
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,350
Does Lord care?

388
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,350
The new receiving system
is ready to be deployed.

389
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:42,550
Reception of all bands
in the direction of Centaurus will be expanded

390
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,350
to the maximum range.

391
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,550
I'll see to it.

392
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:51,550
Also,
I've mulled over what Pan Han said.

393
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,030
He asked me...

394
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,750
Were you able to hear Lord's voice?

395
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:00,030
He said, "hear Lord's voice".

396
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,720
Don't worry.

397
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,200
I'll take care of the new system.

398
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,440
We have seven, maybe eight cases.

399
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,790
It's getting out of control.

400
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:00,240
The North American Sector
has had four terrorist attacks.

401
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,920
It seems as though
the enemy is escalating.

402
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,750
We just got one case
in our sector so far,

403
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:11,000
but it causes bad influence
of public opinion.

404
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,880
General Chang,
how about Beijing Sector?

405
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,720
Relatively stable as of now.

406
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,830
No similar cases have happened.

407
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:23,350
Can we confirm that the attacks
are related to our investigation?

408
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,310
Yes.

409
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,270
We managed to capture a few suspects.

410
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:29,110
What I find odd though is that
most of them

411
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,920
are known environmentalists
and pacifists,

412
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,270
but somehow,
they're turning into violent terrorists,

413
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:37,680
using the same slogan.

414
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,030
"Lord will come to punish vice."

415
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,070
That "Lord" again.

416
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,440
What kind of lord?

417
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,960
Landlord?

418
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,480
"Punish vice."

419
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,640
Whose vice?

420
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,270
Turkeys'?

421
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,960
But what about those rioters?

422
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,960
Aren't they also turkeys?

423
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:59,960
Even if Lord will come,
those mobs are using it to mess around.

424
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,030
Although such attacks
aren't found in our sector,

425
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:08,270
we have to stay on guard.

426
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,400
Against what?

427
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,160
I don't even know what this "Lord" is.

428
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,880
Chang, you said those mobs

429
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,720
used to be pacifists
and renowned scholars, right?

430
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,030
Do they have anything to do
with the Frontiers of Science?

431
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:29,110
It seems to me that they're acting as HR
screening out candidates.

432
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:34,310
Is there an even bigger organization
backing them?

433
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:37,960
Wang Miao
has passed their screening, hasn't he?

434
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:44,400
It's better that
he receives their email ASAP.

435
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,640
Thank you for coming.

436
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,640
That's all for today.

437
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:10,630
When was the last time you came here?

438
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:16,880
Did you send Wei Cheng away
so that he can continue his calculation?

439
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,880
You've been escalating things
in North America and Europe.

440
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,110
Those are terrorist attacks.

441
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,630
I'm practicing Lord's will.

442
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:30,360
"Lord will come to punish vice."

443
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:36,920
Once the Three-Body Problem is solved,
we'll all be saved.

444
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,000
You naive Redemptionists!

445
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,440
You reject the redemptive power
for your goal of destruction, don't you?

446
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,550
Look around. They deserve it.

447
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,960
"Human society can no longer

448
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,070
rely on its own power
to solve its problems."

449
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:55,500
That's what Commander said.

450
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,280
"Human society
can no longer rely on its own power

451
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,070
to restrain its madness.

452
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:04,550
Therefore,
we ask Lord to come to this world,

453
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:10,960
and with its power, forcefully watch over us
and transform us

454
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,880
so as to create a brand-new,
perfect human civilization."

455
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:22,590
That's Commander's original words
and our plan, too.

456
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,590
You remember every word of it.

457
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:29,280
Having Lord come here is our plan, no?

458
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,960
What the Redemptionists
like you are doing?

459
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,360
You really believe
your so-called redemption

460
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,000
can solve Lord's problems?

461
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,920
And what you people have done?

462
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,960
You intercepted Lord's messages,
distorted Lord's will,

463
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,440
brainwashed and threatened
members of our organization nonstop.

464
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,960
I know you, the Adventists,
have your own secret agenda, don't you?

465
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,480
That is to destroy all humans.

466
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,590
The human race is an evil species.

467
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:04,590
Human civilization has committed
unforgivable crimes against the Earth

468
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:08,320
and must be punished.

469
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,480
The ultimate goal of the Adventists
is to ask Lord

470
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,590
to carry out this divine punishment:
the destruction of all humankind.

471
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:21,800
That's already an open secret.

472
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,960
With the humans gone,
the world will be changed.

473
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,000
That's why we're the Adventists
instead of the Terminators.

474
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,070
You misrepresented Lord's will.

475
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:38,480
You used to be one of us,
but somehow,

476
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,360
you were converted to a Redemptionist,

477
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,070
which is slightly better
than those cockamamie Survivors.

478
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:54,030
Both you and I know
we won't be able to see Lord coming.

479
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:57,030
The world is beyond redemption,

480
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:02,070
but you're afraid of change
as you see it equals destruction.

481
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:07,630
Only those who rise above death
understand the coming of Lord.

482
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,360
You know what Lord's will is?

483
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:14,140
I'll be able to hear its voice.

484
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,510
Halt Wei Cheng's computation.

485
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:19,070
End your so-called redemption.

486
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:24,550
Otherwise, you will be destroyed.

487
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:37,280
Clearly, humans can't
rely on their own power

488
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,670
to restrain their madness.

489
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:49,280
But I'll keep hope alive
and continue saving this broken world.

490
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,320
Wei Cheng is still
working on his calculation.

491
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,760
You think he'll make it?

492
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,400
Shen Yufei said she'd be able to
hear the voice from the Lord.

493
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,480
Do you think so?

494
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,800
I want her to stop, completely.

495
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,400
You said it's only human beings
who're violated, while the world's changed.

496
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,190
I have a question.

497
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,920
A question?

498
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,070
That is quite unusual of you.

499
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:22,280
Commander, which side is she on?

500
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,880
The Adventists?

501
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,110
The Redemptionists?

502
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:29,320
Or the Survivors?

503
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,230
She... is the Commander.

504
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:36,320
So why would she choose a side?

505
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,550
Why haven't they sent the email?

506
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,440
Have they forgotten?

507
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,630
It's only been one day.

508
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:45,480
Be patient.

509
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:03,860
(Ye Wenjie)

510
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,400
What's wrong?

511
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,070
Are you surprised?

512
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,670
What is this?

513
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,030
You tell me.

514
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,840
Think about it.

515
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:24,710
Who was it that told you
about the Frontiers of Science?

516
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,320
You.

517
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:33,360
I mean, who first introduced you
to the Frontiers of Science?

518
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:36,360
Shen Yufei.

519
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,550
Who made you see the universe flicker?

520
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,400
Shen Yufei.

521
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,030
Who talked you into
playing Three-Body?

522
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:45,760
Shen Yufei.

523
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,030
You have a one-track mind, don't you?

524
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:50,510
Think it over.

525
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:53,920
Without Ye Wenjie,
would you see the flicker?

526
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,000
Without Ye Wenjie,
would you understand the flying stars?

527
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,670
Without such knowledge,
would you get the hang of the game?

528
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,360
I don't want to be suspicious,
but she made me.

529
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,800
She's everywhere in my leads!

530
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,400
Shen Yufei booked
a train ticket to Hai City.

531
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,230
K1303, departs at 22:13.

532
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,840
- She's boarded the train...
- Wait. Hold on...

533
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,920
Hai City?

534
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,030
Hai City...

535
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,760
Shen Yufei.

536
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,400
Hai City.

537
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,880
Shen Yufei's foreign-funded company
owns a red ginseng factory in Qijiatun.

538
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,920
Qijiatun neighbors Hai City.

539
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,760
It takes only 30 minutes from Hai City
to Qijiatun.

540
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,880
(Ye Wenjie)
Does red ginseng need nanotech?

541
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,510
A few days ago, an old friend
from the base brought a gift for me.

542
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,630
Here you are.

543
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,800
(Red Ginseng)
This is the red ginseng you gave me.

544
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,070
Thank you.

545
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,440
She's on a business trip.

546
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,320
They're apples and oranges.
So Far-fetched!

547
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,630
Nanotech and ginseng?

548
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,360
No.

549
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,320
What do you mean?

550
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,000
They're unrelated?

551
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,630
Why didn't you tell me
that Ye Wenjie gave you red ginseng?

552
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:07,000
I didn't know Shen Yufei's company
also owns such a factory.

553
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,000
Here it is.

554
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,230
(Address: No. 39, Qijiatun)

555
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,360
No. 39, Qijiatun.

556
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,320
May I use your computer?

557
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,070
Call Ye Wenjie.

558
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:37,760
Now?

559
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,280
Yeah. Do it!

560
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,960
(Xinlai Red Ginseng for Better Health)

561
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,710
This ginseng factory

562
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,880
(Processed Ginseng Products)
has hardly sold any products.

563
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,360
They must still be in R&D.

564
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,670
(Please try again later.)

565
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,550
She didn't pick up.

566
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,840
It's 10 PM. Perhaps she's asleep.

567
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,510
So Ye Wenjie's friend

568
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:01,400
happened to buy red ginseng
from Shen Yufei's factory

569
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,360
that was hardly sold
and gave it to her,

570
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,280
then she regifted it to you.
What are the odds?

571
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,550
The ginseng can be kept for six years
and it was produced two years ago.

572
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,590
What does that tell us?

573
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:19,360
Shen Yufei and Ye Wenjie go way back!

574
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,320
Yes?

575
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,760
OK.

576
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,760
Found it.

577
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,320
Ye Wenjie also bought
a ticket to Hai City.
