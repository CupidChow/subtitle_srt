1
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,190
Rookie?

2
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,640
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,790
I hit your car.

4
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,280
My motor bike is uninsured.

5
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,350
I tell you what,
leave me your phone number.

6
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,960
I'll have your car repaired.

7
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,830
OK?

8
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,150
How dare you
ride an uninsured motor bike?

9
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,390
Driving license, registration.

10
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,920
I'm so sorry.

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,390
(Driving License of the People's
Republic of China, Mu Xing)

12
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,000
Mu Xing?

13
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,110
You look familiar.

14
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,120
I heard on the news recently
that a policeman was suspended.

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,790
Is that you?

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,000
Did you really hear it on the news?

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,840
No.

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,400
I found it out.

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,000
Found it out?

20
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,680
Let me introduce myself.

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,230
I work in media.

22
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,060
In new media.

23
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,680
In new media?

24
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,220
You can think of me as a reporter.

25
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,840
I am investigating some events
concerning environmental protection.

26
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,870
So, I've noticed what you were doing
in the last several days.

27
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,000
I also know it wasn't your case.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,590
The reason why you went to the scene

29
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,200
is because it has something to do
with your current case.

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,040
What else do you know?

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,400
I know you are investigating

32
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,840
the scientists' suicides.

33
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,200
I'm investigating it too.

34
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,120
You can find out my case

35
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,840
and fake an accident.

36
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,520
You are not an average reporter.

37
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,120
I'm a professional little reporter.

38
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,710
Why don't you work with me?

39
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,190
I have lots of information.

40
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,840
I believe that it can help you.

41
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,280
You can't get
any information out of me.

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,280
Ride an uninsured motor bike, you...

43
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,560
I have insurance.

44
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,910
The policy is in the driving license.

45
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,910
Do you think there are any similarities

46
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,310
between their suicides?

47
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,470
Do you think it was caused by
psychological problems

48
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,900
or external stimulation?

49
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,840
What's your investigation focus?

50
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,590
Are you going to start from
their social relations or research topics?

51
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,120
Take it.

52
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,560
Miss Mu,
I know you scratched my car by accident.

53
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,470
It doesn't matter.

54
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,360
My car has been scratched many times.

55
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,310
You don't have to pay.

56
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,870
Goodbye.

57
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,710
Please think it over.

58

60
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,830
Dr. Sha.

61
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,390
Are you Wang Miao?

62
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,870
I'm Professor Ye's student, Sha Ruishan.

63
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,950
Nice to meet you.

64
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,160
Are these all your instruments?

65
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,060
Yeah, they are used for observation,

66
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,150
but they have nothing to do
with my project.

67
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,560
Come in.

68
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:20,920
OK.

69
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,390
Come.

70
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,680
Aren't they breathtaking?

71
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,480
Unfortunately, they are all like
the ears of a deaf man.

72
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,150
Why?

73
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,830
Ever since construction was completed,

74
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,040
interference has been unceasing
in the observational bands.

75
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,070
First, there were the paging stations
during the 80s.

76
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,240
Now, it's the mobile communication.

77
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,750
Most of the tasks that need

78
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,000
metre-wave aperture synthesis
radio telescope can't be performed.

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,630
There should be a way to solve it.

80
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,920
Solve it?

81
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,390
Who will solve it?

82
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,000
Should mobile communication be stopped

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,920
just because we want to
explore the universe?

84
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,800
In recent years,

85
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,750
commercial operation of basic research
has been fairly successful,

86
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,870
like in high-energy physics.

87
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:11,260
Maybe the observatories should be moved
to places farther away from cities.

88
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,120
It all comes down to money.

89
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,800
Right now, we can only use
technical means

90
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,190
to shield against interference.

91
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,190
Fortunately, my project
only depends on satellite data.

92
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,390
The ground interference
doesn't affect me much.

93
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,600
Let me show you around.

94
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,870
Professor Wang, this is my lab.

95
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,070
It's like home to me.

96
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,920
Enjoy yourself.

97
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,870
I usually live here.

98
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,600
Have some water.

99
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,680
OK, thanks.

100
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,560
My lab is used to receive the data
sent by three satellites

101
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,070
and display them in real time
on the eight terminals.

102
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,920
My job is to use these observational data

103
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,830
to create a more detailed map
of the cosmic microwave background.

104
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,620
What kind of data do you want to see?

105
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,390
The overall fluctuation in the
cosmic microwave background.

106
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,420
Can you be more specific?

107
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:09,070
What I mean is the isotropic fluctuation

108
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:18,040
in the overall cosmic microwave background,
between one and five percent.

109
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,950
Professor Wang, you're not
a specialist in the field, right?

110
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,950
No.

111
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:28,160
Do you have some basic understanding
of the cosmic microwave background?

112
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,830
I don't know much.

113
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,430
I think it was back in the 60s

114
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,430
when two Americans
accidentally discovered the radiation

115
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:40,240
when they were testing a super sensitive
satellite reception antenna.

116
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:44,480
The overall fluctuation
in the cosmic microwave background

117
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,270
is almost negligible.

118
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,830
Even with the sensitivity
of the Planck satellite,

119
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,510
continuous observation
for a million years

120
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,070
might not detect any such shift.

121
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,920
But you want to see
a five percent fluctuation tonight?

122
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,190
Do you realize what that would mean?

123
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,630
What would that mean?

124
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,510
It means the universe
would flicker like a fluorescent tube

125
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,190
that's about to burn out.

126
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,790
This must be some joke.

127
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,800
If only it was a joke.

128
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,630
Come and look.

129
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,980
Look.

130
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,680
This curve is the measurement
of the cosmic microwave background.

131
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,480
After our conversion,
it's basically a straight line.

132
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,750
The error range
is due to the Doppler effect

133
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,790
from the motion of the Milky Way.

134
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,800
If the kind of fluctuation you anticipate,

135
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,720
in excess of one percent, occurs,
this line would turn red

136
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,600
and the fluctuation
will show in real time.

137
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,510
I would bet that
it's going to stay a flat green line

138
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:45,080
until the end of the world.

139
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:50,240
If you want to see it
show the red line of fluctuation,

140
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,720
you might have to wait until long after
the death of the sun.

141
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:00,910
If you say so,
it's really unlikely to happen.

142
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,030
It doesn't matter.

143
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,550
Since Professor Ye asked me to help you,
let's do the observation.

144
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,840
It's not a big deal.

145
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,360
Shall we start now?

146
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,320
It might happen around 1:00 AM.

147
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,670
It will be soon.

148
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,030
Take a seat.

149
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,540
Let me set automatic save.

150
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,440
In case, I mean in case,
the fluctuation really occurs,

151
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,840
it's really worth recording.

152
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:10,120
I'd rather believe there are aliens
than believe the universe would flicker.

153
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,910
Professor Wang.

154
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,870
Professor Wang.

155
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,150
Are you OK?

156
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,500
Would you like some chips?

157
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,670
No, thanks.

158
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,720
Maybe instant noodles or ham sausage?

159
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,240
One minute left.

160
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,600
See?

161
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,320
Look, it's moving!

162
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,000
Red!

163
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,030
It must be a mechanical malfunction.

164
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,600
It doesn't matter.
I have two other satellites.

165
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,910
Impossible.

166
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,790
Impossible.

167
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,790
It isn't a malfunction.

168
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,750
Not a malfunction.

169
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,600
Impossible.

170
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,950
Absolutely impossible.

171
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,720
There's another way.

172
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,750
Answer the phone.

173
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,840
Hurry.

174
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,270
Answer the phone.

175
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,630
Hello, is it the Urumqi Observatory?

176
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,600
This is Miyun.

177
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,080
Send your cosmic observation data
to this terminal now.

178
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,630
Now!

180
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,720
The universe is really flickering.

181
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,200
The universe is flickering.

182
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,630
The universe is flickering!

183
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:15,150
Can you print out the curve?

184
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:20,030
Dr. Sha, can you print out
the waveform? Print!

185
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,720
Yes.

186
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,440
Print!

187
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,150
Short.

188
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:02,240
Long.

189

Short-long-long-long-long.

(From Shen Yufei)
I'll send you a website address.

191
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,750

192
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,840
What do you mean?

195
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,510
Give me a pen.

196
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,600
A pen!

197
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,240
Do you have a pen?

198
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,870
Yes.

199
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,750
Here.

200
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,600
Take it.

201
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,510

Eight.

229
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,200
Only 1,108 hours remained.

230
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,750
What hours?

231
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,790
Three days from now.

232
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,390
Then the countdown will continue.

233
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,360
The entire universe

234
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,240
will flicker for you
from one to five in the morning.

235
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,200
Professor Wang,

236
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:36,720
it's been 57 minutes
and it's still flickering.

237
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,440
Is it possible that the three satellites
and the observatory

238
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,670
are all malfunctioning?

239
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,790
Impossible.

240
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,200
Absolutely impossible.

241
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,360
Is it possible that it's sabotage?

242
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,590
Even more impossible.

243
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,270
To simultaneously alter the data
from three satellites

244
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,390
and an observatory on Earth?

245
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,030
That's a supernatural saboteur.

246
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,480
Not the ghost of a chance?

247
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,680
In fact, it's easy to confirm this.

248
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,480
If the cosmic microwave background

249
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,550
is fluctuating this much,

250
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,000
we should be able to
see it with our own eyes.

251
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,590
The wavelength of the cosmic microwave
background is seven centimeters.

252
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,550
That's about seven orders of magnitude

253
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,640
longer than the wavelength
of visible light.

254
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,790
How can we possibly see it?

255
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,710
Using 3K glasses.

256
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,550
What 3K glasses?

257
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,030
The glasses made for
Beijing Planetarium.

258
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,830
These glasses can compress the wavelength
of the cosmic microwave background

259
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,510
by seven orders of magnitude

260
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,790
so that 7 cm waves
are turned into visible red lights,

261
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:38,920
which is the universe flicker we said.

262
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,720
If I leave here now,
before five o'clock in the morning,

263
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,240
can you find me a pair of 3K glasses?

264
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,350
I'll go to Beijing Planetarium alone.

265
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,200
I know.

266
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,720
What I want to say is that

267
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,510
you must know a lot of things
I don't know.

268
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,500
I hope that you will
explain the truth to me

269
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,950
when you feel the time is right.

270
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:02,310
If this phenomenon
should lead to some research results,

271
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,550
I won't forget you.

272
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,510
The flickering will stop
at five in the morning.

273
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,200
You shouldn't pursue it after this.

274
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,550
You won't get anywhere.

275
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,200
Hello, Dr. Sha sent me here.

276
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,240
Here are the 3K glasses.

277
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,750
This button switches it on.

278
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,580
This is for adjusting brightness.

279
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,960
They're fully charged.

280
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,540
You can look as much as you like.

281
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,000
Thanks.

282
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,960
Sha Ruishan must be mental.

00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,480
Professor Wang!

285
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,200
I hear strange things have been
happening to scientists lately, right?

286
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,400
Yes.

287
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,680
Is it our turn?

288
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,480
It's my turn, at least.

289
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,440
Are you OK?

290
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,370
Don't touch me!

291
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,720
Do you need me to call someone?

292
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,400
No!

293
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,640
Unreasonable.

294
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,240

Buddy, finding it hard to bear?

312
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,510
I said you couldn't handle it.

313
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:46,440
And you insisted on
playing the tough guy.

314
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,510
You wouldn't understand.

315
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,640
I understand too well.

316
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,470
What's next?

317
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,000
You've cried your frustration out.

318
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,920
Let's go grab a bite.

319
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,880
I don't want to eat.

320
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,200
Then what do you want?

321
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,030
Kill yourself?

322
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,830
Let's go drinking.

323
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,750
My treat.

324
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,310
OK?

325
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,510
Let's go.

326
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:24,830
I know you are different from
Yang Dong and the others.

327
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,960
Go.

328
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,920
What do you mean?

329
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:35,510
I mean, you dare not kill yourself.

330
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,240
Welcome, sirs.

331
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,540
What would you like?

332
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,480
A bottle of Erguotou.

333
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,070
OK.

334
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:58,580
Two orders of quick-fried tripe,
a bowl of soymilk,

335
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,920
and one order of
deep-fried dough sticks.

336
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,920
Sit.

337
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:29,310
Grab a bite before you drink.

338
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,830
You'll be sick drinking like this.

339
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,200
Gonna throw up?

340
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,400
I lied to you.

341
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:27,750
I don't have floaters in my eyes,
instead, I have a countdown in there.

342
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,680
Don't you want to say anything,
like I'm sick, or I'm mental?

343
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:47,510
Since I came to see you,
I wouldn't doubt you.

344
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,950
Sirs, your food.

345
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,720
Enjoy.

346
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:56,480
I told Shen Yufei about it.

347
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,030
She told me to
stop my nano experiment.

348
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:06,510
I did as she said
and the countdown really disappeared.

349
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,350
A trick.

350
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:12,960
I thought it was a trick at first.

351
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,580
So I told her that I would restart
the experiment in three days.

352
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,340
If she could, she should project
the countdown onto the sun

353
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,310
and the entire universe.

354
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,550
And then?

355
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,920
She did it?

356
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,070
She really did it.

357
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:36,550
She did it exactly
at the time and the scale

358
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,310
she designated.

359
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:43,110
I went to the
radio astronomical observatory.

360
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:46,830
I saw the cosmic microwave data.

361
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:52,830
Then I went to Beijing Planetarium.

362
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:56,270
Then I went to Beijing Planetarium.

363
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,750
I borrowed a pair of 3K glasses.

364
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:06,920
I saw the entire universe
was flickering, flickering for me.

365
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:13,000
You're saying that
the universe was winking at you?

366
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:18,480
It was exactly the same
as the countdown in my eyes.

367
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,070
Bullshit.

368
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,350
It's true.

369
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,920
I saw it. Sha Ruishan saw it.

370
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,400
The Urumqi Observatory recorded it.

371
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,640
More bullshit.

372
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:44,110
Shi Qiang, have you ever considered
certain philosophical questions?

373
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,880
Where do we come from?

374
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,510
Where will we go?

375
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,240
Where does the universe come from
and where will it go?

376
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,990
Nope.

377
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,030
Never?

378
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,750
Never.

379
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,240
The sesame paste is too salty.

380
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:06,400
When you look at the stars,
don't you feel curious and awed at all?

381
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,110
I never look at the sky at night.

382
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,960
Don't you often work the night shift?

383
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,790
Buddy, when I work at night,

384
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,720
if I look up at the sky,
the suspect is going to escape.

385
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,130
We really have nothing to say
to each other.

386
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,310
You know what, even if I had time to look at
the stars and the moon,

387
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:27,480
I wouldn't be thinking about
your philosophical questions.

388
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,750
I have too much to worry about.

389
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,590
I gotta pay the mortgage.

390
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,960
My child hasn't found a job.

391
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,960
And the endless stream of cases...

392
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,590
I tell you what,
I'm such a simple man that

393
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:52,070
look down my throat
and you can see out my ass.

394
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,280
Naturally, I'm not that kind of person
bosses would like.

395
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,000
Years after being discharged
from the army,

396
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,510
my career is going nowhere.

397
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,880
If I weren't pretty good at my job,

398
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,270
I would have been kicked out
a long time ago.

399
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,680
How can I get the time to gaze at stars
and philosophize?

400
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,350
Have you heard of
the shooter hypothesis

401
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,070
and the farmer hypothesis?

402
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,750
Nope.

403
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:13,310
You're now a two-dimensional creature
inhabiting on the surface of the target,

404
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,830
or a turkey on the farm.

405
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,200
You're mocking me.

406
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,070
I can tell that.

407
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,640
Though I know nothing
about the hypothesis you referred to,

408
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:27,750
I do know an ultimate rule, which is,

409
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,030
anything sufficiently weird
must be fishy.

410
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,120
There's a reason to pull leather pants
on cotton-padded pants.

411
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,350
Either the latter is too thin
or the former is without fur.

412
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,590
What kind of crappy rule is that?

413
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,550
What crap?

414
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:39,310
There's always someone behind things
that don't have an explanation.

415
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,070
There's no one!

416
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,200
If you had a little
basic knowledge of science,

417
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,680
you'd know it's impossible for any force
to accomplish the things I experienced.

418
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,740
A countdown was displayed
at the scale of the universe.

419
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,030
You can't explain it
with our current science.

420
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,550
I couldn't even imagine
how to explain it outside of science.

421
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,790
It's more than supernatural.

422
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,030
It's super, I don't know what...

423
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:01,590
I'm telling you, bullshit.

424
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,550
I've seen plenty of weird things.

425
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:06,110
But I really want to know

426
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,240
what will happen
at the end of the countdown.

427
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,580
What can it be?

428
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,440
The destruction of earth?

429
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,440
Human dying out?

430
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,640
Or physics no longer existing?

431
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,640
Human science no longer existing?

432
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,830
So what?

433
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:27,950
Human returns to the agrarian society,
or even the primitive society.

434
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,960
We have to bore wood to get fire,
farm and hunt.

435
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,160
So what?

436
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,440
Our ancestors lived in that way.

437
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:36,200
We can also live in that way, right?

438
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:54,030
I know you want to comfort me.

439
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:57,160
If you don't think it's important,

440
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,750
you wouldn't have followed me
all the time, right?

441
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:06,200
The end of the countdown
will never be a simple degradation.

442
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,140
What exactly will happen?

443
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,060
What is there that we must face?

444
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,960
Why do they want to destroy our science?

445
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,280
Apart from our science,
what else will they destroy?

446
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,030
I'm right about you.

447
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:33,590
It was a compliment when I said
you dare not kill yourself.

448
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,550
All right.

449
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,590
Let's eat.

450
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,480
And then we go.

451
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,110
Where to go?

452
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,710
I'll send you home
so that you can get some sleep.

453
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,070
After the sleep?

454
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,110
You'll have dinner,
and then have some drinks.

455
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,150
And then get more sleep.

456
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,400
And then?

457
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,630
And then, you'll have to
work the next day.

458
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,400
There are only 1,103 hours left
before the end of the countdown.

459
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,230
Forget about the countdown.

460
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,150
Wang Miao, I tell you what,

461
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:05,230
your first priority is to stand straight
and not collapse into a heap.

462
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:08,630
Then we can talk about other things.

463
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:12,030
Shi Qiang, can you tell me something
about what's really going on?

464
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:15,590
I'm begging you.

465
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:22,920
I've said the very same thing
to Chang Weisi several times.

466
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,510
We're in the same boat, you and I.

467
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,670
I'll be honest with you.

468
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:30,400
I don't know anything.

469
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,920
In the Battle Command Center, at least,
I'm a turkey.

470
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,630
Do you know what turkey represents?

471
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,190
Nope.

472
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:43,280
But I do know, the harder they try
to scare you with something,

473
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,230
the less you should let them
satisfy their desires.

474
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,230
Now they're targeting you.

475
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:54,510
So, I'll never let you die easily.

476
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:58,000
Cheers.

477
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,000
Eat.

478
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,760
(Wang Miao (Nano, Coward) calling)

479
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,150
Hello.

480
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,110
Where are you?

481
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,880
Move a little. I'm upstairs.

482
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,480
Look up.

483
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,180
Now I see you.

484
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,880
Catch.

485
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,590
Are these all you've got?

486
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,550
The negatives are in there too.

487
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:20,400
All right.

488
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:25,480
Go get some sleep.

489
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,670
Daddy, come here.

490
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,710
Sit down.

491
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,920
Mom said your eyes were uncomfortable.

492
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,320
Let me check them.

493
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,150
Left.

494
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:19,350
Right.

495
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,630
Up.

496
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,710
Down.

497
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,030
Captain Shi,
I never thought you were so patient.

498
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:34,670
You're getting along better and better
with such a coward.

499
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:37,110
Focus on driving.

500
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,110
Daddy, I have a question for you.

501
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:43,000
Why shouldn't we eat many lotus roots?

502
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,390
Because they would make us ugly.

(Wang Miao Nano Coward)
Why is the water in the Eastern Sea so good?

504
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,760
(Edit remark)
I don't know.

505
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,020
Because of the Dragon King.

Why is the seafood in the Eastern Sea so good?

507
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,700
Because of the Dragon King?

508
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,630
No.

509
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,840
Because the Dragon King has a daughter
called Little Dragon Maiden.

510
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,070
Guys, dinner is ready.

00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:09,800
Daddy, let's have dinner.

512
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,800
OK.

513
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,340
Have dinner.

The teacher asked me again.

531
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,800
Are you going to give the lecture
in my school?

532
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,550
What lecture?

533
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,670
I told you the other day.

534
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,360
You are a professor of physics.

535
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,440
My teacher wants you
to give us a lecture in my school.

536
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,150
Physics?

537
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,280
Dad.

538
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,670
Please say yes.

539
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:31,710
Say yes.

540
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,030
Who can catch this ball?

541
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:40,840
Me. Me. Me.

542
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:46,320
(Charm of Physics) - Sir, me.
- Me. - Me.

543
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,030
Sir, I can catch it.

544
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:51,050
Sir, me, me.

545
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,550
OK, now I have a question for you.

546
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:59,000
Why does the ball always hit the ground
no matter how high I throw it?

547
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,880
Gravity.

548
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,960
Very good.

549
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,670
You are very smart.

550
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,960
This is the truth of physics.

551
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:12,630
It reveals the nature of all things
in the world and the laws of movement,

552
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,320
and explores the mysteries of nature.

553
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,630
Physics will tell you all the answers.

554
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:21,580
According to calculation,
using this rule,

555
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:25,040
we have a probability of about 3.22%
to reduce the costs.

556
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,190
And we may also solve the problem
that Nano Flying Blade

557
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,510
can't go into mass production.

558
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:31,480
Now the shutdown
and maintenance are over.

559
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,920
I declare, the experiment restarts.

560
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,150
This is the tennis ball we just tossed.

561
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,760
This is an iron ball.

562
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:46,070
If we release them at the same height
and the same time,

563
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,510
which will hit the ground first?

564
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:51,150
- Tennis ball.
- Iron ball.

565
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:51,880
OK.

566
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:59,070
Now let's count one, two, three,
and see which will hit the ground first.

567
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,840
Mr. Wang, everything is ready.

568
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,800
The experiment can restart in two hours.

569
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:16,320
One, two, three.

570
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:43,920
Ready to restart.

571
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:08,950
As you saw,
they hit the ground at the same time.

572
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:10,360
This is physics.

573
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:14,630
It isn't based on imagination
or speculation.

574
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:17,590
We need to conduct experiments
down to earth,

575
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:20,150
one experiment after another.

576
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:25,030
Our experiments may fail,
but we shouldn't give up.

577
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,280
Like when you were little,
you had to learn to walk,

578
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,150
ride a bike, and skate.

579
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:34,500
What would you do
if you fell down accidentally?

580
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:38,550
Stand up.

581
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,140
Very good.

582
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:44,760
You won't stop moving forward
just because you are afraid of falling.

583
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:50,960
Of course, it will never be easy
to pursue the truth.

584
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:57,280
You'll face setbacks and suspicion.

585
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,440
But whether Giordano Bruno
or Galileo,

586
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,510
history has eventually proved that

587
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:10,400
their adherence to the truth
is incomparably correct.

588
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:20,150
Let's stick to our intention
of pursuing truth and never give up.

589
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,280
What's this?

590
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,150
Look carefully.

591
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,030
Look in the middle.

592
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,670
What's this?

593
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:41,550
Countdown.

594
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:55,920
Dr. Ding.

595
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:11,670
Dr. Ding.

596
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:25,960
Stay back.

597
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:43,320
In 1975, Victor, the scientist,

598
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,830
used a high-energy electron
accelerator collider to verify his model.

599
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,070
But he failed.

600
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:51,550
Then he stayed there for over four hours
to check all the components,

601
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:54,630
and eventually found that
his calculation was incorrect.

602
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:59,320
So are you paying tribute
to Victor now?

603
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,800
The first data at 9:07,
the second data at 10:22,

604
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,230
and the third data at 10:50
are inconsistent.

605
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:12,840
Neither are they consistent
with the calculation.

606
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,030
The experiment failed.

607
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:19,100
I saw all the data.

608
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,510
I think at most,

609
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:25,800
the verification hasn't been completed.
It isn't a failure.

610
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:30,960
But I didn't find any regular patterns.

611
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,840
This kind of problem
happens in most experiments.

612
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:42,480
If it were me,
I would find various excuses.

613
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:49,280
Maybe my outfit today isn't right.

614
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,430
Or maybe I shouldn't
have had that cup of coffee.

615
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,000
Or maybe I shouldn't

616
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,070
have played that music during bath
last night.

617
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:00,550
I think
you should think about it in this way.

618
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:04,230
Maybe you left home
too early this morning.

619
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:08,000
Maybe you didn't wear the perfume
I gave you.

620
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:19,510
Maybe, the experiment will go smoothly
if you say yes to my proposal.

621
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:27,630
You should know, every time when we get
inaccurate data,

622
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:30,260
it means the theoretical models become
more and more complex,

623
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:33,550
vague, and uncertain.

624
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,190
Experimental verification will
become more and more difficult.

625
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:43,480
Then you should measure more times.

626
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:52,440
And I'll propose more times.
