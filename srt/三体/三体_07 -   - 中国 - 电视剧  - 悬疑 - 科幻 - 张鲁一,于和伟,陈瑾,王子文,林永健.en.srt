1
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,110
Professor Wang,
have you seen through my tricks?

2
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,100
I think it's a device.

3
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,070
Tell me about that.

4
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,830
You can set up a screen
with a width of over 300,000 km

5
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,670
beyond the observation range
of all observatories

6
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,510
in space 150,000 km
away from the earth,

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,870
and project on the screen
the universe flicker

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,150
you want to display.

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,560
Then I can see it.

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,030
Interesting.

11
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,790
Similarly, by setting up a screen with
a size of less than 2 mm

12
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,710
very near to my pupils,

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,150
you can also project the countdown
in front of my eyes.

14
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:51,850
Don't you think
it's pseudoscience heresy?

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,600
Everything beyond scientific cognition

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,150
is called pseudoscience heresy
at the beginning, right?

17
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,710
If I now go to a primitive tribe
where there isn't even electric light,

18
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,350
and play an open-air movie
for the tribesmen,

19
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,730
they'll be as shocked as I was
when they see the movie.

20
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,150
Are you indicating
you're living in a primitive tribe?

21
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,920
You've done so many things
just to make me think I am a turkey.

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,400
Fine.

23
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,310
As a turkey scientist,
I really want to know

24
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,310
which farm I belong to
and who is the farmer.

25
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,180
Can I get the answer
if I join the Frontiers of Science?

26
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,810
You have the right to join us.

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,090
Hello?

28
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,420
Hello?

29
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,820
(A new message from: Shen Yufei)

30
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:55,200
(No. 38, Fenghangling Road,
from: Shen Yufei, June 17th, 2007)

31
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,570
Buddha, please help my Lord
break away from misery.

32
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,300
Wang Miao restarted his
nanomaterial project.

33
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,780
You failed.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,620
He joined us.

35
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,530
Anyway, his project doesn't stop.

36
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,870
It's not your call
to decide whether I fail or not.

37
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,180
What?

38
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,910
You want him to know about
Lord's world?

39
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,650
We all started from that, didn't we?

40
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,630
You are always willing to do
such insignificant things.

41
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:40,000
What I do is more significant
than what you do.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,620
I hope Lord
will approve of your significance.

51

It broke down again.

52
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,120
It's a little toy
made by one of my students.

53
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,430
Currently, it isn't mature enough.

54
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,430
The battery has a low storage capacity.

(Scholar Community)

56
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,240
If the battery is big,
it'll take up more space.

57
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,310
If it's small,
it can't drive a powerful motor.

58
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,040
I think it's useless for now.

59
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,510
Who are you here to see?

60
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,930
Shen Yufei.

61
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,450
Come with me.

62
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,120
The temple seems to be
different from other temples.

63
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,190
Yes.

64
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,480
Other temples need pilgrims
to offer money to stay afloat.

65
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,190
So they want more tourists.

66
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,600
This temple doesn't.

67
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,550
It's peaceful and quiet here.

68
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,740
Most of our visitors
are engaged in academic research.

69
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,950
Sometimes when they
have problems they can't solve,

70
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,480
they'll come here
and stay for a couple of days.

71
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,240
The rent here is very high.

72
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,570
It's enough to support us.

73
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,630
Please.

74
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,860
Thanks.

75
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,480
Do you like soda?

76
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,600
They're all the same.

77
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,390
After getting into our body,

78
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,480
food may only be divided into
absorbable and non-absorbable.

79
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,890
What's the difference?

80
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,070
You want to see Shen Yufei?

81
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,160
Do you also research nanomaterials?

82
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,330
Yes.

83
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,030
That's good.

84
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,250
Good.

85
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,680
Sir, you're merciful.

86
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,160
A world in a grain of sand.

87
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,120
A bodhi in a leaf.

88
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,930
You just saved
this civilization from destruction in floods.

89
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,750
You work in nanomaterials.

90
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,860
You should understand that.

91
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,680
Professor Han used to study
particle physics

92
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,750
in Europe and America.

93
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,750
Since he returned to China,
he's been teaching particle physics.

94
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,310
Let bygones be bygones.

95
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,510
Now, I live near the temple.

96
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,920
I may become a monk someday.

97
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,990
I've come up with a monk name, Daydream.

98
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,790
It's not like a sweet dream.

99
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,890
It's a nightmare.

100
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,250
I know.

101
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,100
What do you know?

102
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,120
When your research comes to a dead end,

103
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,120
you'll find that
your research is nothing but a daydream.

104
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,940
I'll leave you alone to talk.

105
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,320
Many scientists will look for
other gratification when they reach

106
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,360
an unbreakable bottleneck
in their research.

107
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,890
They would like to come here
and ponder the problems they can't solve.

108
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,010
Professor Munphy's last stop was here.

109
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,540
So Professor Munphy's suicide
had something to do with you.

110
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,630
If you committed suicide after
you had seen the universe flicker,

111
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,360
does it have anything to do with me?

112
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,700
I only told you the truth.

113
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,550
I've decided to join
the Frontiers of Science.

114
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,480
So you can tell me now,
what the farmer is?

115
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,770
What will happen
at the end of the countdown?

116
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,020
Professor Wang,

117
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,050
you seem to have gotten used to
the countdown in front of your eyes.

118
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,080
Yes.

119
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,820
It always reminds me that
I'm a turkey.

120
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,550
I was a little anxious
and panicked before.

121
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,360
But now I'm even looking forward to

122
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,440
knowing what will happen
at the end of the countdown.

123
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,220
A turkey can be curious.

124
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,510
What you see is a miracle.

125
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:13,700
But not everyone can accept
the truth behind the miracle.

126
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,550
If you like,

127
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:24,370
you can go to the farmer's world
for a look.

128
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,670
Compared with traditional media,
new media uses digital technology,

129
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,080
(New Media New Thinking)
network technology, mobile technology,

130
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,550
by Internet,
wireless communication network,

131
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,960
- Excuse me.
- satellite and other channels,

132
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,870
as well as computers, mobile phones,
digital TVs and other terminals...

133
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,440
I'm late.

134
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,670
Sit down.

135
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,960
Is it just starting?

136
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,350
Yes, it is.

137
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,630
According to the statistics,
by December, 2006,

138
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:04,180
the number of netizens in China
has reached 180 million.

139
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,820
In the future,
it's likely to reach 500 million,

140
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,440
even one billion.

141
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,270
Judging by the characteristics
of new media,

142
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,700
it affects our daily life
in the following aspects...

143
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,360
(Impact of Environmental Pollution
on Ecology)

144
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,670
Wait.

145
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,830
Sir, please wait for me.

146
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,870
You lost something.

147
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,390
Hello.

148
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,770
Is this yours?

150
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
Thanks.

151
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,510
My name is Mu Xing.

152
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,870
I'm an independent media worker.

153
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,670
May I know your name?

154
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,890
Pan Han.

155
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,360
It's really you.

156
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,740
The famous
biologist and environmentalist.

157
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,120
You've created
China's first experimental community,

158
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,510
Pastoral China.

159
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,650
Can we have a talk?

160
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,910
OK.

161
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,510
Thanks.

162
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,750
Is there any difference

163
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,360
between Pastoral China and
the "return to nature" utopian groups

164
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,710
in the West?

165
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,430
The primary difference is that

166
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,870
Pastoral China isn't
located in the wilderness,

167
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,380
but in the midst of a large city.

168
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,150
Your funding source is...

169
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,440
We have no property at all.

170
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,120
It's an experiment
that turns urban trash

171
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,120
into daily necessities.

172
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,680
Why haven't you asked the press
to promote your program?

173
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,150
Environmental protection is
for public welfare, not for show.

174
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:25,410
Miss Mu,
do you listen to the weather forecast?

175
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,870
Yes.

176
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:31,890
Do you know when the air pollution index
was added into the playlist?

177
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,960
It's...

178
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,940
When it started to affect people's life.

179
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,270
Are you suggesting that
the press is only needed when

180
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:44,860
environmental problems begin to
affect human's survival?

181
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,360
I'm in a hurry, Miss Mu.

182
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,270
Let's talk next time.

183
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,120
Mr. Pan, sorry to bother you.

184
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,480
But if I didn't find the information
and returned it to you,

185
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,790
they would have been lost.

186
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,440
Can I borrow it?

187
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,100
I'll return it to you after I read it.

188
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,980
Give me your number.

189
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,120
Thanks.

190
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,910
Don't lose it.

191
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,100
Sure.

192
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,200
Mu Xing has attended several
academic forums recently and

193
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,720
contacted with quite a few scientists.

194
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,150
Today she went to a new media forum.

195
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,200
She left during the event

196
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,080
and talked with a man
called Pan Han for a while.

197
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,550
The man is a biologist engaged in
environmental protection.

198
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,960
Environmental protection?

199
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,000
What did they talk about?

200
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,270
Nothing.

201
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,430
And Pan Han seemed
not willing to talk to her.

202
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,870
Keep an eye on her.

203
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,100
Yes.

204
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,600
(Three-Body)

205
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,510
Three-Body?

206
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,480
What's this?

207
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,550
It seems to be a game.

208
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,550
Game?

209
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,390
Log in.

210
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,600
Play it.

211
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,360
I can't.

212
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,150
Why can't you play it?

213
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,840
The game requires a V-suit.

214
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,720
V-suit?

215
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,100
What's that?

216
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:10,480
Chang, we need you to pay for
the expense of the game suit.

217
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,870
You know what, the suit is amazing.

218
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:17,640
When you log in to the game,
you can go up to the sky.

219
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,510
Take you for example.

220
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,670
If you stamp your foot in the game,
you'll leap into the sky like fireworks.

221
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,120
Like Superman.

222
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,320
Have you played it?

223
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,630
I heard of it from others.

224
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,430
From who?

225
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,840
People of the Frontiers of Science.

226
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,000
They play the game.

227
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,950
Yeah.

228
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,600
I need it for work.

229
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,960
Just pay for it.

230
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,870
It's a little expensive.

231
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,910
You should report the expense
to the Finance.

232
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:42,910
I don't have to bother you
if I can make it clear with them.

233
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,240
By the way, I heard from the
European Combat Zone this morning

234
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,620
that in Northern Europe,
another scientist committed suicide.

235
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,600
So, it's urgent.

236
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,750
Don't worry, Chang.

237
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,910
With this, I'll pass the game.

238
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,320
Do you think it's as easy
as the Snake you play?

239
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,020
You and Wang Miao must try your best.

240
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:13,400
(Chang Weisi)

241
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,600
My gloves are a little tight.

242
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,020
So are mine.

243
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,510
Do I wear it right?

244
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,530
OK.

245
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,790
You said Shen Yufei told you
the website of the game

246
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,870
and the shop that sold the V-suits.

247
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,630
The things are so expensive.

248
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,120
Do you think she's a saleswoman?

249
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,460
The development costs of games played
with V-suits is beyond your imagination.

250
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,480
Can I wear this?

251
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,000
The countdown timer.

252
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,310
Is it electrified?

253
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:59,650
Take it off. Don't wear it.

254
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,200
I can't.

255
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,840
We agreed to live and die together.

256
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,840
OK, that's it.

257
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,910
Ready.

258
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,720
OK.

259
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,960
Be careful when you log in.

260
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,240
Don't worry.

261
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,480
Being a policeman for years,

262
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,000
I've caught 29 bad guys
with my bare hands,

263
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,240
knocked down 17 guys
and shot 16 with my gun.

264
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,360
Enough.

265
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,740
Don't beat people at will
when you get in the game.

266
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,910
How could I?

267
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,580
I even don't know
what it's like in there.

268
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,320
Maybe we're all turkeys and
we can only peck each other.

269
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:31,370
Shen Yufei said it was a world
of the shooter and the farmer.

270
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,340
Let's go.

271
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:31,160
(Three-Body)

272
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,510
(Welcome to Three-Body.)

273
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:37,090
(Please create your own ID.)

274
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,080
(Hairen)

275
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,120
(Stew)

276
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,540
It's cold.

277
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,240
Yes, very cold.

278
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,150
This is the Warring States Period.

279
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,510
I am King Wen of Zhou.

280
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,790
King Wen doesn't belong to
the Warring States Period, right?

281
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,680
He's survived until now.

282
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,030
King Zhou of Shang is alive, too.

283
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,680
I am a follower of King Wen.

284
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,110
That's my log-in ID.

285
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,240
Follower of King Wen of Zhou.

286
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,180
He's a genius.

287
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,310
My log-in ID is Hairen.

288
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,580
The stuff on your back
looks very heavy.

289
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,640
Sure.

290
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,090
The distance and weight here
are real as in life.

291
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,090
Sandglass.

292
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,430
This is sandglass.

293
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,590
Every eight hours, all the sand
flows to the bottom.

294
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,830
Flip it three times
and you can measure a day.

295
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:25,960
But I often forget to flip it,
and I need Follower here to remind me.

296
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,180
Hey.

297
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,110
You seem to be on a very long journey.

298
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,880
Is it necessary
to carry such a bulky clock?

299
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,000
Or what?

300
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,670
How else would we measure time?

301
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,480
You can carry a portable sundial.

302
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,200
Or you can just look at the sun
and know the approximate time.

303
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,640
The sun?

304
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,510
How can the sun tell us the time?

305
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,960
We're in the midst of a Chaotic Era.

306
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,350
Chaotic Era?

307
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,400
It's so cold! I'm almost frozen.

308
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,510
Hurry, let's go.

309
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,720
It will be colder if we stop.

310
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,030
When the sun comes out,
it will be warmer.

311
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,500
Are you pretending to be
some kind of oracle?

312
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,350
Even King Wen cannot predict the future.

313
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,960
Do you need an oracle to predict that?

314
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,680
Everyone can see that

315
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,630
the sun will rise in about
another hour or two.

316
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,590
This is a Chaotic Era!

317
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,160
What is a Chaotic Era?

318
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,270
Other than Stable Eras,
all times are Chaotic Eras.

319
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:22,440
Is the Chaotic Era known to all?

320
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,460
Look at the sun.

321
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,790
So it's dusk instead of dawn?

322
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,310
It is dawn.

323
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:37,390
But the sun doesn't always
rise in the dawn.

324
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,510
That's what a Chaotic Era is like.

325
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:44,030
It looks like the sun
won't rise for a long time.

326
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,510
What makes you think that?

327
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,270
There's no way to be certain.

328
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:52,510
Ji Chang, may I have some dried fish?

329
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,240
No.

330
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,030
I barely have enough for myself.

331
00:21:55,030 --> 00:22:00,610
We must guarantee that
I make it to Zhaoge, not you.

332
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,270
Look over there!

333
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,530
The sun is rising over there.

334
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,400
But the direction
is different from last time.

335
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,510
Are we in the wrong way?

336
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,400
I told you it's a Chaotic Era.

337
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,310
Finally, it's getting warmer.

338
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:20,500
But why is the sun bluish in color?

339
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,460
Why did it set so soon?

340
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,240
These branches.

341
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,980
We can use some as firewood.

342
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,740
Hurry, hurry up.

343
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:59,090
You know what, I hate to light a fire.

344
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,000
Guys,
do you know a man called Wang Miao?

345
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,200
Wang Miao?

346
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,470
I don't know him.

347
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,870
Why don't you join us?

348
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,650
Aren't you cold?
Warm yourself at the fire.

349
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,980
It's really cold.

350
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:39,400
If we
burn some of the dehydrated bodies,

351
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,590
we'll have a roaring fire.

352
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:43,030
Nonsense! Only the tyrant King Zhou
would do that.

353
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,310
The dehydrated bodies are
scattered along the road.

354
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,830
They've been torn,

355
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,750
and won't be revivable
even when rehydrated.

356
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:52,880
If your theory really works,
we can even eat some,

357
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,160
let alone burn a few of them.

358
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:00,900
How can a few lives compare to
the importance of your theory?

359
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:05,000
No way.

360
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,770
We're scholars!

361
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,790
It's finally burnt out.

362
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,460
Let's continue our journey.

363
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,160
Who do you follow?

364
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,000
Follow?

365
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,590
Let me put it this way.

366
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,900
What do you research?

367
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,000
Are you a newcomer?

368
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Yeah, I'm a rookie.

369
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,830
We follow King Zhou
and we're going to Zhaoge.

370
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,240
Do you want to join us?

371
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,000
Be an accessory to a tyrant?

372
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,030
Forget it. Zhaoge is too far.

373
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,240
I have to find my friend.

374
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,660
Where is Miao?

375
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,380
No, no.

376
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,140
We can have enough today.

377
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,660
We've flipped the sandglass six times.

378
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,420
It's been two days.

379
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:25,350
In the two days,
the sun never rose once,

380
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,510
not even a hint of dawn
over the horizon.

381
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:31,270
It seems that
the sun will never rise again.

382
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:35,680
I told you not to
pretend to be an oracle.

383
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,250
This is a Chaotic Era!

384
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,720
The sun is rising over there!

385
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,950
Look!

386
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:46,070
It looks like a normal sun!

387
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:49,590
I'm warning you
not to pretend to be an oracle.

388
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,140
It's finally getting warm.

389
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,400
Oh, dear!

390
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,830
What should we do?

391
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,480
Find shade quickly!

392
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,480
What's wrong?

393
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,640
Hurry. Hurry.

394
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,090
What's wrong?

395
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,070
Traveling during a Chaotic Era
is like walking through hell.

396
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,440
I can't stand it anymore.

397
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,480
I can't.

398
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,830
Then you should be dehydrated.

399
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,880
OK.

400
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,790
Wait.

401
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,440
You won't abandon me, will you?

402
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,350
Don't worry.

403
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,270
I promise to bring you to Zhaoge.

404
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,790
OK.

405
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:44,530
Dehydrate me.

406
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,090
What happened to him?

407
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,160
Is he dead?

408
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,250
No.

409
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,400
He'll recover soon,
when we soak him in water.

410
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,940
It's just like soaking dried mushrooms.

411
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,980
Even his bones have turned soft?

412
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,020
Yes.

413
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,680
They've turned into dried fibers.

414
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,750
This makes him easy to carry.

415
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:22,030
In this world,
can everyone be dehydrated?

416
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,400
Of course. You can, too.

417
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,030
Otherwise we could not
survive the Chaotic Eras.

418
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:29,140
You carry him.

419
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,710
Oh, dear!

420
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,310
My friend.

421
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,270
No.

422
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,820
I must find him.

423
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:44,100
If a turkey doesn't drink water,
will it die of thirst?

424
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,310
You can choose to be dehydrated
if you can't stand it.

425
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,470
Dehydrated?

426
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,980
How could I be dehydrated?

427
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,010
You only have to say

428
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,250
(Dehydrate me)
these two words.

429
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,240
This is the password.

430
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,640
Is it some kind of trap?

431
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,510
What can you get
if I say dehydrate me?

432
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:14,050
I, I...

433
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,510
What are you doing?

434
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,110
Who are you?

435
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,160
Give him back to me.

436
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,830
He is my friend.

437
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,960
Give him back to me!

438
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,590
Do you know he is dehydrated?

439
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,110
The only way he contributes

440
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:40,240
to this civilization
is to be our food or firewood.

441
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,070
You're unreasonable!

442
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,610
Give him back to me!

443
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
- Give me!
- Wang Miao.

444
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,590
Wang Miao.

445
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,400
Give him back to me!

446
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,880
You don't understand
the truth of the world.

447
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,350
Wang Miao, hang in there.

448
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,790
I'll log in right now. Hang in there.

449
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,480
Wait a minute.

450
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,140
In order to achieve our goals,

451
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,000
(Game Over)

452
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,330
this is nothing.

453
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,880
How is your friend?

454
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,640
He was dehydrated
and taken by some guys.

455
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,110
What will happen to him?

456
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,720
It's normal.

457
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,790
He can't adapt to this world.

458
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,500
Let's start off.

459
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,740
I can finally have water.

460
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,380
How long has it been?

461
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,240
About a month.

462
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,070
It's either extremely hot
or extremely cold.

463
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,070
The Chaotic Era is killing me.

464
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,180
Flying stars.

465
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,270
Two flying stars!

466
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,750
We've seen them yesterday.

467
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,400
They look bigger than ordinary stars.

468
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,270
Yes.

469
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,480
They show up as disks.

470
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,790
They move through the sky

471
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,110
quickly enough for the naked eye
to detect the motion.

472
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,510
But it's different this time.

473
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,640
How come?

474
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,000
There are two of them.

475
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,440
Two flying stars!

476
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,110
A Stable Era is about to begin!

477
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,820
Is two the most we'll see at once?

478
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,030
No. Sometimes three will appear,
but no more than that.

479
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:43,240
If three flying stars appear,
does that herald an even better era?

480
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,440
What are you talking about?

481
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,880
Three flying stars?

482
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,810
Pray that such a thing never happens.

483
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,350
It hasn't been so pleasant
in a long time.

484
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:03,110
How long does this Stable Era last?

485
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,750
A day or a century.

486
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,150
No one can predict that.

487
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:10,640
According to historical records,
the Western Zhou Dynasty

488
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,790
experienced a Stable Era
lasting two centuries.

489
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,830
How lucky to be born during such a time!

490
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,830
What about a Chaotic Era?

491
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,190
How long does it last?

492
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,330
I already told you.

493
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,790
Other than Stable Eras,
all other times belong to Chaotic Eras.

494
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,270
Each of them takes up the time
not occupied by the other.

495
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,880
This is a world in which
there are no patterns.

496
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,270
Yes.

497
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:34,580
Civilization here can only develop
in the mild climate of Stable Eras.

498
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,790
Most of the time,

499
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,110
humankind must collectively
dehydrate and be stored.

500
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,400
When a long Stable Era arrives,

501
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,350
they collectively revive
through rehydration.

502
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,000
Then they proceed to build and produce.

503
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,880
How can we predict the arrival
and duration of each Stable Era?

504
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,880
You can't.

505
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,960
Nobody can do that.

506
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,550
When a Stable Era arrives,

507
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,680
the King makes a decision
based on intuition

508
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,590
as to whether to engage in
mass rehydration.

509
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:03,880
Often, the people are revived,
crops are planted,

510
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,880
cities begin construction,
life has just started,

511
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,000
and then the Stable Era ends.

512
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Extreme cold and heat
then destroy everything.

513
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,070
Congratulations.

514
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,790
Now you know the goal of this game.

515
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:18,640
It's to use our intellect
and understanding

516
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,630
to analyze all phenomena

517
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,550
until we can know the pattern
of the sun's movement.

518
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:27,750
The survival of civilization
depends on it.

519
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,720
Based on my observations,

520
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,310
there is no pattern
to the sun's movement at all.

521
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:34,000
That's because you don't understand
the fundamental nature of the world.

522
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,350
And you do?

523
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,750
Yes.

524
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:41,590
I'm going to Zhaoge
to present King Zhou

525
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,480
with an accurate calendar.

526
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,240
How long before we get to Zhaoge?

527
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,140
Soon. We'll be there soon.

528
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,640
Have you heard anything?

529
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,440
That's the sound of the pendulums.

530
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,940
We've arrived in Zhaoge.

531
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:13,400
Those are pendulums.

532
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:18,460
The sight of them suggests
the end of our journey.

533
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:21,920
Help!

534
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,220
Hurry.

535
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,960
There's a pyramid in Zhaoge?

536
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,110
Yes.

537
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:31,550
In order to survive
during a Chaotic Era,

538
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:34,640
one must live in thick-walled buildings
like this one,

539
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,740
as though one were living underground.

540
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:41,700
It's the only way to avoid
the extreme heat and cold.

541
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,660
My king.

542
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,150
My beloved deputy, as you were.

543
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,110
This is Fu Xi.

544
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:13,710
Apparently he has his own theory.

545
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:18,110
Yes. He thinks that
the sun is a temperamental god.

546
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:21,030
When the god is awake,
his moods are unpredictable,

547
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,320
and thus we have a Chaotic Era.

548
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,440
But when he's asleep,
his breathing evens out,

549
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,230
and thus we have a Stable Era.

550
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,760
Fu Xi suggested that
I build those pendulums out there

551
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,110
and keep them in constant motion.

552
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:35,550
He claims that the pendulums can have
a hypnotic effect on the sun god

553
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:39,190
and cause him to sink into
a long slumber.

554
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:42,840
I've never heard that
anyone can hypnotize the sun.

555
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,760
It doesn't seem useful.

556
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,880
Yes.

557
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,400
So far, the sun god remains awake,

558
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,570
though from time to time
he naps briefly.

559
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,530
What is he going to do?

560
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,860
Go to hell!

561
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,670
Foolish witchcraft.

562
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,140
What have you learned about the sun?

563
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,360
My king, the sun is not a god.

564
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,550
The sun is yang, and the night is yin.

565
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:19,030
The world proceeds on the balance
between yin and yang.

566
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:22,670
Though we can't control it,
we can predict it.

567
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:26,710
If you can predict it,
you'll be the hero of the world.

568
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,480
But many people who claimed
to be able to predict it

569
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,380
ended up in the bronze cauldron.

570
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:42,960
My king, this is the code of the universe.

571
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:50,000
With it, I can present your dynasty
with an accurate calendar.

572
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,150
Ji Chang, I'm eager to know

573
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,800
when the next long Stable Era
will come.

574
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,420
I will forecast it for you right now.

575
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,760
Next will be
a Chaotic Era lasting 41 days.

576
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,480
Then comes a five-day Stable Era.

577
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:15,190
Thereafter, there will be
a 23-day Chaotic Era

578
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,840
followed by an 18-day Stable Era.

579
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,190
Then we'll have an
eight-day Chaotic Era.

580
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:24,880
But when this Chaotic Era is over,
my king,

581
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,480
the long Stable Era you've been
waiting for will begin.

582
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,150
That Stable Era
will last three years and nine months.

583
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:38,440
The climate will be so mild
that it will be a golden age.

584
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,590
King Zhou seems not to be

585
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:44,500
very excited
about the accurate prediction.

586
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:49,130
We have to
verify your predictions first.

587
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,400
Report!

588
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,400
My king, all the initial predictions
have been verified.

589
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,590
Ji Chang,
I shall erect a monument for you,

590
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:26,670
one even greater than this palace.

591
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:32,880
My king,
awaken your dynasty and let it prosper!

592
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,340
Rehydrate!

593
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:56,380
Rehydrate!

594
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:05,860
Rehydrate!

595
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,960
My foot!

596
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,980
My finger!

597
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,960
How long have we been dehydrated?

598
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,710
If they weren't rehydrated in time,
they would all have been

599
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:01,150
eaten by the Chaotic Era rats.

600
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:04,500
Enjoy the beautiful Stable Era!

601
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:09,090
You're lucky!
