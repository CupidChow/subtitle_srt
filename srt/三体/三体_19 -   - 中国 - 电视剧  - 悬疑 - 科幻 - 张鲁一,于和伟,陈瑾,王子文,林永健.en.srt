00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,510
Hello?

10
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,120
Hello?

11
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,870
Where are you?

12
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,840
Why weren't you answering your phone?

13
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,620
Just now I was out of cell range.

14
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,190
I think I'll get to the village entrance
in a minute.

15
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,120
Alright. I'll wait for you
at the village entrance.

16
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,130
Okay.

17
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,690
Chang has gotten access
to the files of Red Coast.

18
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,860
Do you know the purpose
of Red Coast Base?

19
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,710
To search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

20
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,840
Simply put, to look for aliens.

21
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,470
You knew it?

22
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,650
Yeah.

23
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,750
Chang has shared this information
with other Combat Zones.

24
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,560
He also pulled their files
about their search

25
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,020
for extraterrestrial intelligence
in recent years.

26
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,190
Where's Ye Wenjie?

27
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,560
She said she wanted to stay here
for a while, reminisce about the past,

28
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,650
and visit her old friends
while she's at it.

29
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,470
The old lady's surprisingly poised.
What about her relations with Shen Yufei?

30
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,360
According to Qi Jianguo,
they didn't have many dealings.

31
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,680
And her red ginseng?

32
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,630
That was a gift from the villagers.

33
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,430
Professor Ye has nothing to do
with the red ginseng factory.

34
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,240
What about you?

35
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,530
Did you find anything about the factory?

36
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,520
Shen Yufei's just an adviser
working for the foreign company.

37
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,360
She periodically comes here

38
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,910
to check the fruits of development
before acceptance.

39
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,000
She seems to be in a hurry.
She's already left.

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,080
Outwardly, there's nothing suspicious.

41
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,870
But I don't believe it.

42
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,740
I don't believe it's so coincidental.

43
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,860
But I have no way
to arrest her or interrogate her.

44
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,310
Let's go.

45
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,510
Where to?

46
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,860
Home. To do some research
about Red Coast.

47
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,680
Can we have some rest first?

48
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,510
Is it possible to have them
send that chopper here to pick us up?

49
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,500
Do I look like a chopper to you?

50
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,100
Just now you said Ye Wenjie
wanted to visit some old friends.

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,360
What kind of old friends?

52
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,000
Given that she lived here
for so many years.

53
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,540
She probably has a lot of friends.

54
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,980
Old friends.

55
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,920
In your description,

56
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:25,180
Red Coast was made of harsh cold steel.

57
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,510
I always thought
this place was a forest of concrete.

58
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:35,130
But the sight of it makes me feel

59
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,980
it has something warm about it.

60
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:46,230
That's because it's abandoned.

61
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,690
It's old.

62
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:56,200
Anything that has lost its power
and is dying

63
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,740
tends not to put people on the defensive.

64
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,740
I feel like a pilgrim here.

65
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:18,130
Like a believer who finally made it
to Jerusalem.

66
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:24,300
This is where it all started.

67
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:30,570
As the Buddha puts it,
it's predestined bonding.

68
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,690
Long time no see, Commander.

69
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,930
You don't have to call me that.

70
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,920
The Commander's status is untouchable.

71
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:57,870
To me, to ETO,
you're our spiritual leader.

72
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:02,180
You'll always be the supreme commander
of ETO.

73
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,620
When I was all alone in this world,

74
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,120
with nowhere to find
any spiritual assistance,

75
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,360
when I was even too helpless
to understand the meaning of life,

76
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,000
even the meaning of despair
was beyond me.

77
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,800
Whenever such greatness appeared,

78
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,890
I saw how small and despicable we were,

79
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,010
that lives were worthy
of respect and sacrifice,

80
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,920
that everything changed.

81
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:37,220
Then a door opened,
and a new road appeared.

82
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:45,370
You were the one who lit that lamp,
Commander.

83
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,680
Only you pushed

84
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,300
the button to contact Lord.

85
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:03,660
Pushing a button
is just an insignificant movement.

86
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,560
Many major changes in human history

87
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,240
were triggered
by an insignificant movement.

88
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,600
Stefan Zweig even picked some stories
and made a book out of them.

89
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,380
Decisive Moments in History.

90
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,660
But they're different from you.

91
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,860
You didn't do it by accident.

92
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,030
You made a choice.

93
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,870
Even the achievements
of all outstanding humans combined

94
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:42,540
stand no comparison
with the great decision you made.

95
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:47,010
What really established
a communication mechanism with Lord

96
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,050
was your Second Red Coast.

97
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,540
It's our Second Red Coast.

98
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:05,120
(19 years ago)

99
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,720
You named it the Second Red Coast?

100
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,240
Yeah.

101
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,650
Red Coast is a great name.

102
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,270
What is this place?

103
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,550
Judgment Day.

104
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,030
Three years ago,

105
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,840
you gave me the direction and frequency
required for contacting Lord.

106
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,370
Otherwise the Second Red Coast
would never have been built.

107
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,650
Contacting Lord will take a long time.

108
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,440
Yeah.

109
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,720
Our lives are too short.

110
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,530
Fortunately, you gave me
and ETO a chance.

111
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,270
Commander, if you didn't choose me,

112
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:21,500
I would never be able to communicate
with Lord.

113
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,960
At that time, in front of the first batch
of ETO members,

114
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:33,080
you said our ideal was to invite Lord
to reform human civilization,

115
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:38,960
to curb human madness and evilness,
so that the Earth can once again

116
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:44,650
become a harmonious, prosperous,
sinless world.

117
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,750
Yeah.

118
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:52,500
But now everything has changed.

119
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,000
You disagree with me,

120
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,860
because you haven't seen
the true colors of mankind.

121
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,150
Everything you did was based on love.

122
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,790
You love mankind.

123
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,340
You love the earth.

124
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,600
Even becoming the Commander

125
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,200
was your move to keep ETO
from losing control.

126
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,050
There's too little I can do.

127
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,510
I looked into you.

128
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:33,620
I even read your father's books.

129
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,120
I found that in this aspect,

130
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,480
you're greatly influenced
by your father.

131
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,840
Because of your great sense
of responsibility,

132
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,030
no matter how much harm you suffer,

133
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,950
you'll never give up
the last bit of hope.

134
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:52,670
You can't bear to part
from the splendid human civilization,

135
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,550
but has it ever occurred to you

136
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,720
that the evil of humanity
is imperishable?

137
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,010
Even I, your very first follower,
has betrayed you.

138
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,530
Commander,
humans are absolutely incorrigible.

139
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,990
Actually,

140
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,130
you didn't have to come here to see me.

141
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,840
I know you're still trying
to get information about Lord.

142
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,840
You even rebuilt the reception system.

143
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,440
It's right here.

144
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,460
This used to be the great Red Coast.

145
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,550
I never thought
you'd build a new Red Coast

146
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,370
on the ruins of the abandoned one.

147
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:46,940
I think we should call it
the Third Red Coast.

148
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,120
Did you change
the reception and transmission methods?

149
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,220
Or have you been fabricating it
this whole time?

150
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,240
Lord is coming.

151
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,530
Who am I to fabricate that?

152
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:15,200
I think it's merciful
to let humans destroy themselves.

153
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,840
Only humans will be destroyed.

154
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,770
This world will be changed.

155
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,630
Commander,
has there ever been any mercy

156
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,460
in the history of human civilization?

157
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:38,890
Evans, you still have a choice.

158
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:47,840
Compared with the universe,
anything is insignificant.

159
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,620
I don't want to
make any pointless choices.

160
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:59,910
Humans are trapped in an inferno,
unable to get out.

161
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:06,620
And you
were the one who started the fire.

162
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,460
Thank you, Commander.

163
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,270
I started the fire,

164
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,090
but I can't keep it under control.

165
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,670
According to the archives,
the Red Coast Base was built in 1968,

166
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,030
and abandoned in 1987.

167
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,720
During the 20 years of its service,

168
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,870
no abnormal radio wave
from the space was detected.

169
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,480
So they didn't find any aliens.

170
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,240
For now, that's one way to put it.

171
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,510
For now?

172
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,480
Yeah.

173
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,510
Because the universe is vast,

174
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,910
and there are many kinds of interference
in it,

175
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,750
which makes the traveling speed
of the radio wave seem very slow.

176
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,750
And the longer the distance,
the weaker the signal.

177
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:25,080
But we can't say for sure no aliens
have received our radio waves.

178
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,120
There are so many archives here.

179
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,480
Are there any details
that don't tally with Ye Wenjie's words?

180
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,550
What Professor Ye told me was mainly
about the true purpose of Red Coast.

181
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,030
It accords with the archives
almost perfectly.

182
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,550
If at that time the whole world
was looking for aliens,

183
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:46,270
was it really necessary
to make it that confidential?

184
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,670
I asked Professor Ye the same question.

185
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,080
She gave me an explanation.

186
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,480
There's some information about it
in the archives as well.

187
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,670
Have you guys ever heard of
Bill Mathers's "contact as symbol" theory?

188
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,870
What?

189
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,080
What? What? What?

190
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,720
I'll put it in a simple way.

191
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,790
It means contact
with an alien civilization

192
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,120
is only a symbol or a switch.

193
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,200
Regardless of the content of the encounter,
the results would be the same.

194
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,200
The impact would be magnified by the lens
of human mass psychology

195
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,550
and culture until it resulted
in huge, substantive influences

196
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,910
on the progress of civilization.

197
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,910
If such contact
were monopolized by one country

198
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,790
or political force, the significance
would be comparable

199
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:31,620
to an overwhelming advantage
in economic and military power.

200
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,320
You can't understand?

201
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,550
It's not that.

202
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:40,750
Actually, what you said
was not difficult to understand.

203
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,910
It's just that your wording
and your way of speaking… I…

204
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,750
It means making contact
with an alien civilization

205
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,080
is like getting a book
about superb martial arts.

206
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,480
Whoever gets it and learns the skills
will become invincible.

207
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,240
Captain Shi,
that's what you mean, right?

208
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,270
That's exactly what I mean.
Clear and easy to understand.

209
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,390
- Professor Wang, you made it sound complicated.
- It's my bad.

210
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:03,240
It's like all martial artists
are fighting for a martial arts book,

211
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,400
throwing the martial arts world
into chaos.

212
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,240
If you're right,
once anybody gets in touch with aliens,

213
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,790
the world will be changed.

214
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:14,080
Chang also said those foreign terrorists
used to be pacifists.

215
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,400
There're also those scientists
who committed suicide.

216
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,790
They all changed without warning.

217
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:23,920
Was it because
they made contact with aliens?

218
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,680
Professor Ye also said
the search for alien civilization

219
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,550
is a very special subject.

220
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,850
It has a strong influence
on the researchers' outlook on life.

221
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,920
Professor Ye.

222
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,000
(Astrophysicist)

223
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,740
Professor Ye is indeed quite special.

224
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,530
Xu Bingbing,
did the ten of you find anything else?

225
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,160
Overall, the infosheets about Red Coast
correspond with Professor Wang's words,

226
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,200
but I don't know
if you've noticed these details.

227
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,500
Yang Weining and Ye Wenjie
registered their marriage in 1973.

228
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,160
(Personnel Who Died in Line of Duty)
And here.

229
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,940
(Lei Zhicheng, Yang Weining,
Oct 21, 1979)

230
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,270
(Mountaintop platform
Dropped to his death)

231
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,270
Lei Zhicheng

232
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:20,830
and Ye Wenjie's husband Yang Weining
both died in the Red Coast?

233
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,090
On the same day.

234
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,720
Professor Ye.

235
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,090
Professor Ye is way too special.

236
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,590
(Astrophysicist, Ye Wenjie)

237
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:47,110
I know your research and study
about alien civilization

238
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,750
are state secrets of your countries.

239
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:54,590
I'm very grateful to you for sharing them
to let us analyze them together.

240
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:59,070
Unfortunately, none of our searches have
been turned to any results.

241
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,830
The signals from space are just static.

242
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,510
It's just the natural noises
of the planets.

243
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,000
This is why we cannot accept it call.

244
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,830
That's what we can call the miracle
from another civilization.

245
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,400
The original conjectures
of the Global Battle Command Center

246
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,590
also include
the possibility it was aliens' doing,

247
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:20,240
but this is
what we're most unwilling to admit.

248
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:27,640
If they are indeed alien civilization
from outer space, how do we respond?

249
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,440
We're not prepared for that.

250
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,110
To this space civilization,

251
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:34,200
we're like 16th-century
aboriginal Americans,

252
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,480
watching the Spanish armada
come over the horizon.

253
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,610
There's nothing we can do.

254
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,350
I've still got so many Red Coast infosheets
to read.

255
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,400
Why did you bring me so many more?

256
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,880
Do you want me
to look into nanotech or not?

257
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,030
You need to do both, and do them well.

258
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,960
Xu Bingbing sifted out these infosheets.

259
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,940
Red Coast didn't find any aliens.
See if any other countries did.

260
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,200
After reading these infosheets, I found there
were indeed a couple of occasions

261
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,110
when the radio frequencies
were abnormal.

262
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,380
Abnormal how?

263
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,070
But it's absolutely impossible.

264
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,960
Look, take this one for example.

265
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,680
It's too far away from us.

266
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,880
If it was really aliens
trying to contact us,

267
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,270
a round trip
would take them billions of years.

268
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,960
There's no telling if the earth
would still be there by that time.

269
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,590
Is it possible
they can travel really fast?

270
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,160
Just like those in the movies.

271
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,590
Faster than light.

272
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,200
If they could travel at light speed,
why would they send radio signals?

273
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,920
Just like you. You got a cellphone.

274
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,900
Will you still use a carrier pigeon?

275
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,590
Well, could it be that
they were trying to reach a neighbor,

276
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,350
and we accidentally received the signal?

277
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,440
This signal was so strong.

278
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,720
It's like knocking on a neighbor's door
with an atomic bomb.

279
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,000
Are you saying
there are absolutely no aliens?

280
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,350
There are no aliens we can understand.

281
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:56,850
So you're saying
there are aliens we cannot understand?

282
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,240
What's wrong?

283
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,980
Why are you so impatient?

284
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,640
If they exist, where are they?

285
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,960
This is indeed a classic question
in astronomy.

286
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
Astronomy?

287
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,880
Has Professor Ye come back?

288
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,310
- How about you consult her again?
- What are you doing?

289
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,640
You want me to look into her
for you again?

290
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,440
No.

291
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,960
If you want it done, do it yourself.

292
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,920
Scientific mettle.

293
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,640
This is scientific mettle,
Professor Wang.

294
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,880
If you, a scientist,
have no scientific mettle,

295
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,000
how can you expect me, a cop,
to have any?

296
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,980
You have it.

297
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,440
Professor Ye has come back
only this morning.

298
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,270
I can't visit her in the afternoon.
It feels wrong.

299
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:43,550
This is how you display
your strong thirst for knowledge.

300
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,000
What am I supposed to ask her?

301
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,920
Surely I can't ask her
how Yang Weining died.

302
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,740
Just ask her
if aliens really exist or not.

303
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,160
If they made any discoveries
in the Red Coast Base,

304
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,680
it's unnecessary for her
to conceal them from me.

305
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,960
Only Professor Ye knows
if that's necessary.

306
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,000
If they made no discoveries whatsoever,

307
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,960
then how come these oddities
led us to the subject of alien civilization?

308
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,570
Why didn't they tell us the Black
and White Death Envoys were real?

309
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,880
Is it really that important?

310
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,480
It is.

311
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,090
It's very important.

312
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,940
Lately,
I've read many famous astronomy books.

313
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,830
I find that the Fermi paradox
is really pretty interesting.

314
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,550
It's such a big universe.
How can we be alone?

315
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:40,770
But if there are aliens,
where are they?

316
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,030
When the Fermi paradox
was first developed,

317
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,330
it wasn't taken seriously.

318
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:54,310
As our searches for alien civilization
turned out to be unfruitful,

319
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:58,510
the Fermi paradox
gained attention again,

320
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,440
and it sparked
more and more speculations.

321
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,000
For example, the Rare Earth Hypothesis.

322
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,030
It says aliens don't exist,
that the earth is special.

323
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,220
It's the only planet
with intelligent life.

324
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,960
Another hypothesis
focuses on science and technology.

325
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,240
It says aliens exist,

326
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,550
but alien civilization is far more developed
than human civilization,

327
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:31,720
or far less developed than it,
so they're unable to contact us.

328
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,180
There's another one.

329
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,440
It's about radio silence.

330
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,960
I saw that as well.

331
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,530
It says all aliens chose to keep silent.

332
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,330
For some reason.

333
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,510
There are many
similar hypotheses.

334
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:04,400
But none of them can verify
whether alien civilization exists.

335
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,330
Which one of those hypotheses
do you support?

336
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,160
I've been doing scientific research
for more than half of my life.

337
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:20,340
I advocate thought experiments,
but suspect everything.

338
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,140
Wang, aren't you the same?

339
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:44,270
Professor Ye
didn't answer your question at all.

340
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,510
She did.

341
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,510
She said she advocated thought experiments
but suspected everything.

342
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:51,000
What's the matter?
You find this answer unsatisfactory?

343
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,640
Suspecting everything is an attitude.

344
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,510
When you scientists do research,
you have to pick a direction first, right?

345
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,960
Take Newton for example.

346
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,350
He believed light was a group
of particles,

347
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:05,640
but Huygens believed light was a wave,
so they were both trying to

348
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,050
prove their opinions
in the directions they picked. Right?

349
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,480
You know
about the wave-particle duality?

350
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,380
How can I not know it?

351
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,290
What books have you read lately?

352
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,920
A Hundred Thousand Whys.

353
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,030
What?

354
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,790
A Hundred Thousand Whys.

355
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,290
Will you please articulate?

356
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,350
A Hundred Thousand Whys.

357
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,000
What's the matter?

358
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,200
The astronomy and geography volume.

359
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,400
Don't laugh.

360
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,650
Ye Wenjie clearly evaded your question.

361
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,550
Did she not want to answer it?
Or she couldn't answer it?

362
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,830
How am I supposed to know?

363
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:46,610
That's why we need
to keep investigating Ye Wenjie.

364
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,160
Hello?

365
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,290
Are you responsible
for looking into Wei Cheng?

366
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,310
Captain Shi,
this is indeed against the rules,

367
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:24,960
but General Chang made it very clear,
so we had to spare the room for him.

368
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,350
Why is he doing calculations here?

369
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,100
This guy's pretty weird.

370
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,200
He brought a pile of infosheets
and a computer here,

371
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,590
and said he wanted to report a crime,

372
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,960
but he spoke for quite a while
without making himself understood.

373
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,830
And then he started
doing calculations here.

374
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,960
We rushed him,
but he said he'd pay us.

375
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,590
He took this place for a hotel.

376
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:45,110
- Can we go inside and talk to him?
- You can't.

377
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,310
Just now he emphasized

378
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:50,290
that you two have to wait
for another four hours.

379
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,160
It's been five hours.

380
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,900
If he doesn't come out right now,
I'll go in and unplug his computer.

381
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,980
I'm asking you a question.

382
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,070
Do it.

383
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,180
Unplug it.

384
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,290
If I unplug it, then he won't
be able to figure it out, right?

385
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,980
You're such a quick-tempered guy.
Why do you care?

386
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,160
Captain Shi, you guys may go in now.

387
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,790
But that guy wants you to bring him
some booze.

388
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,510
Captain Shi,
who is he? Why is he so cocky?

389
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,590
Booze?

390
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,440
Good.

391
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,830
Him wanting booze is good news.

392
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,740
It means he made a breakthrough.

393
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,790
Tell me.

394
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,440
Staying at home is so comfortable.

395
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,380
Why did you come here?

396
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,810
Long story.

397
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,160
How about we do some celebrating first?

398
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,290
Don't. If you do that,
we won't be able to talk until tomorrow.

399
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,510
Come on. Tell us.

400
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:45,740
Tell us how many steps have you taken?

401
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,550
I've built a model.

402
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:57,010
Can the model
solve the Three-Body problem?

403
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:00,240
That needs verifying.

404
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,640
This is such a crucial juncture.

405
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,780
Did you specially come to the Public
Security Bureau to finish it?

406
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,110
Because someone threatened me.

407
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,810
This is the safest place.

408
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,550
Threatened you?

409
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,770
Who?

410
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:23,150
If I'm to tell you that,
I'll have to start from the beginning.

411
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:26,640
Today I feel a bit weary.

412
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,720
If you guys really want to hear it,

413
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,790
I might need to shift into a comfortable
position and take my time.

414
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,510
Go ahead.

415
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,070
Find yourself a comfortable position.

416
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,160
Tell us.

417
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,610
Sorry.

418
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,160
It all started when I was
in high school.

419
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,640
No, no, no. Skip the high school part.

420
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,070
High school is way off-topic.

421
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,350
No.

422
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,920
If I don't go off-topic,

423
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,230
I'm afraid you guys won't be able
to understand.

424
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,500
Well, go ahead.

425
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:21,460
It all started when I was
in high school.

426
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:28,440
(The number of arrays)

427
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,920
You have one hour.

428
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,380
Can you work it out?

429
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:52,100
(Minimum)

430
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,030
And the derivation process?

431
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,960
The derivation process…

432
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,180
I don't know.

433
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,790
You deduced too fast.

434
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:19,160
And you did it instinctively.

435
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,400
So even you yourself cannot perceive it.

436
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,270
Just like it's difficult
for people to explain how they deduce

437
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,980
two plus two is four.

438
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,440
What are numbers in your eyes?

439
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,590
Solid figures.

440
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,000
What about geometric shapes?

441
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,150
They're numbers.

442
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:41,220
You have a mathematical talent.

443
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,250
But…

444
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:50,250
But people like you
will never appreciate your talents.

445
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,160
My teacher was right.

446
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,500
I don't know how to appreciate myself.

447
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,848
(Legend of the Flying Fox)
I was shiftless when I was an undergraduate,

448
00:32:00,872 --> 00:32:01,550
(Legend of the Flying Fox)
graduate, and doctor.

449
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:04,400
Surprisingly, I managed
to muddle through.

450
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,400
Afterward I became a college teacher,
but still couldn't pull myself together.

451
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,400
I wrote the words "easy to prove"
on the blackboard,

452
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:16,340
but my students couldn't figure it out
no matter how hard they tried.

453
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,440
We waited for you
for almost five hours

454
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,400
not to hear you brag to us
or tell us you're a genius.

455
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,790
You're wrong.

456
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:26,460
I'm no genius.

457
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,790
I'm a good-for-nothing.

458
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:34,160
Except for maths,
I can't do anything properly.

459
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,110
My life's getting worse and worse.

460
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:39,070
Suddenly, one day,
I got tired of all that,

461
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:42,680
so I packed some stuff
and went to a temple.

462
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,060
You became a Buddhist monk?

463
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,720
Weren't you married?

464
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,160
You're wrong again.

465
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,480
I couldn't be bothered to become a monk.

466
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,160
I just wanted a quiet place
where I could blow off some steam.

467
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,270
An old friend of my father's
lived there.

468
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:59,830
He was very knowledgeable,
but when he got old, he became a monk.

469
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:05,220
According to my father,
people like him

470
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,290
had no other choice.

471
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,180
No. I'm sorry.

472
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,010
Stop pretending.

473
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,510
Is this necessary?

474
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,680
I'm trying to understand Buddhism.

475
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,550
Talking about Buddhism
with a guy like you?

476
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,030
That's pointless.

477
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:06,140
Come with me.

478
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,090
You may live here.

479
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,800
Actually, I don't care where I live.

480
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,670
I just want to find a quiet place

481
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:47,340
to fiddle around
for the rest of my life.

482
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,590
This place is not quiet.

483
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,760
There are many people coming and going.

484
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,000
The safest hideout is the crowd.

485
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,690
If you want quietness,
you have to empty yourself.

486
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,980
Flush.

487
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,760
How can I make myself emptier?

488
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,000
Fame and wealth
are less than nothing to me.

489
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,050
Come over here.

490
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,690
Come here.

491
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,190
Look.

492
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,150
What is this?

493
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,800
Isn't it just a radio?

494
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,480
- May I ask why it doesn't have an antenna?
- You geek.

495
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,230
It's Bluetooth-enabled.

496
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,530
Bluetooth?

497
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,920
Is this a radio?

498
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,820
This is an amplifier.

499
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,280
Is this a radio?

500
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,380
This is a transistor.

501
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,110
This is a capacitor.

502
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,530
Where's the radio?

503
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:32,960
Gone.

504
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,270
So radio is just a temporary pseudonym
we gave these components.

505
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:43,550
If you dismantle it in your mind,
it'll cease to exist.

506
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:47,800
Therefore,
radio is not a permanent entity.

507
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,590
These things can become a radio
or a pile of components.

508
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:56,530
This process is emptying.

509
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,480
What does "Form is emptiness" means?

510
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,920
If you're right,
then form is only a process.

511
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:11,500
Form means everything you can see.

512
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:15,320
Emptiness is not nothingness.

513
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:20,830
You need to fill yourself with emptiness.

514
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,630
I couldn't sleep that night,

515
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:54,000
so I kept pondering over
Professor Han's remark.

516
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,860
I never thought the never-never land
would be so uncomfortable.

517
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,550
My sheets were very damp
due to the mountain mist.

518
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:04,670
And the bed was very hard.

519
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:07,030
It made it difficult for me to sleep.

520
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:14,130
To get to sleep,
I tried doing as Professor Han said.

521
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:21,650
Filling myself with emptiness.

522
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:29,050
Can you guys understand?

523
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,130
Go on.

524
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:25,050
In my mind,
I created the first "emptiness".

525
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:28,800
It's a boundless space.

526
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,400
There's nothing in it, not even light.

527
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,820
Absolutely empty.

528
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:45,500
Soon I realized that the empty universe
couldn't calm me down.

529
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:50,800
Being in there
made me feel inexplicably anxious.

530
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,550
Like someone drowning in a river

531
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:55,280
who's trying to grab something
within reach.

532
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,570
So

533
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:03,000
I created a sphere for myself

534
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,090
in the infinite space.

535
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:15,170
That was a sphere with mass, not big.

536
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,980
But it didn't make me feel better.

537
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:25,840
The sphere was floating
in the center of the space.

538
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,840
Nothing in the universe
was exerting any forces on it,

539
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,820
and there was nothing for it to exert
forces on either.

540
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,480
It just floated in there.

541
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,730
It would never move,
or change in any way.

542
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,260
That's the most perfect interpretation
of death.

543
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:48,900
Therefore, I created another sphere,

544
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,730
which was of the same mass and size
as the first one's.

545
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:03,760
Their surfaces
were total reflection mirrors.

546
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,550
They reflected each other,

547
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:10,960
reflected the only entity
in the universe apart from themselves.

548
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,480
But the situation didn't improve much.

549
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,840
Because if there was
no initial movement,

550
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,840
the spheres would soon be drawn together
by their gravity.

551
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:24,320
And then the two spheres
would float there side by side, motionless.

552
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,730
It'd still be a symbol of death.

553
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:33,480
But if there was initial movement
and they didn't collide,

554
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,590
they would revolve around each other
under their gravity.

555
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,030
No matter how you initialized them,

556
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,230
that kind of revolving
would eventually stabilize

557
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:43,590
and never change again.

558
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:46,420
The dance of death.

559
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,780
So

560
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,760
I then introduced a third sphere,

561
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,230
and to my astonishment,
the situation changed completely.

562
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,030
Like I said, any geometric figure
turns into numbers

563
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,070
in the depths of my mind.

564
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,480
The sphereless, one-sphere,
and two-sphere universes

565
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,960
all showed up as a single equation
or a few equations that could describe it.

566
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,630
But this third sphere

567
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,840
gave "emptiness" life.

568
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:15,550
The three spheres,
given initial movements,

569
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:19,280
went through complex,
seemingly never-repeating movements.

570
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,730
The descriptive equations rained down
in a thunderstorm without end.

571
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:31,170
Just like that, I fell asleep.

572
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,590
The three spheres continued
to dance in my dream,

573
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:44,460
a patternless, never-repeating dance.

574
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:53,150
Yet, in the depths of my mind,
the dance did possess a rhythm;

575
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:56,320
it was just that its period
of repetition was infinitely long.

576
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,940
This mesmerized me.

577
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:06,400
My attention
had never been so completely engaged.

578
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,400
All the monks suspected I was crazy.

579
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,510
But Professor Han knew
I had found emptiness.

580
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:12,440
My mind…

581
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,260
My mind was calm as never before.

582
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,900
It's such a big project.

583
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,650
For the first time, I enjoyed math.

584
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:36,530
So… So I want to describe
the whole period or part of it.

585
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:44,170
So since then, you've been
pursuing the Three-Body problem.
