1
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,400
I told you to investigate the abnormal things
she did before her suicide. 

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,320
All you recorded are trivial stuff. 

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,000
These are her preparations
for the wedding, 

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,870
like the date of the wedding photos
and the time for the wedding day. 

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,510
It's no use. 

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,360
I also recorded that  she stopped
the experiment of Superstring Theory. 

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,830
I knew that, too. 

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,600
It must be stopped. 

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,920
She was preparing for the wedding,
and had no time for her experiment. 

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay. I gotta go. 

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,140
(Wang Miao) 

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,380
(Shen Yufei) 

13
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,790
Are you okay? 

14
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,760
Can't you sleep? 

15
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:56,000
You haven't slept well for two days. 

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,350
Never mind. I'm fine. 

17
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:16,000
What did the so-called farmer
say today? 

18
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,870
It wasn't settled. 

19
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,190
How about I consult my colleague 

20
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,960
in the psychiatry department
about your symptoms? 

21
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,280
Maybe we will know the reason. 

22
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,070
I went to a gathering at
the Frontiers of Science the other day. 

23
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:50,000
Many scholars were discussing
the farmer hypothesis. 

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,430
I told you that yesterday. 

25
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,560
This one and the shooter hypothesis. 

26
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,910
I didn't understand why 

27
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,070
(Frontiers of Science)
they were discussing these hypotheses. 

28
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,400
But I got it now. 

29
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,430
When scientists find the phenomenon 

30
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,590
that can't be explained
by modern science in their research, 

31
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,630
they may think of shooters and farmers. 

32
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,750
It's almost become their instinct. 

33
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:52,470
You can't understand it
until you really see it. 

34
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,120
I don't want to see it. 

35
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,510
There are so many troubles
in our lives. 

36
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,160
I don't want to know your hypotheses. 

37
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,310
Alright. 

38
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,740
Go to bed. 

39
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,870
Stop it. 

40
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,860
I'm gonna go to the lab. 

41
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,000
Why? It's late. 

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Never mind. Good night. 

43
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,630
(Yesterday morning,
Brookhaven National Laboratory) 

44
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,830
(in Suffolk County, Blue Island,
North America, exploded.) 

45
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:56,480
(16 researchers were killed and wounded
in the explosion,) 

46
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,510
(including Dr. Nicholas Brown,
a prominent physicist in high energy,) 

47
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,510
(Dr. John Kratah,
an expert in nuclear physics.) 

48
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,630
(The two of them died
of their injuries.) 

49
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,070
(Call from Shen Yufei)
(Their deaths were announced.) 

50
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,950
(This is the third
recent laboratory accident) 

51
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,310
- (happened in North America.)
- Hello? 

52
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,830
(In addition, we also heard that
William Ty Angel,) 

53
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,040
(a scientist in frontier science,
a month ago,) 

54
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,750
(claimed to have seen
an unscientific phenomenon.) 

55
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,040
(We don't know
whether his claim is related to) 

56
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,310

of accidental deaths of scientists.)

Mr. Wang. 

77
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,160
Mr. Wang. 

78
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,390
Why are you sleeping here? 

79
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,630
It's only 8:30. 

80
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,510
Why did you come to work so early? 

81
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,830
Since the reaction chamber
malfunctioned, 

82
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,270
I've been checking it every morning. 

83
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,800
That's how I did at your age. 

84
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,630
These things were all I thought about. 

85
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,560
Mr. Wang. 

86
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,310
You are my role model. 

87
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,160
What? 

88
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,630
You proposed to produce
the Flying Blade. 

89
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,710
No one thought you could make it. 

90
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,750
But only after a dozen years, 

91
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,600
you have made this ultrastrong nanomaterial,
Flying Blade, in reality. 

92
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,430
Even in the field of applied physics, 

93
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,750
there are very few
doer researchers like you. 

94
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,120
I was naive. 

95
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,750
I thought molecules can be stacked
one by one 

96
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:36,910
by using the molecular structure,
like laying out bricks for a wall. 

97
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,120
But I never thought that this method,
with massive resource consumption, 

98
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,440
made the Flying Blade become precious. 

99
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,360
We can't put it into mass production. 

100
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:54,030
It's no different from not producing it. 

101
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:58,600
How does the chamber operate? 

102
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,750
It has been operating for more than a year. 

103
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,450
There are some malfunctions
in operating, 

104
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,320
such as reduced sensor sensitivity
and increased error. 

105
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,150
It should be shut down for maintenance. 

106
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,550
But you told us it can't be turned off. 

107
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,270
It's pivotal to complete the third batch
of synthetic combinations. 

108
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,030
So all engineers are working to 

109
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,270
equip more and more
supplementary correction device on it. 

110
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,790
These added devices 

111
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,030
also need to be overhauled now. 

112
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,270
Yes. 

113
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,840
So most engineers want to 

114
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,150
suspend the operation
of the reaction chamber. 

115
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,000
This listed all the errors
and their codes. 

116
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,120
(Registration Form
for Reaction Chamber Use) 

117
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,960
It's overloaded. 

118
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,360
Again, try to stop it. 

119
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,510
How long would it take to
completely overhaul the sensors? 

120
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,480
Four to five days. 

121
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,550
If we work fast,
it will take only three days. 

122
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,360
I promise. 

123
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,750
Stop your research. 

124
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,390
What did you see? 

125
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,560
You look okay. 

126
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,950
At our last classmate reunion party... 

127
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,240
Right in front of my eyes. 

128
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,070
The countdown keeps going
second by second. 

129
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,720
Stop your research. 

130
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,240
Tell me what you know. 

131
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,080
Stop your research. 

132
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,080
Just try it. 

133
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,070
Stop our research. 

134
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,470
Shut down its operation for maintenance. 

135
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,390
Follow the schedule you promised. 

136
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,510
Yes, Mr. Wang. 

137
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,740
Our team will give you
an updated schedule right away. 

138
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,600
- We can stop the operation this afternoon.
- Stop it right now. 

139
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:45,790
I'm going to tell everyone.

(Stopped running) 

142
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,480
Previous to this,
maybe you've never thought 

143
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,360
that you might be a turkey scientist. 

144
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:54,960
The turkeys on the farm
are meant to die on Thanksgiving Day.

(Shen Yufei) 

147
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,150
Why? 

148
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,960
What will happen
at the end of the countdown? 

149
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,000
Shen Yufei, are you listening? 

150
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,200
Yes. 

151
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:06,750
It's just nanomaterial,
not the particle accelerator. 

152
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,000
My research is
in the applied physics field. 

153
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,790
Is it worth your attention? 

154
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:16,320
Whether it is worth the attention
is not for us to decide. 

155
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,960
That's enough. 

156
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,960
Do you think
these little tricks can fool me? 

157
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,200
Do you think
I'm going to stop my research? 

158
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,990
I admit that I can't explain
how you're doing it now. 

159
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,440
But that's only because I haven't 

160
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,430
snooped behind the curtain
of your shameful illusionist. 

161
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:41,510
You're saying you want to see the countdown
on a greater scale? 

162
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,150
So what if you show it
at a bigger scale? 

163
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:47,440
You can still play tricks. 

164
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,870
Modern technology allows 

165
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,600
people to project a hologram
into the sky. 

166
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,960
With a laser powerful enough, 

167
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,020
we can project an image
onto the surface of the moon. 

168
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,080
As you told me before, 

169
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,850
if it were shooters and farmers
who did it, 

170
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,790
tell them to play tricks
at a scale that humans cannot. 

171
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,360
The question is whether you can take it. 

172
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,310
I want to help you
avoid Yang Dong's fate. 

173
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,200
Don't scare me with Yang Dong. 

174
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,840
Will you accept my challenge? 

175
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,720
Sure. 

176
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,200
What are you going to do? 

177
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,150
I'll send you a website address. 

178
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:45,620
(A new message from Shen Yufei) 

179
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,940
(From Shen Yufei) 

180
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,150
Morse Code. 

181
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,030
What do you mean? 

182
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,000
Professor Wang. 

183
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,870
Are you planning to restart
your nanomaterial project? 

184
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,190
Of course. 

185
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,390
When? 

186
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,080
Three days from now. 

187
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,600
Then the countdown will continue. 

188
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,240
Where? 

189
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,120
Somewhere you can
observe the cosmic microwave background. 

190
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:22,390
Three days from now, that's the 14th,
the entire universe will flicker for you 

191
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,390
from one to five in the morning. 

192
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,790
Hello? 

193
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,350
What's wrong with you? 

194
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,030
Are you in a bad mood? 

195
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,790
If you disturb my work and life
like this again, 

196
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,510
I will call the police. 

197
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,000
You know what? 

198
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,070
I'm a policeman. 

199
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,340
Does this research center belong to you? 

200
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,790
It belongs to our country. 

201
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,820
It's the National Center
for Nanoscience and Technology. 

202
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,430
Get off work after six.
It's too early, huh? 

203
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,160
They lack research spirit. 

204
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,110
There's a notice posted outside. 

205
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,510
The reaction chamber has stopped
for maintenance. 

206
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,920
What can I do for you? 

207
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,400
Yeah. 

208
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:09,680
Tell me about your countdown thing. 

209
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,680
What are you talking about? 

210
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,980
(Zhou Nan, chief ophthalmologist
of Beijing Tongren Hospital,) 

211
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,310
(affiliated to
Capital Medical University) 

212
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,550
The countdown in front of you. 

213
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,750
My symptom is diagnosed
as muscae volitantes. 

214
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,000
I feel something in my eyes. 

215
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,960
Doesn't it count down? 

216
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,510
Second by second. 

217
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,150
That's flash. 

218
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,810
One of the symptoms
of muscae volitantes. 

219
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:48,110
Why are you suddenly being so patient
with my questions today? 

220
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,310
Shi Qiang, I'm not the criminal
interrogated by you. 

221
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,550
Take it easy. 

222
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,880
I treat criminals even more rudely. 

223
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,720
I want to work with you. 

224
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,440
There's nothing
we can work on together. 

225
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,920
The countdown in front of you 

226
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,720
has something to do
with Shen Yufei, right? 

227
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,270
I'll give you a clue. 

228
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:21,440
Yang Dong also stopped her experiment
before suicide. 

229
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:24,640
What a coincidence. 

230
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,930
There are more coincidences. 

231
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,720
The scientists who committed suicide
all contacted Shen Yufei. 

232
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,200
Now, she is contacting you. 

233
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,750
You can work with me. 

234
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,070
Take my protection. 

235
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,400
That's your only choice. 

236
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,270
If you really suspect Shen Yufei,
you can arrest her. 

237
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,350
You said everyone she contacted
killed themselves. 

238
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,740
Did she kill them? 

239
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,400
You can't prove it. There's no proof. 

240
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,960
Protect me, huh? 

241
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,200
If Shen Yufei wants me to die now,
you can't stop her at all. 

242
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,750
What did she say about that? 

243
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,550
How did she threaten you? 

244
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,100
She said I'm a turkey. 

245
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,790
Turkey? 

246
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,680
You are a turkey too. 

247
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,390
Professor Wang. 

248
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:50,400
Are you planning to
restart your nanomaterial project? 

249
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,160
Of course. 

250
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,830
When? 

251
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,200
Three days from now. 

252
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:05,070
Then the countdown will continue. 

253
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,790
Where? 

254
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,400
Somewhere you can
observe the cosmic microwave background. 

255
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,500
Three days from now, that's the 14th, 

256
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:29,480
the entire universe will flicker for you
from one to five in the morning. 

257
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,480
What's wrong with you? You look pale. 

258
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,750
Don't get me started.
My child had eczema. 

259
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,340
He cried all night. 

260
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,100
I tried to calm him down
and couldn't sleep at all. 

261
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,550
My sister told me
there is an effective eczema medicine 

262
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,550
in the hospital where she works. 

263
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,590
Really? What's the name of it? 

264
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:50,070
Ms. Ye. 

265
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,590
Wang. 

266
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,350
Granny, did you buy sugar for us? 

267
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:04,110
Of course. Here you are. 

268
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,030
Thank you, Granny. 

269
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,680
They like to play at my home. 

270
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,190
It's Sunday. 

271
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:19,110
But their parents have to work overtime,
so they left them to me. 

272
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,770
Have you finished your picture? 

273
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:31,920
Nannan. 

274
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,830
Shall we give it a title? 

275
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:36,630
Let's call it Duckling in the Sun. 

276
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,000
Sounds good. 

277
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,920
Let me write it for you. 

278
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,030
Thank you, Granny. 

279
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:47,870
Duckling in the Sun. 

280
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:54,960
June 12th, by Nannan. 

281
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,240
What do you want to eat for lunch? 

282
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,440
Eggplant. 

283
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,830
Eggplant? Braised eggplant, right? 

284
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,000
Yes. 

285
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,440
How about you? 

286
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,430
Meat. 

287
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:07,630
Your mom told me that
you shouldn't eat so much meat. 

288
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,960
It's hard to digest. 

289
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,880
How about some fishie instead? 

290
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,820
See? 

291
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,310
I brought a fishie. 

292
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:14,960
Okay. 

293
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,240
That's great. 

294
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,790
Well, it's time for cartoons. 

295
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,030
Cartoon time! 

296
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:24,350
Cartoon time! 

297
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:32,060
(Zhu Wujie, I'll give you
another chance to redeem.) 

298
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,580
(Yes, sir.) 

299
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:50,550
Wang. 

300
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,720
Let it go. 

301
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:01,350
Even if Dong were alive,
she wouldn't have had children. 

302
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:06,680
Marriage and children
are not her pursuit. 

303
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,310
But weren't they already
planning to get married? 

304
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:20,400
Maybe she changed her mind
and wanted to be a real woman. 

305
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:27,510
But she didn't get out of her own world. 

306
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:31,920
Ms. Ye, I'm sorry to reopen your sores. 

307
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,830
Never mind. 

308
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:39,200
If you are not here,
I'll still think about her. 

309
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,310
Have a seat. 

310
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:44,550
I'm going to soak the vegetables
for a while. 

311
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,510
These days, they use
so many pesticides. 

312
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,790
When I cook it for children, 

313
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:52,430
I have to soak it
for at least two hours. 

314
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,000
Give me back the remote. 

315
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,920
- No.
- Be careful. 

316
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,200
- No.
- Give me back. The remote. 

317
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,720
Slow down. 

318
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,830
That's Dong's room. 

319
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:26,240
When Dong was a child,
she lived with me in Northeast China. 

320
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,790
She really liked the forest
and nature. 

321
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:35,350
When we returned to Beijing,
she also decorated our home 

322
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:39,350
with some elements of the forest
and nature. 

323
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:45,030
Her bed is lined with ura sedge
from Northeast China. 

324
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:49,590
I don't know if she slept well on it. 

325
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,750
What is the background of this photo? 

326
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,440
That's the antenna. 

327
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,730
A product of that time.

(Yang Dong's Birch-bark Notebook) 

336
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,100
It's okay. 

337
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,830
Those are pictures Dong drew
when she was a child. 

338
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
Is it made of birch-bark? 

339
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:55,070
The brich-bark
faded from silver-white 

340
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:59,790
to dark-yellow because of time. 

341
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:06,030
You even dated the pictures for her. 

342
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,790
It was drawn in 1982. 

343
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,440
Right. 

344
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,070
1982. 

345
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,750
She was three. 

346
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:20,440
Usually, children of that age
draw abstract lines and shapes 

347
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,830
to express their feelings. 

348
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:32,680
I didn't teach Dong
from simple to complex. 

349
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:39,200
I exposed her too early to
some very abstract, very extreme topics. 

350
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,030
That's normal in families
of researchers. 

351
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:48,480
But she expressed an interest
in abstract thinking at an early age. 

352
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,310
I wanted to stop her. 

353
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:57,400
I told her
that field wasn't easy for researchers. 

354
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,550
Guess what she said? 

355
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,310
What about Madame Curie? 

356
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:12,110
I told her, Madame Curie was never really
deep into that field. 

357
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:16,750
Her success
ascribed to her persistence and hard work, 

358
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:22,920
but without her,
someone else would have done her work. 

359
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,790
Later, I discovered that 

360
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:30,310
she really was different
from other kids. 

361
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,440
For example,
when it comes to a new formula, 

362
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:39,270
other children might say,
"What a wonderful formula!" 

363
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,640
But she would say... 

364
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,200
What a beautiful formula! 

365
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,550
It was like she was looking
at a pretty flower. 

366
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:52,880
Then I realized that
she may see figures and formulas 

367
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,880
in a different way than others do. 

368
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,880
Are these records also Yang Dong's? 

369
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,920
Those were her father's. 

370
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,000
She listened to all of them
and finally picked a record by Bach 

371
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,270
and repeatedly listened to it. 

372
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,030
This... 

373
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:19,550
I was confused. 

374
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:29,510
The music played by Bach
may not attract children, especially girls. 

375
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:33,150
At first, I thought she was attracted
by this kind of music on a whim, 

376
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,230
but when I asked her
how she felt about the music... 

377
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,480
Do you like listening to this music? 

378
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:44,310
I can see in the music a giant
is building a large, complex house. 

379
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,590
Bit by bit, he is building it slowly. 

380
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:51,790
When the music is over,
the house is done. 

381
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:04,480
You educated Yang Dong very well. 

382
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,510
No. 

383
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,270
I'm a terrible mother. 

384
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,510
Her world was too simple. 

385
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:21,030
All she had were ethereal theories. 

386
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,640
Once they collapsed, 

387
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,240
she had nothing
to lean on to keep on living. 

388
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,640
Physics doesn't exist. 

389
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,920
Ms. Ye, I can't agree with you. 

390
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,880
Recently, events are happening
that are beyond our imagination. 

391
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,510
It's an unprecedented challenge
to theories in the field. 

392
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,310
She's not the only scientist
to wade in this field. 

393
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,960
But she was the only woman. 

394
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:06,480
Women should be like water,
flowing through everything. 

395
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,510
Nanny, I'm hungry. 

396
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,750
Nanny, I'm hungry. 

397
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:22,270
Ms. Ye, sorry for bothering you. 

398
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,830
Let's have lunch together. 

399
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,440
No, thanks. 

400
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,920
Well, let me walk you out. 

401
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,110
Ms. Ye. 

402
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,720
I would like to ask you one more thing. 

403
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,060
Do you know where I can observe
the cosmic microwave background? 

404
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,590
There are two places
in China that work on it. 

405
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:46,830
One is the Urumqi Observatory. 

406
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,790
I remember it was a project 

407
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,690
by the Chinese Academy of Sciences'
Space Environment Observation Center. 

408
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,000
The other one is nearby. 

409
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,350
This radio astronomy observatory
located in the suburbs of Beijing, 

410
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,880
which is run
by the Chinese Academy of Sciences 

411
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,190
and Peking University's Joint Center
for Astrophysics. 

412
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:04,060
It's for receiving data from satellites. 

413
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,070
I have a former student working there. 

414
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,470
When do you want to go there? 

415
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,270
Early morning on the 14th. 

416
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:15,510
I'll make a call for you. 

417
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,200
Hello. 

418
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,070
I'm Ye Wenjie. 

419
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,670
Well, my friend wants to 

420
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:36,680
go to your observatory tomorrow.
Will you be there? 

421
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,030
That's great. 

422
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:41,110
Alright. Alright. 

423
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,850
My student's name is Sha Ruishan. 

424
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:47,750
(Bulaotun Village, Miyun Reservoir North Shore)
He will be on the night shift tomorrow. 

425
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,990
It's the address. 

426
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:50,910
Wang. 

427
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:55,790
It's not your field of research, right? 

428
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,160
I have some things to figure out. 

429
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,550
You look pale. 

430
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,270
Recently, I haven't slept very well. 

431
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,350
I'll be fine after some rest. 

432
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:13,240
Wait a minute. 

433
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,370
A few days ago, an old friend from the base
brought a gift for me. 

434
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,550
(Red Ginseng)
Here you are. 

435
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,880
No, Ms. Ye. 

436
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,920
It's cultivated, not very precious. 

437
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,350
I have high blood pressure
and can't eat it. 

438
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,640
Take it. 

439
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,270
You can slice it
and make it into ginseng tea. 

440
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:41,310
You're still young,
but you have to take care of yourself. 

441
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,480
Take it. 

442
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,020
Thank you, Ms. Ye. 

443
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:48,270
I'll take it. 

444
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,270
Professor Wang. 

445
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,480
Professor Wang, where are you going? 

446
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,510
Stop stalking me. 

447
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,920
No. 

448
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,960
No taxis are available now. 

449
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,840
The drivers are changing their shifts. 

450
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,920
Do you need a ride? 

451
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,190
See? 

452
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,840
It didn't stop. 

453
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,070
I want to ask you something. 

454
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:30,060
Did you go to visit Yang Dong's mother? 

455
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:33,150
It's not a duty for her normal friend. 

456
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,550
Let alone you are not friends. 

457
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:41,070
I know you educated people
often infatuate with reachless muse. 

458
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,140
Is Yang Dong like this in your heart? 

459
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,760
Goddess, right? 

460
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,230
Can you respect her? 

461
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,960
Speak no ill of the dead. 

462
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,480
I have nothing to do with Yang Dong. 

463
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,960
You're shameless. 

464
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,030
How can you offense her
to achieve your goal? 

465
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:59,070
Come on. 

466
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,960
What did you guys talk about? Tell me. 

467
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,550
Why should I tell you? 

468
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,590
Ms. Ye is over-calmed. 

469
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:10,030
Calmness is a necessary quality
for a scientist. 

470
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,840
As a mother, she is over-calmed. 

471
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,280
Cut the crap. 

472
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,480
The daughter she brought up
committed suicide. 

473
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,710
Shouldn't she be overwhelmed? 

474
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,190
But at her daughter's funeral, 

475
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:26,230
she was too calm,
as if nothing special had happened. 

476
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,880
Think about your daughter. 

477
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,040
I don't think something was wrong. 

478
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,920
If you are good at
observation and judgment, 

479
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,070
polices will lose their jobs. 

480
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:37,510
If you're really so talented,
why do you need me? 

481
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:41,710
My greatest talent is find you. 

482
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:45,230
No taxi. You can't get it. 

483
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,030
What are you doing? 

484
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:56,760
Let's go. Dinner's on me. 

485
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,280
That's great. 

486
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,710
(Integrated information service
and rescue system) 

487
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:09,480
(for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games) 

488
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,150
What else did Ye Wenjie say to you? 

489
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,670
No more. 

490
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,360
Did she give it to you? 

491
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,230
Her old friend in the base
brought it to her. 

492
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:23,840
So, your conversation
can be concluded that 

493
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:29,230
Yang Dong was a special woman, right? 

494
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,760
Yes. 

495
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,840
That's a very emotional conclusion. 

496
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,760
No reference value. 

497
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,070
I'm not your scout. 

498
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,470
I thought you invited me to dinner 

499
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,400
to show your sincerity
for working with me. 

500
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,990
I'm sorry you're making a mistake. 

501
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:50,150
I want to get rid of you. 

502
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,510
I have answered your questions
in detail. 

503
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,540
So if you're going to stalk me again,
I'll have to call the police. 

504
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,320
Come on. 

505
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,280
I'm a policeman. 

506
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,100
Besides, you have said it many times. 

507
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,920
You didn't have to pay for my dinner. 

508
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,510
So,
you must have something else to tell me, 

509
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,550
or you may have something to ask me. 

510
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,020
Am I right? 

511
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,710
Go ahead. 

512
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,880
You said that everyone 

513
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,190
who connected Shen Yufei
committed suicide. 

514
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:19,320
Is Yang Dong among them? 

515
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,360
Yes. 

516
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,540
General. 

517
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,480
The European Combat Zone informed us 

518
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,260
to attend a video meeting
of global combat zones 

519
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,840
15 minutes from now. 

520
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,630
Is it a team? 

521
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,580
Yes. 

522
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,550
This is an astronomical observation
team from Helsinki. 

523
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,480
Nine in total. 

524
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,230
Nine. 

525
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,430
Oh my god. 

526
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,760
Set the video conference. 

527
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,110
(The European Combat Zone is connected) 

528
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:59,840
The African Combat Zone is connected. 

529
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,990
This is the North American Section. 

530
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,840
We just received the report that
yesterday, 

531
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,070
nine more scientists committed suicide. 

532
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,230
It was a physics research team
from Helsinki 

533
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,590
conducting accelerator experiments. 

534
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:15,320
We tried to intervene,
but we were too late. 

535
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:19,590
Nine more scientists in one day. 

536
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,280
There are so many scientists
who have contacted Shen Yufei. 

537
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,630
Why are you only
investigating Yang Dong? 

538
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,590
I have investigated all of them. 

539
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:31,510
Would you be interested in the results? 

540
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,110
No. 

541
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,550
I'm not interested in anyone. 

542
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,950
I told you. 

543
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:40,430
I've only met Yang Dong once
and know little about her research. 

544
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:43,670
Among the dead scientists,
she was the closest to me, 

545
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,430
so I had a reaction. 

546
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:49,760
How could my reaction have anything
to do with your investigation? 

547
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,880
Why are you so excited? 

548
00:38:53,480 --> 00:39:00,400
Don't you want to know how Shen Yufei
contacted Yang Dong? 

549
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,020
I think you want to know about it. 

550
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,760
Scientists committed suicide before... 

551
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,280
(According to the preliminary proof,
the victim was Yang Dong.) 

552
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,480
(Professor David
of Gadayork University) 

553
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,920
(committed suicide a month ago.) 

554
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,000
They all contacted Shen Yufei. 

555
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,920
I've investigated 

556
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,070
Yang Dong's relationships
and social circle. 

557
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:30,150
But I haven't found any connection
between her and Shen Yufei. 

558
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,880
Until eight months ago, 

559
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,630
Yang Dong picked up a call
from Shen Yufei's company. 

560
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:41,440
So I went to the cafe
where Yang Dong often went to investigate 

561
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:46,920
and got its hard disk
of video monitoring. 

562
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:20,550
I finally found
the video of their meeting. 

563
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,320
What did they talk about? 

564
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,280
It's a silent video. 

565
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,110
I saw Shen Yufei
giving a folder to Yang Dong. 

566
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:38,230
But we didn't find it in her things. 

567
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:44,440
It's not weird. 

568
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,350
They are scientists
and have common topics. 

569
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:51,790
It's normal for them
to talk about something. 

570
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:58,230
But five days after they met,
Yang Dong committed suicide. 

571
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,150
What? 

572
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,630
Are you scared now? 

573
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:36,440
I'm not. 

574
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,880
Fear springs from ignorance. 

575
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,280
Braveness springs from ignorance, too. 

576
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,030
Scientists who committed suicide
all contacted Shen Yufei. 

577
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:53,840
Now, she is contacting you. 

578
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,070
What will happen
at the end of the countdown? 

579
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:59,830
As you told me before,
if it were shooters and farmers who did it, 

580
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:02,920
tell them to play tricks
at a scale that humans cannot. 

581
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,360
Three days from now. 

582
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:11,180
that's the fourteenth,
the entire universe will flicker for you 

583
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,000
from one to five in the morning. 

584
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,710
Dr. Shen, 

585
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:18,760
has it ever occurred to you
that such a statement can kill? 

586
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:26,320
The turkeys on the farm
are meant to die on Thanksgiving Day. 

587
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:56,510
Daddy. 

588
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,620
Doudou, why are you at home? 

589
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,480
Classes were over. 

590
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,190
I totally forgot that. 

591
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:07,550
I just broke a glass by accident. 

592
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,360
I'm not scaring you, am I? 

593
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,190
Daddy. 

594
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:12,590
Our school will hold a lecture
on Friday. 

595
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:18,480
My teacher knew you are a physicist
and wanted you to be here. 

596
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,800
Friday. 

597
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,550
I'll try to make it. 

598
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:33,730
You can go back to your room
and do your homework. 

599
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:17,480
What do you think about 

600
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,880
the farmer hypothesis
and shooter hypothesis? 

601
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,070
That's the Frontiers of Science. 

602
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,230
I thought
human science has no boundaries. 

603
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:33,440
Think about ancient Chinese mythology
and ancient Greek mythology. 

604
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,070
They were all farmers that people imagined. 

605
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:43,480
Maybe they were scared of them,
but now those can be explained with science. 

606
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:49,800
To put it bluntly,
fear springs from ignorance. 

607
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:53,220
Did Yang Dong have fear? 

608
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,480
She had nothing to fear. 

609
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:59,360
Her world was only about physics. 

610
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:05,000
Physics doesn't exist. 

611
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,920
That was terrible news for her.
