1
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,350
Such irregularity in the sun's movement
in the game

2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,480
is beyond our comprehension,
just like the universe flicker.

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,760
It's incomprehensible.

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,670
I'm beginning to understand this game.

5
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,230
Maybe we'll know the reason
for the universe flicker

6
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,280
when we find the pattern
of the sun's movement.

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,790
Shen Yufei's right.

8
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,030
The answer is in the game.

9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,670
Alright.

10
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,280
Drive safe.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,960
Night.

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,640
What's the matter?

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,470
That Sha Ruishan guy made so many
discoveries in a single gaming session.

14
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,670
Is it because he specializes
in astrophysics?

15
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,320
Of course.

16
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,430
Well, if that's the case, I think
you have a very capable helper.

17
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,790
Who?

18
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,680
Ye Wenjie.

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,920
She's an astrophysicist, and she has more
leisure than Sha Ruishan does.

20
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,680
Maybe she even likes chatting.

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,560
Just think about it.

22
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,640
Why did you advise Wang Miao
to meet Ye Wenjie?

23
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:52,310
I couldn't shake the feeling that she took
Yang Dong's death too calmly.

24
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,000
Did you find anything
about the reporter?

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,840
Hello?

26
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,240
Ms. Ye,
sorry to disturb you at this hour.

27
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,840
May I ask when you're free?

28
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,590
I need to ask you a few questions.

29
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,150
Okay.

30
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,400
I'll wait there for you.

31
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,400

Hello?

51
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,070
Hi.

52
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,680
Do you have any news clues to offer?

53
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,430
I want to speak to Mu Xing.

54
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,160
Is it because
you have some news clues for her?

55
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,070
Put this away.

56
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:13,160
Mu Xing,
why don't you just hire an operator?

57
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,310
What are you reporting this time?

58
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,160
Isn't it obvious?

59
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,040
Excessive emissions.

60
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,830
How did you get all those news clues?

61
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,120
There are always people providing clues.

62
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,360
The more people like me there are,
the harder it is to obscure the truth.

63
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,480
(M·X STUDIO Displays a real world)

64
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,480
People like you?

65
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,360
What are you guys trying to do?

66
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,190
To let more people see the truth.

67
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,560
There's nothing wrong in that,

68
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,720
but the focus of your reports
is a bit problematic.

69
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,920
A pharmaceutical company
has emission problems,

70
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,270
but you didn't condemn the regulator,
or urge the people involved to fix it.

71
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,750
Instead, you kept warning people

72
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,920
about the development
of science and technology,

73
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,920
turning them into enemies of science.
Why did you do that?

74
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,680
What people should guard against is the hazard
brought by science and technology,

75
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,750
not science and technology themselves.

76
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,480
Besides, I just showed people the truth.

77
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,630
- I didn't interfere in their choices.
- That's not true.

78
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,360
I think you obviously interfered.

79
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,070
Who are you guys exactly?

80
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:39,390
You don't have to ask that
when you replace "you guys" with "we".

81
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,680
Then who are we?

82
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,630
We?

83
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:49,630
We are people who live on this planet,

84
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,560
enjoying the conveniences
science brings us

85
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,190
and enduring the hazards it causes.

86
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:01,830
I want to become
the one revealing the truth,

87
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,480
while you are the one
trying to obscure the truth.

88
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,950
If I wanted to obscure the truth,
I would've arrested you already.

89
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,390
You did arrest me once,

90
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:18,920
but pity you didn't give me
any useful clues the other day.

91
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:24,750
If someday you find some useful clue,
feel free to come and arrest me.

92
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,510
I read your reports.
You weren't always like this.

93
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,510
You used to be very objective
when stating the facts,

94
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:34,000
but now, your reports are obviously
misleading in a sinister way.

95
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,040
Just think about it.
Why did it come to this?

96
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:43,160
Sooner or later I'll find out
who you guys really are.

97
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:49,160
Alright then,
let's investigate together.

98
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,600
(There was an explosion
in a lab earlier this morning.)

99
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,830
(Several of the country's
top scientists were conducting an experiment.)

100
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,270
We're in charge of this thing now.

101
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,190
We'll tell the public that the scientists
died in an unfortunate accident

102
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,310
during the experiment.

103
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,950
What occurred is much worse.

104
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,270
(The cause of the explosion
is still under investigation.)

105
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,950
(Stay tuned for more details.)

106
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,830
The enemy has already
begun his massacre.

107
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,600
They're playing bridge
in one of their monthly get-togethers.

108
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,920
There's even a Nobel Prize winner.

109
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,310
They're getting more bold.

110
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,800
We can't just sit around.

111
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,600
We need to react.

112
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,580
(Incoming Call from Shen Yufei)

113
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,100
So the protection of the vulnerable
is still ineffective?

114
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:43,540
General Chang,
you can't predict the enemy.

115
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,820
Hello?

116
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,860
You went too far.

117
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,380
Four scientists,
and one of them even won a Nobel Prize.

118
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,980
Every one of them had the potential

119
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,500
to make a breakthrough
in Three-Body research.

120
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,540
Did I ever get in your business?

121
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,100
So you guys had better stay out of mine.

122
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,980
I think both of us
should do Lord's bidding.

123
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,140
Us?

124
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:22,980
On the surface, we are on the same side,
but in fact, we are mortal enemies.

125
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,060
Yes.

126
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,420
You people have been using Lord's powers
against mankind.

127
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,420
That's one way to put it.

128
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,660
We need Lord to come to our world

129
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,380
and mete out the long overdue punishment
to the sinners,

130
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,540
but you are being a hindrance,

131
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:40,020
so we are irreconcilable enemies.

132
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,420
Lord should not be used by you people.

133
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,260
You are not serving Lord either.

134
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:50,380
If you don't stop, we'll make you stop.

135
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,620
You think the Commander will allow that?

136
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,740
The Commander?

137
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,300
Wasn't it the Commander
who caused all this?

138
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,700
This is your car, right?
Sorry. I hit it.

139
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,420
I'm really sorry.

140
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,700
Your words enlightened me.

141
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,220
All I saw on the paper
was your theory.

142
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:44,460
It surprises me that you've put it
into practice to such an extent.

143
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,700
But there are still
many unsolved problems.

144
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,180
The matter of manufacture
will be settled sooner or later.

145
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:58,660
Like I said, your research on
applied physics is very realistic.

146
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,140
But my knowledge base is still too small.

147
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,740
Otherwise I wouldn't have disturbed you

148
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,220
and asked you so many questions
about the movement of fixed stars.

149
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,620
Thank you for coming here, Ms. Ye.

150
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,940
The theories I told you about
are available in books.

151
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,620
Your lab is a real eye-opener for me.

152
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:23,180
Let's just say
we're learning from each other.

153
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,140
I got another question for you.

154
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,660
Do you know flying stars?

155
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,260
Flying stars?

156
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,540
Are you referring to meteors,

157
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,540
or fixed stars
with unstable spin and orbital periods?

158
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,580
Fixed stars.

159
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,140
Spin…

160
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,060
Unstable spin and orbital periods?

161
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,220
Fixed stars
with unstable spin and orbital periods?

162
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,300
Oh, this way, please.

163
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,900
I suddenly thought of a friend.

164
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,580
Every time he hears
the words flying stars,

165
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,660
he'll say that they're stars
aimlessly whooshing around.

166
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,940
That's one way to put it.

167
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,700
I remember that ten-odd years ago,
there were some foreign books and papers

168
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:25,420
concerning that, so we read some of them

169
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:30,060
and did some research,
but it was unfruitful.

170
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:36,260
If you'd like to know more about it,
I can recommend two books to you.

171
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,780
Okay.

172
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,220
This is my office.

173
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,500
Ms. Ye, have a seat.

174
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,300
Sorry to trouble you.

175
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,860
Please write the names
of the books here.

176
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,260
Ms. Ye,

177
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,500
(Red Ginseng)
this is the red ginseng you gave me.

178
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,580
I make tea with it quite often.

179
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,860
It's pretty good.

180
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,580
Thank you.

181
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:54,180
You look much better now,
but this red ginseng is not good enough.

182
00:13:54,180 --> 00:14:01,340
There used to be first-class wild mountain
ginseng near our workplace.

183
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,860
You may take the outlooks
of these books for reference.

184
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,980
Stellar Structure and Evolution.

185
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,260
Stellar Movements
and the Structure of the Universe.

186
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,700
Okay.

187
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,620
These two books
might not be easy to find.

188
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,340
They're too old.

189
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,540
The names I wrote are the original ones.

190
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,700
I think there are new editions now.

191
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,300
These kinds of materials
are easy to find nowadays.

192
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,700
This is a much better era.

193
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,820
When I was your age,
we needed to apply beforehand

194
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,940
to look up things in books.

195
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,420
It was quite an effort.

196
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,380
Many people
stayed in the reference room

197
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:50,140
for days without eating or sleeping
after they finally got into it.

198
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:55,020
I remember I once watched a documentary
about Two bombs and One Satellite.

199
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,940
The last generation of scientists
are quite admirable in terms

200
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,740
of both imagination and creativity.

201
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:07,180
Now we're living in peaceful times,
and the Internet is so highly developed,

202
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,660
but I still feel humbled.

203
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:16,380
The scientists contemporary with you
are the real legend.

204
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,420
Legend?

205
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:26,900
You wouldn't have felt it that way
had you experienced it.

206
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,980
Ms. Ye, the other day you told me

207
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,860
something happened
when you were in the Construction Corps.

208
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,900
Afterwards, you went to another place.

209
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,740
What's that place like?

210
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,380
The place I went to
was named Red Coast.

211
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,340
Red Coast?

212
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,500
I read a book about Red Coast.

213
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,540
The author's the developer of Red Coast's
self-interpretation system.

214
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,660
I think he emigrated
to Europe afterwards.

215
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,020
Is what he says in the book real?

216
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,980
I know that book.

217
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,220
The author is somewhat irresponsible.

218
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:20,610
Many of the contents
of the book are not factual.

219
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:24,460
Then what really did happen?

220
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,700
I'm sorry, Ms. Ye.

221
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,620
I was being presumptuous.

222
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,060
Sorry.

223
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,460
No.

224
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:41,740
Correcting them is what I should do.

225
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:56,460
At that time, I thought my life was over,
and I might even die in that room.

226
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,180
This is the person you want.
I've handled all the formalities.

227
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,100
You know the nature of this, right?

228
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,900
Do you have any idea how much trouble
I had to go through to transfer her?

229
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,460
It would never have been so difficult
if you could transfer her above board.

230
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,540
First, the project
is highly confidential.

231
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,780
More importantly, there are strict
confidentiality regulations.

232
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,220
With such a long isolation period, you may
forget about those with family members.

233
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,860
I almost had to forcefully move her.

234
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,340
Weren't the two people
doing pretty good?

235
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:58,300
They would rather stay
at the May Seventh Cadre School.

236
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,620
This kind of unconventional transfer
must not happen again.

237
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,900
Let me tell you something.

238
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,140
Your project itself is unconventional.

239
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,100
If something goes wrong,
I’ll accept the responsibility.

240
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,020
You really think you can
take responsibility for this?

241
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,780
You are a technical person,

242
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,740
but Red Coast is not like
other national defense projects.

243
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,420
Its complexity goes
far beyond the technical issues.

244
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,540
So you do know it's complex.

245
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,460
The country in the north is doing it,
and so are the western countries,

246
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,020
but you won't even give me any manpower.

247
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,580
How am I supposed to complete the task?

248
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,500
What do you mean by I…

249
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,500
Are you okay?

250
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,820
Possible Energy Interfaces

251
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,340
in the Solar Radiation Zone
and Their Reflective Properties.

252
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,260
Was it you who wrote this paper?

253
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:06,780
If it wasn't her,
why would I have you get her here?

254
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:12,540
Where are we going?

255
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,420
Red Coast Base.

256
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,420
Lei Zhicheng was the political commissar
of Red Coast Base.

257
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,740
Yang Weining was the chief engineer.

258
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:42,620
If they hadn't moved me, everything…

259
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:49,580
everything would've been
entirely different.

260
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,980
What were they researching
in the Red Coast Base exactly?

261
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,780
I know you specialize in astrophysics.

262
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:00,660
Did they come to you
because of your speciality?

263
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,900
That was what I thought at the beginning.

264
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:14,220
Yang Weining was a good guy.

265
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,500
Come.

266
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,100
Have a seat.

267
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,700
Shao Lin, this is Yang Weining.

268
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,260
He just became my graduate student.

269
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,860
This is my wife.

270
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,460
Hi, Mrs. Ye.

271
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,860
Have a seat.

272
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,460
Sit.

273
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,780
What topic are you researching?

274
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,780
It's about experimental
and applied physics.

275
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,420
Oh, it's pretty similar to mine.

276
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:57,340
Your mentor
researches theoretical physics.

277
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,180
I want to devote myself to this era
and make some actual contributions.

278
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,980
Theories are the foundation
of application.

279
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:13,220
Isn't discovering the laws of nature
the greatest contribution to this era?

280
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,740
This is our home.

281
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,580
You may say whatever you want.

282
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,180
Yeah.

283
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:30,620
I feel theoretical research tends to
mess with people's minds.

284
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:37,660
Ye, you got yourself a good student.

285
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,900
Mrs. Ye, I bought you some fruits.

286
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,500
I… I'll go wash them for you.

287
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,780
This graduate student is pretty good.

288
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,100
He's balanced and pragmatic.

289
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,780
He's got very good grades,
and excels at maths.

290
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:04,780
Pity his attitude towards science
is not sincere enough.

291
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,180
Well, I think he's very sincere.

292
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:12,140
He's pretty practical,
and he does want to contribute.

293
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:16,100
In the long run, people like him
are more likely to create value.

294
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,700
Science is science.

295
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,660
Truth is truth.

296
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,980
There's no in-between.

297
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,660
Okay, okay.

298
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:27,620
We never reached an agreement on this.

299
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,780
Since Yang Weining
was your father's graduate student,

300
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,740
he figured out a way to move you?

301
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,580
He was in charge
of the project in Red Coast.

302
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,140
Red Coast was short-handed,
and I got the right speciality.

303
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:51,220
Otherwise, in that era,
he wouldn't have been able to help me.

304
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:59,060
But even so,
he was taking great risks doing that.

305
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:06,260
He was really a good guy.

306
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,020
Political Commissar Lei.

307
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,220
Chief Engineer Yang.

308
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,160
Thanks, but I can manage it myself.

309
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,260
Get the supplies to the storeroom
for registration!

310
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,820
Yes!

311
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:13,300
Come on. This way.

312
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:01,740
Ye Wenjie, I'm offering you a chance.

313
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,380
This is a national defense
scientific-research base.

314
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,340
Your expertise might be useful
for the ongoing research in there.

315
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,980
Chief Engineer Yang
will tell you the details,

316
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:17,340
but whether you can seize this chance
depends on you.

317
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,460
I've talked to
the military control commission.

318
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,900
Although Cheng Lihua
advocates sentencing you severely,

319
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,860
considering your actions,
I think you’ll get ten years or so.

320
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,820
If you perform well
during the ten years,

321
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,380
your sentence might be commuted.

322
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:45,540
But here is a research project under
the highest security classification.

323
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,460
Professor Ye…

324
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,860
Ye Zhetai made a mistake,
and so did you.

325
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,140
Therefore, given your status,
if you enter the gate,

326
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,620
it's possible you'll never leave
for the rest of your life.

327
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,740
I want to go in.

328
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,100
Don’t be hasty.

329
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,180
The helicopter will take off
in three hours.

330
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,260
Take your time and think it through.

331
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:23,300
If you refuse our offer,
I'll get you back.

332
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,660
Let's go in.

333
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,580
You should be cautious.

334
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,980
Do you know what it means to go in?

335
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:44,580
I'm willing to stay here
for the rest of my life.

336
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,340
At that time,
apart from the underworld

337
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,060
which nobody knows if it exists,

338
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:49,660
the place I wanted to go to the most
was this sequestered place.

339
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,540
The Red Coast Base was so mysterious.

340
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:57,100
What did they research in there exactly?

341
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,180
(So many things were done with haste.)

342
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,260
(The earth rotates nonstop. Time flies.)

343
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:08,060
(10,000 years are too long.
We need to seize the day.)

344
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:12,340
(The future is bright.
The path is winding.)

345
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:16,100
(We need to harden our resolve,
dismiss our fear of death,)

346
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,300
(overcome all obstacles,
and fight for victory.)

347
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,060
(Those on duty in the Transmission
Department, attention, please.)

348
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,900
(Those on duty in the Transmission
Department, attention, please.)

349
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,580
(The computer magnetic core storage
in the Transmission Department)

350
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,740
(displays a failure code.)

351
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,940
(Maintenance personnel
are to go and fix it immediately.)

352
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,580
(The computer magnetic core storage
in the Transmission Department)

353
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,660
(displays a failure code.)

354
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,340
(Maintenance personnel
are to go and fix it immediately.)

355
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,940
(Range of monitored frequency:
1,000 to 40,000 MHz.)

356
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,980
(Number of monitored channels: 15,000.)

357
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,860
(At 5:00 PM, there will be
a sanitary check)

358
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:54,540
(on the mainframe cabinet
between transmitters and receivers.)

359
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,620
(Please prepare ahead of time.)

360
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:01,260
(A routine work meeting will be held
after the transmission.)

361
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,340
Who are you?

362
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:09,140
(Department heads are to attend on time.)

363
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,380
(Comrades, we are conducting)

364
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,820
(glorious and steadfast
socialist construction.)

365
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,140
(Building and Protecting Our Great Motherland)
(We should harness from the work,)

366
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,740
(A Spark Can Grow Into an Inferno,)

367
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,540
(the power that'll help us
overcome any obstacle.)

368
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:31,980
(Today, we re-read
A Spark Can Grow Into an Inferno.)

369
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,820
(Under the guidance
of our great leader, Chairman Mao,)

370
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:40,980
(we'll surmount all difficulties
and triumph.)

371
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,660
Chief Engineer Yang,
there's a change in the shift schedule.

372
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,580
Have a look.

373
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:55,340
This is a large-scale
weapons research project.

374
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,620
If it succeeds,
the result will be even more important

375
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,980
than the atomic bomb
and the hydrogen bomb.

376
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:10,340
(The Monitoring Department
will now announce)

377
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:14,980
(the schedule of the next night shift.)

378
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:19,620
(Monday, Transmission...)

379
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,980
This is the smell of machine oil.

380
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,260
It's pretty strong, but bearable.

381
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,420
You'll get used to it soon enough.

382
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,260
Chief Engineer Yang.

383
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,180
Your room isn't ready yet.

384
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,340
You may go in with me.

385
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,500
I'll just wait here.

386
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,100
You're a staff member now.

387
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,860
You can go anywhere
with only a few exceptions.

388
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,940
I'll just wait here.

389
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:32,340
Chief Engineer Yang,
take a look at this set of data.

390
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,900
Are you…

391
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,300
The conditions here are poor.

392
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,660
There's no heating in the house.

393
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,380
Zhang.

394
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,140
I'm here!

395
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,820
When a fire is made in her room,
take her there to have some rest.

396
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,380
Yes!

397
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,260
Take it.

398
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,580
Take it.

399
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,020
Put it on.

400
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,660
Let's go.

401
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,540

418
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,020
25 seconds.

419
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,620

431
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,660
Fourteen.

432
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,860
Thirteen.

433
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,020
Twelve.

434
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,140
Eleven.

435
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,260
Ten.

436
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,220
Nine.

437
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,300
Eight.

438
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,340
Seven.

439
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,460
Six.

440
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,460
Five.

441
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,540

444
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,100
One.

445
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,540
Begin transmission!

446
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,100
All units continue to monitor!

447
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,380
You feel itchy, right?

448
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:45,740
Every time it transmits,
my hands and face feel itchy,

449
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,980
and it makes me feel warm.

450
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,260
Sparrows.

451
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,980
(Malfunction with Coding Unit.
The codes are problematic.)

452
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,780
Recheck it.

453
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,540
(The codes are problematic.)

454
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,860
Is there
any solar radiation interference?

455
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,780
Report. No solar radiation interference
detected.

456
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,660
(Computer processing error message.)

457
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,900
(Computer processing error message.)

458
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,500
Report. The electric current is growing.

459
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,340
(Maintenance personnel
are to check the circuits immediately.)

460
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,180
(I repeat.)

461
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,940
Malfunction with Amplifier unit.
Magnetron No. 3 has burnt out.

462
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,740
Backup Unit is in operation.

463
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,260
Checkpoint one reached.

464
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,100
Turn it again.

465
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,580
Circuits undamaged.

466
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:53,220
Transmission 147
of Red Coast Project completed.

467
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,900
Transmission systems shutting down.
Red Coast now entering monitoring state.

468
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,780
System control is hereby transferred
to the Monitoring Department.

469
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,820
Please upload checkpoint data.

470
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:05,300
All units should fill out
transmission diaries.

471
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,540
All unit heads should attend the post-transmission
meeting in the debriefing room.

472
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,860
We're done.

473
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:15,780
Where's BN20197F?

474
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,500
I don't know that either.

475
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:24,700
I think it's over there.

476
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:28,220
Over there.

477
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:52,180
There was a giant antenna,
and a powerful electric field.

478
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,620
The Red Coast was under
such a high security classification.

479
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,820
Were there many restrictions as well?

480
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:01,620
All those restrictions were necessary.

481
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,380
For example,
the leave-of-absence mechanism.

482
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:11,500
Every time I wanted to go out,
the approval process was easy for me.

483
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:30,820
Besides, when I first joined Red Coast,
my workload was really light.

484
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:36,900
I often climbed to the mountaintop
to see the sunrise.

485
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,460
You got up so early.

486
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:57,620
I used to get up early to work.
I've taken to it.

487
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:01,700
You start working so early?

488
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:06,370
All devices need double-checking.

489
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:10,060
You've always been a meticulous guy.

490
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,220
Professor Ye…

491
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:20,660
He…

492
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:24,340
Seen from here, the northern tree farm

493
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:28,140
is really pitch-dark.

494
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:36,020
I never thought
I'd come back in a month.

495
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,540
Back?

496
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:41,060
Yeah.

497
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:45,700
Previously, I looked up here
from down there.

498
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:59,580
And now,
I'm looking down there from up here.

499
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:08,060
Be careful.

500
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,700
I was scared of this place
when I first came here.

501
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:19,060
It struck me as bottomless.

502
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,900
Now it's growing on me.

503
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:31,500
This is the quietest spot in the base.

504
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:35,340
I can stay here for the rest of my life.
