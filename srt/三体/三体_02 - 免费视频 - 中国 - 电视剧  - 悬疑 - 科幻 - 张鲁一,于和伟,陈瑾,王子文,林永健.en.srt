1
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,950
You…

2
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,400
How long have you been married?

3
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,040
Eight years.

4
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,230
How old is your child?

5
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,760
Seven.

6
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:46,200
I bought this house
in preparation for marriage.

7
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,070
I thought she'd actually
start a family with me.

8
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,560
Yang Dong.

9
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:03,680
She was like a star in the sky,
which was far, far away from you.

10
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,120
Even the light it shed on you felt cold.

11
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,680
This afternoon, after you left,

12
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,900
people from the Battle Command Center
talked to me in private.

13
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,750
They wanted me to join
the Frontiers of Science.

14
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,390
Well, you didn't agree, right?

15
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,430
No.

16
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,120
Right!

17
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,630
Your choice's quite right!

18
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:39,910
Let me tell you something.
They're just a bunch of arrogant idiots!

19
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,030
They seem to have done some digging.

20
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,960
Yeah. Worldwide digging.

21
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,120
So they should know that
there are two people having nothing to do

22
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,280
with the Frontiers of Science at all.

23
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:58,840
And Yang Dong was one of them.

24
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,300
=Three-Body=

25
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,020
=Episode 2=

26
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,360
Dr. Ding,
why did Yang Dong make a choice like that?

27
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,620
Because physics doesn't exist anymore.

28
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,480
If physics didn't exist anymore,
and you release your hold right now,

29
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,950
this book would fly into the sky
instead of falling to the floor.

30
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,780
You're right.

31
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,190
If physics didn't exist anymore,

32
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,630
Schrodinger wouldn't
have been on the floor.

33
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,480
He would've been…

34
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,920
in the sky.

35
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,750
So, Einstein wouldn't have been
on the floor either.

36
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,310
Newton wouldn't have been
on the floor either.

37
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,000
None of these people
would've been on the floor.

38
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,560
They would've all been floating
in the sky.

39
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,120
They're all on the floor now.

40
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,190
Do you know how to play this?

41
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,000
A little.

42
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,720
Yang Dong and I loved it,

43
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,920
because it reminded us of
the collision in a particle collider.

44
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,600
Help me clean this.

45
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,630
You may toss them
wherever you want. It's okay.

46
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,390
No need. It's okay.
You don't have to stack them up.

47
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,630
Just toss them away.

48
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,300
Can you hit it into the hole?

49
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,480
I think any normal person can do it.

50
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,920
Let's rotate it 90 degrees.

51
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,800
Alright.

52
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,560
Okay. This will do.

53
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,350
Dr. Ding, what are we doing?

54
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,830
Do it again.

55
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,750
Okay, now the experiments are over.

56
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,800
Let's analyze the results.

57
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,780
We conducted five collision experiments
in total, right?

58
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,540
The first four took place
in different positions at different times,

59
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,630
and the fifth one happened
in the same position as the first one,

60
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,870
but at a different time,

61
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,630
so you're unsurprised
by this outcome, right?

62
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,630
All five collision experiments
generated the same result.

63
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,310
What do you mean?

64
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,270
I…

65
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:22,630
I'd like you to explain this outcome
with the language of physics.

66
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,750
Language of physics.

67
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,840
In the five previous experiments,

68
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:38,200
there was no change whatsoever
in the mass of the two balls.

69
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,360
Their relative positions,

70
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,000
if using the pool table
as a reference frame, never changed either.

71
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,150
The velocity vector at which the white ball
hit the black one hardly changed,

72
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,270
which caused the momentum exchange

73
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,550
generated by the collision between
the balls to remain unchanged as well.

74
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,000
That's the reason the black ball

75
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,670
went into the hole
every time it got hit.

76
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,080
So now you've discovered a great law:

77
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,470
the laws of physics are even
in terms of time and space.

78
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,750
From the start of human history

79
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,670
until now, all the discoveries
made in the field of physics,

80
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,360
such as Archimedes' principle,
the string theory,

81
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,430
every single one of those things
is based on this law.

82
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,120
You know what I mean?

83
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,360
I understand your words, but I don't know
what you're trying to convey.

84
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:23,510
Do you dare to imagine another result?

85
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:29,720
In the first experiment,
the black ball was hit into the hole.

86
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,630
In the second one,
well, the black ball went off track.

87
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,600
In the third one,
the black ball flew into mid-air.

88
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,510
In the fourth one,
the black ball, like a scared sparrow,

89
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,870
flew around in the room.

90
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,030
And then in the fifth one,
at near the speed of light,

91
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,120
it flew off this table,
penetrated through the wall,

92
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,240
broke free from Earth's gravity,

93
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,620
and shot straight
out of the solar system.

94
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:08,150
Just like what Asimov depicts in his sci-fi.

95
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:23,750
If the results of the experiments
were like that,

96
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,240
what…

97
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,440
what would you think?

98
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,200
You and Yang Dong
both liked playing pool,

99
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:46,440
because it reminded you of
the collision in a particle collider.

100
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,390
So this kind of thing
really did happen?

101
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,480
In Yang Dong's lab?

102
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:59,750
The first data, recorded at 9:07,
the second date, recorded at 10:22,

103
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,790
the third data, recorded at 10:50.

104
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,030
They're all inconsistent.

105
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,950
They're also inconsistent
with the calculation results.

106
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:10,000
The experiment failed.

107
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,150
It happened.

108
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,230
But that was always
part of the experiment.

109
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,000
In terms of experiment,
that was quite normal.

110
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,940
Yeah. In terms of experiment,
abnormal data is a normal thing, right?

111
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,120
But this time, things are different.

112
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,790
Let's get back to pool.

113
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,030
Uh, if in the fourth experiment,

114
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,480
the black ball flew all around
like a sparrow,

115
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,080
and in the fifth one it flew
out of the solar system,

116
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,240
if I need you
to verify that kind of results,

117
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,820
would you be able
to do it with deduction?

118
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,240
I specialize in applied physics,

119
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,050
so I don't know much
about this kind of stuff,

120
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,200
but I think that's very unlikely.

121
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:46,150
These are the faxes
you sent to the victim.

122
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,600
You sent all these?

123
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,670
What's wrong?

124
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,200
Is your girlfriend okay?

125
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,790
What's going on exactly?

126
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,550
What's the matter?

127
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,390
Look at this.

128
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,390
Experiment results.

129
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,390
No.

130
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:12,080
The time.

131
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,120
This can't be happening.

132
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,150
Nine o'clock.

133
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,360
It couldn't be nine.

134
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,240
Impossible.

135
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,840
The data, which was the same
as Yang Dong's,

136
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,360
had been delivered to Professor Munphy

137
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,320
when her experiment was still ongoing.

138
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,120
No way.

139
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,550
According to our known knowledge
of physics,

140
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,720
that's absolutely impossible.

141
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,200
We think it's impossible,

142
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,270
because right now we still
believe in physics.

143
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,640
Yang Dong expounded and proved it?

144
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,360
I don't know either.

145
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,720
I want to find out as well.

146
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,960
If this is true,
then… the evenness of time and space

147
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:57,870
that laws of physics are based on
will be non-existent, which means…

148
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:01,200
Which means physics
doesn't exist anymore.

149
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,510
This will be a catastrophe for the research
of cutting-edge theory.

150
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,150
So, to make achievement
in theoretical physics,

151
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:18,080
you need
an unswerving religious belief.

152
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,030
That's why there are people

153
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:24,200
believing the hypothesis
about the shooter and the farmer.

154
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,550
The shooter and the farmer.

155
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:33,130
That's the theory
of the Frontiers of Science.

156
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,790
Yeah. Anyway, those theories
which cannot be proved right

157
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:40,120
and cannot be proved wrong either
are actually, to put it bluntly…

158
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,790
You know, they give people hope.

159
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:53,360
But sometimes this kind of hope
might drive people to their doom.

160
00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:01,870
I always felt that
I was about to win her heart.

161
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,080
Maybe, if you accept my proposal,
the experiment will go well.

162
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,630
The experiment failed.

163
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,030
Then do some extra ones.

164
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,720
But maybe I was wrong.

165
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,440
The data, which was the same
as Yang Dong's,

166
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,960
had been delivered to Professor Munphy
when her experiment was still ongoing.

167
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,610
No way.

168
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,910
According to our known knowledge
of physics,

169
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,840
that's absolutely impossible.

170
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,190
We think it's impossible,

171
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:06,200
because right now
we still believe in physics.

172
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:13,750
Physics doesn't exist anymore.

173
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,120
Are you blind?

174
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,840
What a psycho.

185

(Pierla Hutong 4-2)

186
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,790
Hi.

187
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:36,160
Welcome back
to the Frontiers of Science.

188
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,480
Sorry to disturb you.

189
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,590
No.

190
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:42,340
I'm very happy you called.

191
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,200
You want me
to join the Frontiers of Science?

192
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,110
I want everybody to join us,
and get to know us.

193
00:17:53,510 --> 00:18:00,270
I still can't fully accept your theory,
though it sounds fascinating.

194
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,790
Anything, when you begin to doubt it

195
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,030
and want to break through it,
becomes the most fascinating.

196
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,680
That's why our organization is named
Frontiers of Science.

197
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,480
In this area,
owning such a large manor house,

198
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,790
the owner must be no ordinary person.

199
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,070
This is a private residence
of one of our members.

200
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:21,160
It was offered to us for communication.

201
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,200
Professor Wang?

202
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,350
That member specializes
in quantum entanglement, right?

203
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,920
Yeah.

204
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,750
Welcome, friends visiting the Frontiers
of Science for the first time.

205
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:18,240
And welcome back, Professor Wang Miao.

206
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:27,300
Professor Wang participated
in some of our previous discussions, so, next,

207
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,240
(Frontiers of Science)
I'd like you to tell everybody

208
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,290
what our research is about.

209
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:36,160
I think it's the shooter hypothesis
and the farmer hypothesis.

210
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,160
(Assuming that a marksman
leaves bullet holes on a target)

211
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,510
(at intervals of 10 centimeters.)

212
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:49,270
(Suppose that on this target resides a kind of
two-dimensional intelligent species.)

213
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:55,960
(Their scientists,
after observing their universe,)

214
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,790
(discovered a great law.)

215
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,830
(Each time they travel 10 centimeters,
they're guaranteed to find a hole.)

216
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:12,400
(They mistake
what the shooter did on a whim)

217
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,720
(as an unchanging law
of their universe.)

218
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,540
In the eyes
of those two-dimensional creatures,

219
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,030
the holes made
at intervals of 10 centimeters

220
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,960
might be the greatest wonder
in their world.

221
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,920
Maybe they're planning on adventuring.

222
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
Maybe they're even
researching surveying equipment,

223
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,640
trying to find out
which material can help them

224
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,640
explore in a more efficient
and safer way.

225
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,000
Maybe it's nano-material.

226
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,310
There's also a farmer hypothesis.

227
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:47,590
There is a flock of turkeys on a farm.

228
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:54,110
Every day the farmer
feeds them at 11 AM.

229
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,790
One of the turkeys, a scientist,
observes the phenomenon.

230
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:03,960
It observes for almost a year,
and there's been no exception,

231
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,070
so it also announces
a great law of their universe.

232
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:14,440
Food arrives at 11 AM every day.

233
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,060
One day, when it's 11 o'clock,
the farmer shows up again,

234
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,310
but it's Thanksgiving Day.

235
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,480
Food doesn't come.

236
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:38,400
The farmer walks inside,
takes them all and slaughters them.

237
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:44,830
We might be like
the two-dimensional scientist on that target,

238
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,350
or the turkey scientist on the farm.

239
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:54,000
If, in this world, there is indeed
a kind of supernatural power,

240
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,550
the shooter, then the regularity
that the shooter knows is the truth.

241
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:03,680
Newton's classical mechanics
is totally useless in the micro-world,

242
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,350
and Einstein's theory of relativity,

243
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,470
when applied to the quantum world,
raises even more problems.

244
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,680
If science has frontiers,

245
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,480
then what we're about to touch
is very likely to be the frontiers.

246
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,590
The "truth" that those two-dimensional
creatures find is not the truth,

247
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:24,070
because in their world,
they can never find the truth.

248
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:29,830
Their science has frontiers.

249
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,070
Then what's beyond the frontiers?

250
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:35,160
What regularities do the shooter
and the farmer know?

251
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,710
Personally, this is not just science.

252
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,960
It's more like a ritual.

253
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:47,720
A ritual of infinite exploration
of the frontiers of science.

254
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,790
But what's the point of all this?

255
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,340
State your opinions.

256
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,880
I have no impressive opinions.

257
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,510
Every one of you
know more about theories than I do,

258
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:04,750
but I think today's discussion serves only
to make scientists vulnerable.

259
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:10,000
In my eyes, there's no way whatsoever
to authenticate these hypotheses,

260
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,960
but if those two-dimensional creatures
and the turkeys on the farm

261
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,400
find out everything but are powerless
to make any difference,

262
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,150
how despairing will they be?

263
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,270
Actually, your current attitude
proves that

264
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,430
no matter whether you're willing
to admit it or not,

265
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,030
you've come to believe this hypothesis.

266
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,720
Even if I believe it, I will not accept
that I'm a turkey scientist.

267
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,510
Previous to this,
maybe you've never thought

268
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,950
that you might be a turkey scientist.

269
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,750
I will not accept
I'm a turkey scientist.

270
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:59,960
Dr. Shen, has it ever occurred to you
that such a statement can kill?

271
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:09,270
The turkeys on the farm
are meant to die on Thanksgiving Day.

272
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:29,340
(Defend Our Mother Country)

273
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,790
Professor Wang, you don't look very well.

274
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,480
Rough night?

275
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:56,200
The other day, you said those words
to me on purpose, right?

276
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,880
What words?

277
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,230
Asking me to talk to Ding Yi.

278
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,590
Making me become suspicious
of the Frontiers of Science.

279
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,350
All those were tricks
meant for me, right?

280
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:09,790
You set a trap for me
and waited for me to step into it.

281
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,920
Although you're a science guy,
you're pretty smart.

282
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,230
Well, what did you find out?

283
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,960
Fill me in.

284
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,880
Was Yang Dong's death really suicide?

285
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,880
In terms of criminology
and forensic examination,

286
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,110
it was undoubtedly suicide,
but if all their deaths were suicide,

287
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:29,440
then what's the point
of our investigation?

288
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,770
You're still trying to trick me.

289
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,920
You're trying to trick me
into focusing on Yang Dong.

290
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,720
That's right.

291
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,920
I need to set another trap for you.

292
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,400
Yang Dong's funeral is in two days.

293
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,640
Go ahead. Go ahead.

294
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:46,030
Go ahead.

295
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,920
What are you doing?

296
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,230
Give me a ride downhill.

297
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:01,810
That's not even my car.
Why are you pulling?

298
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:11,680
People are prone to make mistakes
when… when agitated.

299
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:29,070
He went to Ding Yi, and then Shen Yufei.

300
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,590
Don't get too excited.

301
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,440
What's that going to prove?

302
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,550
I bet he'll attend Yang Dong's funeral.

303
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,920
Why?

304
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,590
No particular reason.

305
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,480
This Wang Miao guy
strikes me as very special.

306
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,920
Chang, it's been such a long time,

307
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,160
and this is just a case
about scientists' suicides.

308
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,790
With such a large
Battle Command Center,

309
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,640
have you really found nothing?

310
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,780
It's about time you fill me in.

311
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,350
I mean, it's been some time
since you transferred me here.

312
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:04,030
Does everything going on in this center
need to be reported to you?

313
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:09,240
All you have to do
is solve the case of the scientist.

314
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,400
Alright.

315
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,200
Consider it done.

316
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,350
I'll crack this case for you
following the clue of Wang Miao,

317
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:21,480
but don't forget our deal.

318
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,400
My suspension,
you need to handle it for me.

319
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,020
Have I not handled it for you?

320
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,350
Are you under suspension?

321
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:35,240
You're doing pretty well
in my department, aren't you?

322
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:50,110
The first bow.

323
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:55,070
The second bow.

324
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,960
The third bow.

325
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:08,350
Kin's reciprocal bow.

326
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,960
Ms. Ye, sorry for your loss.

327
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:36,160
Who are you?

328
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,510
I'm Yang Dong's friend.

329
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,790
My name is Wang Miao.

330
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,550
Thank you.

331
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,070
You specialize
in the string theory as well?

332
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,640
No.

333
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,480
I specialize in nanotechnology.

334
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,480
Applied physics.

335
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:05,510
A few days ago, I read a news report,
and it's about nanotechnology.

336
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:10,780
It mentioned a kind of
super-strength nano-material.

337
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,720
Its name's Flying Blade.

338
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,480
That's the very thing
we've been researching in our lab.

339
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,110
That's very audacious,
and very forward-looking.

340
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:25,310
You flatter us, Ms. Ye.

341
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,540
It happens that not long ago,

342
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,750
when the superstring model verification
experiment was conducted in Liangxiang,

343
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,920
I took a picture of Yang Dong.

344
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,830
I brought it here
so you could have it as a keepsake.

345
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,160
Sorry, Ms. Ye.

346
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,640
There was a technical glitch
when I was developing and printing it.

347
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,790
I'll develop and print another one

348
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:58,240
and deliver it to your house
in a few days.

349
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,550
Thank you.

350
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,350
You're welcome.

351
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,350
See you around, Ms. Ye.

352
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,590
You look pretty good
dressed entirely in black.

353
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,400
I know what you're going to say.

354
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
I came here purely to show

355
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,580
my respect for a scientist
and offer my condolences.

356
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,640
Do I make myself clear enough?

357
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,920
Stop following me.

358
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,160
Did I ask you to make yourself clear?

359
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:55,480
You and Ye Wenjie, Yang Dong's mother,
talked for a long time.

360
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,880
Is that so?

361
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,910
Sorry for your loss.

362
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,110
Goodbye.

363
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:06,470
It took you that long
to say those words?

364
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,680
What is this?

365
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,750
Hello?

366
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,510
Wang.

367
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,310
Li.

368
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,590
What's up?

369
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,480
What's going on?

370
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,270
I asked you
to develop that roll of film for me.

371
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,240
Was there something wrong
with your machine?

372
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,550
Why are there time codes
on the pictures?

373
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,950
That… That's impossible.

374
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,590
That never happened
to my other customers.

375
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:53,240
Could it be
that your negative's problematic?

376
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,070
Hold on.

377
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,960
The negative has it too.

378
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,720
Could it be the film?

379
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,310
I bought the film from you as well.

380
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,960
It can't be.

381
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,440
I think it's your camera.

382
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,400
Could it be
that you got the timer wrong?

383
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,110
Uh, what's the brand of your camera?

384
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,160
Leica.

385
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,710
M2, 1988.

386
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,640
Fully mechanical and manual.

387
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,310
Well, that's a beautiful thing!

388
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,030
You're such a big spender!

389
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,750
It can't be. Your camera
should have no timer in it.

390
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,310
Well, even if it had a timer,

391
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:34,720
there's no way the time could've
appeared in the middle of the picture.

392
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,310
Well, I don't know.

393
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:39,720
How about you do some more research?

394
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,550
Something's not right.

395
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:52,260
The color of these codes
changes with the background.

396
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,480
Well, I'll do some research about it.
Talk to you later.

397
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,270
Alright.

398

399
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,880
They're all smaller than 60.

400
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,630
