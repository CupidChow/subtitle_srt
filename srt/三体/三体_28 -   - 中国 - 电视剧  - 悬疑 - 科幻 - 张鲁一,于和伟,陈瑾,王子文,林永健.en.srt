00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,820
=Episode 28=

3
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,510
The last but also
the most important question.

4
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,560
So far,

5
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,030
the Trisolaris has only sent radio waves

6
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,500
to the Earth?

7
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,750
Almost true.

8
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,800
Almost?

9
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,190
The current Trisolaran civilization

10
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:23,080
(is capable of space travel
at one-tenth the speed of light.)

11
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,750
(This technology leap occurred
a few decades ago in Earth years.)

12
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,360
(Before that point, their maximum speed)

13
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,630
(had hovered around one-thousandth
the speed of light.)

14
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,080
(The tiny probes
that they sent to the Earth)

15
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,520
(have not even completed one-hundredth)

16
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,840
of the journey between there and here.

17
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,520
(If the Trisolaran Fleet that
had been launched)

18
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,030
is capable of flight
at one-tenth the speed of light,

19
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,240
it should take only 40 years
to reach the solar system.

20
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,280
Why do you say that it would take
more than 400 years?

21
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,520
Here's the thing.

22
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,080
The Trisolaran Interstellar Fleet
is composed of incredibly

23
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,520
(massive spaceships.)

24
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,080
(Accelerating them is a slow process.)

25
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,910
(One-tenth the speed of light
is only their maximum speed,)

26
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:14,030
(but they cannot cruise
at this speed for long)

27
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,360
(before decelerating.)

28
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,190
(So, the time it takes
the Trisolaran Fleet)

29
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,910
(to reach the solar system)

30
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,530
(is ten times longer than
that of a small probe.)

31
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:30,400
Also, the source of propulsion
for the Trisolaran ships

32
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,860
is matter-antimatter annihilation.

33
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,500
Matter-antimatter annihilation?

34
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,520
Then is there a large magnetic field
in front of each ship?

35
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,520
Is there a large magnetic field
in front of each ship?

36
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,620
Yes.

37
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,520
(Theoretically,
the field is shaped like a funnel)

38
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,280
(to collect antimatter particles
from space.)

39
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,710
(This collection process is slow,)

40
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,710
(and only after a long wait
can it gather)

41
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,840
(enough antimatter to allow the ship)

42
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,580
(to accelerate for a brief period.)

43
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,330
If that's the case,

44
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,500
it indeed takes 400 years.

45
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,510
Then what did you mean by
"almost" just now?

46
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,190
We're talking about

47
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,270
the speed of space flight
within a certain context.

48
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:46,360
Outside this context,
even backward human beings

49
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,430
(are capable of
accelerating certain objects)

50
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,310
(to close to the speed of light.)

51
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,510
By "context", she probably means
at the macro scale.

52
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,800
At a micro scale, we can already
use high-energy particle accelerators

53
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,100
to speed up micro particles
to near the speed of light.

54
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:09,660
Those micro particles you mentioned
are the "objects", right?

55
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,160
You're clever.

56
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,120
I'm flattered.

57
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,620
I have the world's
foremost scientists behind me.

58
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,560
Yes,

59
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,420
they're micro particles.

60
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,600
Six years ago,
in the distant triple star system,

61
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,360
Trisolaris accelerated
two hydrogen nuclei

62
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,360
to near the speed of light

63
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,630
(and shot them toward the solar system.)

64
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:45,750
(These two hydrogen nuclei, or protons,)

65
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,920
(arrived at the solar system
two years ago,)

66
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,890
(then reached the Earth.)

67
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,240
Two protons?

68
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,510
They only sent two protons?

69
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,070
That's almost nothing.

70
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,430
General Chang,

71
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,500
you also said "almost".

72
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,680
That's the limit of Trisolaran power.

73
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,310
They can only accelerate something

74
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,540
as small as a proton
to near the speed of light.

75
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,430
Over a distance of four light-years,

76
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,180
they can only send two protons.

77
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,040
(At the macroscopic level,
two protons are nothing.)

78
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,680
(Even a single cilium on a bacterium)

79
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,000
(would include several billion protons.)

80
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,310
(What's the point?)

81
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,480
They're a lock.

82
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,740
A lock? What are they locking?

83
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,060
The progress of human science.

84
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,360
(During the four and a half centuries)

85
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,270
(until the arrival
of the Trisolaran Fleet,)

86
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,160
(due to the existence
of the two protons,)

87
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,040
(humanity will not be able to make)

88
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,470
any important scientific developments.

89
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,310
Evans once said that the day of arrival

90
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:16,750
of the two protons was also the day

91
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,540
that human science died.

92
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,740
(So you already knew that
the protons sealed off human science.)

93
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,310
(Professor David
of Gadayork University,)

94
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,830
(committed suicide a month ago.)

95
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,630
(The astrophysicist of Country A...)

96
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,800
(Human science will never progress.)

97
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,720
(Yang Dong's experiment
will never succeed.)

98
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,660
Physics doesn't exist.

99
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,220
(Why didn't you
tell her the truth earlier?)

100
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,980
Is everything I know

101
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,570
the truth?

102
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,290
General Chang,

103
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,010
this is Wang Miao.

104
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,960
OK, thanks, Professor Ye.

105
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,150
Let's call it a day.

106
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,170
Someone wants to see you.

107
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,340
Thank you for seeing me.

108
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,720
There is a question

109
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,370
that I haven't answered you.

110
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:23,100
Is it about Yang Dong?

111
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,530
Dong

112
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,580
didn't like to watch
the news on current events,

113
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:39,790
because she had a basic belief that

114
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:43,240
life and the world

115
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,120
might be ugly,

116
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,360
but at the end of the micro and macro,

117
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,410
it was harmonious and perfect.

118
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:01,490
(The daily world was just a foam
floating on the perfect ocean.)

119
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,510
(But because the protons interfered with
the accelerator experiment,)

120
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,980
Don't come over.

121
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,230
(the daily world became
a beautiful presentation instead.)

122
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,720
(The micro it contained)

123
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,510
(and the macro that contained it)

124
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:31,800
(might be more chaotic and uglier.)

125
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,010
(So her faith collapsed.)

126
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,250
(She actually knew that)

127
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,050
she didn't have to think that way.

128
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:53,500
Without physics, she could still live.

129
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,390
(She made choices and efforts,)

130
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:04,000
(trying to live peacefully)

131
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,860
(like an ordinary woman.)

132
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,860
(For her,)

133
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:15,230
(half of her life had been destroyed.)

134
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,500
I talked with Shen Yufei.

135
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:24,320
Yang Dong tried to make changes.

136
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,770
Perhaps she did that to save herself.

137
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,250
But I don't know

138
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,170
why she eventually
chose to end her life.

139
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,370
That's because

140
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,170
I destroyed

141
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,410
the other half of her life.

142
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,270
(If I was right,)

143
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,630
(Dong)

144
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,270
(should have accidentally seen)

145
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,790
(the files on my computer
that I didn't delete,)

146
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,380
(and found out)

147
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,050
(about my secrets with Trisolaris.)

148
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,130
(She never thought that)

149
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,890
(her mom who kept her company)

150
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,430
(was a different person,)

151
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,510
(a person)

152
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:22,240
(she couldn't)

153
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,630
(even believe)

154
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,940
(might exist.)

155
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,500
(The two things together)

156
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:35,650
(constituted her entire life.)

157
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,940
But,

158
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,340
they were actually one thing.

159
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,530
To be exact,

160
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,340
I was the one

161
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,620
who destroyed Dong's life.

162
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,320
♪The cruel choice of nature♪

163
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,130
(All the evidence
points to a single conclusion.)

164
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:11,500
(Physics has never existed,)

165
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,220
(and will never exist.)

166
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:20,460
(I know what I'm doing
is irresponsible.)

167
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,030
(But I have no choice.)

168
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:26,200
(Triazolam)

169
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,720
I know you always think

170
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,010
there are many doubts
about Yang Dong's death.

171
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,460
I have doubts, too.

172
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,950
If I tell you,

173
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,010
it's partly because of physics,

174
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,960
and partly because of Professor Ye,

175
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,410
will it clear your doubts?

176
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,130
What do you think?

177
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,850
Physics has never existed,
and will never exist.

178
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:39,360
Honestly, I think just the opposite.

179
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,530
I think Yang Dong's suicide note
becomes even more strange.

180
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,870
Let's do a sociological
thought experiment

181
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,790
with Yang Dong as an example.

182
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,440
Quantum collision failed.

183
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,010
The foundation of physics
seemed to have collapsed.

184
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:15,320
(But if she knew it was because
two protons had locked human science,)

185
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,960
(she should have found
reasonable explanations)

186
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,650
(for the anomalies
in theoretical physics.)

187
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,390
(Profess Ye's story indeed
destroyed her hope,)

188
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,600
(but at the same time, she could)

189
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,590
(at least see the reason why
human physics didn't exist)

190
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,340
(was because of
the intervention of Trisolarans.)

191
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,860
This should be new hope.

192
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,240
Yang Dong couldn't
have failed to see this,

193
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,390
but she still chose...

194
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,980
chose to kill herself.

195
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,220
She must have seen
something more long-term than us.

196
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,790
But what did she see?

197
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,360
How did she see?

198
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,170
Both of us can't figure it out.

199
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,550
Your experiment just now
took the two protons locking the Earth

200
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:16,250
as a necessary condition.

201
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,140
Do you really believe that?

202
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,200
The Trisolarans
shot two protons at the Earth

203
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,310
from four light-years away

204
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,400
(and they both reached the target.)

205
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,640
(That accuracy is incredible.)

206
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,240
(You know there are numerous obstacles
between there and here.)

207
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,720
(And both the solar system
and the Earth are moving.)

208
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,510
It's like...

209
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,640
It would require more precision

210
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,240
than shooting
a mosquito here from Pluto.

211
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,830
The shooter is beyond imagination,
right?

212
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,740
So what does that mean?

213
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,290
I don't know.

214
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,740
I don't know.

215
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,510
What do you think
those micro particles

216
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:07,940
such as protons, neutrons
and electrons look like?

217
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:13,290
They would just look like a point,
but with different structures.

218
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:18,050
The image in my head
is more realistic than yours.

219
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,090
Look what this is.

220
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,010
A cigarette filter.

221
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:36,270
Looking at this tiny thing
from where you stand,

222
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,530
how would you describe it?

223
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,460
It's practically just a point.

224
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,790
If this little sponge is spread open,
the adsorbent surface area

225
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,020
can be as large as my living room.

226
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,510
Do you smoke pipes?

227
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,110
I don't smoke.

228
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,310
Pipes use a more advanced filter.

229
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,350
Three yuan for one.

230
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,400
It's filled with active charcoal.

231
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,200
If you take out all the infill,
it looks like mouse droppings.

232
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,350
But spread open,

233
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,920
the adsorbent surface formed by
the tiny holes inside

234
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,310
is as large as a tennis court.

235
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:32,980
This is why active charcoal
is so adsorbent.

236
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,200
So, what are you trying to say?

237
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,350
Well, the sponge or active charcoal
is three-dimensional.

238
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,030
But their adsorbent surfaces
are two-dimensional.

239
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,000
Thus, you can see how a
high-dimensional structure

240
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,900
can contain a huge
low-dimensional structure.

241
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,030
But at the macroscopic level,

242
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,240
this is the limit of the ability
for high-dimensional space

243
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,700
to contain low-dimensional space.

244
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,000
Because God was stingy.

245
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,270
During the big bang, he only

246
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:02,980
provided the macroscopic world
with three dimensions,

247
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,440
but this doesn't mean that
higher dimensions don't exist.

248
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,790
Up to eight dimensions
are locked within the micro scale.

249
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,610
(And added to the three dimensions
at the macro scale,)

250
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:19,900
(an eleven-dimensional space-time
exists within fundamental particles.)

251
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,400
So what?

252
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,830
What do you think is the mark of a
civilization's technological advancement

253
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,050
in the universe?

254
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,680
The view of dimensions.

255
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,650
I think it's the ability to control
and make use of micro dimensions.

256
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,440
Making use of fundamental particles
is something that our ancestors

257
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,240
already did back when
they drilled wood to make a fire.

258
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,400
Utilizing chemical reactions is just

259
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,270
manipulating micro particles
at the one-dimensional level.

260
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,640
Of course, this utilization
also progressed from crude to advanced,

261
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,790
from bonfires to steam engines,
and then generators.

262
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,000
But now, the ability for humans to manipulate
micro particles at the macro level

263
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,960
has reached a peak.

264
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,880
We have computers and nanomaterials.

265
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,960
But all of this, from the perspective of a more
advanced civilization in the universe,

266
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,610
is accomplished without

267
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,290
unlocking the many dimensions.

268
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,220
That's why
they think of humans as mere turkeys.

269
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,350
What does all you said

270
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,390
have to do with those two protons?

271
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:27,820
Ultimately, what can they do?

272
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,790
A single cilium on a bacterium
can contain several billion protons.

273
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:35,720
Even if the two protons turned entirely
into energy on the tip of my finger,

274
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,920
at most it would feel like a pinprick.

275
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,550
Even if they turned into energy
on a bacterium,

276
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,400
the bacterium probably
wouldn't feel anything.

277
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,920
Not to mention you.

278
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,070
Then what were you trying to say?

279
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,720
Nothing.

280
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,920
I don't know anything.

281
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,440
What can a turkey know?

282
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,510
But about this thing,
you know more than I do.

283
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,240
You are not at a loss as I am.

284
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,610
At least you can tell me what you know.

285
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,570
- Tell you what I know?
- Yes.

286
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,010
If I tell you what I know,

287
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,140
you really won't be able to sleep.

288
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,700
What's the point of worrying?

289
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,960
Learn from Shi Qiang.

290
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,700
Just do the best
within your responsibility.

291
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:25,050
I'll go drinking
and then go back to sleep like a turkey.

292
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,480
Mom. Mom.

293
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,400
Look, Dad is smoking.

294
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,160
When did you come in?

295
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,000
Play outside.

296
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,440
Let Dad do his work.

297
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,270
Mom, don't let Dad smoke.

298
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,200
OK. I won't let Dad smoke.

299
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,420
Go and play.

300
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,310
What's wrong?

301
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,980
Is there a problem
with your experiment?

302
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,680
Why do you say that?

303
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,440
The last time you stared
at something in a daze was when

304
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,810
the nanomaterial lab was built.

305
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,810
That wasn't worth mentioning.

306
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,570
Is that so serious?

307
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,640
No.

308
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,030
I mean I was young back then.

309
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,110
When I had a problem,
I always thought it was big.

310
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,000
Now looking back, they were nothing.

311
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,270
All academic problems
are a matter of time.

312
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:40,680
Over time,
all problems can be solved.

313
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,500
Dad,
it's your turn to tell me a story today.

314
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,000
Doudou, don't disturb Dad.

315
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,350
It doesn't matter.
I happen to be free today.

316
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,240
Come.

317
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,510
Dad will tell you how
a magician outwitted a dragon.

318
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,070
Come.

319
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,850
Be a good girl.

320
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,940
Come.

321
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,030
Once upon a time,
there was a magician who had been

322
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:13,500
trying to make magic potions
and practice magic.

323
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:17,750
But one day, a dragon came.

324
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:23,070
It destroyed the magician's magic hut,
knocked over his magic potion,

325
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:28,180
(and took away the magic fruit
that the magician survived on.)

326
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,640
(The magician didn't give up.)

327
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,960
He went through countless hardships
to find the dragon's nest,

328
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,900
and declared war on it.

329
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:44,990
(He dodged the dragon's huge tail,
and extinguished the flames it spewed.)

330
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:48,270
At last, the magician
defeated the dragon

331
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,240
and took back his magic fruit.

332
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,030
Dad, you're also a magician.

333
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,830
You magically put the egg in the bottle.

334
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,880
So you are brave, too.

335
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,400
Thanks.

336
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,680
Why did the dragon fight the magician?

337
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,590
Is there any chance that
they finally became friends

338
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,500
and fought no more?

339
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:16,830
Wang Miao, your friend came to see you.

340
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:20,160
Dad, it must be the dragon.

341
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,270
Be careful.

342
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,880
Dad is a magician.

343
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,250
Dad isn't afraid.

344
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,550
Are you Wang Miao?

345
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,920
Excuse me, you can't smoke here.

346
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,980
The hallway, we can talk in the hallway.
You can't smoke there either.

347
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,680
(Please keep the hallway clean
and do not smoke)

348
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,240
Are you OK?

349
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,480
Yes.

350
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,880
I just recollected the old days.

351
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,400
I mean your health.

352
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,030
I'm fine.

353
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:00,680
Don't worry.

354
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,960
I'm not radioactive anymore.

355
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,830
Because of a tiny nuclear bomb,
they've washed me inside and outside

356
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,740
like a flour sack.

357
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,960
No sooner than you left the hospital,
you came to knock on my door.

358
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,790
Is it urgent?

359
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,920
It's urgent.

360
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,880
Come with me.

361
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,140
No, I'm busy this afternoon.

362
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,880
This afternoon,
we'll rearrange your schedule.

363
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,880
There's a car waiting downstairs.

364
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,310
Will you come or not?

365
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:29,510
I want to recall the old days, too.

366
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,830
Will you come or not?

367
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,090
Do I have a choice?

368
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,400
I read Ye Wenjie's interrogation record.

369
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,310
It said that the Trisolarans sent
two protons to the earth.

370
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,400
What are the protons?

371
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,240
What's the Trisolarans' purpose?

372
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,510
The two protons they sent
are too small to be seen.

373
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,640
But they can lock human science.

374
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,750
Just like when you fought with someone,

375
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,160
you did your utmost,
while by throwing two hairs,

376
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,200
your opponent made you stiff
and unable to move.

377
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:13,160
This information is like the countdown
and weighs heavily on our minds.

378
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,030
(Don't you feel that everyone here)

379
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:18,980
(is anxious and worried?)

380
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,110
(Even the blue whale fossil)

381
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:33,660
(seems to become rougher and yellower.)

382
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:41,460
Is that the sense of vicissitudes
you educated people always say?

383
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:47,550
It feels like human civilization
soon became aging.

384
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,740
Cut the crap.

385
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,750
It's only been a month.

386
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,160
What civilization would age so fast?

387
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,590
Wang Miao, answer me,

388
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:00,180
do you want to

389
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,570
play a game with me and all humanity?

390
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,920
Do I have a choice?

391
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,240
Good.

392
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,220
Come.

393
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:45,070
Dr. Ding and I seem to be
the only scientists here.

394
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:48,750
You were not supposed to
attend the meeting, not even me.

395
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,200
Don't you see
they are all military officers?

396
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,900
I insisted on
attending the meeting with you.

397
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,750
Why did you insist on doing this?

398
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:02,200
We can do nothing to help arrest Evans.

399
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,720
Not necessarily.

400
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,790
The first time I saw you, I thought,

401
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:10,070
perhaps, you're a good knife for murder.

402
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,880
Are you still in the mood to joke?

403
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,880
I didn't joke.

404
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,000
Probably,

405
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,880
the two of us are going to

406
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,550
take the lead, make our mark,
and stand out.

407
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:25,140
How do you like my idioms?

408
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,400
Good morning.

409
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,270
Everyone at this meeting

410
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:47,070
now has a basic understanding
of the situation.

411
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:50,030
According to our agreement,

412
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:54,480
we shared information in sync.

413
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,920
I'm sorry to tell you,

414
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:02,000
the war between alien invaders
and humanity has begun.

415
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,680
(Some may say, for now,
our opponents are still human.)

416
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,510
(After all, our descendants
won't face the Trisolarans)

417
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:17,240
(for another four and a half centuries.)

418
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,240
(Yet, in essence,
these traitors to the human race)

419
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,160
(like the ETO can also
be seen as enemies)

420
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,920
(from outside human civilization.)

421
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,940
We have never faced an enemy

422
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,000
like this.

423
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,720
So our next common objective

424
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,350
is to capture the intercepted
Trisolaran messages

425
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:43,960
stored on Judgment Day?

426
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,550
Yes.

427
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:49,440
These messages
may have great significance

428
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,820
for our survival.

429
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,950
Please look.

430
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:57,200
This is Judgment Day.

431
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,440
(We've tracked its location by satellite.)

432
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,790
(The ship is still
sailing on the Atlantic freely.)

433
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:10,200
(It has already submitted plans
to the Panama Canal Authority)

434
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,550
(to pass through the canal)

435
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,310
in four days.

436
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:17,920
This seems to be our
best opportunity to take action.

437
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,550
Perhaps, such an opportunity
will never arise again.

438
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,830
The purpose of this meeting

439
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:27,160
is to discuss possible plans
of operation,

440
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,750
and then report one to three

441
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,640
of our best suggestions to Central.

442
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,160
This operation is very difficult.

443
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,160
Because any plan

444
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,030
must guarantee one thing,

445
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:47,820
which is the secure capture
of the Trisolaran messages.

446
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,030
According to the information
from the captured ETOs,

447
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:56,740
Judgment Day was rebuilt
from an old oil tanker.

448
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,550
(But the superstructure
and the interior)

449
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,240
(have been extensively renovated)

450
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,030
(with complex structures,
rooms and passage ways.)

451
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:08,440
(And the crew having
lived on the ship for over a month)

452
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,270
(still need a map
to navigate some areas,)

453
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:15,090
(which we don't have.)

454
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,830
Right now, we don't even know

455
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:23,110
the location of the computing center
on Judgment Day,

456
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:27,550
(or whether the Trisolaran messages
are stored there,)

457
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,350
(or how many copies they have.)

458
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:32,310
(The only way to achieve our objective)

459
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:36,920
(is to completely capture
and control Judgment Day.)

460
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:41,310
The most difficult part is
preventing the enemy from erasing

461
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:44,200
Trisolaran data during our attack.

462
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,400
If they just emptied a cartridge clip
at the server hard drive,

463
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,720
(it would all be over.)

464
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,680
(It would take 10 seconds at most.)

465
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,640
So basically, we need to clear the ship,
its entire crew,

466
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,350
(find the disk or drive,)

467
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:01,400
(or which we have no idea
of its actual location)

468
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,960
(without a map, without causing)

469
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,550
(any substantial damage
or raising any alarms)

470
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,750
(all in 10 seconds.)

471
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:13,640
Do we have any spies
on Judgment Day to control or move

472
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:20,070
the storage equipment elsewhere
right before our operation?

473
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:22,140
No.

474
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:34,250
Then we have nothing more
to discuss except bullshit.

475
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,960
A ball lightning weapon
can eliminate all personnel

476
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:51,500
within an enclosed structure
without harming other equipment.

477
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,000
I don't think this is feasible.

478
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,270
We don't know if the ship has been
equipped with magnetic walls

479
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:05,700
to shield against ball lightning.

480
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:09,710
(Also, the ball lightning needs
some time to release its energy,)

481
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:14,070
(10 seconds at least, or one minute,
even longer.)

482
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:17,780
(They will have enough time to react.)

483
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,880
What about a neutron bomb?

484
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,070
Also there's a problem.

485
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:29,860
The radiation from a neutron bomb
cannot put them to death immediately.

486
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:36,030
(After the neutron bomb attack,)

487
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:40,070
(the enemy has a lot of time
for a meeting,)

488
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,110
just like us.

489
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,840
Another option is nerve gas.

490
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:49,880
But from the time of our release to the
time it'll take to get around the ship,

491
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,070
it's more time than we have,

492
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:54,420
so that doesn't meet
the general's requirements.

493
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:01,190
The only other choices are

494
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:05,300
concussion bombs or infrasonic waves.

495
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,710
I use concussion bombs,
the toys, in police work.

496
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:23,440
They can indeed stun people
inside a building into unconsciousness,

497
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,400
but they're only good for a room or two.

498
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,840
Do you have any concussion bombs
big enough to stun

499
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,110
a whole ship full of people?

500
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,070
No.

501
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:36,000
Even if we had,
such a large explosive device

502
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,030
would certainly damage
equipment inside the ship.

503
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,630
What about infrasonic weapons?

504
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:45,710
No, it's not ready yet.
We're still in testing.

505
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,880
It's not ready for field.

506
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,550
Besides, the power we will need

507
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:51,000
for a ship that size...

508
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,440
It will barely be enough to cause

509
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,630
some dizzy spews or
maybe a bit of nausea.

510
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:59,920
I told you
all we have left to discuss is bullshit.

511
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,320
But you seemed to have ignored me.

512
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,710
Can't you translate
the word "bullshit"?

513
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:08,550
The general said
time was of the essence.

514
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,630
Hurry up.

515
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,650
Say what else have you got.

516
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,920
Are we going to
let the policeman run this?

517
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,500
Are you even qualified?

518
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,900
What do you mean?

519
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,150
I'm a policeman, so what?

520
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,320
A policeman isn't qualified.

521
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,280
So are you even qualified?

522
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,590
Colonel Stanton has been one of

523
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,510
the longest standing experts
in special ops,

524
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:47,650
and he has been in every
major operations since the Vietnam War.

525
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,420
I see.

526
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,070
Fine.

527
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,630
Then let me tell you why I'm qualified.

528
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:59,880
Before I became a policeman,
I was also in the military.

529
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,400
My reconnaissance squad once
sneaked dozens of kilometers

530
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,400
behind the enemy,

531
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,440
and captured a hydroelectric station
under heavy guard.

532
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,110
We prevented the enemy's plan
to demolish the dam with explosives,

533
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:16,190
which would have flooded
the attack route for our army.

534
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,990
That's why I'm qualified.

535
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:24,170
I defeated an enemy
who once defeated you.

536
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,320
Shi, say your plan.
Don't bring up irrelevant matters.

537
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,780
I don't think we need to continue
listening to this police.

538
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:35,110
Police?

539
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:38,360
I heard that word twice.

540
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,070
What?

541
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,110
You look down upon the police,
don't you?

542
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:45,440
To drop some bombs
and turn that ship into smithereens,

543
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,880
you military are the experts.

544
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,190
But to retrieve something
out of it without damage,

545
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,960
I don't care how many stars
are on your shoulder,

546
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,260
you aren't even as good as a thief.

547
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,920
For this kind of thing,
you have to think outside the box.

548
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,920
Out of the box.

549
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,760
You will never be

550
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,090
as good at it as criminals,

551
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,000
masters of out-of-the-box thinking.

552
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,630
Criminals could steal one car
out of a moving train.

553
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,190
They reconnected the cars before and
after the stolen one so that the train

554
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,920
got all the way to its destination.

555
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,440
The only tools they used
were a length of wire cable

556
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,320
and a few steel hooks.

557
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,820
Those are the real special ops experts.

558
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,440
And as a criminal cop

559
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,590
who has been playing cat and mouse
with them for more than a decade,

560
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:37,880
I've received the best education
and training from them.

561
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,630
Enough.

562
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,360
Tell us your plan.

563
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,030
Otherwise, shut up!

564
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:45,310
General,
there are so many important people here

565
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,150
that I didn't think
it was my place to speak.

566
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,150
And I was afraid that
you would say I was rude.

567
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,480
Now I see...

568
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,840
You're already being rude!
Tell us your out-of-the-box plan.

569
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,840
OK.

570
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,190
Look.

571
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,920
The middle
of the long table is the canal.

572
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,690
The iron frames are the banks.

573
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:08,050
This is Judgment Day.

574
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,280
I cannot put up with this idiot!

575
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,280
Get out of here!

576
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,400
I'll be done soon.

577
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,320
One minute.

578
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,860
Give me one minute.

579
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,230
One more.

580
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,800
Cigar.

581
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,860
One more.

582
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:32,670
We set up two pillars
on the shores of the canal,

583
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:38,190
and then between them
we string many parallel, thin filaments.

584
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:43,460
The filaments are the nanomaterial
developed by Professor Wang, Flying Knife.

585
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,880
Flying Blade.

586
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,760
Yeah, Flying Blade.

587
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,230
Nanomaterial.

588
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:52,010
It can cut clean through iron.

589
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,030
Done.

590
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,170
That's it.

591
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,860
Professor Wang,

592
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,920
is Flying Blade really
in the form of filaments?

593
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,880
Given our current
molecular construction technique,

594
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,920
the only form we can make is a filament.

595
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,360
The thickness is about one-hundredth
the thickness of human hair.

596
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,590
Could we get enough of that in time?

597
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:50,360
That depends on the width of the canal
and the height of the ship.

598
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:54,590
The narrowest point of the canal
is 150 meters wide.

599
00:40:54,590 --> 00:41:01,500
The Judgment Day is 31 meters tall,
with a draft of eight meters or so.

600
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:07,960
There's probably enough.

601
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,000
Probably.

602
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,190
What if the equipment
holding the Trisolaran data,

603
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:17,790
the hard drives,
the optical disks, is sliced?

604
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,550
The filaments are extremely sharp,

605
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,670
and the cut surfaces
would be very smooth.

606
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:24,030
The data in those optical disks,
hard drives and storage

607
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:26,760
could probably be recovered.

608
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,730
Yeah.

609
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:33,550
Anyone got a better idea?

610
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:36,000
There's no other way.

611
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,800
Yes, all we can do is this.

612
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,010
This is our best option so far.

613
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,280
All right.

614
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,630
Then let's focus on this
and work out the details.

615
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,960
When Judgment Day passes,
can those two pillars

616
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,550
bear the force applied against
the Flying Blade filaments?

617
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:57,840
Is there any chance the pillars
could be sliced apart first?

618
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,670
Everyone, here is the thing.

619
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:02,670
The nanomaterial is thick at both ends
and thin in the middle.

620
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:05,440
We have some material
that are flat sheets.

621
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,550
We can use them to protect
the parts of the column

622
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,190
where the filaments are attached.

623
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:13,030
In addition, the filaments are too thin
to be seen with the naked eye.

624
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,840
So we need to label them
with fluorescent.

625
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,510
This way, in a special light,

626
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:20,510
we can check that
whether the filaments are straightened

627
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,980
and arranged neatly.

628
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:27,030
Judgment Day has a deep draft.

629
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:31,760
(We also need to consider
the filaments below the waterline.)

630
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,550
(It's hard to set the filaments
below the waterline.)

631
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,110
If we don't have enough time,

632
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:38,630
I don't think it will matter.
We shouldn't worry about it.

633
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:41,710
(The parts of the ship below
the waterline are used for engines,)

634
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:44,000
(fuel, and ballast.)

635
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,110
(The conditions are unsuitable)

636
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:48,840
(for computer terminals
or other similar systems.)

637
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,030
For the parts above the ship power,
above the waterline however,

638
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:53,920
(will be much better off
and more effective)

639
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,070
if we can set
a tighter nanofilament net.

640
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:02,550
And the best place to set the trap
is one of the three locks along the canal.

641
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:06,150
(Judgment Day is built to
Panamax specifications,)

642
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,030
(enough to fill the locks.)

643
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:11,320
(So we only need about 32 meters,)

644
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,960
(a small distance in between.)

645
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,440
(And it will be easier to erect
the pillars and string the filaments,)

646
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,280
(especially for the underwater parts.)

647
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,000
(The situation around the locks
is intricate.)

648
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,670
Also, when the ship moves
through the locks

649
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:27,150
(it has to need four mules, electric
locomotives on rails, to pull it forward,)

650
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:29,960
(which moves slowly.)

651
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,550
This is the time when the crew
are all on high alert.

652
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:36,030
There's a high probability that
we will be discovered during slicing.

653
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,070
(What about the Bridge of the Americas,)

654
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:40,840
right outside the Miraflores Locks?

655
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,880
(The abutments)

656
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:46,030
(of the two ends on the beach
can serve as the pillars for stringing.)

657
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:48,280
The distance between
the abutments is too wide.

658
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,480
(We will need a large amount of
Flying Blade materials.)

659
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,590
Can we even make it
in such a short time?

660
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,030
(The construction of nanomaterials)

661
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:57,230
is a very precise and complex process.

662
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:00,190
If the demand is too large,
I have to say,

663
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:02,980
I can't make it within the time limit.

664
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:08,320
Can I suggest
the narrowest part of the Gaillard Cut?

665
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,000
(It's 150 meters in cross.)

666
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,150
(Adding the slack,)

667
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:17,190
make it better
170 meters for the pillars.

668
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,000
Excuse me.

669
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,730
I need time to calculate it.

670
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:21,880
Excuse me.

671
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,000
May I use this?

672
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,130
Thanks.

673
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,920
The existing nanomaterials...
If this plan is followed,

674
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,650
the distance between the two filaments
should be at least 50 centimeters.

675
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,550
That is to say, the ship

676
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,960
has to cross the canal during the day.

677
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,360
Why exactly?

678
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,800
People on board have to sleep at night.

679
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,800
(When a person is lying down,
the gap of 50 centimeters is too much.)

680
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,710
(No matter whether he is standing,
squatting, or sitting during the day,)

681
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,780
(the distance)

682
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:31,530
is enough.

683
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,860
You are indeed a devil.
