18
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,950
Wenjie, this is an official decision.

19
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,310
From this day onwards, you'll be working
in the Monitoring Department.

20
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,480
Now I'll explain the work
of the Monitoring Department to you.

21
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,650
Simply put, the goal is to keep an eye

22
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,430
on all enemy activities in space,

23
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,310
including intercepting communications

24
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,800
between enemy space vessels and the ground,
and between the space vessels themselves,

25
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,120
track the orbits
of enemy space vessels,

26
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,030
collaborate with our telemetry
and tracking centers,

27
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,470
and provide data
for Red Coast's combat systems.

28
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,150
In other words,
the eyes of Red Coast are here.

29
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,870
Political Commissar Lei,

30
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:33,190
I think you should reconsider
whether it's necessary to tell her this.

31
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:43,360
Political Commissar Lei,
if it's too sensitive, then...

32
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,550
No, Wenjie.

33
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,590
Weining, like I said, work must be done.

34
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:57,870
She needs all the information
in order to do her job.

35
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,000
Fine.

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,560
I'll report this to the high-ups.

37
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,630
Sure.

38
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,360
You have the right to do so.

39
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,470
But I give you my word that
I'll take full responsibility for my action.

40
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,910
Alright.

41
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,030
I'll take your word for it.

42
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,190
Don't mind him.

43
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,590
That's just the way he is.

44
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,430
He can be too cautious
to be openhanded at work.

45
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,000
Wenjie, come here.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,590
Take a seat.

47
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,800
Sit.

48
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,870
Look, when we first brought you here,
the goal was simple.

49
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,680
Red Coast's monitoring system
often had interference

50
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,560
caused by electromagnetic radiation
from solar flares and sunspots.

51
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,030
Then we came across your paper

52
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,800
and believed that you were
an expert in solar activity.

53
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,470
And your predictive model
was the most accurate.

54
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,360
So we wanted to solicit your help
in solving this problem.

55
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,910
After you came,
you demonstrated strong abilities,

56
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,470
so I decided to entrust you
with more important work.

57
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,360
You've worked in Transmission
for a while

58
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,480
and gained an overview of Red Coast.

59
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,430
Now that you're transferred,

60
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,800
your assignment in Monitoring
will be discussed later.

61
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,480
Of course, as you can see,
there's some resistance.

62
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,360
But I trust you.

63
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,830
Personally, I have faith in you.

64
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:46,310
I hope you can keep up the good work
and earn the trust of the organization.

65
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,720
Wenjie, honestly,

66
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,940
I sincerely hope that someday,

67
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,810
I'll be able to call you Comrade Ye.

68
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,430
Don't let me down.

69
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,240
Even though
Political Commissar Lei trusted me,

70
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,680
my activities were severely restricted.

71
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,040
I had access to the software
source code, but not the database.

72
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,510
And I had to learn the software techniques
from scratch.

73
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,160
That was far from being easy.

74
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,160
(File Bag)
(According to the latest weather forecast,)

75
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,040
(from 8:00 AM today
to 8:00 PM tomorrow,)

76
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:25,190
(parts of the Northwest
will see light snow or sleet.)

77
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,830
(The local high will be
9 degrees Celsius.)

78
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,190
Report.

79
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,800
Come in.

80
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,600
Chief Engineer Yang,
after being deciphered by the computer,

81
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,360
what we had received turned out to be
a few satellite photographs.

82
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,390
GSD's Surveying and Mapping Bureau said

83
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,000
they're images of
our important military targets,

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,800
including the naval harbor at Qingdao
and several key factories

85
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,550
of the Third Front program.

86
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,600
Did we monitor their satellites?

87
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,920
Analysis confirmed
that these images came from the KA-9

88
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,680
Reconnaissance System of the West.

89
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,560
The first KA-9 had just been launched.

90
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,630
Although it mainly relied on recoverable
film capsules for intelligence gathering,

91
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,510
it was also being used to test out

92
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,120
the more advanced radio transmission
of digital images.

93
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,920
As the...

94
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,560
As the technology is undeveloped,
the satellite transmitted at a low frequency,

95
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,270
which increased its range of reception
sufficiently for it to be intercepted by us.

96
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,430
Abandon this target.

97
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,120
Change the frequency.

98
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,270
I'll let you know about the direction.

99
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,400
We're having a rare opportunity to learn more
about the Western satellite reconnaissance system.

100
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,040
Are you sure about letting it go?

101
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,430
How many times do I have to tell you?

102
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,720
Change the direction
and the frequency!

103
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,870
Transmission has a machine down.

104
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,950
Go and check it.

105
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,310
Yes, sir.

106
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,480
So, it was Yang Weining
who kept holding you back?

107
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,480
He was acting weird,
always lashing out at me for no reason.

108
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,310
But I didn't mind.

109
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:38,240
What mattered to me
was those unexplainable matters at work.

110
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,150
They made me realize
that Red Coast was

111
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:46,240
far more complex than I had imagined.

112
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,870
(The 299th transmission
of Red Coast Project is finished.)

113
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,840
(Shutting down transmission system.)

114
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,440
(Red Coast entering monitoring mode.)

115
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,270
(Monitoring frequency range:
1,000 MHz to 40,000 MHz.)

116
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:20,870
(Monitoring frequency range:
1,000 MHz to 40,000 MHz.)

117
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,200
(Monitoring channels: 15,000.)

118
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,240
(Monitoring channels: 15,000.)

119
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,270
(Key frequencies to monitor:
Hydrogen atom frequency at 1,420 MHz.)

120
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:37,360
(Hydroxyl radical radiation frequency
at 1,667 MHz.)

121
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,200
(Water molecule radiation frequency
at 22,000 MHz.)

122
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,440
(Repeat.)

123
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:48,480
(Key frequencies to monitor:
Hydrogen atom frequency at 1,420 MHz...)

124
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,030
The designated frequencies
for the three transmissions

125
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:57,510
were lower than microwave range
and couldn't result in

126
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,200
any heating effect in the target.

127
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,240
Both Yang Weining's strange attitude

128
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,080
and those abnormal cases
said one thing.

129
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,480
That is, the real purpose of Red Coast
was top-secret.

130
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,660
(Calling Wang Miao End Call)

131
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,060
(Chang)

132
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,510
Chang, it's me.

133
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:42,840
We're in Qijiatun.
I've checked with the village committee.

134
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,150
(Red Coast File Bag)

135
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,240
That red ginseng factory checks out.

136
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,440
The locals can get paid
by working there.

137
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,910
Where are we on declassifying the files?

138
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,360
You've promised me. I need them today.

139
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,360
I've got them.

140
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,030
What's inside
is way beyond imagination.

141
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,510
Don't keep me guessing, OK?

142
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,390
What on earth is Red Coast for?

143
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:14,390
Their research
is indeed the most confidential.

144
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:18,550
(Troubleshooting
of Magnetic Core Memory is complete.)

145
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,840
(Clear fault codes.)

146
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,240
Hello?

147
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,240
Ye Wenjie, come to my office now.

148
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,480
Yes, sir.

149
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,910
(A routine work meeting
will be held at 3:00 PM.)

150
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,270
(Please be prepared.)

151
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:39,960
(Department heads
are to attend on time.)

152
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,030
Report.

153
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,550
Come in.

154
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,910
Ye Wenjie, come here.

155
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,930
I assumed Political Commissar Lei

156
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,240
was being punished for promoting me.

157
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,120
I told myself that no matter what,

158
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,100
I couldn't drag him down
even if I had to lie.

159
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,740
(Ye Wenjie Experience)

160
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:01,950
Ye Wenjie, first, let me be clear
that I disagree with all this.

161
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,600
The decision was made
by Chief Engineer Yang

162
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,870
after seeking the high-ups' permission.

163
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,320
He alone will take all the consequences.

164
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:17,510
To better utilize your skills,
he talked to the superiors repeatedly.

165
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:23,030
Army Political Department
did their investigation, too.

166
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:26,510
Now, we've been authorized
to disclose the true nature

167
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:29,960
of the Red Coast Project to you.

168
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,480
I hope you'll treasure this opportunity
and work hard to redeem your sins.

169
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,270
From now on, you must behave
with the utmost propriety.

170
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,930
Any transgression

171
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,480
will receive the harshest punishment.

172
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,480
Understood?

173
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,320
Yes, sir.

174
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,960
It wasn't until then that I realized

175
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,480
everything Lei Zhicheng had told me
was a lie.

176
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,720
Red Coast
was neither a powerful weapon

177
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,000
nor a monitor on enemy space vessels.

178
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,790
All his care, promotion, and protection
were all an act.

179
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:30,510
That's why Yang Weining
tried to stop him.

180
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:40,080
Yang Weining was a good man.

181
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,960
When the leaders
doubted me for my background,

182
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,120
he stood up for me.

183
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,340
And it was also he

184
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:57,790
who told me the truth about Red Coast.

185
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,030
If you want to quit,
it's not too late now.

186
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,960
I'll do it.

187
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Are you sure?

188
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,720
Once you said yes, the last ray of hope
of leaving Radar Peak would be gone.

189
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:31,480
You'd spend the rest of your life here.

190
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,150
Yes, I'll do it.

191
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:58,120
The truth was an incredible fairy tale
for the ages.

192
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,000
It's a lot.

193
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,840
Read it yourself.

194
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:44,580
(A Question Largely Ignored by Trends
in Fundamental World Scientific Research)

195
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,820
(Space Science and Technology)

196
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,960
This file talks about
two ways to convert the results

197
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,160
of fundamental scientific research
into practical applications:

198
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,480
gradualistic mode and saltatory mode.

199
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,750
That's right.

200
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,510
Gradualistic mode refers to
theoretical, fundamental results

201
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,400
being gradually applied to technology

202
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,960
such as the development and application
of space technology.

203
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,160
Saltatory mode means
theoretical, fundamental results

204
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,830
rapidly become applied technology,

205
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,680
(Nuclear Weapons)
leading to a technological leap.

206
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,920
Examples include nuclear weapons.

207
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,240
Yes.

208
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,110
Now, both NATO and the Warsaw Pact

209
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,000
are intensely active
in fundamental research

210
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,070
and investing heavily in it.

211
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,920
At this rate,
technological leaps may occur anytime.

212
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,680
That will pose a major threat
to our strategic planning.

213
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,590
Here it lists the fields
where such leaps are most likely:

214
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:03,220
physics, biology, computer science.

215
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,740
(SETI)

216
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,590
The Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

217
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,830
If a leap occurs in this field,

218
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:34,790
its impact will exceed the sum of that
in the other three.

219
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,790
That's what I'm talking about.

220
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:43,410
Several NATO states
have already prioritized SETI.

221
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:47,350
For example,
they launched Project Ozma

222
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,750
(Green Bank Telescope at NRAO)
and built NRAO.

223
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,920
(Concise Star Chart)
The project examined the stars

224
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:57,960
Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani
and planned to broaden

225
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,750
the frequency range in 1972.

226
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,510
The Pioneer 10 and 11 probes
would be launched,

227
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,350
each carrying a metal plaque

228
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,270
with information about
civilization on Earth.

229
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:11,400
And in 1977, they'd launch
the Voyager 1 and 2 probes,

230
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,590
each with a metal audio record.

231
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,510
This is the Arecibo Observatory.

232
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,350
It's ready to use
and extremely powerful.

233
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,680
Its effective energy collection area
is about 20 acres,

234
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,960
greater than that of all the others
in the world combined.

235
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,830
Together with the computer system,

236
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,270
it can simultaneously monitor
65,000 channels,

237
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,720
and it's capable of
ultrahigh energy transmissions.

238
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,510
Look.

239
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,440
This is in Europe.

240
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,750
They've also made huge investments.

241
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,720
The entire world is working on SETI.

242
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
That's true.

243
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,310
Except for us
who are paying little attention to it.

244
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:02,350
You should know, if any country
gets in touch with extraterrestrials,

245
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:07,440
it'll overturn the global landscape,
especially those superpowers.

246
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,350
If they beat us to it,
we'll no longer have a chance.

247
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,880
As a major socialist power,
we cannot fall behind.

248
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,550
This unknown area must be conquered
for strategic importance.

249
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,160
There's a long way ahead of us.

250
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,110
Ye Wenjie, from this moment on,

251
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,440
your job is to develop the Red Coast
Self-Interpreting Code System.

252
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,240
Precisely,
using universal, basic mathematical,

253
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,310
and physical laws to construct
an elemental linguistic code

254
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:47,110
that can be understood by any civilization
that has mastered basic algebra,

255
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:51,160
Euclidean geometry,
and the laws of nonrelativistic physics.

256
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,440
Building on that,
create a brand-new linguistic system

257
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,000
including Chinese and Esperanto.

258
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,400
Do you get it?

259
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,160
Yes, sir.

260
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,830
So, the mysterious Red Coast Project
was established for SETI,

261
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:20,510
and you alone created the Red Coast
Self-Interpreting Code System.

262
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,030
At that time,
the Cold War was at its height.

263
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:31,440
The insanity of the human race
had reached its historical zenith.

264
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,030
Nuclear submarines and nuclear weapons
lurking in the corners

265
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:40,440
could be launched at a moment's notice.

266
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,480
Once they were let go,
hundreds of cities would be leveled,

267
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,400
killing hundreds of millions of people.

268
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,880
With such technical leaps in sight,

269
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:57,480
an intense sense of crisis
was shared all over the world.

270
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,720
Professor Ye, you're an astrophysicist.

271
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,070
Do you really think astronomy
will be taking a technological leap?

272
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:11,690
As destructive as nukes are, the universe

273
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,400
is harboring even more terrible forces

274
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,200
such as black holes and anti-matter.

275
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,720
Compared with them, a nuclear bomb

276
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,550
is nothing but a tiny candle.

277
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:34,440
There used to be a waveform monitor.

278
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:40,960
It was to display the waves
that Red Coast picked up from space.

279
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,920
My daily work was to

280
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:48,070
monitor and record that curve,

281
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:54,830
waiting to hear from
the extraterrestrials.

282
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:09,260
Over there, we had a radio receiver,

283
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:12,020
quite sophisticated.

284
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,720
A ruby-based traveling-wave maser
amplified the signals received by

285
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,550
the gigantic antenna.

286
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,680
But there was interference.

287
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,920
Wouldn't it affect the accuracy?

288
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:34,510
Wang, you're underestimating Red Coast.

289
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:39,210
As immature as the technology was,

290
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,610
it could do more than you think.

291
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,640
The core of the reception system

292
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,640
was immersed in
liquid helium at -269 degrees Celsius.

293
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:58,030
A helicopter came to resupply
liquid helium regularly.

294
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:02,180
The reception system was thus

295
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:06,290
capable of picking up faint signals.

296
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:11,400
Back then,
our monitoring range was

297
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:17,510
within a radius of 1,000 light years,
containing some 20 million stars.

298
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:22,830
Other than searching for and monitoring
possible extraterrestrial intelligence,

299
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,750
we also tried to

300
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:28,310
(20 Million Stars)
send messages to the universe

301
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:33,880
to establish contact and communication.

302
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:40,720
So did you really make such attempts?

303
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,290
We did.

307
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,400
Ye Wenjie and I
have redrafted the letter.

308
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:20,270
Ye Wenjie, read it.

309
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,180
(PLA Letter Paper)

310
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:36,440
"We extend our best wishes to you,
inhabitants of another world.

311
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,750
After reading the following message,

312
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:43,640
you should have a basic understanding
of civilization on Earth.

313
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,750
By dint of long toil and creativity,
the human race

314
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:51,540
has built a splendid civilization,
blossoming with diverse cultures.

315
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:57,270
We're also getting to know the laws of nature
and the development of human societies.

316
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,640
We cherish all that we've accomplished.

317
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,750
But our world is still flawed.

Hate exists, as do prejudice and war.

319
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,480
Contradictive productive forces
and relations

320
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,160
are causing extremely
uneven distribution of wealth.

321
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:19,030
And large portions of humanity
are living in poverty and misery.

322
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:23,790
Human societies are working hard
to resolve the difficulties they face,

323
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:27,590
striving to create a better future
for Earth civilization.

324
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:33,400
The country that sent this message
is also engaged in this effort.

325

We are dedicated to
building an ideal society

326
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:41,720
where the labor and value of every human
are fully respected,

327
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:47,310
and everyone's material
and spiritual needs are fully met

328

so that civilization on Earth
may become more perfect.

329

With the best of intentions,
we look forward to establishing contact

330
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,750
with other civilized societies
in the universe.

331
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,370
We look forward to working with you

332
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:05,490
to build a better life in this vast universe."

333
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:11,900
This letter of humans' best wishes
was sent to the universe.

334
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:18,400
Enclosed was an overview of Earth,

335
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:21,310
life on Earth,

336
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:27,270
and human society
as well as basic world history.

337
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:33,310
All that was sent after transmitting
the Self-interpreting Code System.

338
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,200
Red Coast is a great project, no doubt.

339
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,580
When sending messages to the universe,

340
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,960
how did you ensure our security?

341
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:54,200
It was carefully vetted
to ensure that it didn't give away

342
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,720
the Earth's coordinates
relative to the Milky Way.

343
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:06,350
At the 2,280 MHz, 12,000 MHz,
and 22,000 MHz channels,

344
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:11,160
the transmission times
of the message were

345
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:16,440
31 minutes, 7.5 minutes,
and 3.5 minutes respectively.

346
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,070
Transmission at the higher-frequency
12,000 MHz

347
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:24,060
and 22,000 MHz channels was minimized

348
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:27,610
in case our location was exposed.

349
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:34,380
Back in those days, SETI at Red Coast

350
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,620
was marginalized research.

351
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,750
But why such a high security rating?

352
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:48,720
They asked the same question
at the very beginning of the Project

353
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,830
and it was asked until the very end.

354
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,310
But now,
you should have the answer.

355
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,910
We can only marvel at the foresight

356
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:07,300
of the top decision-maker of the Project.

357
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,390
Had Red Coast succeeded,

358
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,240
the world would be utterly different.

359
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:24,880
Well, it's still too soon to tell
whether it succeeded or not.

360
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,470
The radio waves sent out

361
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,760
haven't gone too far in the universe yet.

362
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,110
The farther the signals travel,
the weaker they become,

363
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:43,090
and the less likely that any extraterrestrial
civilization will receive them.

364
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:50,790
In order for extraterrestrials to detect
our signals,

365
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:56,790
we broadcast at a power level equal to
the energy output of a mid-sized star.

366
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:00,200
Soviet astrophysicist
Nicolai Kardashev once proposed

367
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,000
that we could divide civilizations

368
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,830
based on the power they could command
for communication purposes,

369
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,790
He divided them into three types:

370
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:13,640
A Type I civilization
can muster an amount of energy equal to

371
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,960
the total output of the Earth.

372
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,310
A Type II civilization
can marshal the energy equal to

373
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:23,070
the output of a typical star.

374
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:26,200
A Type III civilization
can utilize its communication energy

375
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,110
equal to the energy output of a galaxy.

376
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:35,480
Civilization on Earth is currently
not even a full Type I.

377
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,310
And the transmissions from Red Coast
used only about one ten-thousandth

378
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:43,030
of the power the Earth could muster.

379
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,510
Our call wasn't any louder

380
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:51,310
than the buzzing of a mosquito.

381
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,680
No one could hear it.

382
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,640
But the Type II and III civilizations
Kardashev proposed do exist,

383
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,950
we should be able to hear them by now.

384
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:08,400
In this case, our efforts seem to
have only proven one thing

385
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:14,920
that in the vast universe,
only the Earth has intelligent life.

386
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:25,240
Theoretically, there might never be
a definitive answer to that question.

387
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:30,700
But emotionally, I and everyone else

388
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,480
who went through Red Coast all believed so.

389
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,960
Too bad the Project was decommissioned.

390
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,400
It was there already
and should've kept going.

391
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:51,310
It was a great cause worth fighting for.

392
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:56,180
In the late 70s,

393
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,340
there was a large-scale renovation.

394
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,350
The transmission system was automated.

395
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:27,510
Data processing of monitoring
became far more advanced.

396
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:31,550
40,000 channels
could be monitored simultaneously.

397
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:35,730
The more people knew, the clearer they became

398
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,790
about the difficulty of SETI.

399
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:45,350
And the leadership
lost interest in Red Coast.

400
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,550
After the renovation,

401
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:53,680
the first change we experienced
was lowered security rating.

402
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:58,750
The security detail was reduced to
a group of five guards.

403
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,480
Salute!

404
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:05,830
Red Coast remained within
the Second Artillery Corps,

405
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,790
but management
of its scientific activities

406
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:11,240
was turned over to the Astronomy Institute
of Chinese Academy of Sciences.

407
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:17,960
and it took on some research projects
that had nothing to do with SETI.

408
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,830
I believe you achieved
most of your accomplishments then.

409
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:33,070
At the time,
we had China's largest radio telescope.

410
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:38,550
Following all those changes, we first took on
some radio astronomy projects.

411
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:43,640
Later, more and more
such observatories were built,

412
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,680
and Red Coast shifted to the observation and

413
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,720
analysis of solar electromagnetic activity

414
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,350
with an added solar telescope.

415
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:58,720
I bet practical applications were a ton.

416
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,270
Correct.

417
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:04,640
The mathematical model we built
for solar electromagnetic activity

418
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,670
was state-of-the-art.

419
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:12,550
With such fruition,
the large investment in Red Coast

420
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,670
saw a little bit of return.

421
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:22,110
Actually, much of the credit
should go to Political Commissar Lei,

422
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:26,480
although he did have his own agenda, too.

423
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,390
Political Commissar Lei?

424
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:33,360
Wasn't he a political officer
in that technical unit?

425
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,710
Before enlisting,
he had studied astrophysics as well.

426
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:44,880
Research projects we took on
outside of SETI were all due to his efforts.

427
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:54,590
It wasn't easy
to return to technical work.

428
00:34:54,590 --> 00:35:01,110
Without Lei,
Red Coast would've been long gone.

429
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:04,790
When it was converted for civil use,

430
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,840
the military basically abandoned it.

431
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:14,150
Chinese Academy of Sciences
could no longer keep the base running.

432
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:20,630
Inevitably, it was shut down.

433
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:04,830
In the dead of the night, when I was alone

434
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,510
in the empty monitoring room,

435
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:10,030
I could hear in my headphones

436
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:15,070
the lifeless noise of the universe.

437
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:19,360
It was faint but continuous,

438
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,640
more eternal than the stars.

439
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:30,200
Sometimes I thought it sounded like

440
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:36,000
the endless cold winds of Radar Peak.

441
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,630
I was chilled to the bone.

442
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,610
There weren't enough words

443
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,960
to describe such loneliness.

444
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:55,630
SETI is quite a unique discipline.

445
00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:01,330
It can shape researchers' perspectives
on life.

446
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:07,920
It occurred to me repeatedly
that life was truly an accident

447
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,280
among all the accidents in the universe.

448
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,900
And the universe was an empty palace

449
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:27,090
in which humankind was the only ant.

450
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:58,790
This kind of thinking made me live
a conflicted life since.

451
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:04,950
Sometimes I thought life was precious

452
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,650
and more important than anything.

453
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:13,030
But other times,

454
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:19,760
I found humans so insignificant
that nothing was worthwhile.

455
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,030
Anyway, despite such internal conflicts,

456
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:27,080
my life slipped away,

457
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:34,070
and before I knew it,
I was already old.

458
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:48,920
I'm not getting any younger
or healthier.

459
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,320
I can't predict the future.

460
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:58,800
All I can do is live my life as it is.
