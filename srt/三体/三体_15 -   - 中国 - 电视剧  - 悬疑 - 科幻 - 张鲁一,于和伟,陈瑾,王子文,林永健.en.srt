of the BOCOG,)

(applying for purchasing over 4.9 million
opening ceremony tickets.)

12
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:56,150
You were reading this book last night.
Now you're reading it again.

13
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,640
Is it relevant to your research?

14
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,920
Some problems have to be
solved sooner or later.

15
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,430
Doudou,
wash your hands and have breakfast.

16
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,040
OK.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,400
Dad, I have a question for you.

18
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,750
There's a 700-meter-long road
with a lamp every 10 meters.

19
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,190
There will be wastage
as long as the lamps are on.

20
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,030
15 lamps will be busted every hour.

21
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,870
An electrician comes once an hour
to repair three lamps.

22
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:29,080
Do you know how many lamps are busted
from 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM?

23
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,800
They are all busted.

24
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,430
Wrong.

25
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,000
Why is it wrong?

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,470
If 12 lamps are busted in one hour,
they will all be busted in six hours.

27
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,840
How many hours are there
from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM?

28
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,520
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

29
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,240
Eight hours.

30
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,470
So, they are all broken.

31
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,490
No, no.

32
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,870
Then you tell me how many
of them are broken?

33
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,800
It's daytime from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM.

34
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,310
No lamp is on. Dad, you're silly.

35
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,190
You tricked me.

36
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,840
I didn't.

37
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,360
I got you.

38
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,030
Of course you tricked me.

39
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,120
Dad thought it was
a serious math problem,

40
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,030
not expecting it to be a brain teaser.

41
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:17,750
I told you the answer,
but you didn't realize.

42
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,430
Dad, what's wrong?

43
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,150
Doudou, you are right.

44
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,120
In the seemingly complex problem,

45
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,630
all the important information
is hidden there.

46
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,190
Dad is really silly.

47
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,750
Dad should have
thought of something early.

48
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,840
What's the thing?

49
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,630
Doudou, do you know Copernicus?

50
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,430
Yes.

51
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,220
He was a scientist
who proposed Heliocentrism.

52
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,960
Copernicus was the man
who reminded people of the daytime

53
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:08,280
when they were busy calculating
how many lamps there were broken.

54
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,520
That's what I was doing!
I'm Copernicus!

55
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,750
Dad should learn from you

56
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,150
and be another Copernicus.

57
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,940
(Hairen)

58
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,500
(Copernicus)

59
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,680
You're late.

60
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,430
The meeting has been going on
for a while.

61
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,950
I'm Pope Gregory.

62
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,270
Pope Gregory?

63
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,720
So it's the Middle Ages in Europe?

64
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:18,310
In the world of Three-Body,
historical references are anachronistic.

65
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:26,160
Dear Copernicus, you changed your ID,
but we all recognize you.

66
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,480
In the previous civilizations,
you traveled to the East.

67
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,070
I'm Aristotle.

68
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,560
This is Galileo.

69
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,660
I understand the world
through observation and experiment.

70
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,830
Mozi also conducted
experiments and observation.

71
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,190
Mozi, Mozi.

72
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,950
He was only a
mystic dressed as a scientist.

73
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:54,000
Mozi advanced Civilization No. 141
into the Eastern Han period with his machine.

74
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,830
So what?

75
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,870
We're different from him.

76
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,830
Based on large amounts of
observation and experiments,

77
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,870
we make strict, logical deductions
to build a model of the universe.

78
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:11,510
Then we go back to experimentation
and observation to test it.

79
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,870
Dear Galileo,
that's also my way of thinking.

80
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,830
In that case, show me your calendar.

81
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,750
Pope, I don't have a calendar.

82
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,950
I only have a model of the universe
built upon observation data.

83
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:30,510
But I must make it clear that
even if the model is correct,

84
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:36,830
it may not precisely predict
the sun's motion and create a calendar.

85
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:42,310
However, in any case,
it's a necessary step.

86
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,870
Go ahead.

87
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,480
It's pretty simple.

88
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,360
The reason why the sun's motion
seems patternless

89
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,070
is because our world
has three suns.

90
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,950
Under interaction, their movements are unpredictable.
It's the three-body problem.

91
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,000
When our planet
revolves around one of the suns

92
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,120
in a stable orbit, that's a Stable Era.

93
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,870
When one or more of the other suns
move within a certain distance,

94
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,000
their gravitational pull will snatch the planet away
from the sun it's orbiting,

95
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,270
causing it to wander unstably through
the gravitational fields of the three suns.

96
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,480
That's a Chaotic Era.

97
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,720
After an uncertain amount of time,
our planet is once again

98
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,830
pulled into a temporary orbit
and another Stable Era begins.

99
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,920
This is like a football game.

100
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,720
The players are the three suns,
and our planet is the football.

101
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,550
Burn him to death.

102
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,120
At least let me finish!

103
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,870
Have you seen three suns?

104
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,270
Or do you know anyone who has?

105
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,240
Everyone has seen them.

106
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,270
The sun that we see
at different times may not be the same.

107
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,080
It's only one of the three suns.

108
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,080
And the other two are the flying stars.

109
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,550
Flying stars?

110
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,000
Flying stars are stars with unstable cycles
of revolution and rotation.

111
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,720
When the sun is far enough,
it looks like a flying star.

112
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,200
You lack basic scientific training.

113
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,030
The sun must move continuously
to a distant spot.

114
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,000
It cannot jump over
the intervening space.

115
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,240
According to your hypothesis,
there should be another situation.

116
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,390
The sun gets smaller
than it usually appears

117
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,390
but bigger than a flying star,

118
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:35,360
and gradually shrinks into a flying star
as it moves farther away.

119
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,600
But we've never seen the sun
behave that way.

120
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,750
Galileo, if you have scientific training,

121
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,670
you ought to have
some knowledge of the sun's structure.

122
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,360
The sun is made of a sparse
but expansive gaseous outer layer

123
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,550
and a dense and hot inner core!

124
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,390
Very true.

125
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,390
But Galileo,
you apparently haven't discovered

126
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,670
the special optical interaction
between the sun's gaseous outer layer

127
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,080
and our planet's atmosphere.

128
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,150
Go on.

129
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,390
It's a phenomenon akin to polarization.

130
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,840
When the sun gets
a certain distance from us

131
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,720
and we view it from within
our atmosphere,

132
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,960
the gaseous outer layer
becomes transparent and invisible.

133
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,120
The sun we see is its bright inner core.

134
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,080
But we mistake it for a flying star.

135
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,270
This phenomenon has confused
every researcher throughout history.

136
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:26,030
But now we understand
why the appearance of three flying stars

137
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,480
heralds a long period of extreme cold.

138
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,550
Because at that time,
all three suns are far, far, far, far away.

139
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,030
But based on your theory,

140
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:43,510
we should also sometimes
see three normal-sized suns.

141
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:47,600
This has never happened.

142
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,870
In all the records of all the
civilizations, this has never occurred!

143
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,910
Wait!

144
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,360
There may be such historical records.

145
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,030
One civilization saw two suns
and was immediately destroyed

146
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:10,600
by their combined heat,
but the record was very vague.

147
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,960
I'm Leonardo da Vinci.

148
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:19,390
He was talking about three suns,
not two, you fool!

149
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,720
Don't touch me.

150
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,870
Pope, according to his theory,
three suns must appear sometime,

151
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,910
just like three flying stars.

152
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,240
Three suns have appeared.

153
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,390
And many people have seen them.

154
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,960
But any information about them
couldn't be recorded.

155
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,390
Because those who
saw such a great sight

156
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,480
had at most a few seconds left to live.

157
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,750
They had no chance to escape or survive.

158
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:55,440
Tri-solar days are the most
terrifying catastrophes for the world.

159
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,550
On such days, the surface of the planet

160
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,240
would turn into a smelting furnace
in a second,

161
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,960
and the heat would melt all rocks.

162
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,080
After the destruction
caused by a tri-solar day,

163
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,270
an eon would pass before the reappearance
of life and civilization.

164
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,000
This is why
there's no historical record.

165
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,720
Burn him.

166
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,550
Who is this person?

167
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,720
Giordano Bruno.

168
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,390
He believed that
the universe has no center.

169
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,670
The earth is just a planet
orbiting the sun

170
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:34,840
and the sun is only one of
countless stars in the universe.

171
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,030
So you believe that he's wrong?

172
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,150
Do you really think you're right?

173
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,270
Use a low fire.

174
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,790
What are you doing?

175
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,030
Let go!

176
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,870
Let go of me!

177
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,720
What are you doing?

178
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,150
Pope, you are only a program!

179
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:53,960
As for the rest of you,
you're either programs or idiots.

180
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,320
You just can't accept things
beyond your cognition!

181
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,670
You can't accept them
even in a game!

182
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,120
I will log back on!

183
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,840
You cannot return.

184
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,960
You will disappear forever
from the world of Three-Body.

185
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,840
I'll switch computers and create a new ID.

186
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,840
I'll announce myself when I'm back.

187
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,360
It won't work.

188
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,480
The system has recorded
your retinal scan through the V-suit.

189
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,200
Let me go!

190
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,360
I'm telling the truth!

191
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,510
Let go!

192
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:31,030
If you're telling the truth,
you won't be burnt to death.

193
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:35,750
The game rewards those
who are on the right path.

194
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,390
What are you doing?

195
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,200
You can't do this!

196
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,390
The world has ended!

197
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,150
The world has ended!

198
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,120
Dehydrate!

199
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,390
Dehydrate!

200
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,550
Everyone, go to the dehydratories!

201
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,390
Get ready to dehydrate!

202
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,670
(Civilization No. 183
was destroyed by a tri-solar day.)

203
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,270
(This civilization had advanced
to the Middle Ages.)

204
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:41,000
(After a long time, life and civilization
will begin again,)

205
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,480
(and progress once more through
the unpredictable world of Three-Body.)

206
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,150
(But in this civilization,)

207
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:50,720
(Copernicus successfully revealed
the basic structure of the universe.)

208
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,600
(The civilization of Three-Body
will take its first leap.)

209
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,720
(The game has now
entered the second level.)

210
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,120
(We invite you to log on
to the second level of Three-Body.)

211
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,030
The second level?

212
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,840
How did you make it?

213
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,720
I revealed the basic structure
of the universe in the game.

214
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
What basic...

215
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,550
What of the universe?

216
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:17,720
It's like he found out that the earth is
round and told people about gravitation.

217
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,030
Then what did you find out?

218
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,720
What is the name of this game?

219
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,910
Three-Body.

220
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,670
Yeah.

221
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,080
The answer is in the name.

222
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,510
We've been distracted by
complicated semblances before,

223
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,670
and have neglected the most
important information.

224
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,480
The name?

225
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,000
How can we get the answer
from the name?

226
00:15:54,840 --> 00:16:00,360
In the world of Three-Body,
there are three suns.

227
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,360
A sun is a flying star.

228
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,390
When it's close enough to us,
it looks like the sun.

229
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:15,120
When it's far enough from us,
it looks like a flying star.

230
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,360
The sun that we see at different times
may not be the same.

231
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,910
It's only one of the three suns.

232
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,600
I know a bit about this.

233
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,150
All the stars are the suns.

234
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,390
Fixed stars.

235
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,870
They are stars
when they are far away, right?

236
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,200
Shen Yufei wanted you to
know the world of the farmer.

237
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,910
Then farmer lives in a world
where the stars are close...

238
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,360
Where the three suns...

239
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,550
Where the three stars become suns...

240
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,440
I don't think so.

241
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,240
The civilizations of Three-Body
were destroyed again and again.

242
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,240
How could it achieve a
scientific and technological level

243
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,440
that exceeds the cognition of humans?

244
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,480
Indeed.

245
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,360
It will be impressive if they've developed
in such an environment.

246
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,200
You're right.

247
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,510
What is right?

248
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,270
You should clear the game at one fling.

249
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,360
What are you guys doing?

250
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,150
Why haven't you cleared the game?

251
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,080
Flying stars are the breakthrough

252
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,920
for Wang Miao to reveal the structure
of the universe in the game.

253
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,590
He only obtained the information
after being prompted by Ye Wenjie

254
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:11,880
and reading the paper and the book.

255
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,110
Now I have to believe that
Ye Wenjie is very suspicious.

256
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,400
Didn't you believe that before?

257
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,270
No.

258
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,030
Our previous inference lacked
effective support.

259
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,310
The textbook cliché.

260
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,070
Do you think all evidence
will be presented under your nose?

261
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,920
Use your imagination.

262
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,960
Don't scientists always say
to assume boldly and demonstrate carefully?

263
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,310
See?

264
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,750
It's time for demonstration.

265
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,440
Don't you like stewed assorted giblets?

266
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,830
None of the ten of us likes it.

267
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,000
I only bought one order.

268
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,680
It's nothing compared to
the appetite of ten people.

269
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,200
Have some.

270
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,750
You keep talking about
treating me to a big meal.

271
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,640
Seriously?

272
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
Don't be picky.

273
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,790
Isn't it a big meal?

274
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,070
Wait, wait.
What about the thing I asked you to do?

275
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,070
Ye Wenjie.

276
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,270
Declassify her files.

277
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,510
Is it done?

278
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,750
Almost. Almost.

279
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,640
Can you stop asking?

280
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,030
Is it so difficult?

281
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,880
I've told you many times
that Ye Wenjie is very important.

282
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,880
You've told me your assumptions
many, many times.

283
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,640
Tell him once more.

284
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,550
Wang Miao got to the second level
in the game.

285
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,030
The reason why he made it
is because he revealed

286
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,510
the basic structure of the universe.

287
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:56,440
His finding benefited from a paper
many years ago written by Ye Wenjie.

288
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,880
Chang, you must help me
to declassify the files.

289
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,000
Can I eat now?

290
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,680
Help yourself.

291
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,680
You haven't changed at all.

292
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,640
Everyone, thanks for
attending today's event.

293
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,660
See you next time.

294
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:24,620
(Frontiers of Science)

295
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,550
As far as I know, the theory of the shooter
and the farmer

296
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,160
isn't new in the scientific circle.

297
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,510
Yes.

298
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,920
We have discussed
this question countless times.

299
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,750
So is such introduction
some kind of a ritual?

300
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:53,270
Take it as a ritual for the unlimited
exploration of the Frontiers of Science.

301
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,310
Don't you think it's religious?

302
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,240
It's against science.

303
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:03,000
You are very sharp and observant,
but it has nothing to do with religion.

304
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,350
So mankind is really like
two-dimensional creatures?

305
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,350
The scientific worldview
is to remain skeptical,

306
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,070
just as you media workers do.

307
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:20,000
But in fact, I don't think
you are very interested in science itself.

308
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,400
You're right.

309
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,110
I'm more interested
in people's views on such things.

310
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,310
What's the purpose of
the Frontiers of Science?

311
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:43,590
About that, you can ask Pan Han.

312
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:50,440
I think that Mr. Pan hasn't attended
your events for a long time.

313
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,640
You seem to not know him that well.

314
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,240
He'll tell you if you ask him.

315
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,720
Though we have different views
and act differently,

316
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,790
the Frontiers of Science is open.

317
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,350
You are welcome to visit anytime.

318
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,000
You have different views?

319
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,030
How come?

320
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,480
You ask too many questions.

321
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,350
Before this question, you need to find
the answer of the previous one.

322
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:31,070
Wang Miao.

323
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,510
Wang Miao.

324
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,640
What are you thinking about?

325
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,000
Are you dreaming away?

326
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,750
You should spend more time
with your daughter.

327
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,070
Doudou.

328
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,920
Doudou.

329
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,880
Come.

330
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,790
Have some water.

331
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,750
Be careful.

332
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,550
Shameless!

333
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,640
Wretch!

334
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,070
He dared to claim that
he invented calculus!

335
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,240
Isaac Newton.

336
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,920
Then the one who ran away
must be Leibniz?

337
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,960
Indeed.

338
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,590
I don't really care about
this little claim to fame.

339
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,200
Inventing the three laws of mechanics
has already made me the greatest,

340
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,200
God excepted.

341
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,110
Yes.

342
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,310
That’s really great.

343
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:45,310
From planetary motion to cell division,
everything follows the three great laws.

344
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:50,030
Now, with calculus,
the powerful mathematical tool,

345
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:54,070
it will only be a matter of time
before we master the pattern

346
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,510
of the motion of the three suns.

347
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,240
It's not that simple.

348
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,200
Have you considered
the amount of calculation?

349
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,160
I saw the differential equations
you listed,

350
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,650
and I don't think an analytical solution
is possible, only a numerical one.

351
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,680
It requires such
calculating capacity that

352
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,750
even if the world's mathematicians
worked nonstop,

353
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,400
they couldn't complete them
at the end of the world.

354
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,160
Of course,
if we can't figure out the pattern

355
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:24,720
of the suns' movements soon,
the end of the world won't be far away.

356
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,400
Von Neumann.

357
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,270
Indeed.

358
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,310
You're the only one
who can solve the problem.

359
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,200
Exactly.

360
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,480
Didn't you bring us
thousands of miles to the East

361
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,510
to solve the problem
of calculating these equations?

362
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:40,440
Leibniz, the degenerate,
also came with us.

363
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,480
But I don't understand.

364
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,310
Why you had to come to the East
to build a computer?

365
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,830
A computer?

366
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,550
A computing machine?

367
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,750
Does such a thing exist?

368
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,830
You don't know about computers?

369
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:56,680
You're the father of computer!

370
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:00,160
Right, it's reasonable in the game.

371
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,270
Then, what do you intend to use to

372
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,270
complete the vast amount
of calculations?

373
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,550
Use what?

374
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,590
Use people, of course.

375
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:13,830
Other than people, what else in the world
is capable of performing calculations?

376
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:17,310
No, no, you just said that
all the mathematicians in the world

377
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,110
wouldn't be enough.

378
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:23,110
Instead of mathematicians,
we'll use common people.

379
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:29,750
Common laborers, but in a large number,
at least 30 million.

380
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,270
We'll do mathematics
using human wave tactics.

381
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:36,270
Or we didn't have to come to the East.

382
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,640
Common laborers?

383
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,030
30 million?

384
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,750
You mean 30 million people
who understand calculus?

385
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:45,720
Have you heard the joke about
the Army of Sichuan?

386
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,030
Some soldiers were being drilled,
but without education,

387
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:53,510
they couldn't follow the orders
to march LEFT-RIGHT-LEFT.

388
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,240
So the instructor
came up with a solution.

389
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,480
He had every soldier wear
a straw shoe on the left foot

390
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,440
and a cloth shoe on the right.

391
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:08,270
When they marched, he shouted,
STRAW-CLOTH-STRAW-CLOTH, STRAW-CLOTH...

392
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,680
I never thought that you knew
so much about the East

393
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,720
and could speak so many dialects.

394
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,510
It doesn't matter.

395
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:20,000
The point is that's the kind
of soldier we need.

396
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,160
Except we need 30 million of them.

397
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,680
But where can we find such a large army?

398
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:31,160
So we need
Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor.

399
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,510
Qin Shi Huang?

400
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:36,270
He's now in charge here?

401
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:42,300
♪Roc in the sky♪

402
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:48,790

403

Rise.

404
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,830
Kowtow.

405
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,440
If you want me to gather
30 million men for you

406
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,440
to use the three laws of motion
and calculus

407
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,310
to forecast the movements of the suns,
you must at least demonstrate

408
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:12,200
how such calculations
would be conducted.

409
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,720
Your Majesty,
please give me three soldiers.

410
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,310
I will demonstrate.

411
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,720
Three?

412
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,550
Your Imperial Majesty,

413
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:26,960
the complicated objects of the universe
are made from the simplest elements.

414
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,480
I only need three.

415
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:40,270
To the court!

416
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,270
The two of you will be
responsible for signal input.

417
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,750
I'll call you "Input 1" and "Input 2".

418
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:52,110
You'll be responsible for signal output,
and you're "Output".

419
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:52,680
Like this.

420
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,550
Form a triangle.

421
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,200
Output is the apex.

422
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,270
Input 1 and Input 2 form the base.

423
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,110
Stand in the Wedge Attack Formation.

424
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,400
You should command soldiers
with professional orders.

425
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,970
Your Majesty, you're wise.

426
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,960
Here.

427
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,440
Red represents 0; white represents 1.

428
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,960
Good. Now, listen to me.

429
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,270
Output, you turn around and look at
Input 1 and Input 2.

430
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,480
If they both raise white lanterns,
you raise the white lantern as well.

431
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,000
Under other circumstances,
you raise the red lantern.

432
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,640
There are three such circumstances,
Input 1, red; Input 2, white.

433
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,350
Both red.

434
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,720
Input 1, white; Input 2, red.

435
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,680
Are you clear?

436
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:56,920
I think you should use some other color.

437
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,240
White means bad luck.

438
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,400
But they stand out.

439
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,310
Let's try.

440
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:05,590
Input 1, raise the white lantern.

441
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:15,270
♪Roc in the sky♪

442
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:20,330

00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:36,180

00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:41,340

♪Wipe out the six countries;

447
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,920
Your Majesty,
your army is truly matchless.

448
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:20,240
In such a short time,
we have completed such complex training.

449
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,590
Now I can understand
why Von Neumann said that

450
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,270
with only two or three soldiers,

451
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:27,510
he could build a gate component
of a computing system.

452
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,160
It's very simple.

453
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,640
Any common soldier
can master the skills after training.

454
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,070
Don't they need to learn more?

455
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,400
No.

456
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:44,200
The soldiers form AND gates, NOT gates,
NAND gates, NOR gates, XOR gates,

457
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,110
XNOR gates, tristate gates
and ten million of these gates,

458
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:52,750
then put the components
together into a system.

459
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:56,790
This system will then be able to carry out
the calculations we need

460
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:00,590
and work out those differential equations
for predicting the suns' movements.

461
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:04,920
We could call the system...

462
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,030
Um...

463
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,880
What?

464
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,790
A computer, Your Majesty.

465
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,720
Good.

466
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,200
Computer, that's a great name.

467
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:23,830
The entire system is a large machine,
the most complex one in history.

468
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,350
Even in a Chaotic Era,
my army continues to train.

469
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:34,510
Your Majesty, you're wise.

470
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,160
Ye Wenjie.

471
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,160
(Astrophysicist)
There's something in Ye Wenjie's social relations

472
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,070
that we haven't noticed before.

473
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:47,920
She has a niece called Chen Xue.

474
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,550
Niece?

475
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,680
Then,
she is Ye Wenxue's daughter, right?

476
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,400
Yeah.

477
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,480
But Ye Wenxue
parted from her very early.

478
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,720
(Mother and daughter)
Since college,

479
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,960
she has been supported by Ye Wenjie.

480
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,720
I thought the sisters hated each other.

481
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,480
Why would she do that?

482
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,110
Where is Chen Xue?

483
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,110
Why didn't we find that before?

484
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:12,240
She has been studying at MIT.

485
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,960
(Chen Xue, graduated from MIT)
She graduated this June.

486
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,240
Where was she when Yang Dong
committed suicide?

487
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,550
Conducting a survey in South America
with an MIT research team.

488
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,920
Is she back now?

489
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,480
She returned a few days ago.

490
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,790
Then she's been living
above Ye Wenjie's apartment.

491
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,350
I hear that it belongs to
one of Ye Wenjie's colleagues

492
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,110
and Ye borrowed it.

493
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,680
But Chen Xue

494
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,217
(Chen Xue)
often goes abroad with the research team

495
00:33:36,241 --> 00:33:37,350
and is hardly at home.

496
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:41,030
I checked up on her simply
and found nothing suspicious.

497
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:44,070
Around the time of Yang Dong's suicide,
she was abroad

498
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,920
focusing on academic research,

499
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,841
(Investigation Report Chen Xue)
and didn't contact the Frontiers of Science,

500
00:33:48,865 --> 00:33:49,830
or Shen Yufei.

501
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,550
She didn't even contact Ye Wenjie much.

502
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,880
Anything else?

503
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,480
One more thing.

504
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,160
Shen Yufei

505
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,720
(Shen Yufei)
owns a company producing nanomaterial products.

506
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,440
But a few months ago,

507
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:07,000
she hired many calculators
working in mathematics.

508
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,760
Do they need to understand math
to work in nanomaterials?

509
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,550
You need to understand math
no matter what you do.

510
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:19,710
But she suddenly hired
so many calculators.

511
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:22,960
Apparently, it has nothing to do
with her main business.

512
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,800
I also found that
the salesmen in her company

513
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,670
had no contact with the calculators.

514
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:34,230
Shen Yufei may be using them
to do something else.

515
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,710
Math.

516
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,440
Math.

517
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,280
Math.

518
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,480
Fundamental physics. Astrophysics.

519
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,510
Applied physics.

520
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,550
Now there is math.

521
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:55,880
Learning is really an endless process.

522
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,820
(Physicist)

523
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:10,940
(Couple Shen Yufei Math Wei Cheng)

524
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,150
What does that mean?

525
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:21,800
Do those mathematicians
have anything to do with Wei Cheng?

526
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,230
We should have thought of it early.

527
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:27,190
Shen Yufei's husband,
Wei Cheng, works in math.

528
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:32,320
Those auxiliary calculations will
ultimately serve him.

529
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,540
Then we'd better visit him.

530
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:42,670
(Wei Cheng)

531

As ordered by the great emperor,
turn on the computer!

541
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,670
System self-test!

542
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:40,840
Your Majesty,
we have named this computer Qin I.

543
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:48,110
Look, there in the center is the CPU,
the core computing component,

544
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,760
formed from your five best divisions.

545
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,710
The part that's closest to us
is the display.

546
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:58,920
It will show us the main parameters
of the computation.

547
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,110
Self-test complete!

548
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,400
Begin boot sequence!

549
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,000
Load operating system!

550
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,800
You also used my cavalry?

551
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,550
Yes.

552
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:10,030
They're responsible for transmitting
information in the whole system.

553
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,880
The passage of the whole formation
they will run through

554
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,630
is the bus.

555
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,320
What's the bus?

556
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,550
The bus architecture
is a great invention.

557
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:21,280
If we have new needs or
new plug-in components,

558
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,400
even if they're made from
up to ten divisions,

559
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,320
we can quickly add them
to the main operation bus.

560
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,360
This allows Qin I's hardware to
be easily expanded and upgraded,

561
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,110
and enables us to deal with
various levels of computation.

562
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,230
Is there anything else?

563
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:41,150
The last part, look further still,
you might have to use the telescope.

564
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,360
There's the external storage.

565
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,760
External storage?

566
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,630
I don't like the name.

567
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:50,150
Why don't we call it "hard drive",
Your Majesty?

568
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,630
Hard drive?

569
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,110
Interesting.

570
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,590
Then let's call it hard drive.

571
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:57,710
Copernicus, you're really talented.

572
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:02,630
It's formed by three million people
with more education than most.

573
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,190
Education?

574
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,440
Are they...

575
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,440
Exactly.

576
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,190
The ones you saved when you
buried all those scholars alive.

577
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,920
What can they do?

578
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:16,150
Each of them holds a notepad and a pen
to record the calculations

579
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,510
and store intermediate
calculation results.

580
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:21,670
They're the bottleneck
for the speed of computation.

581
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:27,150
These people either fail to help
or make matters worse.

582
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:00,880
System lockup!

583
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,360
Malfunction reason determined.

584
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,320
There was an error with the operation

585
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,480
of one of the gates
in the CPU status register.

586
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,070
Your Majesty,
in order to improve system stability,

587
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,880
you should take certain
maintenance measures

588
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,960
with respect to faulty components.

589
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,840
Replace the malfunctioning component.

590
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,440
Yes.

591
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,880
All the soldiers who made up that gate,
behead!

592
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,400
Any malfunctions will be
dealt with the same way.

593
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:06,190
Run solar orbit computation software
"Three Body 1.0"!

594
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,920
Start the master computing module!

595
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,230
Load the differential calculus module!

596
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,510
Load the spectral method module!

597
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:15,070
Enter initial condition parameters

598
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:18,960
and begin calculation!

599
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,400
It seems to be
the Qin 1.0 operating system.

600
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,550
Right.

601
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,400
The formation is the hardware.

602
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,670
What's on this paper is the software.

603
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:53,070
The hardware and software are like...

604
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,000
The guqin zither and sheet music.

605
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,070
Exactly.

606
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:56,710
Your Majesty.

607
00:41:56,710 --> 00:42:00,230
You're certainly a great emperor!

608
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,550
Your Majesty, you're wise!

609
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:04,030
Get off.

610
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:06,840
After entering the motion vectors
of the three suns

611
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,000
at a particular moment
obtained by observation,

612
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,150
the software's operation will give us

613
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:15,510
a prediction for the suns' motion
at any moment in the future.

614
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:19,400
Our first computation
will calculate all the suns' positions

615
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,150
for the next two years.

616
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:25,630
Each set of output values will be
one 120 hours apart.

617
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:28,400
For the human-formation computer,
it's such a long calculation.

618
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,960
Each individual's behavior is so simple,

619
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,710
yet together, they can produce
such a complex, great whole!

620
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,030
Sure, Your Majesty.

621
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:38,190
Human has great power.

622
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:41,000
Europeans criticize me
for my tyrannical rule,

623
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,030
claiming that I suppress creativity.

624
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,590
But a large number of men
yoked by severe discipline

625
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:50,590
can also produce great wisdom
when bound together as one.

626
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:55,760
Great Emperor, this is just the mechanical
operation of a machine, not wisdom.

627
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,070
Each of these lowly individuals
is just a zero.

628
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:02,880
Only when someone like you
is added to the front as a one

629
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,000
can the whole have any meaning.

630
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,230
If, in the end, the results computed according
to your theory and mathematical model

631
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:14,000
don't match reality,
then you and I aren't even zeroes.

632
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,280
Indeed.

633
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,760
If that turns out to be the case,
you will be nothing.

634
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,670
The game should be sped up.
