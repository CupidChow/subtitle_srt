At the moment, the hut was quiet.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,780
I could hear the sound of pen nib
scratching against paper,

20
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:13,280
and smell the fragrance of the sawdust.

Since my father died,

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,960
I hadn't felt relaxed
and experienced warmth for a long time.

23
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,840
- Take a look.
- Okay.

24
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,960
Thank you.

25
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,750
You're welcome.

26
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,800
Let me wash your dirty laundry.

27
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,840
No, no, no.

28
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,360
Don't bother.

You ladies work as hard as men

Just go home and take a rest.

31
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,750
We are to climb the mountain
tomorrow at 6:00 AM.

32
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,400
Wenjie.

33
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,190
Sorry.

34
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,870
Excuse me.

35
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,800
I'll return to the division headquarters
the day after tomorrow.

36
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,910
I'll report to the higher-ups about you.

37
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,120
Hopefully you'll be able
to get out of here.

38
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,910
No, thanks.

39
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,470
I find it quite nice here.

40
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,430
It's quiet.

41
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,030
Are you hiding away from something?

42
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,120
Bye.

43

last year's model worker.)

46
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,750
(Hello, dear comrades.)

47
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,750
(I'm honored to be selected)

48
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,240
(as this year's production
and construction model worker.)

49
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,560
(At work, I reflect on myself and
learn from my experience all the time.)

50
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,240
(I follow rules strictly.)

51
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,140
(I learn from the exemplars around me.)

52
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:41,520
(I keep in mind that the people have
unlimited power to create.)

53
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,260
(They can be organized)

54
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,150
(and march towards
the places and departments)

55
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:51,280
(where they can invest their efforts,
dig deeper and expand wider in production,)

56
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,510
(and perform welfare undertaking
that increasingly benefits themselves.)

57
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,550
(There's an old saying going,
three men stick together,)

58
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,880
(dirt can be turned into gold.)

59

Ye Wenjie, rush back to the company.

77
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,270
I don't know.

78

But I feel like

79
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,520
you might be in big trouble.

80
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,670
Just go.

81
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,870
Just drive.

Comrade Ye.

90
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,120
This is Director Zhang
from political department.

91
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,550
He's here to do a survey.

92
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,270
Don't be afraid, though.

93
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,550
Just say what you know.

94
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,120
Be honest,
and be cooperative with Director Zhang.

95
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,290
Director Zhang.

96
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,840
You are Ye Wenjie?

97
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,030
Don't be nervous.
I'm going to ask you a few questions.

98
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:11,030
I hope you can answer them with honesty.

99
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,120
Did you write the letter?

100
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,750
(Revolutionary Masses)

101
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,250
Revolutionary Masses?

102
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,030
Did you write it?

103
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,720
No, it wasn't me.

104
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,270
But the crosscheck result shows
this is your handwriting.

105
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,430
Yes, it is.

106
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,510
But I'm only the copier.

107
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,200
For whom?

108
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,120
Say it.

109
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,270
Just come clean, quickly.

110
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,200
Um…

111
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,240
Director Zhang, I-I know her.

112
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,550
- She's just like this.
- Please take a seat.

113
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,150
Let me talk to her.

114
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,320
Hey, listen.

115
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,320
Ye, you never told me anything
that happened to you.

116
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,270
But… But we all know, right?

117
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,440
Commander told me a few days ago

118
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:54,270
that whatever bad things happened to you,
you would just take it on yourself.

119
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,200
As your instructor, I know you.

120
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,790
You just don't want to get
someone else in trouble, do you?

121
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,120
About this,
you can just tell Director Zhang

122
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,960
everything you know with honesty, okay?

123
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,840
Let's talk it out,
and it'll be fine, you know?

124
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,550
Just tell Director Zhang.

125
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,600
Go on.

126
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,510
Speak.

127
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,910
Comrade Ye Wenjie.

128
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:32,240
You are aware how serious,
and how special it is.

129
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,750
Do you know what it means?

130
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,750
Just speak.

131
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:52,840
A reporter came to the company
from last week.

132
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:58,080
The reporter's name
is Bai Mulin, right?

133
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:03,910
Ye Wenjie, are you aware
how serious the crime of slander is?

134
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,550
We have run a thorough investigation
on Comrade Bai Mulin.

135
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,550
All he did was
help you mail the letter.

136
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,910
He had no idea
what was in the letter.

137
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,200
Did he say that?

138
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,630
You don't believe me, huh?

139
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,240
Present yourself.

140
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,000
Is she the one?

141
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,000
Yes.

142
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:18,720
I believe that this book inspired you
to write the letter, right?

143
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:25,200
The book title is Silent Spring,
published in the western world in 1962.

144
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,840
Its publication
stirred the capitalist society.

145
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,150
(Silent Spring)
And this is the Chinese version.

146
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,600
It's the teaching material
for internal reference,

147
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,630
and is used as a negative example.

148
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:49,170
The higher-ups explicitly stated
that the book had a great negative impact.

149
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:53,960
The book adopts
the idealist conception of history,

150
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,510
and propagandizes the idea of doomsday.

151
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,360
It's seemingly environment-themed,

152
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,150
but its nature is to justify the corruption
and degeneration of capitalism.

153
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:09,550
It's rotten to its core!

154
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,320
The book isn't mine.

155
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,550
You stole it!

156
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,720
I didn't steal it.

157
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,240
Bai Mulin lent me the book.

158
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:34,240
Nonsense!

159
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,550
I was assigned
to translate the book by the authority.

160
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:41,240
- I have the legal right to own this book.
- Control yourself.

161
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,600
I admit it is my fault
that I didn't keep the book properly.

162
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,840
But I didn't expect her to steal the book
when I was doing work.

163
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:07,480
You found the weapon
to harm socialism.

164
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,670
If I wasn't here, she would impute
all the responsibility to me.

165
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,120
Ye Wenjie,

166
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,270
(Assignments Lumbering Transportation Piling)
I have been nice to you, why would you lie?

167
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,550
Why would you betray
your comrades for personal interest?

168
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,030
All right. All right.

169
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,750
Enough.

170
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,200
Calm yourself down.

171
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,320
We have acquired enough information
about this matter.

172
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,150
Alright.

173
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:50,320
Ye Wenjie, we have been treating you
as humanely as possible.

174
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,270
I know that you have a lowly birth.

175
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,080
But we see you as one of us.

176
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,440
About your inclination of isolating yourself from
the people and refusing to seek progress,

177
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
your instructor and I talked to you
many times

178
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,270
and tried to help you change.

179
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:07,920
But who would have thought
that you'd make such a serious mistake?

180
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,110
I knew you inclined to not
integrate into the collective,

181
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,550
but I didn't expect that your toxic
thoughts were so deep-rooted.

182
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:18,000
Take a good look at yourself.

183
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,030
Take her to the division headquarters.

184
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:26,000
Don't stop the interrogation
until she acknowledges her guilt.

185
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,920
Greetings, Representative Cheng.

186
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,110
Hold on a minute.

187
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,510
The room is so cold.

188
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,830
Go get a stove.

189
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,550
Yes, sir.

190
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:53,480
I'm here representing the military control
commission of the intermediate court.

191
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,510
My name is Cheng Lihua.

192
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,240
Nice to meet you.

193
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,720
Ye Wenjie.

194
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,110
Your hand is so cold.

195
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,480
We'll sit over there.

196
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,200
Let's have a good talk.

197
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,920
Come on.

198
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,070
You are young.

199
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,830
Younger than I thought.

200
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,440
Ye, how foolish of you.

201
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,070
Well, that's what young people do.

202
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,640
(Archive Folder)

203
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,480
The more you read,
the more foolish you become.

204
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,880
But to be fair, everybody would make mistakes
when they were young.

205
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
I made mistakes, too.

206
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,400
But our attitude remains the same.
Don't feel stressed.

207
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,830
Acknowledge your mistake and correct it,
and you can still contribute to the revolution.

208
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,350
Here, drink some hot water.

209
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,680
Warm yourself up.

210
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,350
(In relation to Ye Zhetai…)

211
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,350
Here, sign this.

212
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,640
And we'll have a good conversation.

213
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,240
I'll be guiding you.

214
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,510
Ye, you can trust me.

215
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:30,720
I swear on my honor
that your signature on the paper

216
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,200
will prove your attitude and stance.

217
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,880
Come on, sign it.

218
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,680
Okay?

219
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,590
Ye Wenjie, Representative Cheng
only wants to help you.

220
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,510
She's been concerned
about you these days.

221
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,180
Don't be unrepentant.

222
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,510
Do you hear me?

223
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,710
I understand.

224
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:11,070
This girl is terrified.

225
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,480
Some people are too direct,
rough, and minacious even.

226
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,920
And that's not right.

227
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,350
Ye, actually, it doesn't matter whether
you sign it or not.

228
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:31,000
You can read the last page.

229
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:37,720
You just sign here as one of the key
additional witnesses.

230
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:43,640
But you have to understand
that it doesn't have to be you.

231
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,400
It is a kind offer
from the Organization.

232
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,350
My father is dead.

233
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:54,400
All the information is factual.

234
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,310
Otherwise, your sister

235
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,310
(Witnesses: Ye Wenxue)
wouldn't have signed it.

236
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:02,000
We aim to guide
those who were ideologically led astray

237
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,070
to acknowledge their mistakes with facts.

238
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,590
I didn't know my father
talked to these people.

239
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,550
Everything is real.

240
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,200
You must trust the Organization.

241
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,960
I didn't say it wasn't real.

242
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,510
I simply don't know.

243
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,480
So I can't sign it.

244
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,480
Ye Wenjie, mind your language.

245
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,790
Well, Ye,
I'll be completely honest with you.

246
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:39,680
There's still a chance
for you to be pardoned

247
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,680
if you acknowledge your mistake.

248
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,880
It's no big deal that
a young intellectual

249
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,440
got blinded by a reactionary book.

250
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,960
We don't even need to
bring it to the court.

251
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,680
You'll go to a class,
write some self-examination essays,

252
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,510
and be sent back to the tree farm.

253
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:03,830
But if you are self-opinionated,
then we'll probably take your case seriously.

254
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,240
You'll receive
proper ideological education.

255
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,110
The public security system
attaches importance to your case.

256
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:15,720
I came here
to find out what stance you take.

257
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,680
I hope what I said to you is helpful.

258
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,680
Representative Cheng
is trying to help you.

259
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,350
As you can see here,
four witnesses have signed the paper.

260
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:28,550
(Witnesses: Ye Wenxue)
It doesn't really matter if you sign it or not.

261
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:33,590
Ye Wenjie, you don't want to regret it
for the rest of your life.

262
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:37,000
Ye, it breaks my heart

263
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,030
to see a young intellectual's
future to be destroyed.

264
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,000
I really want to help you.

265
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,550
Just be cooperative.

266
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:56,680
Look at me.

267
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,240
Do I look like a person
who would harm you?

268
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,510
(Witnesses)
Any soaring thoughts

269
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:15,750
will eventually drop to the ground.

270
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:23,070
The gravity of reality is way too heavy.

271
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,400
No, I won't sign it.

272
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:56,270
At the time, someone like me
would receive heavy sentences.

273
00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:01,750
What you experienced
is beyond my imaginations.

274
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,680
It's in the past.

275
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,750
The past is the past.

276
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:11,510
The person who framed you up,
do you hate him?

277
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:14,480
Bai Mulin?

278
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,030
Under the pressure
of the political environment,

279
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:23,860
that was his only option.

280
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:29,310
But for what it's worth,
that wasn't a right choice.

281
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:37,790
What is right and what is wrong?

282
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:47,350
This is the question that Silent Spring
most often made me think about.

283
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:52,030
It seems so rightful
for humans to use pesticides

284
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:59,270
from our perspective,
but how would nature view it?

285
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:06,830
What damage have humans brought
upon the world?

286
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:38,640
Right or wrong
is only a matter of perspectives.

287
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:43,070
The most difficult thing for us

288
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:46,920
is to judge something
from another perspective.

289
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:53,070
There would be no difference
even you take the same perspective.

290
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,480
After that thing happened,

291
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:03,110
I left the northern tree farm
and went elsewhere.

292
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:07,790
From a universal perspective,
it could be right,

293
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:12,550
but it also could be wrong.

294
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:20,030
Wang, when you are at my age,
you'll realize all those things

295
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:24,680
that seemed extremely important
will end up being unimportant.

296
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:30,160
When we find
ourselves pushed into desperation,

297
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:36,790
perhaps,
the turnaround is around the corner.
