1
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,960
(Ye Wenjie
(Professor of Tsinghua University))

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,960
What does this mean?

3
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:23,350
Ye Wenjie was hurt, but she didn't hate
the man who hurt her.

4
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,320
What else did she mention?

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,320
She thought she was screwed,
but then she went to a place.

6
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,390
What place?

7
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:41,350
Don't ask me. Find it out yourself.

8
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,110
Why are you looking at me?
Go find it out.

9
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,050
OK. OK.

10
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,960
OK. OK.

11
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:03,520
Seeing that everyone is busy
without gaining anything, how do you feel?

12
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,400
If you're too depressed,
you can play that game too.

13
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,870
The combat zones have recently found
that many high-level intellectuals

14
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,920
are also playing the Three-Body game.

15
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,230
Isn't it a significant finding?

16
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,430
It seems that our team is valuable.

17
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,920
So have you got more valuable information?

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,350
Sure.

19
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,230
I'm waiting for the files.

20
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,000
Ye Wenjie's files?

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,310
Why do you have to dig into her?

22
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,200
I wasn't interested in the old lady at all
in the beginning.

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,950
But now, I have to be interested in her.

24
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,070
Yang Dong committed suicide,
and she's Yang Dong's mother.

25
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,310
In the Frontiers of Science,
she has contact with Shen Yufei.

26
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,280
When I dig into the game
and the universe flicker...

27
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,070
What's that?

28
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,710
That's astrophysics.

29
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,400
I find that she's an astrophysicist.

30
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,870
As an astrophysicist,

31
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,710
she unexpectedly believes that
physics doesn't exist.

32
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:08,030
Physics does exist,

33
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:14,000
only that the physics we believe
doesn't exist.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,430
Many seemingly unrelated clues
meet at one point.

35
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:24,070
So, Chang, I must dig into the point.

36
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,520
A part of her files isn't declassified.

37
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,910
That's exactly what I asked you
to deal with.

38
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,590
Be patient.

39
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,750
Everything has to
go through a process.

40
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,870
It's been dozens of years.

41
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,750
What's there in that era
worth keeping secret?

42
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,520
Use your connections to get the files.

43
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,000
We found that many years ago,

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,190
she participated in a major
national defense project

45
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,870
of which the applicant
was Red Coast Base.

46
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,470
Base?

47
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,430
For military purpose?

48
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,120
Not necessarily.

49
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:10,080
And at that base, there was
an unprecedented huge antenna.

50
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,560
I guess it was
used for information interference

51
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,400
against the West.

52
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,960
Information warfare?

53
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,400
Chang, find a way to get the files.

54
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,280
It's urgent.

55
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,590
Don't urge me.

56
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,150
Who else can I urge?

57
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,400
You have many people around here.
How many do I have?

58
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,030
Don't you know I only have
11 staff quota?

59
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,840

are in full swing.)

(The Official website of
the Beijing Olympic Games...)

70
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,390
Go.

71
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,920
- I'll eat more and reach this line.
- 180 cm?

72
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,360
Then you'll be as tall as Dad.

73
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,120
Mom will be worried
if you grow to 180 cm.

74
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,160
OK, come down.
Wash your hands and have dinner.

75
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,870
- Come. Wash your hands.
- Time for dinner.

76
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,160
I want ice cream.

77
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,870
No.

78
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,600
Hello?

79
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,630
I was measuring Doudou's height.

80
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,240
She's grown 2 cm in three months.

81
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,360
So what?

82
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,270
My mother said that

83
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,390
I had grown 5 cm in less than
two months after I was born.

84
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,770
Isn't that normal?

85
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:08,310
What I mean is you can only realize
the change in height by comparison,

86
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,430
so is the Three-Body game.

87
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,270
When I first logged in,

88
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,600
King Wen of Zhou
tried to deduce by divination

89
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,830
when the Stable Era
would possibly arrive.

90
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,480
During each civilization after that,

91
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,240
many people were studying
the laws governing the sun's motion.

92
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,550
We may advance the game
if we find the law.

93
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,950
Then you must find the law.

94
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,680
You can do it.

95
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,680
Don't worry. I'll be there for you.

96
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,720
It requires a lot of
professional knowledge to play the game.

97
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,430
It's the best if a scientist working
in this field would play with me.

98
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,310
Bro, you're asking for a scientist
who has time to play games.

99
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,040
Where can I find him?

100
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Do you think everyone can see
the countdown like you do?

101
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,070
Is the food ready?

102
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,980
Right away.

103
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,040
There is really a chosen one.

104
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,600
Who is it?

105
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,870
Please enjoy.

106
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,920
Forget about the food. Let's go.

107
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,560
I'm used to it.

108
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,070
These days,
I've been living in the flicker.

109
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,120
Are you the chosen one?

110
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,560
Yes.

111
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,270
I'm the chosen one.

112
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,100
What's this?

113
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,870
The model I made based on
the principle of the universe flicker.

114
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,950
Next, we'll expand it into a light belt
with a length of 300,000 km,

115
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,800
and then launch it into the universe.

116
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,680
In this way,

117
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,070
we can reproduce the universe flicker
on that day.

118
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,160
Who are you?

119
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,270
Did I give you permission?

120
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,070
I'm Shi Qiang.

121
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,000
Who is Shi Qiang?

122
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,600
A cop.

123
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,600
Well, the cops came that day.

124
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,800
I told them everything.

125
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,630
I didn't do it, though I really want to.

126
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,630
Dr. Sha, let me explain.

127
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,560
The reason why we're here today

128
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,680
is to offer a new breakthrough point
for you to know the entire thing.

129
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,000
What point?

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,510
It's a game.

131
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,070
I know well about games.

132
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,480
Look.

133
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,240
Professional player.

134
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,630
Have you played the game?

135
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,840
I've played it for a couple of days,
getting nowhere.

136
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,720
Don't worry.

137
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,600
With my help, you'll pass it soon.

138
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,270
The game is a little special.

139
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,240
You have to wear a V-suit to play it.

140
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,480
Yeah.

141
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,550
We'll give you the V-suit.

142
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:56,270
Then give me 40 sets first.

143
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,080
Pardon?

144
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,000
40 sets.

145
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,270
Are you insane?

146
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,360
I have to take enough partners
when I load down instance zones.

147
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,910
Do you know how much a set costs?

148
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,840
Do you know how complicated
the approval process is?

149
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,750
Do you think the Finance
will approve 40 sets?

150
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,750
How did you blurt it out?

151
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,030
What about eight sets?

152
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,910
Five sets at most.

153
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,080
That will do.

154
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,080
I'll farm an average instance first
and raid progression.

155
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,300
(The harm of Science and Technology
to the Environment)

156
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,510
With these clues,
I'll find out everything else.

157
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,910
But there are several questions

158
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,410
(Explosion Vibration Caused Collapse
of Nearby Buildings) I have to ask.

159
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,960
I suggest you not to
ask unnecessary questions.

160
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,870
How did you get such information?

161
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,000
I told you before that
when numerous people

162
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,550
like you and me were united,
they couldn't cover up many things.

163
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:04,480
What exactly do you want to do?

164
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:09,030
Tell more people about the truth.

165
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,120
Before I read the files,
I didn't even know that

166
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,600
technology could do such great harm
to the environment.

167
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,910
Are you not worried that

168
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,240
the public would resist technology
after seeing the report?

169
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,630
What people resist is the harm
that comes with technology

170
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,960
instead of technology itself.

171
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,720
We just presented the truth.

172
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,000
We didn't force anyone
to choose or judge.

173
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,960
You?

174
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,720
Who are you?

175
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:41,200
You don't have to ask that
when you replace "you" with "we".

176
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,440
Hello.

177
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,000
Wang Miao, I have an emergency case.

178
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,320
You'll have to pick up Doudou.

179
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,510
OK, got it.

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,870
No, I can't play it now.

181
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,200
Li Yao has an emergency case.

182
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,960
I'll have to pick up my daughter.

183
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,030
Don't leave.

184
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,510
The game is important.

185
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,390
I'll pick her up.

186
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,790
But I have to take her to dinner.

187
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,270
I'll take her to dinner.

188
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,480
OK.

189
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,550
Drive my car.

190
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,510
OK.

191
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,390
Don't smoke in front of my daughter.

192
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,550
Ah? What did you say?

193
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,520
I asked you...

194
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,550
I asked you not to
smoke in front of my daughter.

195
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,320
Got it.

196
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,080
(Hairen)

197
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,790
(Welcome back to Three-Body.)

198
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,390
(The soil color changes again.)

199
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,550
(It's the change in composition
under new climatic conditions.)

200
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,360
(How many years have passed?)

201
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,630
(The pyramid and the dehydratories
have changed greatly, too.)

202
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,870
Hairen.

203
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,200
You know me?

204
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,600
I'm Qin Guli.

205
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,910
Last time I came here,
the pyramid was Egyptian in style.

206
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,390
Now it resembles an Aztec one.

207
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,870
That's because this is
a completely different civilization.

208
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,000
Are you going to the apex?

209
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,550
- Yes, I am.
- Go take a look.

210
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,960
There are too many conjectures
about the secrets of the world.

211
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,030
The instruments at the apex
may be helpful to you.

212
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,600
(There are so many telescopes.)

213
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,720
(It looks like an observatory.)

214
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,960
Hello.

215
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:43,200
I'm Mozi.

216
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,790
Hello, I'm Hairen.

217
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,630
I know you.

218
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,670
You were a follower of King Wen, right?

219
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:56,360
I did follow him here,
but I wasn't his follower.

220
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,390
Because I never believed his theories.

221
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,240
You were right.

222
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,120
Have you found the laws
governing the sun's motion?

223
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:09,360
Let me show you the efforts
of the last civilization.

224
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,550
From Civilization No. 137
of King Wen to now,

225
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:16,600
civilization has been reborn
four more times.

226
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,790
The shortest-lived one got only
halfway through the Stone Age,

227
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,150
but Civilization No. 139 broke a record

228
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:28,600
and developed all the way
to the Steam Age.

229
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,200
What's that?

230
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,150
That's Confucius.

231
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,320
Confucius?

232
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,630
As expected, in the game,

233
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,600
time and space and names
are all disordered.

234
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,750
They're just some symbols.

235
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,750
He believed that everything had to
fit order and propriety,

236
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,080
and nothing in the universe
could be exempt.

237
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,510
He created a system of rites
for the universe.

238
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,670
I can imagine the result.

239
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,750
Right you are.

240
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,630
He calculated when the sun
would follow the rites,

241
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:06,030
and predicted a five-year Stable Era.

242
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,600
You know what?

243
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,200
There was indeed a Stable Era
lasting a month.

244
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,390
And then one day,
the sun just didn't come out?

245
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,240
No, the sun rose that day as well.

246
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,550
It rose to the middle of the sky,
and then went out.

247
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,720
What?

248
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,550
Went out?

249
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,150
Yes.

250
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:30,150
It gradually dimmed,
became smaller,

251
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:34,120
and then went out all of a sudden.

252
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,630
Night fell.

253
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:40,270
Oh, the cold.

254
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:50,150
Confucius stood there and
froze into a column of ice.

255
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,150
And there he remains.

256
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,510
Was there nothing remaining
after the sun went out?

257
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:59,000
A flying star appeared in that location,

258
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,480
like a soul left behind
after the sun died.

259
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,600
Are you sure that the sun
really disappeared suddenly,

260
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,240
and the flying star
appeared just as suddenly?

261
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,510
Yes.

262
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,440
That did happen all of a sudden.

263
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,200
You can check the historical annals.

264
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,320
It was clearly recorded.

265
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,600
How can it be?

266
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Just went out suddenly?

267
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,200
What level has the civilization
developed to?

268
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,000
It should be the Han Dynasty.

269
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,200
Forget about the Western Han
or the Eastern Han.

270
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,080
I have a mission, observing
the precise movements of the sun.

271
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:39,080
Unlike those shamans,
Legalists or Daoists,

272
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:45,270
who have no ability to do experiments
and are immersed in their mysticism,

273
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:52,000
I know how to make practical things.

274
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,960
Remember to tell Doudou to keep
a good habit of correcting errors.

275
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,000
OK.

276
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,680
Goodbye.

277
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,240
Bye-bye.

278
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,270
Goodbye.

279
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,640
Thank you.

280
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,160
I'm one of your dad's friends.

281
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,880
You can call me Uncle Shi.

282
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,830
None of Dad's friends smokes.

283
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,550
Where are my parents?

284
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,880
Your mom is working overtime.

285
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,510
Your dad is busy.

286
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,110
Come with me.

287
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,640
I'll treat you to delicious food.

288
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,750
I'll treat you to the food
that your parents wouldn't let you eat, OK?

289
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,400
(Pollution scandals of pharmaceutical
factories emerge continuously.)

290
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,440
(It's reported that)

291
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,400
(these are chemical wastes
discharged from)

292
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,240
(nearby pharmaceutical factories.)

293
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,110
(The toxic substances in the wastes)

294
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,750
(will contaminate the soil and crops.)

295
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,480
(After villagers' livestock
eat the wastes,)

296
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,070
(the toxin will remain permanently
in their body.)

297
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:07,030
(And the pollutants will eventually
get in human's body through food.)

298
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,960
(According to the hospitals' data,
in the villages nearby,)

299
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,590
(27 congenitally deformed babies
have been born.)

300
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,310
(Why has medical technology,
which is supposed to)

301
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,880
(improve people's health,
become a devil?)

302
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,830
(Is the development of technology)

303
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,200
(a sweet fruit or a tumor to human?)

304
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,680
(If there are
such news cues around you,)

305
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:31,270
(please call us on the number
at the bottom of the screen.)

306
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,030
Hello.

307
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,750
Do you have any news cues
to share with us?

308
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,110
Hello, I want to speak to Mu Xing.

309
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,960
Hello.

310
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,400
Do you have any information about
environmental pollution to share with us?

311
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,920
I want to talk to Mu Xing, the reporter.

312
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,510
Hello.

313
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,920
Do you have any problems?

314
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,480
There are problems with you.

315
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,270
Be polite.

316
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,160
I want to talk to you.

317
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,790
I...

318
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,640
Hello.

319
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,720
The reporter, Mu Xing,
find out where she is.

320
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,400
Would you like
stewed assorted giblets later?

321
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,310
Is this one of your practical things?

322
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,550
Yes.

323
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:33,830
I have theories, too,
but they're not mystical.

324
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:38,640
They're derived from a large number
of observations.

325
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,640
First, do you know what the universe is?

326
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,110
What is it?

327
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,110
The universe is a hollow sphere

328
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,160
floating in the middle
of a sea of fire.

329
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,270
On its surface are numerous tiny holes
and a large hole.

330
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,640
The light from the sea of fire
shines through these holes.

331
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,880
The tiny ones are stars,
and the large one is the sun.

332
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,200
We can see the stars moving around,
and the sun rising and setting,

333
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,110
because the sphere is rotating.

334
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:13,070
If all the holes are fixed in
the surface of the same sphere,

335
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:17,550
how can you explain the relative motion
between the sun and the stars?

336
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,160
Correct.

337
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:24,440
That's why I've modified my model.

338
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:31,440
The universal sphere
is made of two spheres.

339
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,400
Come in.

340
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,070
Professor Wang, hello.

341
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:04,170
Is Captain Shi here?

342
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,480
You alone can do the work
of ten people, right?

343
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,680
I thought Captain Shi and you
were both in the game,

344
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,750
so I came to report to him,
not expecting that you would assign me a task.

345
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:23,110
I was in the game just now,
but I couldn't figure something out,

346
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,350
so I logged off.

347
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,000
After Mozi told me about

348
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,030
the theoretical structure
of his giant instrument,

349
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,880
I wanted to make a simple model
on the computer like this

350
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,000
to help me to understand.

351
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,790
Unfortunately, my ability is limited.
You're just in time.

352
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,590
This is the model.

353
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:42,400
As Mozi said,
the sky is the shell of the inner sphere

354
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,240
that has many small holes.

355
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:50,030
Next, let's create an outer sphere
that has one large hole.

356
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:53,250
Then add light.

357
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,680
Yes, that's it.

358
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,240
The light coming through the hole
is reflected and scattered,

359
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,000
filling the space between
the two spheres with light.

360
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,750
Then the light comes in through
the tiny holes

361
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,270
and that's how we see the stars.

362
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:10,200
The theory sounds great.

363
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,830
But what about the sun?

364
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,030
I asked Mozi about it.

365
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,350
He said, the sun is the result of
the large hole in the outer sphere

366
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,640
being projected onto the inner one.

367
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,030
The projection is so bright
that it penetrates the inner sphere

368
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,750
like the shell of an egg,
and that is how we see the sun.

369
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,510
Around the spot of light,
the bright reflected light rays

370
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,510
light up the inner shell.

371
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,510
That's the clear sky
we see during the day.

372
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,270
It's a bold hypothesis.

373
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,160
But there should be a force

374
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,790
that propels the two spheres
in irregular motion

375
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,920
to make it appropriate
to the circumstances.

376
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,640
According to Mozi, the force
is the sea of fire outside the universe.

377
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,880
It's unreasonable.

378
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,550
In the double-shell model,

379
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:56,790
if the sun is the projection of the hole
in the outer shell,

380
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:59,640
its size and brightness
ought to be fixed.

381
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,400
When I asked the question,
Mozi looked disdainful.

382
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,030
He said my conception
of this model was too simplistic.

383
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:12,680
As conditions in the sea of fire change,
the outer shell will shrink or expand.

384
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:18,350
This leads to changes in the size
and brightness of the sun.

385
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,960
That sounds reasonable.

386
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,000
Professor Wang, do you have
any other questions?

387
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,030
What about the flying stars?

388
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,830
Flying stars?

389
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,920
Yes.

390
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,550
The model doesn't take
flying stars into consideration.

391
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,110
Excuse me.

392
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,920
Hello.

393
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,400
Don't talk nonsense.

394
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,830
Though the game is different from
other games, it can't beat me.

395
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:09,810
I've found that the biggest difference
in the game is the sun.

396
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,960
But it's complicated to explain.

397
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,550
Ms. Xu, would you please come over?

398
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:18,200
OK.

399
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,440
Professor Wang,
I'm going to see Sha Ruishan.

400
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,510
I don't want to waste
the five sets of V-suits.

401
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,000
OK.

402
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,030
How do you like it? Is it tasty?

403
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,200
Yes.

404
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,880
Where is Captain Shi?

405
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,980
Babysitting my daughter.

406
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,160
What else do you want to do? Tell Uncle.

407
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,920
Let's go skating, shall we?

408
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,960
Mom says skating is dangerous.

409
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,640
It isn't a good sport for my age.

410
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,680
Professor Wang, are you not worried?

411
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,200
Why is skating dangerous?

412
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,960
For your age...

413
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,160
How old are you?
It isn't dangerous with me by your side.

414
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,920
Uncle, you're so cool.

415
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,680
Am I cool?

416
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,270
Actually, I'm not cool.

417
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,680
When my son was little,
I wouldn't let him go skating.

418
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,880
But I regret it now.

419
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,920
I shouldn't have stopped him.

420
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,270
Who knows what
will happen tomorrow, right?

421
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:27,200
Uncle, no smoking indoors.

422
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,480
OK.

423
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,750
Let's go skating.

424
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,350
Go.

425
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,160
Why do you care about the flying stars?

426
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,920
They're not important.

427
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,960
Just some dust flying about
the inside of the universal spheres.

428
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,200
No,
the flying stars are important.

429
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,880
How does your model explain
the sudden extinguishing of the sun

430
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,640
during the time of Confucius?

431
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,200
That's a rare exception.

432
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,510
Maybe it was because
a dark spot or cloud in the sea of fire

433
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:03,480
happened to pass over the big hole
in the outer shell.

434
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,790
My universe model has proved that.

435
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:13,310
Is this model the machine
you built to replicate the universe?

436
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,350
Yes.

437
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:20,310
Yes, exactly.

438
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:31,960
The light source
is made of the luminescent material

439
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,110
gathered from
hundreds of thousands of fireflies.

440
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:40,750
I used a cool light so that the clerk can
stay inside for a long time.

441
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,400
There's a person inside the sphere?

442
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,070
Sure, the clerk is important.

443
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,830
After we set up the model

444
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,480
to correspond to the current state
of the real universe,

445
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,880
the future state of the universe
will be accurately simulated.

446
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,200
Of course, the sun's motion
can be simulated, too.

447
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,030
The clerk will record everything.

448
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,240
What's this?

449
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,790
Your observation records?

450
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:10,310
The records are a precise calendar.

451
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:17,750
This is the dream of
hundreds of civilizations before us.

452
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,640
Hairen, you've come in time.

453
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,400
According to the model universe,

454
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,110
a four-year-long Stable Era
is about to begin.

455
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,720
Emperor Wu of Han has issued
the order to rehydrate

456
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,070
based on my prediction.

457
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:38,640
Let's wait and see.

458
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:49,200
You can open the interface
and speed up the time.

459
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:15,270
A Stable Era has begun.

460
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:19,400
Proper temperature,
the spring of civilization.

461
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,920
Do you not want to
join this wonderful life?

462
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:30,070
When women are revived,
they crave love.

463
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,790
There is no reason for you
to stay here any longer.

464
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,160
The game is over.

465
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,920
I am the winner.

466
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,720
Your model universe

467
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,270
is indeed incomparable.

468
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,640
But as for its predictions...

469
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,270
May I use the telescope

470
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,270
to observe the sun?

471
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,790
Of course.

472
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,510
Please.

473
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,880
Wait.

474
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:24,030
To observe the sun,
you need this smoked glass filter.

475
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:34,960
Look, the sun is an entity
with a small core in its middle.

476
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,750
The core is actually the sun.

477
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:40,160
Around it is the light
that it gives off.

478
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:46,440
Maybe it's just a visual error.

479
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,550
Let's speed it up again
for the good of observation.

480
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,920
It seems that
the sun will probably not rise again.

481
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,790
It's like the end
of Civilization No. 137.

482
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:48,440
My predictions cannot be wrong.

483
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,790
Look, the golden earth.

484
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,750
It isn't the horizon.

485
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,750
It's the sun!

486
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:35,280
It's about to end.

487
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,640
Dehydrate!

488
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,590
- Dehydrate!
- Dehydrate!

489
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:47,550
Dehydrate!

490
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:09,640
Mozi, we should dehydrate, too.

491
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,350
No.

492
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,550
No need.

493
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,550
The Stable Era will continue!

494
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,550
The universe is a machine!

495
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:21,200
I created this machine!

496
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,070
Mozi!

497
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,400
(Civilization No. 141
fell into ruins in flames.)

498
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,160
(This civilization had advanced to
the Eastern Han Period.)

499
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,960
(The seed of civilization remains.)

500
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,030
(It will germinate
and again progress through)

501
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,350
(the unpredictable world of Three-Body.)

502
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,200
(We invite you to log in
to the game again.)

503
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,880
Flying stars.

504
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:54,830
Flying stars.

505
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,750
Doudou.

506
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:10,030
Who bought you the ice cream?

507
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:18,000
I-I only had one.

508
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,160
Shi Qiang, You bought my daughter
an ice cream, didn't you?

509
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,170
I didn't smoke.

510
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,790
What did you have for dinner?

511
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,830
- Stewed assorted giblets.
- Steaks.

512
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,440
Stewed steaks?

513
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,880
I didn't smoke.

514
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,480
Uncle took me on roller skating.

515
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,480
Anyway, I didn't smoke.

516
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:46,440
Fine.

517
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,000
I shouldn't have believed you.

518
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,550
Give me.

519
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:58,000
What are you doing?

520
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,790
Give me my car key.

521
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,110
Have you found anything new
in the game?

522
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,310
Let me send her home first.

523
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,400
You must have got something, right?

524
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,880
Yes. Let me think about it. Doudou.

525
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,150
Let's go.

526
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:14,960
What, what...

527
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,400
What are the flying stars?
You just said that.

528
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,510
Your hands are so cold.

529
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:28,070
I can't believe that I witnessed
the destruction of Mozi's civilization.

530
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,070
What a great phenomenon!

531
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,230
Great!

532
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,320
The game is so great!

533
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,630
How come?

534
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,480
I can't explain it to you now.

535
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,150
I recommend you to read
some books and papers in this field,

536
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:43,440
like 900 Million Suns,
Structure and Evolution of Stars, etc.

537
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,590
I'll make a list for you later.

538
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,400
By the way,
I asked them to express

539
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,360
the four sets of V-suits back to you.

540
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,110
If you told me
what the game was like early,

541
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,360
I wouldn't have let them team with me.

542
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,920
Those guys only know to kill mobs.

543
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,880
How could they play
such an advanced game?

544
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,760
Fortunately, I didn't log on earlier.

545
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,880
If I did, I might have been
killed by your partners.

546
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,320
Come on.

547
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,150
Get to the point.

548
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,190
Guys.

549
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:11,510
You've been
playing this game for some time.

550
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:14,480
Our goal today is that
you tell me about it

551
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,630
and make sure every word
is understandable to me.

552
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:19,400
That will be enough, OK?

553
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,710
Come on.

554
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,400
In this game,
civilizations advance briefly

555
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,230
in Stable Eras,
while in Chaotic Eras,

556
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:30,570
they stop developing,
or even get destroyed.

557
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,110
So the players' task is to find

558
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:35,320
the appearance regularity
of the Stable Eras.

559
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,670
Understood.

560
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,030
Just like the four seasons.

561
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,030
The ancient must sum up
the laws of seasonal changes

562
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,760
for the good of agricultural production.

563
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,920
The ancient calendar and solar terms
were their summaries of the laws

564
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,440
to help people to sow seeds in spring,
harvest in autumn,

565
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,890
store grains and live through winter.

566
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,070
Understood.

567
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,880
But the sun's motion in the game

568
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,630
isn't as easy to master
as the changes in the seasons.

569
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:07,590
The alternation between the Stable Eras
and the Chaotic Eras is random.

570
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:10,550
Like earthquakes,
with today's science and technology,

571
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,710
we still can't predict them.

572
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:17,280
So, you'll pass the game

573
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,320
- as long as you can predict the Stable Eras.
- Right.

574
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,360
Then do it.

575
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:27,300
All the players were doing it.

576
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,760
King Wen of Zhou
predicted the Stable Eras by divination.

577
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,440
The people of Civilization No. 139

578
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,760
traveled across the whole world
to observe the sun.

579
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,510
Confucius predicted them
by order and propriety.

580
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:44,510
Mozi tried to predict the Stable Eras with
the giant universe model he built.

581
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:50,430
All of them craved a precise calendar.

582
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,760
Understood.

583
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,070
They worked hard,
but they didn't succeed.

584
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:55,920
How come?

585
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,670
Because the world of Three-Body
is different from ours.

586
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,110
What's the difference?

587
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,760
- The sun.
- The sun.

588
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,480
Confidant.

589
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,800
What's wrong with the sun this time?

590
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:15,550
It suddenly appeared in front of us,
humongous.

591
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,710
I don't understand.

592
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:20,110
In other words,
as if in our world,

593
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:23,760
the sun just rose at dawn,
but one second later,

594
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,880
precisely one second later,
it jumped to the position of noon.

595
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,030
And according to Mozi,
in the time of Confucius,

596
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:35,710
the sun went out all of a sudden.

597
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:39,600
He still doesn't understand.

598
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,320
Look.

599
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,760
Hypothetically, this was the sun
in the time of Confucius.

600
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,040
It went out all of a sudden.

601
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,880
Does the sun have a switch?

602
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,280
That's impossible.

603
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,510
But the sun can move.

604
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:01,070
It can move away from
or close to us very fast,

605
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:06,360
as fast as if it is switched on or off.

606
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,150
Understood.

607
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,960
In the time of Confucius,
the sun moved away very fast.

608
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,840
In the time of Mozi,
the sun came close very fast.

609
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,810
Exactly.

610
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:22,920
And Mozi disclosed
very important information.

611
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,230
In the time of Confucius,
after the sun went out suddenly,

612
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:29,440
a flying star appeared in the sky.

613
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,960
If it was true,
I think there is only one possibility.

614
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,960
After the sun went out,

615
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,960
the flying star that was originally
covered by the sun's rays became visible.

616
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,360
I don't understand.

617
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,030
- Do you have a flashlight?
- Yes.

618
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,930
Find me one.

619
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:55,230
That's the sun.

620
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:58,360
This is the flying star.

621
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,030
We can't see it.

622
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:08,150
The sun's light is so strong
that it overshadows the flying star.

623
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:16,320
- But after the sun goes out...
- Look, the flying star appears.

624
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:19,190
There must be some connection.

625
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,630
But I haven't figured it out yet.

626
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:25,360
I need further observation
to figure it out.

627
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,960
Can the sun move that fast?

628
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,960
It's impossible.

629
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,230
In the world of Three-Body,
it's possible.

630
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:36,280
Understood.

631
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:42,320
It makes me a bit uncomfortable
turning it off. Turn it on.
