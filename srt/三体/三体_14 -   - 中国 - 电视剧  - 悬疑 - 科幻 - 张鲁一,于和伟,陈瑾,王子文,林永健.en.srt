4
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,070
(Comrades, let's perk ourselves up
and welcome this brand new day.)

5
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,590
(According to the latest
weather forecast,)

6

to 8:00 AM tomorrow,)

7
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,350
(there will be light snow
in some areas of the northeast.)

8
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:10,030
When I first joined the Red Coast Base,
they didn't give me a fixed job.

9
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,030
I was just doing technology-related
odds and ends,

10
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:18,630
and there was a security guard
supervising me doing that.

11
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,840
It's okay.

12
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,280
I can manage it myself.

13
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,520
What did you do exactly?

14
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,590
Why do they want you watched
even when you're cleaning a machine?

15
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,960
I made a serious mistake.

16
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,680
A serious mistake?

17
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,430
What serious mistake
could you possibly have made?

18
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,870
You?

19
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,680
I don't believe it.

20
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,030
What's wrong?

21
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,280
It's indeed problematic.

22
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,310
You're in charge here?

23
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,280
Why didn't you notice this?

24
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,800
Fix it right now.

25
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,310
Yes.

26
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,520
Impressive.

27
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,150
You know experiments,

28
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,630
and you have pretty strong
observation ability.

29
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:48,080
When I was in college, my mentor
told me that an astrophysicist

30
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,400
wouldn't achieve anything without
experiment skills and observation abilities,

31
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,120
however good at theories they were.

32
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,470
At least that's the case in our country.

33
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,190
Compared with your father…

34
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,080
Compared with his opinion,
this is entirely different.

35
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,150
Theories are the foundation
of application.

36
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,800
I feel theoretical research tends to
mess with people's minds.

37
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,550
There are so many terms in physics.

38
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:26,750
Will changing the names be enough?

39
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,560
I tend to agree with this opinion.

40
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,870
He was too obsessed with theories.

41
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,430
(I will now announce)

42
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:47,240
(the night shift schedule
for next week.)

43
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,870
(Monday: Transmission Department.)

44
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,800
But I'm not surprised.
Your mentor is the doyen

45
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
of radio astronomy in our country.

46
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,070
Highly respected.

47
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,920
He was the reason
I became interested in radio astronomy.

48
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,040
I taught myself some electronic
engineering and computer knowledge.

49
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,070
Without the expertise in the two fields,
I wouldn't have found the glitch.

50
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,680
That's right.

51
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,800
By the way,
what's your postgraduate topic?

52
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,270
I participated in the debugging

53
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,510
of the first small radio telescope
in our country with my mentor.

54
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,870
It was during that period

55
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,430
that I accumulated quite some experience
in this field.

56
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:35,360
I never thought this expertise
would come in handy in this place.

57

59
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,430
The glitch's fixed?

60
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,950
Yeah.

61
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,270
You found it?

62
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,680
She found it.

63
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,750
You have experience in radio astronomy?

64
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,430
As chance would have it,
she does know a thing or two.

65
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,720
That's good.

66
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,040
We may move her here
for the maintenance.

67
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,000
People who can find such glitches
are a rare breed here.

68
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,560
Okay. I'll think about it.

69
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,270
What's there to think about?

70
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,800
Wenjie,
from now on, you're in charge here.

71
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,270
Well, Lei…

72
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,830
I need to talk to you about Liu.
Come over here.

No…

74
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,600
Liu is incompetent
and lacks professionalism.

75
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,870
Why does the stuff he overhauled
keep malfunctioning?

76
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm speaking to you.

77

I'm listening.

78
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,830
You were the one who brought him here,
and now he proved incompetent.

79
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,360
Should we keep him or weed him out?

80
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,720
Liu, right?

81
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,920
Yeah.

82
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,480
Well, Liu…

83
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,480
I'll knock some sense into him.

84
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,950
That won't improve his competence.

85
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,770
Well, sure, knocking sense into people
is also a very important task.

That guy is always shirking.

In the past, he had to work,
but now you've come,

167
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,440
- Hurry!
- Okay!

168
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,200
- I'll check it right away.
- Report. The signal's weakening.

169
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,790
Have you sent the new data?

170
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,140
- Press on with the check.
- On it. Here it is.

171
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:43,910
Press on with the check.

172
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,720
(…in the Transmission Department
displays a failure code.)

173

are to go and fix it immediately.)

176
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,360
(Maintenance personnel
are to go and fix it immediately.)

177
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,000
Liu, check this out.

178
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,630
We've found the reason.
Tell everybody it's because of No. 1731.

179
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,510
Alright.

180
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:20,000
Malfunctioning device identified.
It's No. 1731.

181
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,630
(The 151st transmission
of Red Coast Project is finished.)

182
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,840
Malfunctioning device identified.
It's No. 1731.

183
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,030
(Red Coast entering detection mode.)

184
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,150

please take over system control)

185
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,840
(and upload the break point data.)

186

in the transmission logs carefully.)

187
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:43,510
(Group leaders are to go to the meeting
room for regular transmission meeting.)

188
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,240
I've checked the data.

189
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,030
There's nothing wrong.
The problem lies in your devices.

190
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,320
You know better than me that's not true.

191
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,790
You're just… You're just trying
to have me take the fall.

192
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,720
You know better than me
if you should take the fall as well.

193
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,550
Yang Weining,
you just want me to be your scapegoat.

194
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,200
(All units are to carefully fill in
the forms in the transmission log)

195
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,910
(about the malfunction of No. 1731.)

196
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,670
(Group leaders are to go to the meeting
room for regular transmission meeting.)

197
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,240
(Over.)

198
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,320
Actually, Liu has identified
the problem already.

199
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,200
He also figured out a solution.

200
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:43,080
He put it all in the maintenance report,
but someone crossed it out.

201
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:46,200
I see.

202
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:51,960
Liu is actually much more professional
than he seems.

203
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,150
Yeah.

204
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:58,720
All technical military officers here
are the best in PLA Rocket Force.

205
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,750
I'll never be able to catch up with him

206
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,000
in terms of
electronic and computer expertise.

207
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,480
It doesn't matter anymore.

208
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,630
Anyway, he's leaving.

209
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,440
That's what I'm trying to say.

210
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,630
Liu is competent.

211
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,240
You shouldn't…

212
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,600
It'd be a shame if he got expelled.

213
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,480
A shame?

214
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,750
You're so naive.

215
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,320
You think I'm the reason he's leaving?

216
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:46,670
Living conditions are very poor
in this godforsaken place.

217
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,550
Of course,
those things can be overcome,

218
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,720
but you should know very well

219
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,630
what a scientific researcher
values the most.

220
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,120
It's the prospects of achievements,

221
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,200
but the research and development
of Red Coast systems is over.

222
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,000
There are no prospects
for achievements anymore.

223
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:17,000
And Liu is fully aware
that in a top-level project like this,

224
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,510
once he accepts a core position,
he'll have to stay here forever.

225
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:30,030
He's leaving on his own account?

226
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,080
Liu is a smart guy.

227
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:46,630
In his domain, he counts as a genius,
but he chose to pretend to be a fool.

228
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,870
(Equipment Maintenance Report)
Do you know

229
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,270
who revised this report?

230
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,640
He himself?

231
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,640
Yeah.

232
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,550
He did it himself.

233
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,790
He can't slack off,
so when we tell him to go east,

234
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,510
he'll try his best to go west.

235
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,480
He's playing dumb,
and he's a master of it.

236
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,640
He won.

237
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,920
Lei has talked to me many times
about his competence.

238
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,880
He said Liu's no good,
that he's incompetent,

239
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,750
and unprofessional, and wasting a post.

240
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,400
"Just let him go."

241
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,160
What could I say?

242
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,240
I could only steel myself.

243
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,160
But now I feel this won't work.

244
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:45,750
At this rate, sooner or later
he'll resort to sabotage,

245
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,510
which will be a serious mistake.

246
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,000
He didn't resort to sabotage.

247
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,270
I'm not Cheng Lihua.

248
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:04,510
If Liu really wants out,
I'll let him go.

249
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,920
But I got to give you a note of caution.

250
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,880
After filling the vacancy,
you should just do your job,

251
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,590
which is maintenance.

252
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,830
Do not meddle in anything else.

253
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:18,590
I just can't stand Liu anymore.

254
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,880
You may leave.

255
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,590
Stay here.

256
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,400
I know if I chuck Liu out right now,
you might worry about his replacement.

257
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,070
Am I right?

258
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,960
Well, Wenjie is a suitable candidate.

259
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,350
She studied electronics,
and computer science,

260
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,030
and she's also got expertise
in radio astronomy.

261
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:43,590
A very suitable, all-around candidate.

262
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,070
It can't be her.

263
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,590
Why can't it be her?

264
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:51,720
Expertise can be improved over time.
Attitude is the key.

265
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,640
Wenjie is very responsible,
and she's yearning to improve herself.

266
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,920
I can guarantee you
she'll soon outshine Liu in expertise.

267
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,960
Wenjie, neither I nor Weining

268
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,000
obsesses about people's past
and ignores the change in them.

269
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,960
I promise we'll assess you
in a fair and objective way.

270
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,920
I disagree.

271
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,110
Why do you disagree?

272
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:16,200
She's unfit to enter the core
of Red Coast.

273
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,920
Can we stop talking about the past?

274
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,110
Even Chairman Mao says
we should see things dialectically.

275
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:28,200
We can't fix our eyes on her past
and ignore the changes in her.

276
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,240
I think Wenjie's been performing
very well since her arrival.

277
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,590
Gi…Give us the room.

278
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,550
Her problem is not a small one.

279
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,070
Well...

280
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,310
You were the one
who insisted I move her here,

281
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,440
but now you refuse to put her to work.
What the heck are you playing at?

282
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:04,350
Yeah, I got her here,
but I only want her for maintenance.

283
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,000
She's unfit to enter the core
of Red Coast.

284
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,590
Why?

285
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,040
She made mistakes.

286
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:16,200
Yang Weining, even I, the political
commissar, have no worries about that.

287
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,510
Why are you concerned about it?

288
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,960
I think Ye Wenjie is suitable for it.

(Forward the Revolutionary
and Improve Productivity)

290

Although
Political Commissar Lei and Yang Weining

291
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:59,030
had a wide divergence of opinion,
eventually, I still took Liu's place.

308
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,680
From here on out,
Liu's position will be yours.

309
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,480
You'll be in charge of the core work
of the Transmission Department.

310
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,920
You need to keep it up,
and stay meticulous and responsible.

311
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,510
I'll caution you once again.

312

you shouldn't meddle in,

I've heard.

I did.

00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:56,400
I need to look up the models
of some machines.

325
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,200
I've told the security

326
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,000
you may go to the reference room
whenever you want.

327
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,240
Thank you for your trust,
Political Commissar Lei.

328
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,510
For the moment,
it's just the cybernation unit

329
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,880
of the transmission system.

330
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,900
- We need to open it to you step by step.
(- OS: Wang.)

331
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,480
(OS: These data are problematic.)

332
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,310
I understand.

333
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,590
(- OS: Check them again.)
- Yes.

334
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:19,920
Why do you want to look up these models?

335
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,880
Lately I've come to know
many core contents,

336
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,900
so some questions arose in my mind.

337
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,200
This is an important
confidential project of our country,

338
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,790
but the devices here are too outdated.

339
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,920
Take the Transmission Department's
computers for example.

340
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,350
Although there are three of them,

341
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:35,480
all of them are even more primitive
than DJSC30.

342
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,830
They're even still using

343
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,000
cumbersome magnetic core memory
and paper input tape.

344
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,640
They're too heavy,

345
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,110
and their longest uptime
did not exceed 15 hours.

346
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,440
I also checked Red Coast’s
targeting system.

347
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,920
Its precision is very low,
probably not even on par

348
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,480
with that of an artillery cannon.

349
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:06,240
I understand your worries, but our country
is in the early stage of construction.

350
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,480
To be specific, it's like a child.

351
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,720
Everything is waiting to be taken up.
Just like the northern tree farm.

352
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,110
The objective conditions
are undeniably poor,

353
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,830
but we have to strive
when conditions are good,

354
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:22,000
and when conditions are poor, we have to
improve the conditions and then strive.

355
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,110
We need to overcome all obstacles
and work miracles.

356
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:29,720
This is all we need to do in Red Coast.

357
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,070
I understand.

358
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:35,070
I'll try my best.

359
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,830
Go. Get to work.

Wenjie.

372
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,750
Political Commissar Lei.

373
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:30,790
Wenjie, how long have you been working
in the Transmission Department?

374
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,880
43 days.

375
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,110
You have a very good memory.

376
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:40,400
By now you’re pretty familiar
with the Transmission Department.

377
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,160
This is Red Coast's principal part,
and also its offensive component.

378
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:49,590
I'd like to hear your views
of the system as a whole.

379
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,440
Go ahead, speak your mind.

380
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,440
Political Commissar Lei, I'm just responsible
for maintenance and repair.

381
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,550
As for Red Coast's overall condition,
including its operation and targets,

382
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,400
I know nothing about those things.

383
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,920
I'm not allowed to know.

384
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,270
Your awareness is impressive,

385
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,400
but it's also important
to be practical and realistic.

386
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,510
If you do have something to say,
you may just say it.

387
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,720
There's nobody else around.

388
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,830
The principal part
of the transmission component,

389
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:36,030
when you come down to it,
it's just a radio transmitter.

390
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,160
That's one way to put it.

391
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:47,200
Wenjie,
do you know about microwave ovens?

392
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:53,030
They are a luxury plaything
of the capitalist West.

393
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:57,310
Food is heated by the energy generated
from absorbing microwave radiation.

394
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:00,160
At my previous research station,
in order to precisely test

395
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,480
the high-temperature aging
of certain components, we imported one.

396
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,070
After work, we would use it to bake potatoes
or warm mantou-bread.

397
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,590
It’s very interesting.

398
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:19,480
The inside of the food heats up first
while the outside remains cold.

399
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,160
Actually, Red Coast system
is a giant microwave oven,

400
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:45,850
and its heating targets
are the enemy’s space vessels.

401
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,510
If we can apply microwave radiation
at a specific power level

402
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,920
of one-tenth of a watt
to one watt per square centimeter,

403
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,720
we’ll be able to disable or destroy
many electronic components

404
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:02,920
of satellite communications,
radar, and navigation systems.

405
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,070
I see.

406
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:13,400
It's different
from what you thought, right?

407
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,750
Though Red Coast system
is just a radio transmitter,

408
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,960
it's not a conventional device.

409
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,030
If its transmission power
reaches 25 megawatts,

410
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,000
that'll be really staggering.

411
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,160
This is not just more powerful
than all communication transmissions,

412
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,790
but also all radar transmissions.

413
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,440
That's right.

414
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,160
Red Coast relies on a set
of gigantic capacitors for energy.

415
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,960
Because the power requirements
are so high, its transmission circuits

416
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,750
are also entirely different
from conventional designs.

417
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,070
Now I understand the purpose
of such ultrahigh power in the system.

418
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:53,640
But emission from the system
seems to be modulated.

419
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,790
Yeah.

420
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:58,830
However, the modulation is unlike that used
in conventional radio communications.

421
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:02,590
The purpose isn’t to add information.

422
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:14,030
It's to use a kind of
shifting frequencies and amplitudes

423
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:20,790
to penetrate possible shielding
deployed in the space by the enemy.

424
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:25,920
Of course, those are still experimental.

425
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,110
I see.

426
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,200
Thank you, Political Commissar Lei.

427
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:39,550
Recently, two target satellites
were launched from Jiuquan.

428
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,720
We launched an effective attack
with Red Coast system.

429
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,480
It was a complete success.
The targets were destroyed.

430
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,750
Temperature inside the satellites
reached nearly a thousand degrees,

431
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:54,000
and all instruments and photographic
equipment onboard were destroyed.

432
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,960
In future wars,
Red Coast can effectively strike

433
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,680
at the enemy’s communication
and reconnaissance satellites,

434
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,110
like KH-8, the principal spy satellites
our opponent is using right now,

435
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:06,160
as well as the KH-9,
which are about to be launched.

436
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:12,000
Of course, the low-orbit spy satellites
are even more vulnerable.

437
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,510
If necessary,
we even have the capacity to destroy

438
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:21,270
the Skylab station that the West
plans on launching next year.

439
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:26,240
This is Red Coast.

440
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:29,070
You've come.

441
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,510
Wenjie, give us some privacy.

442
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,240
Yes.

443
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,960
Why did you tell her this?

444
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,390
Does she even believe it?

445
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:06,270
She believes it.

446
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,440
What's the point?

447
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,400
It's very risky
to disclose such information to her.

448
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,880
I know Ye Wenjie is indeed problematic,

449
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,000
but she is also very competent,
and she's got motivation.

450
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,110
She overshadows many people in the base.

451
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:29,550
What do you think we're doing here?

452
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:33,240
We need to make achievements.

453
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,640
Of course, we'll be doing it
for our country.

454
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:01,070
You picked me.

455
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:07,310
It was you who brought me to this base.

456
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,920
But you're too artless.

457
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,670
I can stay here for the rest of my life,

458
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:23,920
but even to this day,
you still don't trust me.

459
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:35,030
Sometimes,
trust can drag you into an abyss.

460
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:28,510
The next day, I was transferred
out of the Transmission Department.

461
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:35,320
I thought I'd never be able to
enter the core of Red Coast again.

462
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,190
So it was Chief Engineer Yang
who transferred you?

463
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:41,440
But it couldn't be.

464
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,110
In principle, Political Commissar Lei

465
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:46,510
had way greater powers
than Chief Engineer Yang.

466
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:51,280
After all, a political commissar
has the final say on all important affairs.

467
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,440
Obviously,
Lei Zhicheng made a personal decision

468
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,760
to tell me the Red Coast's true purpose.

469
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:04,480
I was really very grateful to him
for the trust he placed in me,

470
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:13,590
because trust was a luxury I dared
not even wish for at that time.

471
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,760
Maybe Chief Engineer Yang
was a somewhat prudent guy.

472
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,590
That was what I thought.

473
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:27,880
I felt Yang Weining was nothing more
than a typical intellectual of the period.

474
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:36,670
I found his actions understandable,
but we became estranged from each other.

475
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,710
Fortunately, Political Commissar Lei
trusted you.

476
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,400
Yeah.

477
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,760
I feel he's a serviceman.

478
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,280
He had a soldier’s frank
and forthright manners.

479
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:59,190
In fact, from then on,
everything changed.

480
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,190
What happened next?

481
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,000
When time gets involved,

482
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,800
the line between right and wrong
becomes blurry.

483
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,190
Take Lei Zhicheng for example.

484
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:21,230
I learnt much later
that all he told me was a lie.

485
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:24,190
A lie?

486
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,960
About the true purpose of Red Coast?

487
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,480
The true reason they built Red Coast

488
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:38,030
was far more important and complicated
than he said it was.

489
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,800
And far more incredible.

490
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:47,480
Wasn't Red Coast for reconnoitering

491
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,590
and destroying enemy countries'
communication satellites?

492
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,630
The true value of Red Coast…

493
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:18,190
Sorry, Wang, about this part,
I cannot tell you yet.

494
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,280
I understand.

495
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,440
Sorry, Ms. Ye.

496
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,000
I asked too many questions,
but I'm very grateful to you

497
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,440
for telling me
so many interesting past events.

498
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,360
Thank you.

499
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,760
Red Coast was a giant microwave oven?

500
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,880
Then why did they keep it secret?

501
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,880
Professor Ye didn't say
it's a microwave oven.

502
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,710
It's your job to find out what it was.

503
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:49,320
I know. I know.

504
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,880
The archives are still classified.

505
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,440
Chang has been rushing them,
and I've been rushing Chang.

506
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:00,660
Have you noticed this doubtful point?

507
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,840
Yang Weining.

508
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,400
What about him?

509
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,400
Yang Dong.

510
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,840
Yang Dong's surname was also Yang.

511
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,550
I was too embarrassed to ask her.

512
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,150
I can't believe this.

513
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,320
You are too thin-skinned.

514
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,030
Do you still remember
how I interrogated you that day?

515
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,760
I saw the look in your eyes
when you saw Yang Dong's picture.

516
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,480
Your eyes just lit up.

517
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,000
What did I say? I said "You know her?"

518
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,230
(Yang Dong)
You know her?

519
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:36,840
You don't know her,
but want to know her?

520
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,320
Don't overthink it.

521
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,280
I'm just telling you

522
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,670
a cop must not overlook any detail
when looking into a case.

523
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:47,920
I'm not a cop.

524
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,710
I know.

525
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:52,070
But it's the same thing, isn't it?

526
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,190
Did you solve the problems in the game?

527
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,070
I kind of made some progress.

528
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:02,070
But about the flying stars,
Professor Ye doesn't know much either.

529
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,070
Flying stars?

530
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:06,230
I think I…

531
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:09,510
You read it only this morning.

532
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,190
Yeah.

533
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,960
Sha Ruishan gave us this paper.

534
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,800
Do you know who wrote it?

535
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,320
Who?

536
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,550
Yang Dong's mother.

537
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,230
Ye Wenjie.

538
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,940
(Wenjie Ye
Tsinghua University)

539
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,700
(Stellar Structure and Evolution)

540
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,110
Stellar Structure and Evolution.

541
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:05,670
Professor Ye recommended this book
to me.

542
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:09,710
She said she quoted a lot
from this book when writing this paper.

543
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:12,190
I need to find this book
and read it asap.

544
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:15,710
I'll take this paper with me
and do some research.

545
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:16,800
I've got to go.

546
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,360
Alright.

547
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:34,110
Are you more suspicious
of Ye Wenjie now?

548
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:43,150
At first I just felt she took
Yang Dong's death too calmly.

549
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,230
(OS: Well.)

550
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:51,110
Her life remained completely unchanged.
(OS: It's time)

551
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,550
(OS: for cartoons.)

552
00:41:52,550 --> 00:42:00,150
She accepted the turkey theory,
helped Wang Miao observe cosmic flicker.

553
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:04,030
She encouraged Wang Miao
to follow Copernicus's example.

554
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:09,630
She's also an astrophysicist,
who wrote a paper about flying stars.

555
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:14,030
Just now Wang Miao said
that in the Red Coast Base,

556
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:17,230
she loved to see the sun,

557
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:22,320
but she's got nothing to do
with the Frontiers of Science.

558
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:31,590
It strikes me that she is the biggest
questionable point.

559
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,420
(Ye Wenjie)

560
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,940
(Ye Wenjie)

561
00:42:53,340 --> 00:43:00,500
