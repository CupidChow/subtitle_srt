1
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,030
Countdown.

2
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,470
It is a countdown.

3
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:43,470
No way.

4
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,280
In you go.

5
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,240
Dad, I'm home.

6
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,280
Change your shoes. Quickly.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,320
Go drink some water.
You'll do your homework soon.

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,520
Go.

9
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,640
Do drink the water.

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,150
You're home.

11
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,000
Li Yao.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,410
Take some pictures for me.

13
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,480
I thought you didn't want me
to use your camera.

14
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,870
Put those aside. Here.

15
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,640
Take some pictures for me.

16
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,790
Anything.

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,070
How do I use this?
I can't press the button.

18
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,400
Do this. Press here.

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,710
- Yeah.
- Like this?

20
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,560
Do it again after every shot.

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,150
Press this.

22
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,000
I'll take a picture of you.

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,270
Keep taking pictures. Anything.

24
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,950
OK.

25
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,920
Doudou, Mom will take a picture of you.

26
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,590
Not our daughter.

27
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,430
Not our daughter.

28
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,960
Take pictures of other stuff in our house.

29
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,750
Anything.

30
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,900
I'm used to digital cameras, I rarely…

31
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,400
Rarely use a film camera.

32
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,360
I'll leave you alone.

33
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,080
Just take more pictures.
Let me know once you're finished.

34
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,630
OK.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,280
The whole film?

36
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,910
Yes.

Wang Miao, I'm finished.

55
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,160
I'm finished.

56
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,710
What's the matter with you?

57
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,040
Your hand is so cold.

58
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,310
What's the matter with you?

59
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,190
Are you feeling ill?

60
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,190
I'm fine.

61
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,360
Let me know if you feel ill.

62
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,470
We'll go to the hospital.

63
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,800
No.

64
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,160
Not that.

65
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,480
Not that. Whatever it is.

66
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,270
Not me, please.

67
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,160
I don't want to see that.

68
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,630
I don't want to see that.

69
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,870
Nothing.

70
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,830
Nothing.

71
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,000
Just nothing.

72
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,190
Wang Miao, open the door.

73
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,750
What do you think of the pictures?

74
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,510
Pretty good.

75
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:30,470
It means I'm gifted.

76
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,510
Tell me, what's the matter with you?

77
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,240
You didn't look right back then.

78
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,320
And look at the sweat on your face.

79
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,870
The air-conditioner isn't on.

80
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,240
And the door was closed.
It was just the hot air.

81
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,840
I'll be fine after I let in
some fresh air. I'm alright.

82
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,840
You can't stay
in the darkroom for too long.

83
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,550
Wang Miao,
what's the matter with the pictures?

84
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,870
I see numbers on them.

85
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,840
Don't touch that.

86
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,190
What's wrong with you?

87
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,030
You look pretty uptight.

88
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,840
What, I can't touch it?

89
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,870
I'm studying
how the number got on the pictures.

90
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,370
It was printed on the picture, wasn't it?

91
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,150
No, the number was on it
when it was developed.

92
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,020
Well, it was on the film then.

93
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,080
Those are real-time numbers.

94
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,550
It's the camera's function.

95
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,120
A basic function of all modern cameras.

96
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
What is the image-forming principle?

97
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,910
What makes it photosensitive?

98
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,790
The photosensitive source
of the greatest possibility

99
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,670
is an external gamma-ray
of strong penetration power.

100
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,900
But it is technologically impossible.

101
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,660
Where is the source of the ray?

102
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,600
How can it be so precise?

103
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,070
It's right on the film.

104
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,620
All right, then. You take your time.

105
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,240
I'm going to make dinner.
I'll let you know when it's ready.

106
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,200
Don't you close the door again.

107
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,550
Hello.

108
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,670
Professor Wu.

109
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,720
Hi, Wang.

110
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,450
I'd like to ask you a question
about gamma-ray source.

111
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,630
Not only does it
identify backgrounds with precision

112
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,120
but it also does real-time projection.

113
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,720
Are you kidding me?

114
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,110
So you mean…

115
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,080
it's impossible.

116
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,440
Yes.

117
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,550
Unless it's paranormal power,
or else it's scientifically impossible.

118
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,240
I see.

119
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,080
Thank you.

120
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,910
(Fortune)

121
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,600
Coming.

122
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,830
What's up?

123
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,120
Do you have a camera? Can I use it?

124
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,150
Not a digital one, a film camera.

125
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,070
Wait a minute.

126
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,080
As far as I know, you're a photographer.
You wanna ask me for a camera?

127
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,960
What's with your fancy camera?

128
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,200
Well, I only have a digital camera.

129
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
That will do, too. Can I use it, please?

130
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,750
Wait a minute, then.

131
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,550
Mr. Wang, you don't look well.

132
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,630
Look at your face.

133
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,150
I took some random pictures.
Just delete them.

134
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,990
Thanks.

135
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:36,440
Easy. Don't overstrain yourself.

136
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,910
Li Yao, help me.

137
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,480
What?

138
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,390
- Come on. Take more pictures.
- Let me put it down.

139
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,000
What?

140
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,200
- Take more pictures for me.
- What's the matter with you?

141
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,150
- Take more pictures with this one.
- What is wrong with you…

142
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,550
Just do it!

143
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,390
Come on.

144
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,510
Shoot anything.

145
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,030
One more.

146
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,600
It's enough.

147
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,430
One more.

148
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,670
One more, over there.

149
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,390
One more.

150
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,510
Doudou.

151
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,120
- Hey, wait…
- Come on.

152
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,080
What's up, Daddy?

153
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,550
Take some pictures for Daddy, please.

154
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,600
Shoot the flowers.

155
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,550
Shoot the door.

156
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,630
Here, the television.

157
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,120
Take a picture of the TV.

158
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,910
There, take one.

159
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,840
The statue, take a picture of that.

160
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,630
- OK.
- Enough.

161
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,750
Give me a minute.

162
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,910
I'll grab my camera.
Let's do it together.

163
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,030
Wait, Wang Miao.

164
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,080
Wang Miao.

165
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,000
I know that you're stressed lately.

166
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,320
But you can talk to me.

167
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,630
I'm just playing a game with her.

168
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,190
It's fine.

169
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,080
Come on, Doudou.

170
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,830
Listen…

171
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,550
Take a picture of the bear.

172
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,030
- You…
- One, two, three.

173
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,440
Here, Doudou, let's swap cameras.

174
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,670
We'll take another picture of the bear.
One, two, three.

175
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,240
Do this.

176
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,320
Good.

177
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,030
Press the button.

178
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,390
Take more pictures. Still that.

179
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,390
It's me.

180
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,360
I'm the target.

181
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:49,300
(Wang Miao)

182
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,600
Hello, Shen.

183
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,870
Go over everything that Yang Dong
did before she killed herself.

184
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:59,440
If she did anything abnormal,
you let me know.

185
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,240
What did you see?

186
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,800
What did you see?
Why did you just stop the car?

187
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,830
What are you doing?

188
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,910
Open the door!

189
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,640
What did you see?

190
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,750
Why did you stop the car
all of a sudden?

191
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,720
Open the door!

192
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,070
Roll down the window!

193
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,240
Roll it down! Roll down the window!

194
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,270
What's your problem?

195
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,680
What did you see? Why you stopped?

196
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,680
You banged on your head?

197
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,270
Come on, get off.

198
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,880
Get off the car.

199
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,990
I'm asking you. What did you see?

200
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,200
Answer me! What did you see?

201
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,070
Why did you stop the car suddenly?

202
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,300
Answer me!

203
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,880
Answer me! What did you see?

204
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,550
What did you see?
Why you stopped the car?

205
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,150
I'm asking you! Answer me!

206
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:04,240
Answer me! Look at me!

207
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,680
Nothing. I saw nothing.

208
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,550
You saw nothing?

209
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,790
Why did you stop the car suddenly?

210
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,310
A car's headlight flashed me.

211
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,480
What's wrong with me stopping the car?

212
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,590
Where are you going?

213
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,710
I'll drive you there.

214
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,790
Are you following me?

215
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,720
I'm protecting you.

216
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,680
No, thanks.

217
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,550
I'm a researcher.

218
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:45,200
I have no money or power.

219
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,200
No one wants anything from me.

220
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,830
If your sanity is still with you,
just stop following me.

221
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:55,100
Is there something wrong with your head?

222
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:58,240
Stop following me.

223
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,750
What's the matter with you?

224
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,510
What the heck?

225
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:18,030
What are you doing
in the middle of the road?

226
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,750
Hey, you!

227
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,550
Are you out of your mind?

228
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,950
Get away, weirdo!

229
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,820
Move!

230
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,720
What are you doing?

231
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:27,900
(You mustn't disobey our Lord's will)

232
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,960
Where did you go?

233
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,880
Where were you?

234
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,400
I wanted to get the camera fixed,
but the car broke down.

235
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,750
I will get it fixed some other day.

236
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,310
What on earth is wrong with you?

237
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:26,400
My eyes aren't feeling right.

238
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,000
Then why did you drive a car?

239
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,510
I'm seeing things.

240
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,000
Let me see.

241
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,200
Look left.

242
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,030
Look right.

243
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,720
Up.

244
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,920
You look okay.

245
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,510
But I'm really seeing things.

246
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,720
Listen, an old classmate of mine,

247
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,830
Zhou Nan,
is an eye doctor at Tongren Hospital.

248
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,030
Go see him tomorrow.

249
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,510
He'll do an examination on you.

250
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,270
You'll get up and be there early.

251
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,880
So he can see you before work hours.

252
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:19,000
If I tell you that I'm seeing things
when my eyes are closed,

253
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,960
is it possible that it's not about eyes?

254
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,640
I'm a doctor.

255
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,880
We'll look into all possibilities.

256
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,070
First, ophthalmology. Then neurology.

257
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:31,550
We'll have a conclusion eventually.

258
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:36,440
Hope so.

259
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,440
I hope so.

260
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,750
Time for bed.

261
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:20,500
Where will we be 49 days later?

262
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,590
What?

263
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,590
Still here, no?

264
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:42,270
The medical term is
foreign body sensation.

265
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,870
It's not that.

266
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,440
I'm seeing a clear image.

267
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,070
If it's not supposed to be in your eyes,
it is a foreign body.

268
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,830
Muscae volitantes.

269
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,440
It is a common eye disease
that can happen to people our age.

270
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,750
Vitreous opacity.

271
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,480
It's a difficult one.

272
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,680
But it's no big deal.

273
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,720
I'll prescribe you
some eyewash and Vitamin D.

274
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,480
Maybe it'll be gone.

275
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,400
But I'm not sure.

276
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,440
You mentioned muscae volitantes.

277
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,110
What will the patients see?

278
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,000
It varies from person to person.

279
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,200
Some see small black dots.

280
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,270
Some see tadpole-shaped objects.

281
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:32,720
What if I say I see a string of numbers?

282
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,510
3.1415926?

283
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:40,640
I'm not joking.

284
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:45,790
Seriously, a string of numbers
is in the middle of my field of vision.

285
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,480
You are exhausted.

286
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,480
Li Yao talked to me about you
at our last classmate reunion party.

287
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,880
She said that you were too stressed.

288
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,070
We're not young anymore.
We need to take things easy.

289
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:02,030
You can't afford to hurt your body.

290
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:09,510
So you mean it's a mental disease?

291
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:15,070
I would advise others
to try the department of psychiatry,

292
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,750
but that's unnecessary for you.

293
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,400
You've just been tired.

294
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,790
Take some days off.

295
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:25,960
Enjoy a vacation with Li Yao
and your daughter.

296
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,310
By the way, what's her name?

297
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,720
Doudou, right?

298
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,310
Have fun together.

299
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,270
Trust me.

300
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:34,720
You'll be fine soon.

301
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,150
It's a countdown like this.

302
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,300
Right in front of my eyes.

303
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,480
The countdown keeps going
second by second.

304
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,270
Is it a mental disease, too?

305
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:55,110
You want to know how mental stress
can affect your eyes?

306
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:59,790
Last month,
I saw a girl about 15 years old.

307
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:02,720
She just couldn't see anything
for no reason in the classroom.

308
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,830
She went totally blind.

309
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,590
She had a full examination,

310
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:09,750
but her eyes were
completely okay physically.

311
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,680
And then, she received a one-month therapy

312
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,070
from the experts
in psychiatry department.

313
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:19,960
All of a sudden,
she just got her eyesight back.

314
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,680
No other organic disease whatsoever.

315
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,790
It's called muscae volitantes, you know.

316
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,270
Eye floaters, you know.

317
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,590
I'm serious, Zhou Nan.

318
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,510
But the medical records
can back me up as well.

319
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,000
Li Yao is a doctor, too.

320
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,480
You can ask her.

321
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:47,020
(National Center
for Nanoscience and Technology)

322
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,240
Zhou Nan told me
that muscae volitantes is a tricky one.

323
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,270
But it won't cause much trouble in life.

324
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,640
So don't worry about it.

325
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,030
I don't have muscae volitantes.

326
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:44,960
He told me that what you described
simply doesn't exist.

327
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,310
That's exactly why I'm scared.

328
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:53,240
Why would you be scared
of something that doesn't exist?

329
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,190
But it's right in front of my eyes.

330
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:58,240
It's right there.

331
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:04,350
Do you mean you are seeing a ghost,
Professor Wang?

332
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,790
Li Yao.

333
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:13,030
What if I tell you
that beyond us humans,

334
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:16,400
there's a more advanced civilization?

335
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,110
We'll call it the Farmer.

336
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,920
In the eyes of the Farmer,

337
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,540
all humans
are a bunch of turkeys on the farm.

338
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,300
I'm a turkey scientist.

339
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,640
And you are a turkey doctor.

340
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,440
What do you think of that?

341
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:34,030
So the advanced civilization

342
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,960
enjoys putting a countdown
in your eyes, huh?

343
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,440
Is the end of the countdown

344
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,960
the Thanksgiving Day
of the advanced civilization?

345
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,470
It's a very constructive viewpoint.

346
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:50,310
But why is it in my eyes, not yours?

347
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,240
Who are you calling at late night?

348
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,750
A feeder on the farm.

349
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,350
Hello, Dr. Shen.

350
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,630
I'm Wang Miao.

351
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:08,000
I would like to have a chat
with you in person.

352
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,590
Hello?

353
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,900
(One message from Shen Yufei)

354
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:21,340
(No. 9 Shayang Road, Houyu Town.
From Shen Yufei)

355
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,000
The model is RX8620.

356
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,480
The Superconductivity Research Center
has one, too.

357
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,550
It costs millions.

358
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:19,030
I'm here to see Shen Yufei.

359
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,630
She's dealing with something
in the study upstairs.

360
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:29,110
That one. You'll see her there.

361
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,280
I talked to experts from various fields.

362
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,150
They all said it was impossible.

363
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:06,550
But right now,
it's right in front of my eyes.

364
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,480
The countdown is on.

365
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,960
Like this one.

366
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,480
Professor Wang,

367
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,420
how's the nanoscience project going
under your leadership?

368
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,360
The nanoscience project?

369
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,630
Is that relevant?

370
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,440
They are completely
two different fields of knowledge.

371
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,360
Stop your research.

372
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,400
What?

373
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,110
What did you say?

374
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,920
Stop?

375
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,280
It is a key national project.

376
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,190
The research team
has spent over a decade on it.

377
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:16,550
You ask me to terminate it.
There has to be a reason.

378
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:20,550
Just try it.

379
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,880
Tell me what you know.

380
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,440
This is all that I can tell you.

381
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,070
I can't.

382
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,590
It's not happening.

383
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:37,400
Try it.

384
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,880
It is serious.

385
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,360
Do you know
that we are the one and only

386
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:46,250
research team that
does nano experiments in that area?

387
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:51,180
I know that we've hit
a bottleneck at the moment.

388
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:54,440
I know we can't put it into
mass production.

389
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,280
If we can't solve the problem,
someone else will.

390
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,190
But I won't give up.

391
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:03,030
I certainly hope that the problem
can be solved under my leadership.

392
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:09,480
Again, try to stop it.

393
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,980
I will not accept that
I'm a turkey scientist.

394
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,920
Most of the scholars
who committed suicide

395
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:27,150
had some connection
with the Frontiers of Science.

396
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,320
The Frontiers of Science
is more than a basic-theory

397
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,840
academic exchange organization
as you self-declared.

398
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:47,090
Your connection with real life
is way more complicated than I imagined.
