it was suicide by overdosing on
sleeping pills.

91

several scientists committed suicide)

(Now, what do you think of
the scientists' suicides recently?)

107
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,600
(I always believe that the over-development
of science and technology)

108
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,670
(is a disease of human society.)

109
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:48,720
(The explosive development of technology
is like the rapid spread of cancer cells.)

(In the end,
the hosts will both be killed.)

113

Coming.

114
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,150
(As a scientist,
I've only realized it earlier than others.)

115
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:07,480
(So in your opinion,
what should we do to avoid...)

116
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,150
You are...

117
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,750
Are you Wang Miao?

118
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,950
Excuse me, you can't smoke here.

119
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,510
Captain Shi.

120
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,630
Sorry, Professor Wang.

121
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,840
We're with the Public Security Bureau.

122
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,240
This is Captain Shi Qiang.

123

Fine.

124
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,480
The hallway, we can talk in the hallway.

125
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,500
Sorry, you can't smoke there either.

126
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,900
(Please keep the hallway clean
and do not smoke)

127
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,750
What can I do for you?

128
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,750
Professor Wang, we want to know
if you've had any recent contacts with members

129
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,080
of the Frontiers of Science.

130
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,550
Have you?

131
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,240
The Frontiers of Science
is a very influential

132
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,870
international academic organization
full of famous scholars.

133
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,270
And it's legal.

134
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,630
Why can't I have contact with it?

135
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,860
Look at the way you talk.

136
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,030
Did I say anything
about it not being legal?

137
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,320
Did I say anything about you not
being allowed to contact them?

138
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,600
Did I?

139
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,270
Please respect my privacy.

140
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,960
I don't need to answer your questions.

141
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,870
Your privacy, seriously?

142
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,120
You're a famous academic.

143
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,630
Don't you have a responsibility toward
the public welfare?

144
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,900
As an average citizen,
I also have the right to not answer.

145
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,910
Please leave.

146
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,480
Wait!

147
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,000
Did I permit you to close the door?

148
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,080
Give him the address and phone number.

149
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,390
You can come by in the afternoon.

150
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,870
What are you really after?

151
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,000
What are we really after? I...

152
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,910
Professor Wang.

153
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,390
Just now...

154
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,730
Please don't misunderstand.

155
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,390
There's an important meeting
this afternoon,

156
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,360
to which several scholars
and specialists are invited.

157
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,310
The general sent us to invite you.

158
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,550
I'm busy this afternoon.

159
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,790
I know.

160
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,440
You have an interview with
two science magazines.

161
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,550
And your lab has a meeting at 3 o'clock.

162
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,440
Don't worry.

163
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,790
We have rescheduled those for you.

164
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,670
The general already spoke with the head
of the Nanotechnology Research Center.

165
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,630
This is my ID.

166
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,200
OK.

167
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,080
I'll be there on time.

168
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,440
How could a scientist be so rude?

169
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,910
Captain Shi, let's go.

170
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,510
What's wrong with Shi Qiang?

171
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,080
The general specifically requested him.

172
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,030
I guess he must have
some special skills.

173
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,360
How can a man like that be part of
the Battle Command Center?

174
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,150
Battle Command Center?

175
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,780
Please wait here for a moment.

176
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,600
Someone will pick you up.

177
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,790
OK, thanks.

178
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,360
(Strengthen the monitoring)

179
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,990
(of the six field observatories
of Purple Mountain Observatory,)

180
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,200
(including Delhi Radio Astronomical
Observatory of Qinghai Province,)

181
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,960
(Xuyi Celestial Mechanics Observatory
of Jiangsu Province,)

182
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,550
(Ganyu Solar Observatory
of Jiangsu Province,)

183
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,740
(Honghe Observatory
of Heilongjiang Province,)

184
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,780
(Qingdao Observatory
of Shandong Province,)

185
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,620
(Yao'an Observatory of Yunnan Province.)

186
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,910
(The meeting will start in ten minutes.)

187
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,790
(All departments, please get ready)

188
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,930
Professor Wang.

189
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,490
(and attend the meeting on time.)

190
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,750
I'm sorry.

191
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,600
I was too rude this morning.

192
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,840
My leader criticized me
and let me pick you up

193
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,200
in order to apologize to you.

194
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,670
What do you think of the place?

195
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,070
Do you think it's strange?

196
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,360
Everyone thinks it's strange
when they first come here.

197
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,550
Why is such a secret organization
set up in this place?

198
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,020
It was supposed to be an art museum.

199
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,870
But it was requisitioned before opening.

200
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,840
Come on, let me give you a tour.

201
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,900
Come.

202
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,720
I hear that you're researching
some kind of
new material?

203
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,360
Yes.

204
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,600
Nanomaterial.

205
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,240
I heard that a strand of that stuff could be
used to lift up a truck.

206
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,790
If criminals steal some
and make it into a knife,

207
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:52,320
can't they slice a truck
in half with one stroke?

208
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,750
First, there's no need to
even make it into a knife.

209
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,240
That kind of material can be made

210
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,510
into a line as thin as
one-hundredth of a hair.

211
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,120
If you string it across a road,

212
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,870
a passing car would be
sliced into two halves like cheese.

213
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:09,190
Second,
what can't be used for criminal purposes?

214
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,870
Even a dull knife
for descaling a fish can.

215
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,910
You're right.

216
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,510
Even a fish can be made into a weapon.

217
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,870
I handled a murder case once.

218
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,430
You know what the murder weapon was?

219
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,670
A frozen tilapia
taken out from the freezer.

220
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:24,150
The spines along its back
were like razors.

221
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,510
You're Captain Shi Qiang, right?

222
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,480
Yes.

223
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,480
That's me.

224
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,030
Did you ask me to the meeting
just to talk about this?

225
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,030
No, no, no.

226
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,120
Nothing to do with those.

227
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,270
I was chatting with you
and showing you around. Look.

228
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,720
This museum is enlightening.

229
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,480
It tells us that all human beings
will eventually die.

230
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,510
After they die, they'll become
big skeletons like this.

231
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,110
I don't agree with you.

232
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,270
We'll be cremated after we die.

233
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,480
And this is a fossil.

234
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,860
Right.

235
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,720
Do you think there will be sarira
after scientists are cremated?

236
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,960
Come on.

237
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,750
Let's walk and chat.

238
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,270
Comrades, let me introduce our guests
before the meeting.

239
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:16,630
This is a marines colonel of Country M
in the North American Combat Zone,

240
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,600
Mr. Stanton.

241
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,750
This is an army colonel of Country T,
Mr. Mike.

242
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,620
Meanwhile, they are liaisons of the

243
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:32,380
North American Combat Zone
and the European Combat Zone.

244
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,320
These two comrades...

245
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,310
All these guys want is to
get information out of us,

246
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:43,030
but they never tell us anything.

247
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,120
As for Oceania, Asia...

248
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,720
I've been here for a while,

249
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,750
and I still don't know anything,
just like you.

250
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,600
...and the United Nations,

251
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,960
I won't introduce
their representatives one by one.

252
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,080
Comrades, let's get started.

253
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,110
Yes.

254
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:02,480
Today,

255
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,380
Comrades.

256
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,120
- We call each other comrades here.
(OS: - I will brief all comrades)

257
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,790
Comrades.

258
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,670
(OS: at the meeting.)

259
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,080
(Asian Defense Council)
Of all the combat zones around the globe,

260
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,840
this one has become the focal point.

261
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,390
Recently, the enemy has intensified
the pattern of attacks.

262
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:26,960
Their targets remain elite scientists.

263
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,840
(Professor David, a pioneer)

264
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,120
(in the detection of cosmic neutrino
of Gadayork University,)

265
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,790
(committed suicide a month ago.)

266
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,360
(Hart, the astrophysicist of Country A,
committed suicide 13 days ago.)

267
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,790
(Country T is the disaster zone
of scientists' suicides.)

268
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,150
(Professor August in the field
of precision spectroscopy,)

269
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,750
(Professor Bauer who engaged in nuclear
structure study, and another three scientists)

270
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,240
(died one after another.)

271
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,440
Recently, the number of scientists that
committed suicide around the globe

272
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,240
has increased sharply.

273
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,030
In front of you is a list
of scientists that committed suicide.

274
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,910
Take a look.

275
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,160
Professor Wang,
as you look through these names,

276
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,270
does anything strike you?

277
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:25,100
They are all famous scholars
working at the forefront of...

278
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,340
(Yang Dong)

279
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,960
(Yang Dong)

280
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,720
You know her?

281
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,670
You don't know her,
but want to know her?

282
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,830
All the physicists on this list

283
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:58,790
have committed suicide
in the last two months.

284
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,150
When did this happen?

285
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,510
Professor Wang means the last name.

286
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,880
Yang Dong, right?

287
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,350
Yang Dong was the last
to commit suicide.

288
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:13,550
Two nights ago,
she overdosed on sleeping pills.

289
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:18,440
She died very peacefully. No pain.

290
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,710
Why did they do this?

291
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,310
The only thing we can be sure of is

292
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:28,030
the same reason
drove all of them to suicide.

293
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:36,240
Most scientists questioned in their
suicide notes that physics didn't exist.

294
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,720
The document contains
their suicide notes.

295
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,030
Everyone can examine them
after the meeting.

296
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,590
Yang Dong's isn't included.

297
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,830
Dr. Ding, would you please show
Yang Dong's note to Professor Wang?

298
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,960
Hers is the shortest and
the most representative.

299
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,510
Thanks.

300
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,030
He was Yang's boyfriend.

301
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:15,480
I know.

302
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,350
You know?

303
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,100
He's a famous physicist
who discovered the macroatom

304
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,820
while studying ball lightning.

305
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,030
All the evidence
points to a single conclusion:

306
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:33,680
physics has never existed,
and will never exist.

307
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:37,880
I know what I'm doing is irresponsible.

308
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,160
But I have no choice.

309
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,480
Physics doesn't exist.

310
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,270
Today we'll discuss
an organization called

311
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,240
the Frontiers of Science.

312
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,000
According to our investigation,

313
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,030
most of the scientists
who committed suicide

314
00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:00,070
had some connection with the organization.

315
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,550
Dr. Ding,
since you're a theoretical physicist,

316
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:07,350
can you give us more background on it?

317
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:11,510
I have no direct connection
with the Frontiers of Science,

318
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,640
but it is famous in academia.

319
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,660
Its core goal is a response
to the following:

320
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,880
since the second half
of the twentieth century,

321
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,160
physics has gradually lost

322
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,350
the concision and simplicity
of its classical theories.

323
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:24,830
Modern theoretical models have become
more and more complex, vague, and uncertain.

324
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,880
So they want to use

325
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,510
the methods of science
to discover the limits of science,

326
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,920
to try to find out if there is a limit

327
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,680
to how deeply and precisely
science can know nature,

328
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,350
a boundary beyond which
science cannot go.

329
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,790
But with the development
of modern physics,

330
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:44,510
humans seem to have touched such a line.

331
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,790
Dr. Ding, could you make it clearer?

332
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:55,070
I've made it clear enough.

333
00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:04,160
Dr. Ding, sorry for your loss.

334
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:16,260
♪Unity means power♪

335
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,160
♪The power is iron, the power is steel♪

336
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,470
♪But it is harder and stronger♪

337
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:28,440
♪Firing at Fascism, we fight♪

338
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:35,450
♪We'll wipe out all the systems
not democratic♪

339
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:39,440
Let me introduce myself, Chang Weisi.

340
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,720
According to our investigation,

341
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,580
most of the scholars
who committed suicide

342
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:48,440
had some connection
with the Frontiers of Science,

343
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,550
and some were even members.

344
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:56,110
Of course, they've committed no crime.

345
00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:01,070
We heard that
they contacted you recently, right?

346
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,270
Yes.

347
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,150
They invited me to their gatherings.

348
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:08,680
Could you tell us more details?

349
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,960
Yeah.

350
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,480
Including the names of your contacts,
the times and locations of meetings,

351
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,510
the content of your conversations,
and if you exchanged letters or e-mails...

352
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,480
Shi, behave yourself.

353
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,350
This isn't an interrogation.

354
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:30,880
Professor Wang, go ahead.

355
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,830
The one who invited me was Shen Yufei,
a foreign physicist.

356
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,190
She currently works for
a foreign-invested company,

357
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,110
researching nanotech.

358
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,160
We met at a

359
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,440
(Shen Yufei)
technical conference.

360
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,830
At the conference,

361
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,480
she introduced a few
other physicists to me,

362
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,510
some Chinese, some foreign.

363
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,510
And then?

364
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,640
Then nothing.

365
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,590
We don't have many common topics.

366
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,000
Why?

367
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,500
My work is in applied research,

368
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,640
but they talked about
fundamental physics.

369
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,920
I don't know much about
theoretical matters.

370
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,910
So, basically, I was listening to
their discussions and arguments.

371
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:11,240
But all of them were deep thinkers
with novel points of view.

372
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:16,110
Though I was only listening,
I felt that I was opening my mind.

373
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:19,670
Didn't they ask you to join them?

374
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,000
They did.

375
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,030
But my time and energy were limited,
so I declined.

376
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,240
Tell the truth.

377
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,350
That's what I'm doing.

378
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:32,000
I don't need to hide anything from you.

379
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:36,000
If physics doesn't exist,
what will happen to your nanotech?

380
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,240
I said my work was in applied research.

381
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,310
Even if physics doesn't exist,
I can still carry on nano experiments.

382
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:47,920
Professor Wang, the main reason
we invited you over today

383
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,310
is to ask you to join the organization.

384
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,500
We'd like to learn more about

385
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,880
the internal workings
of the organization.

386
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:02,820
You want me to be a mole?

387
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,790
A mole!

388
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,830
What's so funny?

389
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,480
You're right.

390
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,400
We just want to know
some internal information.

391
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,920
I'm sorry, General.

392
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,240
I cannot do this.

393
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,440
Professor Wang.

394
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,480
It's complicated to investigate
this organization.

395
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,310
For us,
it's like walking across thin ice.

396
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:33,350
Without your support,
we cannot make any progress.

397
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:40,160
I am very busy at work.

398
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,920
I just don't have the time.

399
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,070
I'm so sorry.

400
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:47,580
Thank you for coming here today.

401
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:52,190
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

402
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,480
It's better this way.

403
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,550
I disagree with the plan anyway.

404
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,550
So many bookworms
have already killed themselves.

405
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:02,280
If we send him, he'd be a meat dumpling
thrown to the dogs.

406
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,030
The way you speak is not
appropriate for a good police officer.

407
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:08,030
I'm not a good cop anyway.

408
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,830
We don't know why
these scholars killed themselves.

409
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,440
You shouldn't
speak of them so contemptuously.

410
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,160
Their minds have made
so many contributions to humanity.

411
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,820
They're irreplaceable.

412
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,640
What do you mean?

413
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,440
You're saying they're better than me?

414
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,440
At least I wouldn't kill myself just because
someone told me some bullshit.

415
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,680
Professor Wang,
I have no confidence in you.

416
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,070
Not at all, really.

417
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,480
You think I would kill myself too?

418
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,310
I have to be concerned
about your safety.

419
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,750
There's no need.

420
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,660
I would be much safer than you
in such situations.

421
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,240
A person's ability to discern the truth

422
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,920
is directly proportional
to his knowledge.

423
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,480
I'm not sure about that.

424
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,310
A man as vulnerable as you...

425
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,470
Shi!

426
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,510
Let him speak.

427
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:51,750
Maybe some people just can't understand
what kind of person a scientist is.

428
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,160
Anyway, I must warn you
not to go to the Frontiers of Science.

429
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,640
You mustn't go to
the Frontiers of Science.

430
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,480
The dead can't be brought back to life.

431
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,720
I don't want to see anyone die again.

432
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,160
I want him to remain alive after a while.

433
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,960
Shi, get out.

434
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,590
Of course I'll stay alive.

435
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,960
But I never want to see you again.

436
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,350
Anyhow, I want to see you again.

437
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,110
That's just his personality.

438
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:30,720
He's actually a very experienced
criminal police and anti-terrorism expert.

439
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,480
Over 20 years ago,
he was a soldier in my company.

440
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,510
Given the current situation,
we really need him.

441
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:44,550
Professor Wang,
you can ask me any questions.

442
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,550
General Chang,

443
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:51,200
what did everything you talked about
have to do with the military?

444
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,750
War has everything to do with the army.

445
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,790
War?

446
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,670
Where is this war?

447
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:01,070
There isn't any hot spot in the world.

448
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:05,500
This is probably the most
peaceful period in history.

449
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:12,070
Soon,
you and everyone will know everything.

450
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:19,920
Do you mean that
we are teetering on the brink of war?

451
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:25,000
Professor Wang,
I have a personal question for you.

452
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,740
Have you ever had anything
happen to you before?

453
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,920
I mean the thing that
changed your life completely,

454
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,480
like when you wake up from sleep,

455
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,590
you find the world has become
a totally different place.

456
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,100
No.

457
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:49,920
Then your life has been fortunate.

458
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:54,830
The world is big
and full of unpredictable factors,

459
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:59,830
yet you have never faced a crisis.

460
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,680
But that's true of most lives.

461
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,960
Then most people have lived fortunately.

462
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,480
But many generations
have lived in this plain manner.

463
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,720
All fortunate.

464
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,590
No, General Chang,

465
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,200
I have to confess that
I'm not feeling very sharp today.

466
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,880
Are you suggesting that...

467
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,470
Yes.

468
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:27,110
The humankind has been fortunate.

469
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:32,750
From the Stone Age till now,
no real crisis has occurred.

470
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,920
We've been very lucky.

471
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,590
But if it's all luck,
then it has to end one day.

472
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:42,070
Let me tell you, it's ended.

473
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:45,550
Prepare for the worst.

474
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,790
Then...

475
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,070
The car is waiting.

476
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:52,160
Goodbye, Professor Wang.

477
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,960
The number of scientists that

478
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,390
committed suicide around the globe
has increased sharply.

479
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:22,030
Anyway, I must warn you
not to go to the Frontiers of Science.

480
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,680
You mustn't go to
the Frontiers of Science.

481
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,030
The dead can't be brought back to life.

482
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:29,680
Her death is related
to her scientific findings.

483
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,550
All the evidence
points to a single conclusion:

484
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:39,030
physics has never existed,
and will never exist.

485
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:42,160
I know what I'm doing is irresponsible.

486
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,680
But I have no choice.

487
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,830
(Welcome to)

488
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,110
(10 months ago)
(Sinotron II High-energy Particle Accelerator Base.)

489
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:52,270
Mr. Wang,
are you shooting the accelerator?

490
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,720
(Liangxiang Accelerator Base)
Have you checked everything?

491
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,550
Rest assured.

492
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,960
(45 minutes before the collision
experiment) The nano-components

493
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,000
our lab provided
for the accelerator is perfect.

494
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,300
The accelerator will finally be
put in use today.

495
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,830
Having cost more than 20 billion yuan,

496
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:07,030
it's the third one in the world
and the first in Asia.

497
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,790
I never thought that

498
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,440
such a young scientist would be
in charge of its first operation.

499
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,070
Dr. Yang Dong,
the results have come out.

500
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,160
Here is the test report.

501
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,790
The Superstring Theory's
collider test data.

502
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:23,630
Do you think this set of data is normal?

503
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:26,440
The three sets are not correlated.

504
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:32,630
But, Dr. Qian Xuesen said,
the abnormal is normal.

505
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,260
But I'm curious.

506
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,550
Where did the data come from?

507
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:40,440
Liangxiang Accelerator Experiment Base.

508
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,550
You know, my student, Yang Dong,

509
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,590
(Liangxiang Accelerator Base)
just started the experiment.

510
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:48,400
(15 minutes before the collision experiment)
It isn't finished, not are the data out.

511
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,240
There's nothing in the experiment.

512
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,480
Impossible.

513
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,960
So where did you get the data from?

514
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,230
Liangxiang Accelerator Experiment Base.

515
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:01,680
These are the experiment data
Yang Dong will receive today.

516
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,240
(Accelerate protons.)

517
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,100

(Particle velocity
is 99% of the light velocity.)

527
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:40,140
(Liangxiang Accelerator Base)

528
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,440
Are the measurements incorrect?

529
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,510
Yeah.

530
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,070
No accuracy.

531
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,200
Miss fit of data.

532
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,480
Please fax me the results.

533
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:18,920
No test results. Not accurate.
And yet, you get them before.

534
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,260
Who are you?

535
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,070
How did you get these results?

536
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:26,240
Look at it.

537
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:37,000
It tries hard, climbing over the bricks,
over the steel, the glass.

538
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,240
Through the glass, it sees you and me.

539
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,440
It thinks it couldn't get in

540
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,550
because it hasn't found
the crack on the glass yet.

541
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:53,680
It believes a crack must exist.

542
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:00,030
I can give it the crack.

543
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:05,110
But it got no choice.

544
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:45,880
Buddha bless my lord
to get out of misery.

545
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,790
It doesn't exist.

546
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:53,400
Not all these nonsense.

547
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:24,180
(Ten months later)

548
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,630
Organize these later.

549
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,150
Pay attention to this.

550
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,670
All these stuff should be sealed.

551
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:39,830
Ding Yi is a good choice.

552
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:45,400
First of all, he's a scientist
working in fundamental physics.

553
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,150
And also, he was Yang Dong's fiancee.

554
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:53,510
If he joins the Frontiers of Science,
it'll be advantageous to us.

555
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,000
I don't think so.

556
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,110
Why?

557
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:59,550
The members of the Frontiers of Science
are mostly

558

559

is far from mass production.
