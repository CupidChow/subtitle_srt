9
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,190
Last night, some branches
of our organization in Europe

10
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,510
were purged
by the Battle Command Center.

11
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,240
All of them were the Redemptionists.


12
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,210
Not a member
of the Adventists was purged.

13
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,030
It was led by the Battle Command Center,


14
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:39,190
but I doubt
Pan Han and his men were behind it.

15
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:44,350
They must have had something to do
with Shen Yufei's death.

16
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,460
Commander.


17
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,740
Please don't go.


18
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,310
If you attend Shen Yufei's funeral,


19
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,910
the Battle Command Center
will target you,

20
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,180
and the Adventists
will question your stance.

21
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:40,130
I want to bid farewell to Shen Yufei.


22
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,690
If you knew what happened last night,


23
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,840
you'd be even more desperate.


24
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,120
I had moments of despair,


25
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,630
but now


26
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:10,580
I pinned my hope on unknown kindness.


27
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,340
Kindness.


28
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,190
At the scale of the universe,


29
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,980
kindness is small, like dust.


30
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,370
Only when you understand these things


31
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,740
will you give up all hope.


32
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,660
Buddha bless you.


33
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,540
What are you thinking about?


34
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,270
Shen Yufei.


35
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,800
She worked to
solve the Three-Body Problem,

36
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,630
but in the end,
she realized there was no answer.

37
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,740
She sank into despair.


38
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,240
She was going to renovate
the dilapidated house for Trisolarans,

39
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,750
but only to realize
after all these years that

40
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,010
they planned to invade her planet.


41
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,720
It seems like Shen Yufei was not bad.


42
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,750
In the Three-Body players' meet-up,


43
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,510
Pan Han was always preaching
about the coming of Lord.

44
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,870
He never mentioned
how to solve the Three-Body Problem.

45
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,390
So, within the ETO,


46
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,240
they hold different opinions
about the Lord.

47
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,870
Yeah.


48
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,500
We should
have turned Shen Yufei.

49
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,430
Well, last night,


50
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,220
many ETOs were purged
around the world.

51
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,800
Let's go.


52
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,390
Where are you going?


53
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,920
Get back to the game.


54
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,950
After being admitted as their comrade,


55
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,720
I want to see if the game
will enter a new process.

56
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,660
That's right.
Ask them to open a private server.

57
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,270
According to the decoded files,
it's a repair diary

58
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,920
from the Three-Body games from which
we managed to trace their source.

59
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,190
Attack it.


60
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,510
Which sect are other servers located in?


61
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,750
According to the position,
momentarily Europe.

62
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,190
Momentarily?


63
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,000
The server isn't actually
located on earth,

64
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,240
but is orbiting
on an artificial satellite

65
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,010
24,000 kilometers in space.


66
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,950
Contact the Space Department now.


67
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,770
Contact NASA now.


68
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,980
(Log on Three-Body game  Yes No)


69
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,620
(Game manager interface is opened.)


70
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:17,010
(Are you sure to close the game?)


71
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,920
(Attention.)


72
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,390
(Server of Three-Body will be closed.)


73
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,430
(Free login for the rest of the time.)


74
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,980
(Three-Body will take you
to the last scene.)

75
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,510
Great Copernicus,
why have you come so late?

76
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,830
What's going on?


77
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,310
Why is everything gone?


78
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,630
The pyramid is gone.


79
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:34,670
The United Nations Headquarters is gone.
Even the huge Pendulum Monument is gone.

80
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,940
Don't feel so bad.


81
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,650
We will have more buildings.


82
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,510
What's that?


83
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,390
Stone?


84
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,120
That's your delusion.


85
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,270
It's people.
Hundreds of millions of people.

86
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,870
Almost everyone
in the Three-Body world is here.

87
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,600
What are they doing here?


88
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,990
Waiting for the expedition.


89
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,360
Three cycles of civilizations
have passed,

90
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,740
and you've missed
many great enterprises.

91
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,960
What are these?


92
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,200
Are they stars?


93
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,240
They are greater than stars.


94
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,390
I have never seen such a formation.


95
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,000
More than 30 stars along each edge
of the formation.

96
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,030
A total of more than a thousand stars.


97
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,510
They look less like stars
and more like artificial formation.

98
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:21,290
The Trisolaran Interstellar Fleet.


99
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,750
It's about to begin its expedition.


100
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,750
Trisolaran civilization has already achieved
the capacity for interstellar flight?

101
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,080
Yes.


102
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,150
All those magnificent ships
can reach one-tenth the speed of light.

103
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,910
One-tenth the speed of light?


104
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,000
That is a great accomplishment,
as far as I understand it,

105
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,910
but it still seems too slow
for interstellar flight.

106
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,200
The journey of a thousand miles
begins with the first step.

107
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,790
The key is finding
the right destination.

108
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,080
What's the fleet's destination?


109
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,870
A star with planets
about four light-years away.

110
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,510
That's the closest star
to the Trisolaran system.

111
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,600
Four light-years?


112
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,200
The closest star to us is also
about four light-years away.

113
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,440
You?


114
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,390
The Earth.


115
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,960
That's not very surprising.


116
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,840
In most regions of the Milky Way,
the distribution of stars is fairly even.

117
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,750
It's the result of star clusters
acting under the influence of gravity.

118
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:14,500
The distance between most stars is
between three and six light-years.

119
00:10:22,000 --> 00:11:04,860
Three-Body! Three-Body! Three-Body!


120
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:19,170
We captured the satellite as soon as possible
and began our investigations.

121
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,200
Execute signal search command
of satellite position.

122
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,150
What's going on
in the North American Combat Zone?

123
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,550
Help the satellite...


124
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,870
Number 5811.


125
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,030
Members of the ETO have been controlled.


126
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,410
The email has been cc'ed.


127
00:11:38,440 --> 00:12:10,960
Three-Body! Three-Body! Three-Body!


128
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,080
People are not willing to leave.


129
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,080
That's their hope.


130
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,080
We wouldn't know the outcome
of the launch in our lifetimes,

131
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,030
but four or five hundred years from now,


132
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:24,080
our descendants will receive the news
from a new world.

133
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,890
That'll be the beginning of a new life
for the Trisolaran Civilization.

134
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:41,670
(The Trisolaran Expedition
to the new world has begun.)

135
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,030
(The fleet is still in flight.)


136
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,960
(Three-Body is over.)


137
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,630
(When you have returned
to the real world,)

138
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,510
(if you remain true
to the promise you've made,)

139
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,910
(please attend the meet-up
of the Earth-Trisolaris Organization.)

140
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:58,050
(The address will be
in the follow-up e-mail you receive.)

141
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:03,910
We've managed to block all the signals
to and from the satellite.

142
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,870
The Three-Body game


143
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,980
has been shut down.


144
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,240
The Trisolaran Expedition
to the new world has begun.

145
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,860
The fleet is still in flight.


146
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,120
Their destination


147
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,340
is the Earth.


148
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,080
In theory,


149
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,220
many satellites are
four light-years away.

150
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,870
But if their destination is not the Earth,
are they doing all this?

151
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,840
The interrogation of the ETO members
has been going truly well,

152
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,840
and we will have updates
for you all soon.

153
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,030
The exciting news for a long time.


154
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:54,890
We can call this
an unprecedented victory.

155
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,530
This is far from a victory.


156
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:08,000
As the Chinese saying goes,
no success in the revolution yet,

157
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,050
so hard work is still needed.


158
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,720
We only knew Trisolarans
are heading for the Earth.

159
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,650
It's not a victory at all.


160
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,870
While you were playing the game,


161
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,270
the Battle Command Center


162
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:30,600
already attacked
their server on satellite.

163
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,790
At this critical moment, they kept
operating and announced the finale.

164
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,460
They are tough.


165
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:43,750
It showed
they weren't afraid of your attack,

166
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,580
or they have prepared for it.


167
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,770
It's the same with Chang's safe houses.
They knew everything.

168
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,820
In the war against Trisolarans,
we seem to have no secret to them.

169
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,820
How far are they from us?


170
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,600
Four light-years.


171
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,770
Four light-years.


172
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,820
How soon will they arrive?


173
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,910
The Trisolaran Fleet flights
at one-tenth the speed of light.

174
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,200
It should take


175
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
only 40 years.


176
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,890
But they said in the game that
it would take more than 400 years.

177
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,080
Why?


178
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,150
Did you or they miscalculate?


179
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,830
Four light-years are the distance
light travels in four years.

180
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,790
The speed is one-tenth
the speed of light.

181
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,960
Four divided by zero point one.
Can you make a mistake?

182
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,150
So why?
Are they trying to mislead us?

183
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,500
No need.


184
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,910
I think,
the current time difference

185
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,390
maybe due to the difference
in the measurement of time

186
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,030
between the Earth
and the Three-Body Civilization.

187
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:05,220
We know nothing
about interstellar flight.

188
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,080
So now the worst outcome is that


189
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,650
in 40 years,


190
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,630
we will see the arrival
of the Trisolarans.

191
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,940
Only 40 years.


192
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,820
Will we be able to
build a strong enough defense system?

193
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,440
No.


194
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,480
The worst outcome is that


195
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,890
they were in flight 40 years ago.


196
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,390
We don't know


197
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:38,290
when they started moving.


198
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,640
The members of ETO
is eviler than cults.

199
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,750
They are traitors.


200
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,640
I just talked with Wang Miao that


201
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,240
these traitors
are divided into different sects.

202
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,270
That's right.


203
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:44,000
They belong to different sects


204
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,830
and often disagree with other sects.


205
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:52,000
Some sects slander
and even attack each other.

206
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,310
Most of these arrested


207
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:58,270
were the Redemptionists.


208
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,110
They aim to
solve the Three-Body Problem.

209
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,400
So, most game players


210
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,030
belong to the Redemptionists.


211
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,720
Shen Yufei should be a Redemptionist.


212
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,300
Wei Cheng is still calculating for her.


213
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,270
But it turns out there's no solution
to the Three-Body Problem.

214
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:23,110
The Adventists believe
the Three-Body Problem has no solution.

215
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:28,310
This sect claims
human race should be destroyed.

216
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,550
They eagerly await
the coming of the Lord.

217
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:35,440
That is, they do this in the hope that


218
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,750
they will be saved from death
when the Lord comes.

219
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:43,680
The Survivors believe
the Lord won't kill them.

220
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,440
They are optimistic.


221
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,790
According to our interrogation,


222
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,750
it seems that the other two sects
look down on them.

223
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,590
The major divide of ETO exists


224
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,480
in the Redemptionists
and the Adventists.

225
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,920
Shen Yufei was a Redemptionist.


226
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,310
His rival, Pan Han, is an Adventist.


227
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:06,790
The information we have now
is from Pan Han's computer,

228
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,160
but the list is all about
the Redemptionists.

229
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,660
It seems like
the faction within the ETO.

230
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,640
How did they connect with the Lord?


231
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,880
So far, no connection


232
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,920
with the so-called Lord has been found.


233
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,440
The person who can connect with the Lord
should be their leader.

234
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,400
There are many sects in ETO.


235
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,960
How can there be no leader?


236
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,590
They mentioned a person.


237
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,680
I also doubted this person
has something to do with the ETO.

238
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,290
In ETO, they call her


239
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,110
Commander.


240
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,580
(Commander)


241
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,200
What is on the flash drive?


242
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,750
I have told you.
We are decoding it. It's unknown.

243
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:26,640
Are you afraid that the contents of
the flash drive will bring danger to me?

244
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,640
Yes.


245
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,750
The contents of it
are dangerous for you.

246
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:37,220
So I came to tell you
to stop your investigation.

247
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,960
Do you think I'm the one
who's afraid of danger?

248
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,360
You are not, but I am.


249
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,480
We are creatures
of backward civilization.

250
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,160
If the creatures of advanced civilization
want to kill you, I can't protect you,

251
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,880
so does the Battle Command Center.


252
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,070
Not to mention yourself.


253
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,180
Don't you see?


254
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,440
Last night, some of our members


255
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,500
in the European Combat Zone
have been arrested for no reason.

256
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,090
The truth must be known
to more people.

257
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,310
It happened in Europe.


258
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,340
We need the help of foreign media.


259
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,070
The environmental protection issues
investigated abroad last time

260
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,640
have been reported by foreign media.


261
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,780
They received a good response.


262
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,978
(Commander The Redemptionists
(Solve the Three-Body Problem))

263
00:21:26,002 --> 00:21:30,200
(The Adventists (Destroy)
The Redemptionists)

264
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,590
I felt a growing suspicion that


265
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,030
this information was deliberately leaked
to Mu Xing by Pan Han.

266
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,960
Don't arrest Pan Han now.


267
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,110
He can help us find more information.


268
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:44,500
We should protect Mu Xing now.


269
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,440
I was exposed to the data
when I worked for my master's degree.

270
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,550
I was shocked at first,
and then I tried to change it.

271
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:58,700
If you don't save yourself,
Buddha can't help you.

272
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,050
Then I met her.


273
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,010
Commander gave me hope again.


274
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,590
Commander?


275
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,350
Lord will come to create a bright,


276
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:16,220
new and advanced human civilization.


277
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,330
Commander is the one
who's listened to the voice of the Lord.

278
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:26,850
I'm sure you'll meet her one day.


279
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,460
Thank you.


280
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:38,380
Has anyone ever heard
the voice of the Lord?

281
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:43,680
(The waves traveled alone
through the galaxy,)

282
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,550
(messaging our confusion to the Lord
and bringing back hope for us.)

283
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,510
(How great it is!)


284
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:53,250
(I'll never forget this moment.)


285
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,960
Stop it.


286
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,500
- What are you doing?
- You are an unlicensed driver, right?

287
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,510
- Forget it.
- Stop it.

288
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,960
- What are you doing?
- Doing my duty.

289
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,350
- Work with me. Please!
- Let me go.

290
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,750
Come here.


291
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,440
What are you doing?


292
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,750
- Get on. Get on.
- What's wrong with you?

293
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,940
Listen to me.


294
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,070
I...


295
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,940
Since you continued to investigate,
I can only detain you.

296
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,590
Are you being stubborn?


297
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,400
I'm useful to them.


298
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,880
If I suddenly disappear,
he'll be suspicious.

299
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,270
Just give me 24 hours.


300
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,750
After I do what he asked me to do,
I'll find an excuse to disappear.

301
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,310
24 hours is too long.


302
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,920
Tell them.


303
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,590
It's hard to do it.


304
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,270
Okay.


305
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,720
What?


306
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,240
What's the exact time?


307
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,570
Noon tomorrow.


308
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,340
8 o'clock this evening.


309
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,160
After your hand-off,
I will come to get you.

310
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,160
How about 10 o'clock tomorrow?


311
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,640
10 o'clock this evening.


312
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,400
Report your work.


313
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,350
After your hand-off,
I will come to get you.

314
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,880
Okay?


315
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,850
Okay, okay.


316
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,570
Hand off.


317
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,980
You can go.


318
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,270
10 o'clock this evening.
I'll buy you coffee.

319
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,660
I'm not a coffee guy.


320
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,180
Get off.


321
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,500
I heard you're powerful.


322
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,750
But I can't repel your bullet.


323
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,790
We are not enemies.


324
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:23,810
I invited you here
for Commander.

325
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,310
Many members in Europe were arrested.


326
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:31,880
I found that it had something to do
with a journalist, Mu Xing.

327
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,380
Nothing to do with you, huh?


328
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:38,530
Did you have anything to do
with Shen Yufei's death?

329
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:45,220
I know you doubt me.


330
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,070
But it doesn't matter.


331
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:54,200
I will report all these things
to Commander in the conference.

332
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,770
You called me for Commander?


333
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:03,070
The journalist, Mu Xing,
should have found the information

334
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:08,230
that Commander was present
in the Second Red Coast Base in 1996.

335
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,160
The conference is coming.


336
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,850
Protect Commander.


337
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:29,200
(I was exposed to the data
when I worked for my master's degree.)

338
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,750
(I was shocked at first,
and then I tried to change it.)

339
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,480
(I've tried various methods)


340
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,440
(and even participated in the march
on environment protection abroad.)

341
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,750
(Then...
I participated in the march)

342
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,160
(on environmental protection
in Country T,)

343
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,750
(a police car passed
every 48 minutes on the street.)

344
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,270
(Documentation of BSE)


345
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,510
(OS: The hospital was full
because of BSE.)

346

347
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,200
(OS: In Jinsi Wharf,)


348
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,870
(many people were killed
or injured in the explosion.)

(Smoke overhead,)


350
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,770
(obscuring the blue sky.)


351
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,770
(I thought human race would go die.)


352
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,460
(But she appeared.)


353
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,480
(Registration form for basic information
of researcher, Ye Wenjie)

354
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,720
(OS: My friend took me to a party)


355

(to listen to the message
of the Lord brought by her.)

356
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,350
(At that party, I first learned that)


357
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:18,380
(the Lord was coming
to change the world.)

358
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:21,270
Commander has listened
to the voice of the Lord.

359
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:24,980
Have you seen her since then?


360
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:30,110
The last time I saw her was
at a lecture at Tsinghua University.

361
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,310
She was as kind as ever.


362
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,270
Kind but powerful.


363
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,220
(Ye Wenjie)


364
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,400

that much, right?)

00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,880

(OS: you will become more powerful.)

372
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:58,510
(OS: This is also the greatness of the Lord.)


373
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,330
The Lord will come.


374

(1996 Country T Radio wave

375
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,160
Excuse me.


376
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,510
Is there any other information
about this file?

377
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:50,240
It's over there. Please.


378
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,220
- Okay. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

379
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,030
Hello.


380
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,000
Hello.


381
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,750
I think that girl
took my file by mistake.

382
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,640
Did she return the research report


383
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,480
of Geology Department
of Tsinghua University in 1999?

384
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,640
No.


385
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,680
It's a file of researchers


386
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,770
(Portfolio)
for the expedition to Country T in 1996.

387
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,480
Captain Shi.


388
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,880
The body was dumped over there.


389
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,900
Captain Shi.


390
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,030
The victim's neck was wrung.


391
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,160
She was dead when we found her.


392
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,980
The forensic expert
has taken the body away.

393
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,010
That's it.


394
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,240
What else can you think of?


395
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,200
Nothing.


396
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,090
That's the crime scene.


397
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,400
Cabling revamp work is underway
on this road.

398
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,090
The surveillance was all dismantled.


399
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,240
It wasn't an accident,
but an intended crime.

400
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,050
In addition,
Mu Xing's digital recorder was gone.

401
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,530
She always brought
several digital recorders.

402
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,380
Sir, sugar in your coffee?


403
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,330
Or milk?


404
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,570
Sir, your coffee is ready.


405
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,880
I have a question.


406
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,510
Do I have to take milk and sugar
with my coffee?

407
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,790
It's up to you.


408
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:23,700
Some people like it,
and some people don't.

409
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,610
It's so bitter.


410
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,880
Can I help you?


411
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,280
No. Thank you.


412
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,610
I called the police.


413
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,030
(Who are you?)


414
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,960
(What do you want?)


415
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,710
(I'm sorry.)


416
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,880
(I must protect Commander.)


417
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,320
(You followed me
when I searched for the information.)

418
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,650
(Is it because
I traced Tsinghua University?)

419
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,940
Captain Shi.


420
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,440
(Who are you?)


421
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,360
(What do you want?)


422
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,230
(I'm sorry.)


423
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,760
(I must protect Commander.)


424

(You followed me
when I searched for the information.)

425
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:45,530
(Is it because
I traced Tsinghua University?)

426
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:53,550
Mu Xing's last words
were sending messages to us.

427
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,880
She found their Commander


428
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,460
and tracked down to Tsinghua University.


429
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:05,940
She was on the right track.


430
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,590
(Ye Wenjie, Astrophysicist)


431
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:15,340
Is this another coincidence?


432
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,920
The suspect's voiceprint was identified.


433
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,280
It's a woman.


434
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,440
20 to 35 years old.


435
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,440
Between 1.65 meters and 1.7 meters tall.


436
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,360
She's slim.


437
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,380
There's no match in our database.


438
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,230
(No copyright without written approval)


439
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,110
Then?


440
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,150
The suspect is an expert
in anti-tracking.

441
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,780
She deliberately avoided surveillance.


442
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,010
What's it?


443
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,400
It's from CVS.


444
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,110
When someone enters or exits a CVS,
there will be this opening tone.

445
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:14,260
Mu Xing bought something on the way.


446
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,710
According to this record,


447
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:20,800
Mu Xing was killed
in two hours and 17 minutes.

448
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,480
This sound rang
in two hours and three minutes.

449
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:31,260
This CVS is only a dozen minutes' drive
from the spot.

450
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,940
(July 16th, 2007, Monday)


451
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,420
This woman matches the profile.


452
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,940
She was in heels.


453
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,070
Well, back up.


454
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,090
Back up.


455
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,670
Stop.


456
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,610
Play it.


457
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,550
Stop here.


458
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,070
Have you seen this car?


459
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:08,000
Before it came along,
this was the only lane that had traffic.

460
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,110
After it left,
other cars began to drive in this lane.

461
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,800
Look.


462
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,920
It has been parked
outside the monitoring.

463
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,390
- I'll get the owner's information.
- No need.

464
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,860
It must be a fake-licensed car.


465
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,940
I need you to check all the traffic cameras
on this vehicle.

466

(Ye Wenjie)


467
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,340

Someone wrung her neck.


473
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,670
It's the same on the K1303 train.


474
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:23,820
- Investigate this case with K1303 murder.
- Yes, sir.

475
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,190
Captain Shi, we found the car.


476
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,880
On the West Side Highway,
the camera pictured the driver's face.

477
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,480
It's a blurry version.


478
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,940
The technician is
restoring the portrait.

479
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,340
I think I met her before.


480
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,130
Captain Shi.


481
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:08,150
Chen Xue also bought
the ticket for K1303.

482
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:12,590
That much seems to be clear.
She's the suspect in both murders.

483
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,550
Arrest her now.


484
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:18,860

for arresting her.

486

The journalist who found the list for us


493
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,460
was killed last night.


494
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:44,340
Didn't you ask her to stop investigating
the other day?

495
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,800
The suspect is Chen Xue.


496
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,610
She's a member of ETO.


497
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,110
How do you know
she's a member of ETO?

498
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,960
Mu Xing had the habit of recording.


499
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,710
We found a digital recorder on the spot.


500
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:03,170
Chen Xue said
she must protect Commander.

501
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,510
Do you remember the murder in K1303?


502
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,710
A man was killed in the toilet.


503
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:12,030
His neck was wrung.


504
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:15,580
Mu Xing died the same way.


505
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:19,070
Chen Xue also bought a ticket for K1303.


506
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:23,360
Mu Xing died because she found

who's the Commander of ETO?


508
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:31,190
What extent had she traced to?


509
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:34,170
