18
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,790
Haven't you been suspicious
of Ye Wenjie all along?

19
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,790
What's so strange about her
having dealings with Shen Yufei?

20
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,150
Declassified file.

21
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,510
The declassified file of Ye Wenjie.

22
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,710
You've been dawdling
for quite some time.

23
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,150
Are you constipated or something?

24
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,680
It's just a declassified file.

25
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,470
I'll give it to you tomorrow.

26
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,000
I need to go to Hai City tomorrow.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,310
Hai City?

28
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,560
Ye Wenjie and Shen Yufei
are both going to Hai City tomorrow,

29
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,630
which is very abnormal.

30
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,000
Tomorrow I'll have Wang Miao go there
with me to investigate.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,630
Is Hai City where I get off the bus
if my destination is Qijiatun?

32
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,560
Qijiatun is where we're going.

33
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,150
Do you know what's in Qijiatun?

34
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,560
Shen Yufei has
a red ginseng factory there.

35
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,870
Red Coast Base.

36
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,750
- Where are you going?
- The declassified file.

37
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,190
You just won't think of water
until your house is on fire.

38
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,150
Do we really have to catch the flight early
tomorrow morning to the Northeast

39
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,030
and then catch a train to Hai City?

40
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,310
Yeah. If we fail to catch the same train
as theirs,

41
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,910
they'll get to Qijiatun
way before we do.

42
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,710
Don't worry.

43
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,480
I've contacted
our associate department there.

44
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,080
They'll meet us at the airport and then
drive us straight to the train station.

45
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,710
Police escort.

46
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,400
Hop in.

47
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,920
Hello?

48
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,360
A guy wanting to kill you
is outside the door.

49
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,430
Push the flush button after hanging up,
and then do nothing.

50
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,630
After you hear someone knock three times
on the door, open it and leave.

51
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,040
Repeat what I just said.

52
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,310
Hang up.

53
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,270
Flush.

54
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,920
Leave after hearing someone
knock three times.

55
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,830
Go to car No. 1.

56
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:48,100
(Occupied)

57
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,870
What is wrong with you?

58
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,190
Watch where you're going, okay?

59
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,630
I'm carrying a bowl of instant noodles!
Why did you bump into me?

60
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,390
How unbelievably rash you are!

61
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,390
Commander.

62
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,830
They're making their move.

63
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,310
Just now, were it not for Chen Xue…

64
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,040
You don't love me anymore?

65
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,160
What will I do?

66
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,150
It's okay now.

67
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,600
Let Chen Xue get you back home.

68
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,000
Some professionals
will handle the equipment,

69
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,600
and I'll keep watch on it personally.

70
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,790
A few days ago,
Headhunter Qi's son told me

71
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,750
a foreigner had come to the village
to be a volunteer teacher.

72
00:08:53,750 --> 00:09:02,320
He taught the kids to protect spruce
and skylark, and he loves planting trees.

73
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,150
It's him.

74
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:21,670
He's been in the village
for several days.

75
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,870
Will he find out about our system?

76
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,630
What does it matter
if he finds out or not?

77
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,510
The next stop is Shanhai Pass.

78
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,440
We'll get off there.

79
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,630
We can't stay on this train anymore.

80
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,600
Their target is me.

81
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,750
The Adventists have all gone crazy.

82
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:03,030
It's impossible for humans
to repress their madness unaided.

83
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:07,320
Commander, I have a question.

84
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:13,790
You want to verify
if I'm in favor of the Redemptionists.

85
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,270
In the beginning,
there were no such factions

86
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:23,030
as Adventists, Redemptionists,
or Survivors.

87
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,840
When they made me Commander,

88
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:31,270
I didn't know
there would be so many disagreements.

89
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:40,200
Why did humans
fail to finish the Tower of Babel?

90
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,500
God saw that humans might be able
to finish the Tower of Babel,

91
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,600
so he gave humans different languages,
rendering them unable to communicate

92
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,600
with or understand each other.

93
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:03,630
It was Lord
who caused our disagreements.

94
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:10,320
Humans choose the side in line
with their intentions.

95
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,030
Does Lord do the same?

96
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:33,270
Does Lord want destruction
or redemption?

97
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,870
Let's get off the train
and listen to Lord's voice.

98
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:50,870
Then we'll know
what we should do next.

99
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,790
It's been two years.

100
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:57,270
Lord has never given us any messages.

101
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,510
Silence is also a message.

102
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,120
You got back at something after ten,
and you're leaving at five.

103
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,150
How can you go on a business trip
on such short notice?

104
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,750
Shh.

105
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,390
Keep your voice down.
You might wake Doudou up.

106
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,670
I don't have a choice. It's work.

107
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,670
Where are you going?

108
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,960
Hai City.

109
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,240
There's a
nanotech red ginseng processing plant.

110
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,030
I'm going there for a field trip.

111
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,630
That's over 30 hours' train ride.

112
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,270
You'll be away
for three or four days, right?

113
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,240
I'll get back as soon as I can.

114
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,000
- Take this. You may eat it during the ride.
- Alright. Shove it in.

115
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,510
Okay. I'll bring you back some goodies.

116
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,000
I've got to go.

117
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,550
What's wrong?

118
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,630
Why do you look a bit down?

119
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,960
Got up too early?

120
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,120
You woke up on the wrong side
of the bed?

121
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,720
Or was it your wife?

122
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,120
Your wife got up too early as well?

123
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,630
You didn't sleep well last night, right?

124
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,390
You look a bit overexcited.

125
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,550
I can get excited whenever I want.

126
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,440
I looked it up yesterday.

127
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,000
There's no plane bound for
the Northeast at this hour.

128
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,320
Which airline did you take?

129
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,870
SA341.

130
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,550
Which airline is SA?

131
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,240
SA341 is a gunship.

132
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,720
- What do you mean by "Huh"?
- It's too short notice.

133
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,670
Chang was supposed
to swing us a J-10 Fighter,

134
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,390
but SA341 is acceptable, I guess.

135
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,390
Anyway, we'll get
to the Northeast in two hours.

136
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,360
There's plenty of time.

137
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,120
We'll even have time for breakfast.

138
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,750
Is it safe?

139
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:38,080
Don't worry. It won't fall. I got this.

140
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,440
This is the breakfast you talked about?

141
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,790
Just make do with it.

142
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,240
We'll be cooped up on this train
for over 20 hours.

143
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,720
It'll be such a long ride.

144
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,840
Why didn't you buy us
some decent tickets?

145
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,840
Chang can handle military departments,

146
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,790
but not the Ministry of Railways.

147
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:20,390
We've walked from end to end several times,
but there's been no trace of them.

148
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
Eat faster.
We'll search again after breakfast.

149
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,030
Grid search.

150
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,390
Your ticket and ID card, please.

151
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:35,200
How about we get some help
from your associate department?

152
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,150
Comrades,
your tickets and ID cards, please.

153
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,430
They got on board at the last stop.
Is everything okay?

154
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
Yeah.

155
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,960
Alright.

156
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,150
What's wrong?

157
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,630
Something happened, right?

158
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,270
Looking for suspects?

159
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:30,840
The body
was removed a few stops from here.

160
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,790
He'd been dead
for over three hours when found.

161
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,080
(Occupied)
This door was locked all along,

162
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,550
and at that time all the passengers
were asleep.

163
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,910
Nobody noticed.

164
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,180
The next morning,
the door was still locked.

165
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,670
A train conductor knocked for quite
some time but there was no response.

166
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:48,270
She opened the door with the key
only to find him dead.

167
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,440
Did you just say
his neck was snapped?

168
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,200
Yeah.

169
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,910
The murderer's a good fighter,
and very professional.

170
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:59,720
All the victim's identifying information
has been disposed of.

171
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,160
We searched this train several times

172
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,510
but found no trace
of Shen Yufei or Ye Wenjie.

173
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,680
- Did anybody get off the train early?
- There's no way to know.

174
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,270
I see. Thank you, bro.
I'll call you if I need your help.

175
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,550
- Okay, okay.
- Alright.

176
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,830
Someone died on this train,
and they're not on board.

177
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,070
Something's not right.

178
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,510
What do you mean?

179
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,590
Call her.

180
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,920
Call Professor Ye.

181
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,270
She didn't answer your call
yesterday, right? Try again.

182
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,350
Do it.

183
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,960
Go inside first.

184
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,720
Hello?

185
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:05,550
Ms. Ye, I'd like to
consult you about something in person.

186
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,060
I'm not in Beijing right now.

187
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:14,960
Where are you?

188
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,070
I'm on my way back to Qijiatun
to visit some old friends.

189
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,590
Going there by train
takes over 30 hours, right?

190
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,480
That's really tiring.

191
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,110
Yeah.

192
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:35,830
Originally, I wanted to take the train,
but it'd take 30-odd hours.

193
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:40,310
My friends were afraid I'd be exhausted,
so they arranged a car for me.

194
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,200
- It'll be faster.
- She's not on the train.

195
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:48,160
And I can get out of the car
for a break whenever I want.

196
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,590
Ms. Ye, the Red Coast Base is
in Qijiatun, right?

197
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,160
I'd like to see it.

198
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,270
Is that okay?

199
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,000
Alright.

200
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,960
I'll wait for you in Qijiatun.

201
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,310
Okay, Ms. Ye, bye.

202
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,720
You're letting Wang Miao
come to Red Coast?

203
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:29,960
There are some things
he'll need to know sooner or later.

204
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,750
Right now we can only find out
if they bought tickets or not.

205
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,000
There's no way
to verify any of the subsequent events.

206
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,150
I need to have someone look into it.

207
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:51,510
You think they got something
to do with the murder?

208
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,510
We can't rule out that possibility.

209
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,350
Well, the cop says that guy's taller

210
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,920
and heavier than me,
and he had his neck snapped.

211
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,880
Do you think Professor Ye
can do something like that?

212
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,790
Or do you think Shen Yufei can do it?

213
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:09,310
You have a point, but I still feel
it's a hell of a coincidence.

214
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,030
The problem is we're trapped on a train.

215
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,400
We can't look into anything.

216
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,310
There are over ten hours to go.

217
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,310
Even Professor Ye knows traveling by car
is faster than traveling by train.

218
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:23,070
Can't you just have them
fly us to Qijiatun

219
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,000
with that SA361 thing?

220
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,400
Everybody says scientists are rational.

221
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,680
Why are you such an exception?

222
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,160
10-odd hours aren't exactly a long time.

223
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,750
We can use the time
to think about problems.

224
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,590
You may think about that nano-Flying-Knife
thing or whatever its name is.

225
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,550
I didn't bring any materials.

226
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,000
Then have some sleep.

227
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,440
There are many couchettes available now.

228
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,000
I don't want to sleep here.

229
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,000
Commander.

230
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,960
- Commander.
- Commander. - Commander.

231
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,200
Resume your work.

232
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,960
We've maximized the reception
of all frequencies

233
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,200
from the direction of Centauri,
but there's still no message whatsoever.

234
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,510
Keep monitoring.

235
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:36,000
Yes.

236
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,720
Time to go.

237
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,880
We're going back?

238
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:25,550
I mean it's time for the machines
and devices to go.

239
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:32,440
Commander, we've only just
built this reception system.

240
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,510
Dismantle it.

241
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,070
Are you doing this
because you've accepted the fact

242
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:43,160
that the Adventists
are in contact with Lord?

243
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:49,200
I admit Lord exists.

244
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,640
If we had received messages from Lord,

245
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:59,680
it would've meant Lord can contact us
and is willing to contact us,

246
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:05,720
and we
would be able to change many things.

247
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,270
But now
we've received no message whatsoever.

248
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:18,720
If Lord is unwilling to contact us
and has chosen the Adventists,

249
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,510
then everything we did was pointless.

250
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,910
If they can't receive any messages
from Lord either,

251
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:37,350
then maybe we need to change them.

252
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,960
I get it now.

253
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,400
Don't be dismayed.

254
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,240
This is not a bad thing.

255
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,310
Commander, it's settled.

256
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:29,550
The reception system will be dismantled
with no trace left behind.

257
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,720
You may go back to Beijing without me.

258
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,240
Wang Miao will be here soon.

259
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,240
It's best if he doesn't see us together.

260
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,300
(Incoming call from Shen Yufei)

261
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,480
Hello?

262
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,880
Pan Han, it's me.

263
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,830
Commander?

264
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:11,470
Please tell Evans
it's time for us to meet.

265
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:14,510
I'm in Red Coast.

266
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,440
Yes.

267
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,880
This is the village entrance. Is this where
you and Ye Wenjie agreed to meet?

268
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,790
Yeah.

269
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,970
(Qijiatun)
Professor Ye said a villager

270
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,550
(Qijiatun)
would come to pick me up,

271
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,720
that I might wait under the big cypress
outside the village.

272
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,480
I think it's that one.

273
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,790
It's almost time.

274
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,270
How about you wait here for her?

275
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,720
I'll pay a visit
to the village committee

276
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,790
to get some information
about Shen Yufei's factory.

277
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,270
Alright.

278
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,240
When you see Ye Wenjie,

279
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,640
memorize what she says
and tell me when I get back.

280
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,110
I will.

281
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,350
Are you Wang Miao?

282
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,270
You're Wang Miao, right?

283
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,350
I am.

284
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:54,960
I'm Qi Jianguo. Hop on. Professor Ye
sent me here to pick you up.

285
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,720
Hop on. Hop on.

286
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,110
Alright.

287
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,960
Take it easy. Be careful.

288
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,110
Hold on tight.

289
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,160
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

290
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,350
Does Professor Ye come back often?

291
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,960
No.

292
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,200
But she used to live in our village
when she was younger.

293
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,590
She boarded with us. We're very close.

294
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,790
I heard there's a red ginseng
factory in your village.

295
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,590
Yes, there is.

296
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,550
The owner's a foreigner.

297
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,480
He rented a large piece of land from us.

298
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,480
He said it'd help us get re-employed.

299
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,070
I think it's a great idea.

300
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:47,720
Those who don't want to be peasants
may work in the factory.

301
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,790
Work? What kind of work?

302
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:54,960
Cleaning ginseng, digging ginseng,
picking out ginseng,

303
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,160
and watching the factory for them.

304
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,160
Does Professor Ye have anything to do
with the factory?

305
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,720
I don't think so.

306
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,000
That's a foreigner's factory.

307
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,640
What could she have to do with it?

308
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,110
By the way, there's a flashlight
in there.

309
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:10,590
Professor Ye told me to give it to you.

310
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,510
Ms. Ye!

311
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,070
Ms. Ye, this is it?

312
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,480
Yeah.

313
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:09,440
This is Red Coast.

314
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:25,790
At that time, I thought I'd never be able
to leave this place,

315
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:30,340
but after getting out, I miss it a lot.

316
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,350
(Beware of Electricity)

317
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:35,110
Now this base is abandoned.

318
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:38,640
Maybe because demolishing it
would be too costly,

319
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:45,200
they only transferred the important
scientific research apparatus,

320
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,550
and the overall frame of Red Coast
survived.

321
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:20,440
(Those on duty in the Transmission
Department, attention, please.)

322
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,110
(The computer magnetic core storage
in the Transmission Department)

323
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:26,750
(displays a failure code.)

324
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:32,030
(Maintenance personnel
are to go and fix it immediately.)

325
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,510
(The computer magnetic core storage
in the Transmission Department)

326
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,640
(displays a failure code.)

327
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,480
(Maintenance personnel
are to go and fix it immediately.)

328
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,000
So this is Red Coast.

329
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,270
On both sides
used to be machines and devices.

330
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:57,200
(At 5:00 PM,
there will be a sanitary check)

331
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,270
(on the mainframe cabinet
between transmitters and receivers.)

332
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:06,000
(Please prepare ahead of time.)

333
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,710
Here and there
used to be occupied by apparatus.

334
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:22,000
When I first joined Red Coast,

335
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,840
I was responsible for maintaining
and repairing those machines.

336
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:51,190
Here used to be Yang Weining's office.

337
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,440
Lei Zhicheng's was there.

338
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,280
(According to the latest
weather forecast,)

339
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,550
(from 8:00 AM today
to 8:00 PM tomorrow,)

340
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,880
(there will be heavy snow
or even a snowstorm)

341
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,320
(in some areas of the Northeast.)

342
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,920
(The high tomorrow
will be 2 degrees Celsius,)

343
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,840
(and the low will be minus 18.)

344
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:17,030
(Sunny. Level 6 southeast wind.)

345
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,280
This used to be an elevator.

346
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,630
Let's take the stairs.

347
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,480
Okay.

348
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,190
Be careful.

349
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,840
Did this used to be
the Monitoring Department of Red Coast?

350
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:04,510
Ms. Ye, the other day you said you got
transferred out of the Transmission Department.

351
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:07,710
You were moved here, right?

352
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,880
Yes.

353
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:18,710
At that time, I thought I'd never
get a core technical position again.

354
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:26,550
Afterward I discovered that
the core of Red Coast was actually here.

355
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,960
Core?

356
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,960
That concerned the real purpose
of Red Coast.

357
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:42,280
I know even to this day, that part
is still classified.

358
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:53,070
Now that you've already come here,
there's actually no harm in telling you.

359
00:38:53,070 --> 00:39:01,150
It was in this room that I came to find out
the truth about Red Coast.

360
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,800
But how is she supposed to do her job

361
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,920
if you keep concealing things
from her like this?

362
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,510
I see it differently.

363
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,630
I think if you tell her too much,

364
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:27,840
- it'll definitely create…
- Report!

365
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:34,590
- Anyway, remember where the limit is.
- I know what to say.

366
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:38,070
Wenjie, come in.

367
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:52,150
Wenjie, this is an official decision.

368
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:55,480
From this day onwards, you'll be working
in the Monitoring Department.

369
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,800
Now I'll explain the work
of the Monitoring Department to you.

370
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:05,670
Simply put,
the goal is to keep an eye

371
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:11,510
on all enemy activities in space,
including intercepting communications

372
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,920
between enemy space vessels and the ground,
and between the space vessels themselves,

373
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,230
track the orbits
of enemy space vessels,

374
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:20,230
collaborate with our telemetry
and tracking centers,

375
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,550
and provide data
for Red Coast's combat systems.

376
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:26,280
In other words,
the eyes of Red Coast are here.

377
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:31,550
Political Commissar Lei,
I think you should reconsider

378
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:35,000
whether it's necessary to tell her this.
