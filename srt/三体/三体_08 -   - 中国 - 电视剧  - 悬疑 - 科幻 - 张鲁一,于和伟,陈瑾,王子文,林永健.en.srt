1
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:21,000
Ji Chang, it's been eight nights.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,280
We're in another Chaotic Era.

3
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,800
The sun has never risen again.

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,760
My king, this is temporary.

5
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,560
The sun will soon rise.

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,240
The Stable Era and the spring
will resume.

7
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,470
Heat the quadripod.

8
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,840
My king! My king!

9
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,840
There are…

10
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,070
There are three flying stars in the sky!

11
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,670
You don't know what it means to have
three flying stars in the sky, I presume?

12
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:05,760
It means a harsh winter is about to come.

13
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,310
It can freeze hard rocks into powder.

14
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,280
Dehydrate!

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,350
Dehydrate!

16
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,040
Dehydrate!

17
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,640
- Dehydrate me.
- Dehydrate.

18
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,680
Dehydrate!

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,950
Dehydrate me!

20
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,040
Dehydrate.

21
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,710
Dehydrate!

22
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,200
Use slow fire.

23
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,910
Those who want to quit may quit now.

24
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:12,190
This game
doesn't have anything to offer anymore.

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,750
You didn't quit the game either.

26
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:38,630
I think it's raining dry ice now.

27
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:05,190
These snowflakes
are solid oxygen and nitrogen.

28
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,240
The atmosphere is gradually dissolving
at absolute zero.

29
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,190
Then we'll soon lose oxygen.

30
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,360
(The long night lasted 48 years.)

31
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,470
(Civilization No. 137
was destroyed by the extreme cold.)

32
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,520
(This civilization had advanced
to the Warring States Period.)

33
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,360
(The seed of civilization remains.)

34
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,240
(It will germinate)

35
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,000
(and again progress
through the unpredictable world)

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,400
(of Three-Body.)

37
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,240
(We invite you to log in
to the game again.)

38
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,080
Did you lose or win?

39
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,400
Did you lose or win?

40
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,280
It was awe-inspiring.

41
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,680
How did I die?

42
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,680
Did I die of thirst?

43
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,430
You dehydrated.

44
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,000
All the water in your body
evaporated.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,920
All your blood vessels shrivelled.

46
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,630
You turned into a man-shaped skin.

47
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,240
Those jerks lied to me.

48
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,550
It was really so awe-inspiring.

49
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,560
A civilization
was destroyed just like that.

50
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,070
Destroyed?

51
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,390
The farmer kicked the bucket?

52
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,160
What on earth is this game about?

53
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,800
King Wen of Zhou told me.

54
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,000
This is a Chaotic Era.

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,060
The Stable Era seems
to be an obsession of theirs.

56
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,560
Even now,

57
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,560
I still haven't figured out
what we should do exactly.

58
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,270
Should we look for patterns
about the Stable Era?

59
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,630
Or should we find a way
from among Stable Eras

60
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,920
and Chaotic Eras
to continue the civilization?

61
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,600
Why is it so disorderly?

62
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,380
I don't know.

63
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,310
Maybe the game's not disorderly.

64
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,480
It's just we haven't understood.

65
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,920
How about we get back in and try again
while our morale's still high?

66
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,160
This time we swoop in
and kill King Zhou of Shang together,

67
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,630
and this whole thing
will be over, won't it?

68
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,480
This game is not about killing people.

69
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,310
King Wen told me the goal of this game

70
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,190
is to figure out the pattern
of the sun's movement.

71
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,310
The pattern of the sun's movement

72
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,560
is that it rises in the east
and sets in the west, isn't it?

73
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,160
In the world of Three-Body, the sun's
movement does not follow that pattern.

74
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,360
When it's a Chaotic Era, in particular,

75
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,310
the sun's movement
is completely irregular.

76
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,480
It's a game.
It does things as it pleases.

77
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,560
But have you noticed this?

78
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,190
In this game,
many feelings are a bit too real.

79
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,310
Of course.

80
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,560
I've drunk three bottles of water.

81
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,510
It strikes me that the purpose
of making this game so realistic

82
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,680
is not to give players
a better experience.

83
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,390
I specially checked the pyramid
buried under the snow before quitting.

84
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:04,270
The bottom layer of the snow is solid water.
The middle layer is dry ice.

85
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,950
The uppermost layer
is solid oxygen and nitrogen.

86
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,390
Which company designed this game?

87
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,680
I don't know.

88
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,000
Practice makes perfect.

89
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,120
Let's give it another few shots,
and get to the bottom of this matter.

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,680
Come in.

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,680
Mr. Wang.

92
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,160
Play another round.
Play another round.

93
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,480
One more time. One more time.
Come on. One more time.

94
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,040
Buddy, get me my gloves. Thanks.

95
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,720
It's time for the meeting.

You hit my bike, but don't worry.

105
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,070
I'm not going to demand compensation.

106
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,480
You're almost a blackmail-meister now.
Your imagination is working overtime.

107
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,270
How could I cause such a severe car accident
when I wasn't even in my car?

108
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,310
What do you want?

109
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,270
Look carefully.

110
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,440
Today I have no digital recorder on me.

111
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,320
It doesn't matter.

112
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,720
I got nothing to say to you.

113
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,360
Not even about
the Frontiers of Science?

114
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,480
That's right.

115
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,270
It seems you're still
inept at dealing with media workers.

116
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,000
When asked by a media worker,

117
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
you should say "No comment",
or "Never heard of it".

118
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,790
Saying that you got nothing to say

119
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,840
means you know a lot,
but are unwilling to disclose anything.

120
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,200
I don't want to say "No comment".

121
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,750
I do know a lot,
but why should I tell you?

122
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,390
Alright.

123
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,910
This proves my investigation's heading
in the right direction.

124
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,030
I'm looking
into the Frontiers of Science as well.

125
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:23,910
- Move your bike and get out of my sight.
- Alright.

126
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,870
What a pity.

127
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:33,000
You didn't disclose anything useful.

128
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,070
Hello?

129
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,840
I need you to keep looking
into that Mu Xing girl for me.

130
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,910
We must find out what she's up to.

131
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,390
What happened exactly?

132
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,720
Why did you call me here in such a hurry
at this late hour?

133
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,030
Are you Wang Miao?

134
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,200
I'm Professor Ye's student,
Sha Ruishan.

135
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,030
Nice to meet you.

136
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,750
It's really an honor to meet you.

137
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,910
They are used for observation, but
they have nothing to do with my project.

138
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,630
Come.

139
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,320
Huh?

140
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,360
Come in with me.

141
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,390
Aren't they breathtaking?

142
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,550
They are all like
the ears of a deaf man.

143
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,720
Ever since construction was completed,

144
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,030
interference has been unceasing
in the observational bands.

145
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,960
First, there were the paging stations
during the 80s.

146
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,200
Now, it's the mobile communication.

147
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,960
Most of the tasks that need

148
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,000
metre-wave aperture synthesis
radio telescope can't be performed.

149
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,840
What on earth are you rambling on about?

150
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,910
Come on.

151
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,270
Come on. Come on.

152
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,320
Come on. Come on.

153
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
Solve it?

154
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,630
Who will solve it?

155
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,390
Should mobile communication be stopped

156
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,070
just because we want to
explore the universe?

157
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,390
We don't have the money.

158
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:11,480
Right now, we can only use technical means
to shield against interference.

159
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,870
My project only depends on satellite data.

160
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,720
The ground interference
doesn't affect me much.

161
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,790
What do you want exactly?

162
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,960
We're running out of time.

163
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,790
Let's go.

164
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,790
Let me show you around.

165
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,390
This is my lab.

166
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,270
It's like home to me.

167
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,390
I usually live here.

168
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,240
Hurry. Hurry.

169
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,360
Come on. Hurry.
Make yourself at home.

170
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,480
Come on. Come in here.
Have some water.

171
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,030
- I don't want to drink it.
- You must drink it.

172
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,740
Take it.

173
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,120
My lab is used to receive the data
sent by three satellites

174
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,870
and display them in real time
on the eight terminals. I…

175
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,600
Stand here.

176
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,550
Come here.

177
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,510
Hurry.

178
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,360
Stand here.

179
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,790
Stop.

180
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,030
Alright.

181
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:04,120
My job is to use these observational data
to create a more detailed map

182
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,720
of the cosmic microwave background.

183
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,360
What kind of data do you want to see?

184
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,670
Can you be more specific?

185
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:16,440
Professor Wang, you're not
a specialist in the field, right?

186
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:24,740
Do you have some basic understanding
of the cosmic microwave background?

187
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,150
The overall fluctuation
in the cosmic microwave background

188
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:32,120
is almost negligible.

189
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,480
Stop.

190
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,630
Alright. Stay there.

191
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,120
Even with the sensitivity
of the Planck satellite,

192
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,030
continuous observation
for a million years might not detect a…

193
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,750
Stop.

194
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,320
You called me here at this late hour,

195
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,840
had me wear the same clothes
as the last time,

196
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,320
and then you said exactly
what you said on that day.

197
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,030
What is this about?

198
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,030
Stop.

199
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,750
Don't sit there.

200
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,240
Sit here.

201
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,080
Come on. Come on.

202
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,080
Hurry.

203
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,550
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

204
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,000
This morning, I ate a fried egg,
and then went out on my bike.

205
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,360
I was two minutes late.

206
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,720
At noon, I knocked over a cup of coffee.

207
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:43,840
Before dinner, I hurt my foot
when overhauling a piece of equipment.

208
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,270
And then in the evening, you came.

209
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:57,440
All these things were exactly the same
as what happened on June 13th.

210
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,910
You and I saw the universe flicker.

211
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,960
It's almost time to make observations.

212
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,870
Come on. Sit straight.

213
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,870
The universe is not
going to flicker tonight.

214
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,830
It's almost time.

215
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:36,390
Three, two, one.

216
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:52,510
Like I said, the universe is not
going to flicker tonight.

217
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:31,120
Did you wear black socks
on that day as well?

218
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,900
Do you think the universe
will flicker again if we repeat all this?

219
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,870
Are you implying
we're controlling cosmic flicker?

220
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,360
Is it you or me who has that ability?

221
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,360
You really believe
the universe can flicker?

222
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,320
Hold on a second.

223
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,550
The whole universe
flickered on such a massive scale.

224
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,750
I don't believe that.

225
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,790
If you tell me someone placed
a gigantic screen in the universe

226
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,870
to make us think the universe flickered,
I won't believe that either.

227
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,080
Both cosmic flicker and gigantic screens

228
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,030
are things we can neither believe
nor comprehend,

229
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:12,440
but it did happen
right in front of our eyes.

230
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,750
We are the chosen ones.

231
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,240
Chosen?

232
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,960
By who?

233
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,670
A lot of people got hit by apples:
orchardists, children, Newdon, Newmen,

234
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:36,720
but only Newton was the chosen one.

235
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:46,910
I've been feeling since my childhood
that someday I'll become an astronomer.

236
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:53,120
I believe all these things
are the guidance a deity is giving me.

237
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,200
So a deity led you
into scientific research?

238
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,870
Professor Wang.

239
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:08,190
Do you believe God
parted the Red Sea for Moses?

240
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,750
I'm a scientist.

241
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:15,440
I mustn't believe that,
but how is what we saw that day

242
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,680
any different
from God parting the Red Sea?

243
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,070
I want to research all this.

244
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,070
I want to understand all this.

245
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:27,510
I want to know the truth.

246
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,510
Professor Wang,
don't you want to know the truth?

247
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,790
I don't.

248
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,590
Comrades, this is a war.

249
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:07,920
Although we still
don't know who our enemies are,

250
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:13,720
or what they look like, or how they exist,
we do know one thing.

251
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:21,110
Those dead scientists were important assets
to the world, and even to mankind.

252
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,880
If a war breaks out, or post-war
reconstruction becomes necessary,

253
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,510
they'll have a very important role
to play.

254
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,310
We need them.

255
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,760
Almost all the suicides were connected
to the Frontiers of Science.

256
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,830
Why don't we just attack them?

257
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:40,310
The Frontiers of Science is still
an international academic group.

258
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:44,110
We have no reason to attack them.

259
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,830
Besides, they're scholars.

260
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:51,830
Any move against them
will cause severe social influences.

261
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,510
Do you have any suggestions,
General Chang?

262
00:18:54,510 --> 00:19:02,200
I suggest we keep top scientists of
all Combat Zones under surveillance.

263
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:08,070
If we detect any signs of the Frontiers
of Science contacting or swaying them,

264
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:12,680
we'll immediately
adopt protection measures.

265
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,680
Morning.

266
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,270
Wang Miao, come here.

267
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,550
Your timing's perfect.

268
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,510
My ten assistants
wrote this report on Three-Body.

269
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,350
Yesterday they played it all night.

270
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,590
Alright.

271
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,640
You had ten assistants play a video game?

272
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,640
Just… Just read it.

273
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,480
Okay.

274
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,270
(Asian Defense Council
Three-Body game report)

275
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,640
This report is pretty long.

276
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,400
And it seems pretty meticulous.

277
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,200
I had several gaming sessions,

278
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,720
collecting one type of game information
at a time.

279
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,830
Information about the environment,
the creatures, and how players feel.

280
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,640
Then I sorted and summarized it.

281
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,160
My assistant, Xu Bingbing.

282
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,750
Well, when playing it,

283
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,790
did you ten people figure out
the pattern of the sun's movement?

284
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,920
Yeah.

285
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,000
But so far we haven't been able
to draw any conclusions.

286
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,200
The shift between the Chaotic Era
and the Stable Era is random.

287
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,350
It switches between extreme cold
and scorching heat without any warning.

288
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:14,350
Sometimes it even happens repeatedly
in an hour.

289
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,110
When it's a Chaotic Era,
apart from dehydration,

290
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:20,640
are there any other ways of survival?

291
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,960
I did some observing.

292
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,000
Some mire fish
can survive extremely hot weather.

293
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
If humans dig a hideout
before the mire dries up as those fish do,

294
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,680
and the Chaotic Era is short enough,
maybe they'll survive.

295
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,000
Are the mire fish you talk about
similar to the African lungfish?

296
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,160
Herring?

297
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,110
The kind they make
stinky canned fish with?

298
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,400
- Lungfish.
- It's lungfish.

299
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,350
Africans once found that some fish
would burrow into the mud

300
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,550
for shelter during the dry season,
leaving only some small air vents.

301
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:56,550
Lungfish can stay alive in dormancy
for almost four years.

302
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:00,400
So the ten of you guys
wrote this report together?

303
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,240
Didn't I introduce her to you
on your arrival? My ten assistants.

304
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,680
Xu Bingbing.

305
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,750
She's worth ten assistants.
Very knowledgeable.

306
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,240
Almost as capable as me.

307
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,350
You, uh…

308
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:12,440
Don't mop the floor again.

309
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,960
Let's continue.

310
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,110
But humans are unable to lie dormant
as lungfish do,

311
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,750
so this information is useless.

312
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,830
Professor Wang.

313
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:26,790
Does it strike you that this game is
alarmingly meticulous in terms of details?

314
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,680
Yeah.

315
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,200
There are mire fish in the mire.

316
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,160
What falls from the sky is dry ice
instead of snow.

317
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,480
Though it's just a video game,
it's unduly realistic.

318
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,400
I told him the other day
that these massive details

319
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,340
were far beyond the concept
of gaming experience.

320
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,510
Then what are they?

321
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:54,920
I… I'll figure out
how to explain this to you.

322
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,270
Along the River During the Qingming Festival.
Surely you know that picture.

323
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,200
I do.

324
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,920
- The one with hundreds of people on it.
- Yeah.

325
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,590
Which one contains more information?

326
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:18,200
Along the River During the Qingming Festival
or this one?

327
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,880
This picture… It contains information?

328
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,510
It does, and its information is tens,
even thousands of times

329
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,200
that of Along the River
During the Qingming Festival.

330
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,880
Normally, the details of a video game

331
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,440
are designed to give the players
better experience,

332
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:41,070
so game designers will capture more
character movements and render more images

333
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,960
to increase the amount of information
as much as they can

334
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,750
so as to make the game more realistic.

335
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,590
Just like Along the River
During the Qingming Festival.

336
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:51,550
But the designer
of this game did the exact opposite.

337
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:55,550
There's a huge amount of information
hidden behind this game.

338
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,680
Just like this picture.

339
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,350
It attempts
to drastically compress the information,

340
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,960
as if trying to hide
some kind of enormous truth.

341
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,310
Since the designer has so many ideas,

342
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,640
who don't we just seek him out
and get the answers from him?

343
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,830
I looked into it,

344
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:14,310
but I couldn't find any information
about the designer of Three-Body.

345
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:18,070
Well, did you look into
who might be capable of

346
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,960
designing a video game like this?

347
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,750
I don't think any individuals
can develop a game like this.

348
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,790
Only very established
and strong video game companies

349
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:31,160
or top-notch game designer groups
can do it.

350
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,110
The login interface of the domestic
version of this game is in Chinese,

351
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:38,160
so I sifted out all the outstanding
video game companies.

352
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,590
I think these ones
might be capable enough to do this.

353
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,240
(Game Design Companies)
We may consult them.

354
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,830
Alright.

355
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,110
A quick aside here.

356
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:52,640
What's the monthly salary
of the ten of you?

357
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,720
Not much.

358
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,680
I get only the normal salary.

359
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,400
How can they do this?

360
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,790
How can they give you
only the normal salary?

361
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:05,270
From now on,
mopping the floor will be my job.

362
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,550
Actually, this game has been there
for quite some time.

363
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:18,750
We just never paid any attention to it.

364
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,880
Our investigation shows
most of the players of this game

365
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,960
are scientists, or elite intellectuals.

366
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,400
Many of them
are members of the Frontiers of Science.

367
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,300
Yang Dong never played this game, right?

368
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,240
And neither did Munphy, right?

369
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,440
We looked into those dead scientists.

370
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,590
None of them even owned a VR device.

371
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:47,790
Why did they pick Wang Miao
to play this game?

372
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,720
Maybe it's an interview.

373
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,550
Wang Miao agreed to join them,

374
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:55,030
and he needed to clear this game
to gain their recognition.

375
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,160
Xu Bingbing, you…

376
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,000
The ten of you should clear this game
as soon as possible.

377
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,480
Me clearing it won't do any good.

378
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,070
This test is for Wang Miao.

379
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,440
Why won't it do any good?

380
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,680
If you clear it, you'll know
the key to the clearance,

381
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,350
which will be helpful to Wang Miao.

382
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:14,110
You're doing much better
than I did when I first played the game.

383
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,830
What's the pattern of the sun's movement
in the world of Three-Body?

384
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,720
You play it every day?

385
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,720
You told me I needed to see
the farmer's world with my own eyes,

386
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,070
but where on earth is the farmer?

387
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,200
The gathering is about to begin.

388
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,240
Why don't you come
and do some reviewing?

389
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,440
Is it still
about the shooter and the farmer?

390
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,960
I've heard that twice.

391
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,270
Hearing it one more time
will help you know more about Lord.

392
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,200
How did it go?

393
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,790
Do you know any of today's attendees?

394
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,750
I've met some of them before.

395
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,550
Which ones?

396
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:18,350
Which ones have frequent dealings
with Shen Yufei? Tell me.

397
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,400
Don't "Ah" me.

398
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,550
Think back.

399
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,920
I didn't recognize all of them.

400
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,440
Just tell me the ones you recognized.
Think back carefully.

401
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,030
I just know
one of them was Pan Jianzhong.

402
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,480
He specializes in quantum optics.

403
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,000
There have been many reports
about him lately.

404
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,200
Give the others some thought, okay?

405
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,070
Try to remember.

406
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,640
Think back carefully.

407
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,750
Mr. Pan.

408
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,680
Mr. Pan, I'm sorry.

409
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,400
Looks like I'm late anyway.

410
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,790
What would you like to drink? My treat.

411
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:29,110
Shi, lately another couple
of foreign scientists have died.

412
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,480
Also suicide?

413
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,200
The Combat Zones have made a new plan.

414
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,310
How many have you recalled?

415
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,920
Captain Shi, Professor Wang,
this is the roster.

416
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,350
Wh-what?

417
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,510
Roster.

418
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,640
I, uh, have a list of names.

419
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,920
It can be said the names of all top-notch
scientists of all fields are on the list.

420
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,780
We need to keep them under surveillance?

421
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,110
Under protection.

422
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,400
Read it carefully
and see if any of them

423
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,960
attended today's gathering,
or has close ties with Shen Yufei.

424
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,270
There are too many of them,
so I can't protect every one of them.

425
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:05,070
Then we protect those in contact
with the Frontiers of Science.

426
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:05,680
Dude!

427
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,680
(Pan Jianzhong, Sun Bogang, Zhang Feiyang.)
You recalled only three during the ride?

428
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,310
Well, I can remember nanotech devices,
but I'm really not good with names.

429
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,350
Besides,
why do you want me to think about this?

430
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:15,070
Many attend the gatherings
of the Frontiers of Science,

431
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,920
but only a few of them
are truly interested.

432
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,070
I got an audacious assumption.

433
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,270
Those having dealings with the Frontiers
of Science have two possible endings.

434
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:26,240
One is that they pretend
to trust them, cooperate with them,

435
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,000
and join them as you do.

436
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,550
The other is that they commit suicide
because they can't stand it.

437
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:31,310
Right now we need to seek out all
the scientists who might kill themselves,

438
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,880
- so we can protect them. Understood?
- Yeah.

439
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,400
Seek them out!

440
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,830
Mr. Pan, I've read all the infosheets.

441
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,720
I find them very thought-provoking.

442
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,200
You mentioned a set of data
in your infosheets.

443
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,110
(Impact of Environmental Pollution
on Ecology)

444
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,480
In the last 40 years,
due to human activities,

445
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,200
the number of sparrows in Country T
has decreased by 57%.

446
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,510
The number of aquatic birds in Albax
is 81% smaller over the previous year,

447
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:59,350
and that of Asian white-backed vultures
has decreased by 99.9%.

448
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,230
They've almost become extinct.

449
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,750
Our earth is faced with such a dire
environmental situation,

450
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:07,400
but we're turning a blind eye to it.

451
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,790
Unless their own lives are in danger,
most people will choose to ignore it.

452
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,070
Yeah.

453
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:21,830
They don't care about the ozone hole,
or water pollution, or air pollution.

454
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,070
You're ignoring one thing.

455
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,920
Yeah.

456
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,960
Light pollution.

457
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,550
You mentioned it in the infosheets.

458
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,310
I find that thought-provoking as well.

459
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,350
Bright light at night

460
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,440
makes it difficult for flying insects
to orient themselves,

461
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,200
and the flowers
that rely on nocturnal insects

462
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,350
to spread their pollen
will have difficulty to multiply.

463
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,790
They'll gradually disappear from the earth.

464
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:49,550
In the long run,
it'll damage the earth's ecosystem.

465
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,750
(Pan Jianzhong)

466
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,510
No. I really can't remember so many names.
I'm about to pass out.

467
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,920
Keep it up.

468
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,000
You can do this.

469
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,480
I can only recall that earlier today,

470
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,070
there was this guy
who's a bit older than others.

471
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,790
His hair's a bit grizzled.

472
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,310
He has a small beard on his chin
which is also grizzled.

473
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:11,680
He talked about something
about northern construction.

474
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,550
I found him.

475
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,510
A fluid dynamics expert.

476
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,510
Cheng Yuan.

477
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,240
Come on.

478
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,540
Keep it up. This is the sixth one.

479
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,750
I remember one more guy.

480
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,920
He had this dimple on the right side
of his face when smiling.

481
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,070
I think he specializes
in quantum dynamics.

482
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,110
Is there a guy like that?

483
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:29,070
What's his name? Do some digging.

484
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,000
Zhai Yiming.

485
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,680
He works at Central China University.

486
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,590
Awesome!

487
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,680
Keep it up, Wang Miao.
This is the seventh one. Go for it.

488
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,920
There's another one.

489
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,640
He works in the Atmospheric Physics
Research Center.

490
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,000
He's well-featured
and a bit square-faced,

491
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,920
but he has asthma,
because he keeps using a spray.

492
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,820
Zhang Jiuchao.

493
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,920
Attaboy!

494
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,920
You're the man!

495
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,000
You can do this. Go for it.

496
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,510
I will. I will.

497
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:56,680
Mr. Pan,
I think if I put all these on newspaper,

498
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:01,240
the public are bound
to be shocked by them.

499
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,440
Shocked?

500
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,880
Will shocking them do any good?

501
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,310
Will anybody care?

502
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,030
Take you for example.

503
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,720
When you gunned your bike
to make it to this interview in time,

504
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,400
did you think of what the exhaust gas
might do to the environment?

505
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,200
Will you feel guilty

506
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,820
when turning on the headlight
of your bike on the road at night?

507
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,310
In the interests of hygiene,

508
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,960
you had the waiter put your coffee
into a takeout cup.

509
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,960
Did you think of the damage
it might cause?

510
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,200
You've read all the infosheets,
but what influence did they have on you?

511
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,440
Did you change in any way?

512
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,110
What's the point
of putting them in an article?

513
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:43,910
Mr. Pan, your words are even more
thought-provoking than the infosheets.

514
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:48,270
Well, what can I do?

515
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,070
Your efforts to publicize these
are commendable enough.

516
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:54,920
If everyone is environmentally aware
enough to ask what they can do,

517
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,830
we'll have a chance.

518
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,200
Do you know the correct way
to dispose of batteries?

519
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,920
With this list,

520
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,400
(List of scientists in need of protection)
we've kept nine scientists

521
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,750
who have close ties with Shen Yufei
under constant surveillance.

522
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:34,480
Most of them specialize in
branches of physics.

523
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,680
What have physicists done
to deserve this?

524
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:42,110
If anything abnormal is detected,
we'll put them under protection immediately.

525
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,110
Liar!

526
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,920
You liar, Newton!

527
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,960
Schrodinger, you liar!

528
00:32:53,960 --> 00:33:00,830
Einstein, you liar.

529
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:10,310
Cavendish, you liar.

530
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:17,640
Dirac, you liar.

531
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:24,000
You liars.

532
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,750
Fortunately, it's Sunday,
so there's nobody working in the lab.

533
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:57,030
The one who found the body was the
security guard on duty this weekend.

534
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:02,400
We've handled it,
minimizing the aftermath of this incident.

535
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,790
Did he have dealings with anybody?

536
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,680
No.

537
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,350
It's still suicide, without doubt.

538
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,070
Only days ago, his research received
international recognition.

539
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:12,480
He was scheduled to give many interviews
in the next few days,

540
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,550
and his department was going to
hold a meeting to commend him next week.

541
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,670
He even prepared an acceptance speech.

542
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,760
Then he killed himself?

543
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,880
Yeah, he did.

544
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:36,550
Mandatory protection.

545
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,840
I'm very sorry
to have brought you here

546
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,590
in this fashion,
but you have nothing to worry about.

547
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,630
We're protecting you.

548
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:08,440
Lately, a lot of scientists
committed suicide without warning.

549
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,630
We suspect
that there's more to those suicides.

550
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:16,710
I don't want anything like that
to happen to you.

551
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,110
You're all elites of our country.

552
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:23,670
It can be said that you've
made great contributions to

553
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,670
our nation, our country, even mankind.

554
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:29,320
I really hope you can leave aside
the scientific research you're doing

555
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,360
and stay under our protection.

556
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:39,710
We'll ascertain the truth asap
lest your lives be threatened again.

557
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:43,550
(Transfer Letter from Battle Command Center)
As for your original departments and families,

558
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:47,280
you may rest assured
that we'll make proper arrangements.

559
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,510
All of us will claim that
you're transferred temporarily

560
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,670
for a scientific research project.

561
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,960
Please trust me.

562
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:01,230
Everything I did
is to ensure your safety.

563
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,510
Do you know that these places were
covered in greenery only years ago?

564
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:15,230
But now they're a scene
of utter desolation.

565
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:20,030
Actually, what we need to know
is much more than these.

566
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:23,510
On earth,
dozens of species go extinct every day.

567
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:29,230
And the carbon dioxide levels in the air
are the highest in three million years.

568
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:33,150
Even in the untraversed Antarctica,
plastic trash has been found.

569
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:36,590
Maybe you feel that none of this
has anything to do with you.

570
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:39,840
To save time, you press your foot down
sharply on the gas pedal

571
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,150
without realizing how much damage
the exhaust gas might cause.

572
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,760
That Mu Xing girl you told me to
look into recorded a program in the studio.

573
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,280
Still about environmental protection.

574
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,400
You buy a bubble tea at the roadside

575
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,710
and use a takeout container
without a second thought.

576
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,070
If the contents of her recording
is problematic, don't let her release it.

577
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:55,760
Yes.

578
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,110
Where will plastic litter end up?

579
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,030
Someone visited her during the filming.

580
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:04,000
They had a talk, and then she
left without finishing the filming.

581
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,360
Where did she go?

582
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,800
Don't worry. I had someone tail her.

583
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,760
(Mu Xing)

584
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,840
So you're Mu Xing?

585
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,510
Nobody attacked him.

586
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,480
All his vitals are normal.

587
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,590
He just has blurred vision.

588
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,590
Blurred vision?

589
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,400
Yeah.

590
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,880
He says his field of view is filled
with sparks.

591
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,880
Sparks and electrical sparks.

592
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,190
He can hardly see anything else.

593
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,280
Send him to a hospital.

594
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,550
Make sure he's properly protected.

595
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:27,030
Yes.

596
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:11,030
That man was carried onto an ambulance.

597
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,550
He's a scientist specializing
in quantum electrodynamics,

598
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:16,280
Zhai Yiming.

599
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,760
How's the definition of the footage?

600
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,670
Impressive.

601
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,190
You found out as well?

602
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,960
Found out what?

603
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,800
These scientists are under house arrest.

604
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,550
Apart from him, there are others.

605
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:42,670
I strongly suspect that this has something
to do with the suicides of those scientists.

606
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:47,440
This is a protection measure.

607
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,030
It was your doing?

608
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,800
- Come with me.
- Please don't.

609
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,400
Now!

610
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,030
Speak!

611
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:13,320
According to the regulations,
I can stay here for 24 hours, right?

612
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,070
24 hours.

613
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:20,110
I doubt you can sit here for 24 hours
without telling me anything.

614
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,630
Those are my lines.

615
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:25,320
I should say the same thing to you.

616
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,590
How did you know Zhai Yiming was there?

617
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,750
Who told you?

618
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:32,280
Who's the guy visiting you
in your studio this afternoon?

619
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,840
Do you think it's possible
that he told me the address

620
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,150
because he's also worried
about the scientists' safety?

621
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:40,710
If he was worried,
he would've told the police.

622
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:43,670
He told you
because he wanted you to cause panic.

623
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,510
I'm spreading the truth.

624
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,700
That's bullshit.

625
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:52,280
What you should do the most is to keep
your nose clean and cause us no trouble.

626
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,590
What's the point of burying your head
in the sand like an ostrich?

627
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:00,710
Everybody deserves to know the truth.

628
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,840
You think I was the only one who found out
about those scientists' whereabouts?

629
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,400
You can stop me, but can you stop
everybody else from spreading the truth?

630
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,710
Officer Shi.

631
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,880
Please be cooperative.

632
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,070
You got the information I want,
and I got the information you want.

633
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:20,030
Why don't we just trust each other
and be honest with each other?

634
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:23,360
You think this is a cafe or something?

635
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,510
Do you know what this place is?

636
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,280
I do.

637
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,440
Then why are you bargaining with me?

638
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,070
You think you're in a position
to bargain with me?

639
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:37,000
Captain Shi,
why don't you let me ask her?

640
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,670
Do you think…

641
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:00,590
Describe what you saw.

642
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:02,430
I can't.

643
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:03,880
I couldn't see anything else.

644
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,150
One second, there were sparks.
Then next, there were electrical sparks.

645
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:12,830
Anyway, it's like there were
fireworks crackling in front of my eyes.

646
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,710
The glare almost blinded me.

647
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:17,280
Fireworks crackling?

648
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,220
No firecrackers?

649
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,400
No.

650
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,110
Then why did you hear the crackle?

651
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,070
There was no crackle.

652
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:25,920
Just glare.

653
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,550
What about now?

654
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:30,440
It suddenly… suddenly stopped.

655
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,960
Are you sure
there were only fireworks?

656
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,510
I'm sure.

657
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:35,960
No numbers?

658
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,190
Even if there were,
I wouldn't have been able to see them.

659
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:41,710
There were sparks everywhere.

660
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,360
What did the doctor say?

661
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,480
Severe floater.

662
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,550
How's he now?

663
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:51,280
He's recovered.
