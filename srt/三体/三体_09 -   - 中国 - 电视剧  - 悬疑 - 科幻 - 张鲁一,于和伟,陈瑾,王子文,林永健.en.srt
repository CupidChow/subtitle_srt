1
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,640
(The planned route of the torch relay
for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games)

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,750
(was officially released in April.)

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,320
(Yes.)

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,670
(Currently, preparations for
the torch relay are in full swing.)

5
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,480
(As far as we know, the torch relay
of the Beijing Olympic Games)

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,230
(will manifest the concept
of green Olympics.)

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,510
(Environmental awareness will
run through the whole relay.)

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,390
(The Beijing Organizing Committees
of the Olympic Games)

9
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,110
(have formulated environmental standards
of conduct for all people.)

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,710
(Please note that it's all people, participating in the
Olympic torch relay,)

11
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,640
(including torch bearers.)

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,390
(Exactly.)

13
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,040
(It seems that
our environmental awareness...)

14
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,350
(Yes.)

15
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:48,880
(We've learned from the
environmental promotion that)

16
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,060
(the BOCOG requires all people
participating in the torch relay)

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,830
(not to use disposable foam tableware,
or wooden chopsticks.)

18
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,200
(They also suggest that
we should actively reduce)

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,770
(the use of disposable towels, etc.)

20
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,710
(They particularly encourage people
to take buses,)

21
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:03,170
(Yes.)

22
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,730
(to reduce energy consumption
and vehicle emissions.)

23
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,280
(Exactly.)

24
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,430
I'm home.

25
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,510
Finally.

26
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,760
Your daughter has been
waiting for you all night.

27
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,280
Doudou, Dad is home.

28
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,760
Your rescuer comes.

29
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,040
What's up?

30
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,230
After you gave the speech at her school,
she became interested in physics.

31
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,710
Look, she's doing an experiment.

32
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,920
Doudou, what experiment
needs so many eggs?

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:55,200
The teacher asked us to
put the egg into the bottle intact.

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,950
For the experiment, Doudou has eaten
several eggs this night.

35
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,200
Are you upset?

36
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,870
The bottle is small and the egg is big.

37
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,960
It can't be shoved in.

38
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,960
Dad will figure a way out.

39
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,590
Let's see if I can help you, OK?

40
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,800
Here, hold the egg.

41
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,310
Doudou, hold the egg.

42
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,870
When I tell you to release it,
put it at the mouth of the bottle, OK?

43
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,840
Get ready.

44
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,560
Three, two, one.

45
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,080
Release.

46
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,360
Mom, Mom, come here.

47
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,240
Coming.

48
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,800
Look.

49
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,080
The egg went down itself.

50
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,680
It really did.

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,190
Amazing!

52
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,280
Dad, can you tell me why?

53
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,680
Let me tell you.

54
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,910
There are many tiny molecules
both in the bottle and outside it.

55
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,080
The fire Dad lit
burned some of the molecules out.

56
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,400
So there were more space inside,

57
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,590
and the tiny molecules outside
were impatient to swarm in.

58
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,470
Thus they shove the egg in.

59
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,630
Physics is amazing, just like magic.

60
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,560
Physics isn't magic.

69
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,750
It only took you three hours?

70
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,670
How did you make it?

71
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:31,600
The first two hours and 55 minutes,
I sat in front of her without saying a word.

72
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,560
Then she couldn't stand it.

73
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,430
I couldn't have stood it either
if it were me. And then?

74
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:44,040
Then I told her that it was a state-level
secret and I wanted her to cooperate.

75
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,000
That's all?

76
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,830
I promised her that she could continue the
investigation without disclosing the secret.

77
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,000
Let her make more trouble?

78
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,070
She did find something.

79
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,830
This is the video Mu Xing got.

80
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,680
All eight safe houses have been exposed.

81
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,120
It's weird.

82
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,750
Not until the last minute before
arriving at the safe houses

83
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,830
did the SWAT team members escorting
the scientists know the locations

84
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,430
of the safe houses.

85
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,240
Then the secret shouldn't
have been let out.

86
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,560
Many impossible things
have happened recently.

87
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,800
Look.

88
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,240
From the beginning of the shoot

89
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,040
to the time when the scientists entered
the safe houses, before the SWAT knew

90
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,000
where the houses were located,
they had already made

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,920
all preparations for the shoot.

92
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,470
There must be a snitch.

93
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:03,120
If there's really a snitch,
it must be me.

94
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,800
Don't say that about yourself.

95
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,360
It's strange.

96
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:14,390
I chose the eight safe houses from
my file and numbered them one by one.

97
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:18,920
I didn't inform any team members
until the last moment.

98
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,560
How could the secret be leaked?

99
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:40,160
Physics doesn't exist.

100
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,630
Have you found Mu Xing's
information source?

101
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,440
(Since the Olympic Games
were open to booking,)

102
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,230
(tickets for the opening ceremony
have been a hit in public bookings.)

103
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,090
(Judging by the current orders,)

104
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,620
(most people have booked tickets
for the opening ceremony.)

105
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:02,540
(The orders are far more than the
26,000 tickets provided by the BOCOG.)

106
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,480
Brat.

107
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,510
Why are you standing here?

108
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,600
Waiting for you.

109
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,750
Waiting for me?

110
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,790
If I wanted to escape, how could
your poor car catch up with me?

111
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,790
Really?

112
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,000
What car do you drive?

113
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,480
The same brand as yours,
but more premium.

114
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,840
What's the output volume?

115
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,480
Four-wheel drive?

116
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,030
Why are you waiting for me here?

117
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,320
It's convenient.

118
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,360
After you finish interrogating me,
I can pick up my car by myself, right?

119
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,480
Come on.

120
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,600
Let's go in my poor car.

121
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,200
Go.

122
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,790
Come on.

123
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,840
I can do it myself.

124
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,510
Can you?

125
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,550
Yes, no problem.

126
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,600
We're in extremely
perilous situation here.

127
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,960
If we take them into protective custody,
they'll accuse us of strong armament.

128
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,910
There will be public unrest, riots,
and God knows what else.

129
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,030
On the other hand, we have to act now.

130
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:48,510
General Chang, your sector is the
only one under control, am I right?

131
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,360
It's only temporary.

132
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,080
I don't know if tomorrow
we'll face the same situation as you do.

133
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,720
Each and every move of ours
is exposed to the enemy.

134
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,320
And we don't ever know
who are they by now.

135
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,390
Are you scared?

136
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,080
Frankly speaking, I'm scared.

137
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,670
I would rather face a real war
than be a turkey waiting for

138
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,750
Thanksgiving like now.

139
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,200
Shi, rumor is a fearful thing.

140
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,320
Now, the Combat Zones are under
the pressure of public opinion.

141
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,200
Fortunately, we've controlled
the malicious spread of information.

142
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,080
I've caught the messenger. I'll interrogate him later.

143
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,720
Did you catch him? You're such a boaster.

144
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,750
He drove here himself.

145
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,910
Whatever, he is the first we've caught.

146
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,030
OK.

147
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,510
You rock!

148
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,600
You've been here
for more than a year, right?

149
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:54,590
If you hadn't occupied the museum,
it would have opened long ago.

150
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:59,440
In that case,
I should be the first tourist, right?

151
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,600
Tourists can leave after the visit.

152
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,840
That's why I parked my car at the door.

153
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,390
It'll be more convenient
for me to drive off.

154
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:19,120
This place
should be the Asian Combat Zone.

155
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,390
The European Combat Zone
was established earlier.

156
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,030
Sure, the North American Combat Zone

157
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:30,510
in Lington, Country M,
was the earliest established.

158
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:37,480
Now, Oceania, South America and Africa
should have taken it seriously too.

159
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,080
Combat Zone, seriously?

160
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,630
Do you know who you're fighting against?

161
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:51,150
You did a great job!

162
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,150
I only read your paper recently.

163
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,480
I never thought that at that time,
you had already correctly predicted

164
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,600
that long-term consumption of genetically
modified foods would cause controversy.

165
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,720
You also predicted
the ecological disasters would

166
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,320
come with genetically modified crops.

167
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,120
The specific details
were close to life and horrifying.

168
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,270
Do you know how
those scholars appraise you?

169
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,910
From the future.

170
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:23,000
God's eye.

171
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,120
According to your theory, should I
discard the straw and the can separately?

172
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,840
It makes no difference.

173
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,630
When they're shipped to the dump,
they'll still be mixed up together.

174
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,910
I'm relieved to hear that.

175
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:45,720
Hu Xiaoxi, graduated from the Electronic
Engineering and Information Institute,

176
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:51,030
works in Songjie Network Service
as a service administrator.

177
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,960
So you're an administrator
of an Internet cafe.

178
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,390
Six years ago, you started to
write science fiction online

179
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,750
under the pseudonym, Poet of Chuantuo.

180
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,360
Your fiction almost attracts no readers.

181
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,120
Last year, you participated in
a cyber-fiction competition.

182
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,910
The prize was about 5 million yuan.

183
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,630
Yes.

184
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:18,510
It was said that whoever wrote
a more terrifying future

185
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,440
would be more likely to win the prize.

186
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,480
At last, you won the prize
for no reason, didn't you?

187
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,240
General Chang, I think you
should be more curious about

188
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:37,960
how I know your combat zone and
the locations of your safe houses.

189
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,720
Fine.

190
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,240
Come on. Tell me.

191
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,790
Who are you?

192
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:48,140
General Chang, you are responsible
for the protection of the scientists.

193
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,960
(List of scientists in need of protection)
Only at the last moment,

194
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,030
would you tell your men
about the locations.

195
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:57,390
Before that,
nobody knew anything other than you.

196
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,200
Aren't you curious at all?

197
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:07,720
How could I arrive at the safe
house before your order was even given?

198
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,550
Yeah.

199
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:13,630
I think that's what
you came to me to talk about today.

200
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,390
I really understand your feelings.

201
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,000
After all, you're leading a combat zone.

202
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,750
You have to know the enemy
you're going to face.

203
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,910
OK.

204
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,960
Let me tell you.

205
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:29,600
Your enemy at the moment is me.

206
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,510
You look a little dismissive.

207
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,000
You may think I'm not qualified.

208
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Fine.

209
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,910
Answer me,
what your combat zones are doing?

210
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,960
You're investigating
the suicides of scientists.

211
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,670
Of course,
you call those accidental deaths.

212
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,030
Let me make it clear with you.

213
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:56,600
They did commit suicide.

214
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,750
I didn't tell anyone
where the safe houses were.

215
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,960
I've thought it over.

216
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,550
It might have been leaked
when I pulled the information.

217
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:11,440
But, you are definitely not
the boss behind the scenes.

218
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,150
You received an email
that informed you of the locations.

219
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:21,670
On that day, you answered
a phone for 11 seconds.

220
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,440
You were told to take the video.

221
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,120
But you were short of hands,
so you sought for your friends' help.

222
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,480
After you took the video,
you gave it to her.

223
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,910
What's her name?

224
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,750
Mu Xing.

225
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,240
That's right. You gave it to her.

226
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,870
I've got two pieces of information,
the phone call and the e-mail.

227
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:43,870
But I don't know who gave you
the call and sent you the e-mail.

228
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:48,750
So I'll ask you again, who are you?

229
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:54,200
General Chang,
why do you still not understand?

230
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,000
That's not the question you should ask.

231
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,360
You should ask about us.

232
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,000
Who are we?

233
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,720
OK.

234
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,110
I tell you what,
let me tell you a story.

235
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,680
Once upon a time, there was a farm.

236
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,160
Stop. Stop. You're going to tell me that

237
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:27,440
I'm a two-dimensional creature,
or a turkey, aren't you?

238
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,880
Then tell me, who is this farmer?

239
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,350
Don't you have anything to say?

240
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,000
Fine. Even if there is this farmer,
he would never hire

241
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,960
such a dumb turkey as you
to work for them.

242
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,400
All right. I don't think you can
tell me anything useful today.

243
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,830
Go home.

244
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,350
No, I...

245
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,750
No, wait, wait, wait.

246
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,920
You should continue the interrogation.

247
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,440
- Did you even interrogate me?
- Does it make any sense?

248
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,000
It's only a waste of my words.

249
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,880
Go.

250
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,790
No. I...

251
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:06,790
By the way, you said
you wanted to be my enemy.

252
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,400
You're not qualified.

253
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,440
You're really some piece of work.

254
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,070
You caught a dumb ass.

255
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,720
How could you waste my time like that?

256
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,510
Did I catch him?

257
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:26,070
He drove here himself.

258
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:32,720
Chang, I have to warn you that all your
eight houses have been exposed.

259
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,960
We got the list from Wang Miao.

260
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,160
Wang Miao's cover must have been
blown in the Frontiers of Science.

261
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:48,480
When I got that list,
I was mentally prepared to be exposed.

262
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,640
What should we do?

263
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,880
Proceed as usual.

264
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:20,480
If it weren't for me, you would have
lost contact with the eight people.

265
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,200
So what?

266
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,200
The Battle Command Center only locked
them up to suspend their research.

267
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,550
They didn't lock them up.

268
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,880
They are protecting them.

269
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,720
This list
was leaked by your member, Wang Miao.

270
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,640
The activities of our group
have always been above board.

271
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,200
It can't be regarded as a leak
to tell an outright thing.

272
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,030
But Wang Miao isn't
outright enough to you.

273
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:53,790
And he's never stopped his research.

274
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:04,920
When Wang Miao first played the game,
he performed better than you and me.

275
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,640
It means that
he can know Lord faster than we do.

276
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,510
It means nothing.

277
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,510
He isn't our comrade.

278
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,030
None of us can alter the will of Lord.

279
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:20,310
Did your people, Hu Xiaoxi,
follow the will of the Lord?

280
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:23,790
Did Lord let him swagger to the
Battle Command Center to show off

281
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,510
and demonstrate?

282
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,590
I never liked him driving, let
alone driving cars with large-engines.

283
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,400
It isn't environmentally friendly.

284
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,750
Lord will never see him again.

285
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,750
Press!

286
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,590
Harder!

287
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,590
All right.

288
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,030
Wash your hands.

289
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,750
What's wrong?

290
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,750
Inadequate stress on the two contact
faces caused a large amount of loss

291
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,070
during power transmission.

292
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,480
Don't you scientists
love to talk in this way?

293
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,960
Why don't you understand?

294
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,070
The belt pulley is loose.

295
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,720
OK.

296
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,720
You caught all the people
on the list I gave you, didn't you?

297
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,830
We didn't catch them,
instead, we tried to protect them.

298
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:46,880
But you failed.

299
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:59,030
I can feel that Chang is under great
pressure even though he didn't tell me.

300
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,830
Just think.

301
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:07,510
He made the plan himself and
didn't tell anyone, yet it was leaked.

302
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:11,200
Clearly, the Center must be
under close surveillance.

303
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,830
We should take the initiative.

304
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,480
Shen Yufei must have
seen through me now.

305
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,830
And you still ask me to contact her.

306
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,400
Don't you think
she'll keep an eye on me?

307
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,160
I've discussed it with Chang.

308
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,590
It doesn't matter whether you
leak the secret or not.

309
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,110
After all,
their gatherings are above board.

310
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,920
She must have other plans for you.

311
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,350
But for your safety, I should go with you
to see Shen Yufei and talk to her.

312
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,680
We'd better cut to the chase.

313
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,350
In case of any danger, I'll warn you.

314
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,000
I told you that I would protect you.

315
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,110
I must protect Copernicus.

316
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,860
(Waste water from Xitang Village)

317
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,640
Mr. Pan.

318
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,510
You're on time.

319
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,960
I came here on foot today.

320
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,150
This, I replaced its battery
with a rechargeable one.

321
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,960
Thanks a lot.

322
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,350
That's what I should do.

323
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:37,270
Actually,
that's what everyone should do.

324
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,400
Unfortunately, people only pay attention

325
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:46,200
to things concerning their
own interests, or vulgar gossip.

326
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,270
You're very sensitive in this respect.

327
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:53,480
And I admire that.

328
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,590
Did you see my news report?

329
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,270
Don't record our conversation again
from now on.

330
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,590
First, I regret to tell you that you
should have reported a piece of big news.

331
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,640
Big news?

332
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,030
What's that?

333
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:18,350
You should have reported it earlier
than foreign presses.

334
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:23,310
Unfortunately,
you missed the opportunity.

335
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,510
You mean
the case of scientists being kidnapped?

336
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,110
You were caught.

337
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:35,480
So you couldn't report it.

338
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,480
It's a state-level secret.

339
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,240
How did you know it?

340
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,790
Aren't you curious about why you
got the information so easily?

341
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:50,160
Of all the media workers,
why Hu Xiaoxi gave the information to you?

342
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,310
Because I chose you.

343
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,720
I kind of understand this game now.

344
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,070
You did well in the game.

345
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,440
I want to talk to you.

346
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:12,830
Here's the address,
Number Two, Carriage Four.

347
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,310
What do you mean?

348
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:20,790
It's the only train in
Civilization No. 139.

349
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:48,680
I never thought that
this civilization had advanced

350
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,790
all the way to the Steam Age.

351
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,030
We are lucky.

352
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:57,350
This time, the Stable Era has been
lasting very long.

353
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:01,640
Civilization No. 138
ended in the Stone Age.

354
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,310
I thought Civilization No. 139
would end soon,

355
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:08,270
never expecting that it would
advance to this level.

356
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:11,790
I almost forgot
what the Chaotic Era was like.

357
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:14,750
But you're constantly afraid.

358
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,480
I think the purpose of this game is
for us to find the alternation pattern

359
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,550
between the Stable Eras and
the Chaotic Eras, or find a way to

360
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,070
protect and continue civilization.

361
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,400
Am I right?

362
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,880
Professor Wang,
why should civilization advance?

363
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,830
To survive.

364
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,030
Yes.

365
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,350
We spare no effort on
observation and calculation,

366
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:43,440
and climb the technology tree
in order not to be destroyed.

367
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,310
You've shown me the world of the farmer.

368
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:51,200
Does that mean I can see the farmer
after I pass the game?

369
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,440
Lord needs you to know him first.

370
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,830
In the game,
many people have begun an expedition

371
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,830
through the world to observe the suns.

372
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:03,680
They hope to calculate the distance
between us and the sun by solar parallax.

373
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,640
Do you think they can find a pattern?

374
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,590
I hope they can find it.

375
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:11,790
But do we still have time?

376
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,160
Sherlock Holmes?

377
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,030
Who are you dressing as?

378
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,160
The Lady of the Camellias?

379
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,350
Madam Butterfly?

380
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:41,070
You know what, a scientist
can be pretty if she's dressed up.

381
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,590
How do you like my style?

382
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,110
It suits you.

383
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,790
What took you so long?

384
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,790
- Don't mention it.
- Sit down.

385
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,030
The carriage numbers
are not in sequence.

386
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,920
I got in Number Seven
directly from Number Two.

387
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,590
And then I got in Number 42.

388
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,240
I walked back and forth.

389
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,030
You're not interested
in the game, are you?

390
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,000
No.

391
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,880
I don't think it's as easy to play
as Snake.

392
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,400
I don't think you came to see me
only to talk about this, right?

393
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,200
I see.

394
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,830
You don't have to do this.

395
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:17,510
You can ask me directly if you want
to know who were in our gatherings.

396
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,550
The gatherings are open.

397
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,960
You don't need to feel bad
about handing in the list.

398
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,240
If you said that earlier,
our talk would be easier, Dr. Shen.

399
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,830
Our chat in the game doesn't
count as an interrogation.

400
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:37,830
I just want to know what happened to
those scientists who committed suicide.

401
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,240
I've told you everything I know.

402
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,680
If you want to know more,
I can tell you what I understand.

403
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,680
It's about to end.

404
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,830
(Civilization No. 139
was destroyed by a tri-solar day.)

405
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:26,510
(The civilization had advanced
to the Steam Age.)

406
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,400
(The seed of civilization remains.)

407
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,070
(We invite you to log in
to the game again.)

408
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:47,500
(Nanomaterial Center)

409
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,070
Let's go.

410
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,030
To see Shen Yufei.

411
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,830
Did you see my news report?

412
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:13,350
Don't record our conversation again
from now on.

413
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:19,590
Mr. Pan, I know you are a famous biologist
in the Frontiers of Science.

414
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:22,790
Many scientists committed
suicide after contacting the group.

415
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:25,880
What do you think of it?

416
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:30,160
Suicide isn't worth investigating.

417
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,310
This is.

418
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:45,620
(Risk Assessment of Foreign Water Pollution)
(Foreign Data on Sulfur Dioxide Pollution)

419
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,350
Where did you get these?

420
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,350
Who on earth are you?

421
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,790
It doesn't matter who I am.

422
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:06,640
But when numerous people like you and me
are united, they can't cover up many things.

423
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,920
We can help you to do
what you want to do.

424
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,350
You?

425
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,750
We're very powerful.

426
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:21,680
By working with us, you'll get more.

427
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:26,110
So, you are not a simple biologist.

428
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:30,680
With a pH value greater than nine,
plants can't survive.

429
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,240
Take a look at the information.

430
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,830
How many places there are
with a pH value far greater than nine

431
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:39,240
due to industrial pollution?

432
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,640
A simple biologist
can't protect those creatures.

433
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,480
So you want me to report these for you?

434
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,440
It will be a great shock.

435
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,550
Don't worry.

436
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,590
I won't let them stop me this time.

437
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,440
I'll take care of it.

438
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,350
We can't arrest or interrogate her.
Will she tell us the truth?

439
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,030
We'll talk.

440
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:30,400
If she talks to us,
we'll get something eventually.

441
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,880
Is it an interrogation
when you question me here?

442
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,310
No, no.

443
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:23,590
It's just a chat between net friends.

444
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:26,070
Sit down.

445
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:33,350
What do you want to know?

446
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,030
Start from Professor Munphy.

447
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:41,400
I've told you everything.

448
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,310
I only let him see the truth.

449
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:56,350
The Liangxiang Collider,
Yang Dong tested three times using it.

450
00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:00,270
None of the data was the
same as her calculation.

451
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,960
According to my consultation,
under normal conditions,

452
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,510
even if the three sets of data
were different from her calculation,

453
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:11,710
there shouldn't be such huge differences
between the data themselves.

454
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:16,590
And, the differences...

455
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,360
- Were without patterns.
- Yeah.

456
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,110
Without any patterns.

457
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:24,070
I was wondering,
if they couldn't calculate the data

458
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:30,070
no matter what they did, how could
you get them even before the experiment?

459
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:37,630
Munphy showed Yang Dong
two copies of data.

460
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,880
Nine o'clock.

461
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,110
What happened at nine?

462
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:45,320
Ding Yi then consoled her that something
might be wrong with the photocopier.

463
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,230
I only sent him faxes.

464
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,840
If it was he who photocopied them,
how could the faxes

465
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,510
have been photocopied
at different times?

466
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:54,840
Nobody could've gotten the results of
your experiment before you conducted it.

467
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,630
It's definitely the machine.
Have some faith in science, okay?

468
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,280
Can a photocopier make mistakes
with only the time?

469
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,480
Obviously, the explanation
wasn't convincing at all.

470
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,630
It was you who gave the data
to Munphy in advance.

471
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,400
Yes.

472
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,360
I did give him the data
before the experiment.

473
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:22,150
Did you come up
with the results by calculation?

474
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:27,030
If you did,
physics should still exist.

475
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:31,360
You and I work in applied physics.

476
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,190
We can't get them.

477
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,960
Yang Dong and Munphy worked
in fundamental physics.

478
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,070
They couldn't get them either.

479
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:44,800
It shows that our physics
really doesn't exist.

480
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,280
Then who worked them out?

481
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,000
The farmer?

482
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,190
Lord knows everything.

483
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,920
Lord?

484
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:03,840
Are you talking about
one person or a group of people?

485
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:08,030
It doesn't matter.

486
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:19,360
Is it a big deal to get those data?

487
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,440
Sorry.

488
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,400
No smoking here.

489
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,000
Professor Wang
will answer your question.

490
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,070
I drop this box of cigarettes
three times in a row.

491
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,190
Same cigarettes.

492
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,440
Same amount.

493
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:56,110
Do you think that where each cigarette
lands can be exactly the same each time?

494
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,230
It's impossible.

495
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:01,630
If I ask you to mark
the position of each cigarette

496
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:06,280
each time in advance, can you do that?

497
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,280
Even more impossible.

498
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,630
- Do you understand now?
- Yes.

499
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:15,190
But you didn't have to
throw my cigarettes.

500
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:23,920
So, Munphy killed himself because
he couldn't accept this, right?

501
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,320
He killed himself because
he accepted the truth.

502
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,150
It's gone.

503
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:34,400
All this nonsense.

504
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,920
I see.

505
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,440
His faith collapsed.

506
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,320
What about Yang Dong?

507
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:52,840
Honestly, I don't know Yang Dong well.

508
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,630
After the experiment,
we talked on the phone.

509
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:59,400
I thought she accepted the fact
that physics might not exist.

510
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,440
Afterward, she didn't give up her life.

511
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:09,840
She changed her job
and even thought of getting married.

512
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:14,510
You gave her a file packet.

513
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,670
Five days after that,
she killed herself.

514
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,760
If you made a survey,
you should know what was inside.

515
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,030
If I was really a suspect,
I wouldn't be sitting here now.

516
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:34,150
What was in the packet?

517
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,800
A recommendation letter.

518
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,030
She recommended Yang Dong
to work in a research institute.

519
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,030
So are you suggesting

520
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:46,230
Yang Dong's suicide had nothing to do
with the existence of physics?

521
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:50,510
I don't understand why Yang Dong made

522
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:55,590
such a choice ten months
after the experiment failed.

523
00:38:55,590 --> 00:39:00,000
Physics has never existed,
and will never exist.

524
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,880
Yeah.

525
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,670
Those were Yang Dong's last words.

526
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:10,880
I understand why Munphy killed himself,
but I don't understand Yang Dong.

527
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,630
I did show those scientists the truth,

528
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:19,000
but I couldn't interfere with
their choice.

529
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,960
Did your Lord ask you to do so?

530
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,510
Lord revealed the truth to us.

531
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:31,760
That's why he's the Lord.
