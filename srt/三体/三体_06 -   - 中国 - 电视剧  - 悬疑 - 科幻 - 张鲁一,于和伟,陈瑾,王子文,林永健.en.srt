1
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,880
What's this?

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,800
Look carefully.

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,760
Look in the middle.

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,390
What's this?

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,230
Countdown.

6
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,500
Where did you get these?

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,230
Wang Miao took them.

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,030
Every one of them was taken by him.

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,830
Every one has that thing on it.

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,500
When did he start taking these?

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,150
This is the first time.

12
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,870
Previous to this,
it only appeared in pictures,

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,430
but now, it's right in front of him.

14
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:45,560
I mean, even the things he sees
have that countdown on them,

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,850
and it's been ongoing all the time.

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:57,150
Chang, while you're checking these out,
I, uh, I'll fill you in on something.

17
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,600
I used to have a colleague named Tian.

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,070
I think you know him.

19
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,000
He has a habit.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,110
Every time he needs to go on a mission,

21
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,950
he'll check the total number of
the cigarettes in his cigarette pack first.

22
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,400
It has to be odd.

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,950
If it's even,
he'll pull one out before departure.

24
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,310
Don't smoke in here.

25
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:31,700
Strangely enough, so long as it's odd,
he's guaranteed to catch the suspect.

26
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,920
On one occasion,
after he checked his cigarettes,

27
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,060
I stealthily pulled one out.

28
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,640
Guess what?

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,040
On that day,
he cornered the suspect at a dead end,

30
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,070
but somehow the latter
climbed over the wall and escaped.

31
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:50,430
Because of that, I didn't get any cigarettes
from Tian for two months.

32
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:58,150
Chang, do you think this
has anything to do with the case?

33
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,920
Then what did Wang Miao do

34
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,640
that had nothing to do
with the countdown?

35
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,510
Wang Miao shut down
the nano experiment,

36
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,430
and the countdown disappeared.

37
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,520
I've always said that anything
sufficiently weird must be fishy,

38
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,360
but this time around,
this fishy thing's way too unusual.

39
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,460
Do you know who had him
shut down the experiment?

40
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,400
Shen Yufei.

58
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,870
It's very weird that I,
a would-be Buddhist,

59
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,150
raise chickens, right?

60
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,030
I heard chicken used to be
your favorite food.

61
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,520
Yeah.

62
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,800
A student of mine, who didn't know
I'd converted to Buddhism,

63
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,120
came to visit, and he actually brought me
a couple of chickens.

64
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,390
I couldn't eat them,

65
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,560
even if I wanted to,
so I had no choice but to keep them.

66
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,310
You see,
now they've become so many.

67
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,680
It's not weird.

68
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,750
I'm a scientist but I pray quite often.

69
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,600
I wonder if these chickens know
it is me who's been feeding them.

70
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,830
Just like I don't know
if the deity you pray to

71
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,480
can see your piety or not.

72
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,600
I mean, the whole universe
is… is like

73
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,390
a malfunctioning fluorescent tube.

74
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,560
It flickers with a crackling sound,
and uh,

75
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,630
Shen Yufei told Wang Miao beforehand
when it would flicker.

76
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:04,750
The rhythm of its flickering
is a set of codes.

77
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:12,480
After the codes were deciphered,
they're still a countdown.

78
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,430
Do you guys raise chickens
in Pastoral China?

79
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,560
That program is the work
of Pan Han and some others.

80
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,270
I got nothing to do with it.

81
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,830
I heard he threw people back
into the natural environment

82
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,260
to reduce consumption and trash.

83
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,480
You don't like his method
of environmental protection?

84
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,480
What's the point of that?

85
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,310
Humans can never give up city life
and get back to nature.

86
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,800
Only a small number of people

87
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,120
have seen through the emptiness
of earthly life.

88
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,160
What is this countdown exactly?

89
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,950
Where does it come from?

90
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:56,040
And what will happen when it ends?

91
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,060
That's what I'm going to find out.

92
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:04,160
Chang,
what should we do with Wang Miao?

93
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,750
Shen Yufei put a lot of work into him.

94
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,430
Her efforts will not be in vain.

95
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,070
But don't worry.

96
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:19,000
Wang Miao is definitely our entry point
to the truth.

97
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,820
Yeah.

98
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,950
Alright.

99
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,750
My report is over.

100
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,040
I understand.

101
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,070
You made it an odd number.

102
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,600
See you.

103
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,840
How does it feel to see
through the emptiness of earthly life?

104
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,160
Boring.

105
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,070
You guys think my lifestyle's boring,
and I think yours is boring,

106
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:06,360
so this is very interesting.

107
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,270
Interesting.

108
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,680
Professor Peng, I'm Chang Weisi.

109
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,800
I got a question for you.

110
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,310
Can the universe flicker?

111
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,290
We've got European, North American, African,
and all other major combat zones.

112
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,240
Send those pictures to them right now.

113
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay.

114
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,790
I'm sorry to have
kept you waiting, everybody.

115
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,160
Latest news.

116
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:09,420
A moment ago, another exceptional case
happened in Asian Combat Zone.

117
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,160
Another scientist's suicide?

118
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,190
No.

119
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,830
Someone saw a countdown.

120
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,830
A countdown?

121
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,920
You mean, like, the ones in the photographs?

122
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,950
Were they printed?

123
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,430
They're not printed.

124
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,560
We haven't verified
how they came into being.

125
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,190
Those on the pictures
are only in a preliminary form.

126
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,360
What do you mean?

127
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,110
Are they projected
or are there other carriers?

128
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,510
It's somewhat bizarre.

129
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:39,240
I should say this is something
we've never seen before.

130
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,030
It's on his retina.

131
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,390
What? Undercover?

132
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,270
That's one way to put it.

133
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,750
You see,

134
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,480
all those things
have something to do with Shen Yufei

135
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,550
and the Frontiers of Science,
and Shen Yufei came to you.

136
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,440
If you don't go undercover,

137
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,630
do you think
they'll come to me someday?

138
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:13,390
I used to think the Frontiers of Science
was just an academic organization,

139
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,080
but I see it differently now.

140
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,550
What do you mean by "differently"?

141
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,720
I don't know how to explain it,

142
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,550
but I know very well
that they're desperate

143
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,670
to have me accept a hard truth.

144
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:30,750
And it's that no matter whether
we're eating, chatting,

145
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,910
or improving civilization,
developing science and technology,

146
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,790
or deepening our understanding
of this society,

147
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,510
it doesn't change the fact that we're

148
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,720
just a flock of turkeys
on a shabby farm.

149
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,910
Even so, you're an undercover
science-savvy turkey.

150
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,150
I'm not like you.

151
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,750
I'm a bodyguard turkey.

152
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,630
Don't worry.

153
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,390
I'll always be there for you.

154
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:56,390
You'll never understand
what I've been through,

155
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,670
or what I'm going through.

156
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,000
Here.

157
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,630
Look here.

158
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,910
Don't be afraid.

159
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,670
I had a friend make this for me.

160
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,510
I told him
I wanted a super-long countdown timer.

161
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:23,510
He's an expert bomb maker
who blows up things.

162
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,070
This is the best he can do.

163
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,600
I...

164
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,070
I don't know
what your countdown is about.

165
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,480
Anyway, here's the point.

166
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:41,960
Wang Miao, if your time is up,
mine will be up as well.

167
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,840
Do you understand?

168
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,600
Come on.

169
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,270
Let's set the watch.

170
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,830
You became cross-eyed.

171
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:24,550
Are the numbers of the countdown
very close to each other?

172
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,720
Not that close.

173
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,670
Tell me. What is it?

174
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,960
One, zero, one, eight, four, five, two.

175
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,120
One.

176
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,510
Zero.

177
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,200
One, eight.

178
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,120
Four.

179
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,750
Five.

180
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,150
Two.

181
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,840
Alright.

182
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,000
Tell me when it's double four.

183
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,510
I'll press the button at the same time.

184
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,000
Countdown starts.

185
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,070
Five.

186
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:51,960
Four.

187
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
Three.

188
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
Two.

189
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,670
One.

190
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,120
Are they the same?

191
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,670
Yeah.

192
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,360
Okay.

193
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,510
Done.

194
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,480
Look.

195
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,670
It seems insubstantial.

196
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,440
The experiment has been restarted.

197
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,720
When can you finish the Flying Knife?

198
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,510
It's Flying Blade.

199
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,150
Are there any differences?

200
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,080
Currently, nano Flying Blades

201
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,620
are made with molecular construction techniques,
but it's very resource-intensive.

202
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,960
Right now what we're trying to do
is develop a catalytic reaction

203
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,960
as a substitute
for molecular construction.

204
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,670
Can you translate those words for me?

205
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,480
I mean, use a language I can understand.

206
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,270
The experiment hasn't succeeded yet.

207
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,790
We still need to work on it.

208
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,480
Can you get the job done
before it ends?

209
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,200
I mean, the countdown.

210
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
I don't know.

211
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,240
You said the countdown halted
when you stopped the experiment.

212
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,200
Is it possible that
this is a countdown to your success?

213
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,390
I mean, can it be that

214
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,230
you'll succeed
at the end of the countdown?

215
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,030
Your way of speaking is very unreasonable,

216
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,240
but there have been
too many unreasonable things lately.

217
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,120
Just tell me if seeing it this way
cheers you up.

218
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,270
Munphy also talked to Shen Yufei
before his death.

219
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,120
If you're right,

220
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,150
all those who had dealings
with Shen Yufei

221
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,150
have either joined the
Frontiers of Science or committed suicide.

222
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,030
Not all of them.

223
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,910
You're still alive, aren't you?

224
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,150
That's why you need to join it.

225
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,510
Apart from me,
are there any other survivors?

226
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,390
Yes.

227
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,480
Yang Dong's mother.

228
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,600
During the investigation,
I originally thought

229
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,230
that Shen Yufei got close to Ye Wenjie
for Yang Dong,

230
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:03,440
but it didn't seem to be the case,
because Ye Wenjie is a scientist herself.

231
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,190
She's alive, and so are you.

232
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:12,000
You two survivors
don't seem to follow any patterns.

233
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,750
Do you think it's possible
Ye Wenjie can see the countdown as well?

234
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,210
Probably not.

235
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,870
The other day, when I went to observe
cosmic background radiation,

236
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,120
it was she
who contacted her student for me.

237
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,320
If she could also see the countdown,
she should know what I was there for.

238
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,720
You've looked into Ye Wenjie, right?

239
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,510
Yeah.

240
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,580
Nothing out of the ordinary,
except she didn't commit suicide.

241
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,240
This place
used to be the warehouse of a museum.

242
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,720
It's very roomy.

243
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,390
Now it's your office.

244
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,120
A warehouse?

245
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,030
It's pretty nice.

246
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,960
Being big enough is the whole point.

247
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,270
There are a dozen people, after all.
They need enough space.

248
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,440
You've already started working?

249
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,080
General.

250
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,390
Let me introduce you.

251
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,650
The introduction can wait.

252
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,200
You should wait until everybody's here.

253
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,960
It'll save you the trouble
of introducing me repeatedly.

254
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,390
Everyone's here.

255
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,440
Xu Bingbing.

256
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,000
Transferred here from CID.

257
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,960
She's worth ten agents.

258
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,350
What do you mean by "Everyone's here"?

259
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,670
How do you know she's worth ten agents?

260
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,600
Why should I believe you?

261
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,980
Chang, how can you do this?

262
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,080
You're such a high-ranking general.

263
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,320
How could you go back on your word?

264
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,870
Do I need to have you write it down
every time you make me a promise?

265
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,740
Are you done?

266
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,440
You don't want her?

267
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,360
I'll take her away then.

268
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,840
Go, go, go.

269
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,240
Wait.

270
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,310
You can't leave.

271
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:10,030
I'm not letting her leave unless you get me
the 10 people as promised.

272
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,320
I need a hostage.

273
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,910
Alright.

274
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,430
Stop it.

275
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:39,960
I asked Chang for information specialists,
not cleaners.

276
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,660
(Ye Wenjie)

277
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,750
(Mu Xing)

278
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,150
Ye Wenjie, an astrophysicist.

279
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:59,830
Mu Xing, a reporter
and freelance media worker.

280
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,600
That's all?

281
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,910
I'm giving you four hours

282
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,200
to gather everything you can
on these two people.

283
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,880
Alright.

284
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,750
This job requires two people at the most.

285
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,270
This is a list of the names of
all the scientists we need to look into.

286
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,960
I want all the detailed information
about them and their family members!

287
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,270
It must be done today!

288
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,070
Alright.

289
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,510
And clean this room.

290
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,880
I want it spotless.

291
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,000
Don't say alright.

292
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,960
Say yes.

293
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,590
Understood.

294
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,160
Yes.

295
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:36,440
(Reporters have learned
from the meeting held on the 13th)

296
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,270
(about the assignment of tasks
of 2007 Lucky Beijing volunteers)

297
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:43,440
(and the Beijing Olympics
urban volunteers that…)

298
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,880
Dad, do you feel better?

299
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,680
Doudou put the eye drops in Dad's eyes,
and Dad's eyes feel much better now.

300
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,190
You two, the rice is done,
and the fish will be ready in two minutes.

301
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,350
- Doudou, go wash your hands and eat.
- Get ready to eat.

302
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,550
Hurry.

303
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:00,790
Wash your hands clean, Doudou.

304
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,480
Li Yao,
you and Doudou may eat without me.

305
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,480
I have an errand to run.

306
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,640
What errand do you
have to run at mealtime?

307
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,270
You're going out, Dad?

308
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,160
Yeah.

309
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,680
Dr. Doudou has cured Dad's eye disease,
so now Dad has to go to work.

310
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,640
I think Dad hasn't fully recovered yet.

311
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,160
The treatment has to continue.

312
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,480
You still don't get it?

313
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,880
Your daughter
wants you to stay at home a bit longer.

314
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,720
Right, Doudou?

315
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,510
Dad will stay at home
and keep Doudou company

316
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,790
for many days after finishing this job.

317
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,640
Be good.

318
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,510
Sit there and eat.

319
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:37,240
Alright. Come and eat. Come on.

320
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,960
Li Yao, the fish is almost done.

321
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,000
You may turn off the heat now.

322
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,400
It can't be done so soon.

323
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:03,400
You're so accurate.
Are you a stopwatch or something?

324
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,790
You're just too tense, and too punctual.

325
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,590
It's bad for your health.

326
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,550
I have an appointment
with an old expert today.

327
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,000
I can't be late.

328
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,750
Doudou, bye-bye.

329
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,310
Goodbye, Dad.

330
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,960
I've got to go.

331
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,480
Alright.

332
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,300
Wang, thanks.

333
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,830
You went to so much trouble.

334
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,270
You're welcome, Ms. Ye.

335
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,750
Alright, thanks.

336
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,920
Let me help you with this.

337
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:18,550
By the way, Ms. Ye, a few days ago,
I met a scientist.

338
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,350
Her name's Shen Yufei.

339
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,750
Have you ever heard of her?

340
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,920
It rings a bell.

341
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,990
Maybe I saw her at some kind of event.

342
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,750
If my memory serves me well,

343
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,910
she specializes in nanotechnology
as you do.

344
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,200
Yeah.

345
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,750
By the way, the other day,
when you went to the observatory,

346
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,400
Sha Ruishan gave me a call.

347
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,440
He said you guys
spotted some rather unscientific stuff.

348
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,680
Yeah.

349
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,270
This is exactly what I want
to consult you about.

350
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,260
You specialize in astrophysics.

351
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,240
In your experience,

352
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,960
do you think it's possible
for the universe to flicker?

353
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,270
According to what we know,
that's impossible.

354
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:14,160
What about what we don't know?

355
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,400
When science
goes beyond our comprehension,

356
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,200
it usually gets mistaken for heresy.

357
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,030
That's why it throws people into panic.

358
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:40,200
In human history,
science caused panic many times.

359
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:44,920
During the Renaissance in Europe,
Copernicus got persecuted and repressed

360
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,310
by the Church
for his heliocentric theory.

361
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:51,680
When The Revolutions
of the Heavenly Bodies was published,

362
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:57,550
he only stroked its cover
before passing away.

363
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,590
Bruno, who supported
the heliocentric theory,

364
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,830
was burned at the stake by the Church.

365
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:09,680
Cecco d'Ascoli, an astronomer,
believed that the earth was round,

366
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,030
and he got burned alive as well.

367
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:19,790
The theories that we see
as common sense today

368
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:24,790
served only to cause great panic
among the public in that era.

369
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:28,150
Just like the many problems
we're faced with today.

370
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,880
In the future,
when we look back on them,

371
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,550
we'll find them as unsurprising
as the fact that the earth is round.

372
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,310
Mu Xing returned from overseas
only half a year ago.

373
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,710
She's in the new media industry.

374
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,030
Her reports are mainly

375
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,830
about science and technology
and environmental protection.

376
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,640
She's very aggressive
in getting exposure on newspapers.

377
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,350
She once exaggerated the facts
to create hot topics.

378
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,480
(Portfolio)
But some of her reports

379
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,440
did bring attention to the issues
and fix some of the problems.

380
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,310
Nothing else?

381
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,830
All information on Ye Wenjie is here,

382
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,680
(Ye Wenjie)
including some deciphered files

383
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,070
and some info about her father.

384
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,200
They're all in here.

385
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
These are infosheets
about all the scientists on the list

386
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,670
and the family members of some of
the scientists who committed suicide.

387
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:36,350
I don't think these infosheets
have any special value,

388
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,680
but I looked into everything
you asked me to look into.

389
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,880
Alright.

390
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,200
If this task was assigned to ten people,

391
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,900
it would definitely have been
a waste of manpower.

392
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,270
In the observatory,
there's a guy named Sha Ruishan, he…

393
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,070
I know.

394
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,520
He's Ye Wenjie's student.

395
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,110
He went to observe cosmic flicker
with Wang Miao a few days ago.

396
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,270
I'll do some digging.

397
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,270
Here's my cell number.

398
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,830
My phone's on twenty-four seven.

399
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,310
If anything happens,
you may call me anytime.

400
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,880
Yes.

401
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,590
Alright.

402
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,200
Who are you looking for?

403
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,640
So you're Sha Ruishan?

404
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,790
How do you know?

405
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,270
The other day, Professor Wang Miao
paid you a visit.

406
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:38,480
I need to verify a few things with you.

407
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,690
Who are you?

408
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:44,540
(Xu Bingbing,
CID of Beijing Public Security Bureau)

409
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,790
I want some information
about cosmic flicker.

410
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:53,310
Are you saying
even if Ye Wenjie knows she's a turkey,

411
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:56,400
she'll feel it's unsurprising?

412
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:02,790
We only talked for a short while,
but it made me feel much calmer.

413
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,640
No matter whether those theories

414
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,790
of the Frontiers of Science
are right or wrong,

415
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:09,750
I find them acceptable now.

416
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:13,240
Maybe we just don't know
who we are exactly.

417
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,790
Just like Schrodinger's cat.

418
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,640
I know about cats.

419
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,400
Lately I've boned up on physics.

420
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,790
It's about putting a cat
into a box, isn't it?

421
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,550
And when you open it,
it's either dead or alive.

422
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,440
But isn't that frivolous?

423
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,000
It's just an experiment
with a lot of constants and variables.

424
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,070
In other words,

425
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,680
it's a process of finding proof
and seeking confirmation.

426
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,680
Is that necessary?

427
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,790
What if the third possibility happens?

428
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,160
That'll be like seeing a ghost.

429
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,720
It'll mean physics no longer exists.

430
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,680
Does Ye Wenjie believe it?

431
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,240
She believes
our physics might have ceased to exist.

432
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,550
Physics didn't cease to exist.

433
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:11,790
It's just the physics we know
might be non-existent.

434
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,190
Many years from now,
history will reveal the answer.

435
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:29,200
We might be Copernicus, or Bruno,
or the Church.

436
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,000
Or maybe we're nothing.

437
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,440
Come. I'll show you something.

438
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,030
Come on.

439
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,270
All data are unproblematic,
but this is impossible.

440
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:12,640
Even the explosion of a supernova
couldn't have done that.

441
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,110
What if someone made that happen?

442
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,720
That's even more impossible.

443
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,260
It's such a large scale.

444
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:22,440
It was spotted from the observatories
in both Beijing and Urumqi.

445
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,790
Do you know what that means?

446
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,440
You see this?

447
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,830
Do you get it now?

448
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:47,020
I'm imposing human interference
on your observation of this lamp.

449
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:52,160
This is both theoretically possible
and doable,

450
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,200
but what's a cosmic flicker?

451
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,070
The observation signals received

452
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:01,160
by Beijing and Urumqi observatories
are from three observation satellites.

453
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,920
Do you know what that means?

454
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,030
What does it mean?

455
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,110
Let's say this is our earth.

456
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,070
These three are observation satellites.

457
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:11,900
To make the whole universe flicker
with human interference,

458
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,830
theoretically, you need to build
a gigantic screen at least

459
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,790
300,000 kilometers wide in a place

460
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:22,480
150,000 kilometers away
from the earth.

461
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,880
Is there science behind your theory?

462
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,880
Science?

463
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,480
You want to talk about science with me?

464
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,720
Considering this scale,

465
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,960
not only Batman and Iron Man
can't make it happen,

466
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,510
but even Superman can't do it.

467
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:41,550
In other words,
it's impossible even in sci-fi.

468
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,680
Then what can make it happen?

469
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,510
Mythology.

470
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:54,920
Zeus should be able to swing it.

471
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:59,240
It was really not my doing.

472
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,570
I'm a cop.

473
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,200
I had dealings with a lot of criminals.

474
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,270
Criminals experienced things
others didn't experience,

475
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:10,480
so sometimes their mindset
is different as well.

476
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,720
Did Professor Ye
experience anything unusual?

477
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,440
That's hard to say.

478
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,510
She lived in that era.

479
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:20,110
She might've been affected.

480
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,350
By the way, the constant and variable thing
you talked about a moment ago.

481
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,070
The guy surnamed Schro.

482
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,960
Did he have to pick a cat?

483
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,680
Could it not be a rabbit,
or a squirrel or anything like that?

484
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,270
What is this place?

485
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,790
Our office.

486
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,750
Roomy, huh?

487
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,510
Come on. Come on.

488
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:44,070
Take a look.

489
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,270
Spotlessly clean.

490
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,790
I brought you here
to let you take a closer look

491
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,030
and do some research
into Ye Wenjie's file.

492
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:51,680
Alright.

493
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,830
Where's Professor Ye's file?

494
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,640
Over there.

495
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,680
Under the picture
of Houyi Shooting Down The Suns.

496
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,640
Below the first sun.

497
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,640
Everything here is orderly.

498
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,160
You found it, right?

499
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,830
Yeah.

500
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,200
I'll fill you in while you read those.

501
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,790
Ye Wenjie's father was a great scientist,
a counter-revolutionary one.

502
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:16,270
Now he's rehabilitated, of course.

503
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,910
Do you know who ratted on him?

504
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,480
His own daughter.

505
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,550
Professor Ye?

506
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,640
No.

507
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,270
Ye Wenjie's little sister.

508
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,400
Her name's Ye Wenxue.

509
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,750
And it gets better than that.

510
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:35,400
Do you know
who delivered the decisive blow to him?

511
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,820
His wife.

512
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,720
Shao Lin.

513
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,270
Uh, not Shaolin Monastery.

514
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,200
Her surname was Shao.
Her given name was Lin.

515
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,200
It's all in here.

516
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:52,240
I wonder
what Ye Wenjie felt at that time.

517
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,440
Ye Wenjie's little sister, Ye Wenxue,

518
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,510
personally had the leader
of the campaign

519
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,240
take her father away

520
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,510
(1967)
for interrogation about the ideology

521
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,920
embodied in his treatise.

522
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,880
In the key phase of the interrogation,

523
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,720
Ye Zhetai's wife, Shao Lin,
showed up as well,

524
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,400
Together with Ye Wenxue,

525
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,790
they distanced themselves
from Ye Zhetai,

526
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:15,680
which was a terrible blow to him.

527
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,510
Didn't Mother say

528
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:46,270
that Grandfather and Einstein
were close friends?

529
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:50,640
That they used to
discuss science together?

530
00:31:51,400 --> 00:32:00,000
But why are they
beginning to criticize Einstein?

531
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:08,680
Shao Lin's father
did cross paths with Einstein.

532
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:19,270
In 1922, on Nanjing Road of Shanghai.

533
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,350
They were walking along the road.

534
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:26,240
Einstein suddenly asked a young boy
smashing stones at the roadside

535
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,500
how much he earned in a day.

536
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,550
He said five cents.

537
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:39,440
That was the only time he conversed
with the master who changed the world.

538
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,640
No physics.

539
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,400
No theory of relativity.

540
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,270
Only the hard truth.

541
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,590
Lin is better than me.

542
00:32:54,590 --> 00:33:05,440
She proved all scientific achievements
were the fruits of the people's wisdom.

543
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:15,720
Those academic authorities
of the bourgeoisie just stole the fruits.

544
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:19,400
There are so many terms in physics.

545
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:24,440
Will changing the names be enough?

546
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:32,790
Any brilliant idea
will fall apart eventually.

547
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:40,720
The gravity of reality
is just too strong.

548
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,550
It never crossed my mind

549
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,750
that Professor Ye had been through
something like that.

550
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,030
Now I can understand

551
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:13,000
why she took Yang Dong's death
so calmly.

552
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,550
But I find it confusing.

553
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,430
By rights, those who have
lost a loved one

554
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:24,500
will definitely
cherish familial bonding even more,

555
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,400
but Professor Ye
doesn't seem to be like that.

556
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,000
It strikes me
that the reason her grief was dissolved

557
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
is probably not so simple.

558
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,280
Professor Ye's father

559
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,440
was unable to continue his research
because of the era.

560
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,030
Professor Ye's daughter,
since physics had ceased to exist,

561
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,760
couldn't continue her research either.

562
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,800
Maybe in Professor Ye's eyes,
death was a relief to them.

563
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,550
We never experienced
anything like that,

564
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:51,840
so maybe we can't understand it.

565
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,480
No.

566
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,190
Professor Ye didn't have many dealings
with Shen Yufei,

567
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,510
but judging from what she said to you,

568
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:03,110
she's not against the theories
of the Frontiers of Science.

569
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:08,070
Professor Ye's behavior is becoming
an increasingly greater mystery to me.

570
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,800
What did she say to you again?

571
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,480
Did she say this was not

572
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,910
the first time the scientific community
had been in panic?

573
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,400
Yeah.

574
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:24,590
In human history,
science caused panic many times.

575
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:32,400
We might be Copernicus,
or Bruno, or the Church.

576
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,150
Or maybe we're nothing.

577
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,000
Was she asking you to become
someone like Copernicus?

578
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,800
Even if I wanted to do that,
aren't I still your plant?

579
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,670
Well, go ahead and become Copernicus.

580
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:53,230
With me protecting you,
I promise you won't get burned alive.

581
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,950
Get burned alive?

582
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:57,960
That guy's name's Bruno.

583
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,070
What about Co-Copernicus?

584
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,030
He died of natural causes.

585
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:04,000
Well, with me protecting you,
I promise you'll…

586
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,830
be Copernicus.

587
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,800
Thank you.

588
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,700

get to know Lord and join us.)
