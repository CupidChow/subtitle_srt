00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,631
(All characters, places, companies, )

2
00:00:01,631 --> 00:00:03,330
(and incidents in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:08,602 --> 00:00:10,142
You must've been surprised.

4
00:00:11,102 --> 00:00:12,271
What were you doing?

5
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:13,541
Checking.

6
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:16,381
I was checking to see if she really went blind...

7
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:17,881
or if she was just pretending.

8
00:00:30,221 --> 00:00:32,022
She is in pretty bad shape.

9
00:00:32,261 --> 00:00:33,532
If she doesn't get surgery soon,

10
00:00:33,532 --> 00:00:35,231
she might go blind.

11
00:00:39,801 --> 00:00:41,301
Just drop the suit...

12
00:00:41,532 --> 00:00:43,102
and let her get the surgery.

13
00:00:43,841 --> 00:00:46,212
That'll be more helpful to her.

14
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:54,452
Hey.

15
00:00:54,452 --> 00:00:55,452
(Episode 11)

16
00:00:55,452 --> 00:00:57,882
Try some. Their best dish is this onion.

17
00:00:58,322 --> 00:00:59,891
This is barely a dish.

18
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:05,261
Lawyer Lee, about that thing you mentioned to me before.

19
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:07,132
I looked into that.

20
00:01:07,362 --> 00:01:10,332
Tak Soo Ho was one of the better ones.

21
00:01:10,332 --> 00:01:13,671
That generation of kids from rich families tends to be...

22
00:01:13,671 --> 00:01:15,401
absolute punks.

23
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:18,041
Any unique or odd rumors?

24
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:21,242
He's the only successor of Jungjin,

25
00:01:21,242 --> 00:01:24,341
so Chairman Tak Jung Jin was so strict with him since childhood.

26
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:25,852
He didn't want to confuse him,

27
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:27,481
so he didn't even get remarried.

28
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:30,951
He put in all of his power into bringing up his successor.

29
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,621
Tak Soo Ho never even had...

30
00:01:33,621 --> 00:01:35,091
a scandal in his history.

31
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:37,162
He might be that meticulous.

32
00:01:37,162 --> 00:01:38,591
Jerks like him...

33
00:01:39,362 --> 00:01:40,362
Right.

34
00:01:40,992 --> 00:01:42,291
There was...

35
00:01:42,662 --> 00:01:44,962
one thing that happened a while ago.

36
00:01:45,332 --> 00:01:47,272
It was when he was in elementary school.

37
00:01:47,832 --> 00:01:50,242
Back then, they stopped the case from going out to the press,

38
00:01:50,242 --> 00:01:53,742
but it did slip out on the internet.

39
00:02:01,712 --> 00:02:03,452
(Chairman Tak Jung Jin's memorial service crowded with people)

40
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:05,351
(Vice-Chairman Tak Soo Ho appointed as the successor)

41
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:06,351
You should...

42
00:02:06,821 --> 00:02:09,992
lock him up in prison, Prosecutor Seo.

43
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:12,832
I'll talk to him.

44
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:15,262
Don't worry about it, Chairman Tak.

45
00:02:30,712 --> 00:02:33,311
Why did you do that to your driver?

46
00:02:33,682 --> 00:02:34,881
I was curious...

47
00:02:35,952 --> 00:02:38,781
if a person would die when I hit their head with a brick.

48
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:44,422
What were you going to do if he really dies?

49
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:49,802
Why didn't he die?

50
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:53,172
I hit him pretty hard.

51
00:03:11,582 --> 00:03:14,621
That driver ended up as brain dead...

52
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:16,292
or something.

53
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:17,962
But there are zero articles on the case...

54
00:03:17,962 --> 00:03:20,432
because it was a mistake that a minor made.

55
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:23,362
But the driver's daughter posted on the internet...

56
00:03:23,362 --> 00:03:25,462
that it wasn't a mistake and it caused a bit of an uproar.

57
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:31,571
He might misunderstand me.

58
00:03:34,012 --> 00:03:36,082
But there are a lot of weird people nowadays,

59
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,142
so I was just trying to check.

60
00:03:39,112 --> 00:03:41,052
Please talk to him for me.

61
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:43,821
Don't worry.

62
00:03:46,052 --> 00:03:47,422
I wasn't worried.

63
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:57,302
Since when did you work with Lawyer Lee Tae Kyung again?

64
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,571
It has been about 5 to 6 years.

65
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:04,371
Do you know him well?

66
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:06,772
Do you know a lot about him?

67
00:04:07,712 --> 00:04:09,211
He'll wrap up everything...

68
00:04:09,742 --> 00:04:11,682
so that you do not have to be concerned.

69
00:04:13,782 --> 00:04:16,152
Let's have lunch with him tomorrow.

70
00:04:17,121 --> 00:04:18,521
We can undo the misunderstanding too.

71
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:35,331
Lunch?

72
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:38,342
Why does he keep wanting to see me?

73
00:04:38,342 --> 00:04:39,742
I hate that guy.

74
00:04:41,342 --> 00:04:42,711
Fine.

75
00:04:48,282 --> 00:04:50,482
Lawyer Lee, I'll get going first.

76
00:04:50,751 --> 00:04:51,751
Mr. Nam.

77
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:55,652
Do you think Jungjin used methanol...

78
00:04:55,652 --> 00:04:57,092
knowing that it's dangerous...

79
00:04:57,092 --> 00:04:58,561
just because it's 70 cents cheaper?

80
00:04:59,092 --> 00:05:00,831
I think there is another reason.

81
00:05:01,232 --> 00:05:02,362
Please look into that.

82
00:05:02,362 --> 00:05:03,761
I'll look into that tomorrow...

83
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,001
Right now.

84
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:13,641
She was suddenly told to leave?

85
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:16,782
Yes, if she isn't going to get surgery now,

86
00:05:16,782 --> 00:05:18,581
there's nothing they can do.

87
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:21,612
They told her to go home tomorrow.

88
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:26,891
And she has to get the surgery soon, right?

89
00:05:27,792 --> 00:05:29,362
They said it's probably for the best.

90
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:32,732
It's okay.

91
00:05:33,261 --> 00:05:35,532
I'm sure I'll be fine even if I get the surgery after the trial.

92
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:39,571
Lawyer Lee. We can win this, right?

93
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:53,881
I was worried you'd get the wrong idea.

94
00:05:54,682 --> 00:05:57,451
Well... There are all kinds of people in this world.

95
00:06:00,422 --> 00:06:03,422
In my position, I get to meet such people quite often.

96
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:06,292
But there are times when I think enough is enough.

97
00:06:08,261 --> 00:06:10,902
When you have nothing, you become desperate.

98
00:06:11,432 --> 00:06:14,032
And when you become desperate, you become low.

99
00:06:15,131 --> 00:06:16,302
Still,

100
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:19,412
did you really think she was pretending to be blind?

101
00:06:24,581 --> 00:06:27,811
You're right. I was being too sensitive.

102
00:06:31,081 --> 00:06:32,251
So...

103
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:36,362
Do you think they'll settle?

104
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:43,032
I've been meeting the victims.

105
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:45,831
Their desire to know is predominant.

106
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:48,732
They want to know why it happened.

107
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:53,941
Knowing that wouldn't make a difference.

108
00:06:58,282 --> 00:06:59,652
Don't worry.

109
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:03,352
If I give them more money than they could ever imagine,

110
00:07:03,352 --> 00:07:04,922
they'll settle right away.

111
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:10,261
You see, people are more vulnerable to money than the truth.

112
00:07:11,362 --> 00:07:13,592
I doubt they will have the courage to choose finding out the truth...

113
00:07:13,862 --> 00:07:15,261
over receiving money.

114
00:07:17,602 --> 00:07:19,371
They must've experienced firsthand...

115
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:22,842
the desperateness of not having any money.

116
00:07:35,682 --> 00:07:36,881
Aren't I right, Chairman Song?

117
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:47,631
But once they let go, they become fearless.

118
00:07:48,932 --> 00:07:50,432
Once you overcome...

119
00:07:50,932 --> 00:07:52,261
that desperateness,

120
00:07:52,561 --> 00:07:54,802
your capacity becomes much greater.

121
00:07:55,871 --> 00:07:58,402
It'll be so great that money won't move you.

122
00:08:04,081 --> 00:08:05,242
Aren't I right?

123
00:08:36,311 --> 00:08:37,981
He's such a scumbag.

124
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:40,252
Why did you provoke him?

125
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,552
We're business partners anyway.

126
00:08:42,682 --> 00:08:44,851
Does he know a weakness of yours or something?

127
00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:47,522
Or are you just intimidated by their company?

128
00:08:48,721 --> 00:08:49,961
What do you mean?

129
00:08:50,221 --> 00:08:52,191
This is unlike you.

130
00:08:53,591 --> 00:08:55,932
Would you like me to destroy him?

131
00:08:59,262 --> 00:09:01,172
You should persuade them to settle.

132
00:09:02,002 --> 00:09:04,142
Don't they need to receive surgery as soon as possible?

133
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:07,372
Fine.

134
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:13,811
Yes, Mr. Nam. Okay.

135
00:09:15,782 --> 00:09:17,221
I'm on my way.

136
00:09:24,491 --> 00:09:27,632
I've been running around since early morning.

137
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:29,032
Yes.

138
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:34,132
Jungjin did that in order to launch their smartphones on the set date.

139
00:09:34,132 --> 00:09:37,172
During that time, they had to replace ethanol with...

140
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:41,772
Yes. So they used methanol.

141
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:46,311
Sir, I'll call you back. Goodbye.

142
00:09:53,522 --> 00:09:56,821
Hello. Are you here to consult regarding a case?

143
00:09:58,662 --> 00:09:59,731
I see.

144
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:03,262
I'm sorry, but we're picky about our cases.

145
00:10:03,262 --> 00:10:05,132
We charge quite a bit.

146
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:07,932
I just came earlier to take a look around.

147
00:10:07,932 --> 00:10:09,872
I'll start working here next week.

148
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:13,441
You'll... You'll be working here?

149
00:10:13,611 --> 00:10:15,111
Did Lawyer Lee pick you?

150
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,752
Are you the new office manager?

151
00:10:22,382 --> 00:10:23,922
He's such a dirtbag.

152
00:10:24,752 --> 00:10:26,392
I'm a lawyer.

153
00:10:28,122 --> 00:10:30,461
A... A lawyer?

154
00:10:32,622 --> 00:10:34,662
You're a lawyer.

155
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:38,932
That's odd. Why did he hire a lawyer?

156
00:10:41,331 --> 00:10:42,701
He didn't really hire me.

157
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:46,272
I used my connections.

158
00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:50,811
I see. Hello... I mean...

159
00:10:50,811 --> 00:10:52,542
You have connections.

160
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,382
Who is your father? Or perhaps, your mother?

161
00:10:59,382 --> 00:11:02,422
I'm Song Dae Jin. I look forward to working with you.

162
00:11:04,491 --> 00:11:06,532
I'm Chairman Song Woo Yong's son.

163
00:11:09,731 --> 00:11:11,262
Oh, Chairman Song?

164
00:11:12,971 --> 00:11:13,971
I heard you guys are in charge...

165
00:11:13,971 --> 00:11:15,872
- of Jungjin's methanol case. - Yes, sir.

166
00:11:15,932 --> 00:11:18,542
Lawyer Lee told me last time.

167
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:19,542
I see, sir.

168
00:11:19,611 --> 00:11:23,111
I should prepare in advance if I'm to join next week.

169
00:11:23,741 --> 00:11:26,081
Do you have any files I could read?

170
00:11:26,081 --> 00:11:28,882
Sorry? Files? Well...

171
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:33,252
By the way, about calling him a dirtbag...

172
00:11:34,052 --> 00:11:36,491
I didn't really mean it.

173
00:11:36,491 --> 00:11:37,991
I see.

174
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,932
But you sounded quite sincere.

175
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:06,052
He offered me the deal for Contra Building in Cheongdam-dong.

176
00:12:06,522 --> 00:12:09,022
If we wrap up this case nicely,

177
00:12:09,252 --> 00:12:13,662
we can build a 150-story building in the heart of Gangnam.

178
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:17,331
It's what we've always been doing. It's business.

(Management of Actors and Actresses)

181
00:12:59,672 --> 00:13:01,142
What are you doing?

182
00:13:01,512 --> 00:13:03,182
What? What do you mean?

183
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:05,311
What are you doing with my laptop?

184
00:13:05,311 --> 00:13:07,052
Mine is broken, so...

185
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:15,691
What are you doing?

186
00:13:15,691 --> 00:13:17,691
Now, my laptop is also broken.

187
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,302
What a lunatic.

188
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:29,201
Are you serious?

189
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:31,542
I think you should be more careful.

190
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:33,741
Think about that accident.

191
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:38,941
What about the license plate number in the dashcam footage?

192
00:13:38,941 --> 00:13:40,282
It was a borrowed vehicle.

193
00:13:40,981 --> 00:13:43,252
Still, we're looking into it.

194
00:13:44,721 --> 00:13:47,522
By the way, I found something odd.

195
00:13:48,022 --> 00:13:50,061
Jang Entertainment has never made a rookie...

196
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:51,922
into a huge star.

197
00:13:52,392 --> 00:13:56,061
They always brought in famous actresses.

198
00:13:59,061 --> 00:14:01,872
But the ones who were murdered were all rookies.

199
00:14:05,101 --> 00:14:06,471
I don't want to go.

200
00:14:09,672 --> 00:14:10,882
Give me her contract.

201
00:14:13,611 --> 00:14:14,752
All right.

202
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:18,851
"The employee must obey their employer's orders."

203
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:21,451
"If they disobey the employer's orders..."

204
00:14:21,451 --> 00:14:23,522
"or do not fulfill them completely,"

205
00:14:23,522 --> 00:14:24,662
"the former must pay a 100,000-dollar fine..."

206
00:14:24,662 --> 00:14:27,132
"and any further compensations if need be."

207
00:14:28,132 --> 00:14:29,162
Look.

208
00:14:30,762 --> 00:14:33,172
You signed it, right?

209
00:14:34,632 --> 00:14:36,941
If you want, just pay the fine, and let's call it quits.

210
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:39,741
Hold on. There's more than that.

211
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:41,441
I've been paying for your hair salon appointments,

212
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:45,981
costumes, foods, and much more.

213
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:47,552
What will you do?

214
00:14:57,961 --> 00:14:59,591
Just do as I say.

215
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:17,142
(Namwon Restaurant)

216
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:05,122
Chairman Song was involved in the Ahyeon-dong Murder Case...

217
00:16:05,122 --> 00:16:06,591
from seven years ago, wasn't he?

218
00:16:07,361 --> 00:16:09,032
How about this murder case?

219
00:16:15,532 --> 00:16:16,542
Yes?

220
00:16:19,802 --> 00:16:20,872
I'm sorry.

221
00:16:21,571 --> 00:16:22,841
I'm so sorry.

222
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:21,132
(President Jang Chi Soo)

223
00:17:30,112 --> 00:17:31,112
Lawyer?

224
00:17:31,112 --> 00:17:33,582
Yes, the lawyer from the company dropped by...

225
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:35,112
when she was getting discharged.

226
00:17:35,852 --> 00:17:37,122
Was the lawyer from Inchang?

227
00:17:37,922 --> 00:17:40,322
The company will pay for all of the medical bills...

228
00:17:42,622 --> 00:17:44,322
with 500,000 dollars as the settlement money.

229
00:17:45,162 --> 00:17:46,592
We don't have to work so hard with that...

230
00:17:46,592 --> 00:17:48,632
We turned down the offer.

231
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:52,132
If we take it, the cause of her vision loss...

232
00:17:52,332 --> 00:17:54,271
will be buried forever then.

233
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:57,241
I will do whatever it takes...

234
00:17:57,441 --> 00:18:00,041
to get that surgery for Seon Hee with my own money.

235
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:01,842
I will find out the whole truth...

236
00:18:02,572 --> 00:18:04,481
why my sister is going blind.

237
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:32,572
Gosh, you live in this neighborhood?

238
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,112
Do you want a drink?

239
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:39,342
Don't worry. I'm not here to see you.

240
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,051
I'll pay you. Drink with me.

241
00:18:42,812 --> 00:18:44,521
You said you'd do everything for money.

242
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:50,092
That delivery man.

243
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:52,961
He was my brother.

244
00:18:54,761 --> 00:18:56,632
The guy you met seven years ago.

245
00:18:59,902 --> 00:19:01,432
He wanted to support me so I could pass my bar exam.

246
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:02,432
He took time off from school...

247
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,342
and delivered packages for 10 hours a day.

248
00:19:05,642 --> 00:19:06,711
What does...

249
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:08,771
that have to do with me?

250
00:19:09,342 --> 00:19:10,612
But he died...

251
00:19:11,582 --> 00:19:13,981
because he delivered that USB or something to you.

252
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:16,951
Yang Chul Ki told me...

253
00:19:18,251 --> 00:19:20,721
my brother died because of that USB.

254
00:19:22,251 --> 00:19:23,291
I don't know about that.

255
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,721
I don't care if you know or not...

256
00:19:26,622 --> 00:19:29,191
because I decided to bury that for the rest of my life.

257
00:19:36,771 --> 00:19:37,771
Why...

258
00:19:39,842 --> 00:19:41,572
Why did you decide to bury it for the rest of your life?

259
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,682
He was your brother.

260
00:19:48,852 --> 00:19:50,882
If I give up the most precious thing to me,

261
00:19:53,322 --> 00:19:55,152
I can have a lot of things.

262
00:19:56,491 --> 00:19:58,862
But I don't have the guts to give up on my greed.

263
00:20:02,392 --> 00:20:04,062
So you should never live like me...

264
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,142
because this is the worst feeling in the world.

265
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:35,531
Hello?

266
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:40,271
Prosecutors’ Office?

267
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:04,822
Hey, I heard you're doing pretty well for yourself nowadays.

268
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:08,062
What do you think, you jerk?

269
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,801
Why don't we, the lawyers, come to a settlement first?

270
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,971
Gosh, I can't believe this.

271
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:19,541
You're with the best law firm in Korea...

272
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,011
and fully staffed with...

273
00:21:21,011 --> 00:21:23,041
Chief Justice, Minister of Justice, the Public Prosecutor General,

274
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,882
and top students from law school.

275
00:21:25,342 --> 00:21:26,711
There's no way I can beat you guys.

276
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:28,382
It's already been settled, right?

277
00:21:28,981 --> 00:21:30,352
How much do you want?

278
00:21:30,951 --> 00:21:33,051
I told them 500,000 dollars for now.

279
00:21:34,652 --> 00:21:35,721
What do they think?

280
00:21:37,191 --> 00:21:39,562
I thought you were going to give them 200.

281
00:21:41,562 --> 00:21:43,662
Seriously. I knew you were a scumbag.

282
00:21:43,662 --> 00:21:45,562
Only that much? Come on. Have a conscience.

283
00:21:45,562 --> 00:21:46,832
I meant 200 million dollars.

284
00:21:47,902 --> 00:21:49,672
It's much cheaper than setting up dozens of new factories...

285
00:21:49,672 --> 00:21:51,241
because of the industrial accidents.

286
00:21:51,241 --> 00:21:52,402
What?

287
00:21:52,971 --> 00:21:55,142
- Stop joking around... - I don't think we can settle...

288
00:21:55,142 --> 00:21:56,642
if you don't agree to our number.

289
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:00,481
What are you doing?

290
00:22:00,481 --> 00:22:02,812
I'm trying to negotiate with my opposing counsel.

291
00:22:05,781 --> 00:22:07,422
Did you discuss this with Jungjin Group?

292
00:22:07,422 --> 00:22:09,751
Why would I talk to Jungjin Group about this?

293
00:22:09,751 --> 00:22:11,521
I represent the victims.

294
00:22:11,521 --> 00:22:13,632
What on earth is going on?

295
00:22:14,632 --> 00:22:16,231
Didn't Jungjin Group pay you?

296
00:22:19,301 --> 00:22:20,672
Since we studied together at the institute,

297
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,271
I'll give you a piece of advice from the bottom of my heart.

298
00:22:24,402 --> 00:22:26,971
If you become a slave of money at that young age,

299
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,211
it will ruin your family.

300
00:22:29,142 --> 00:22:30,142
Look at me.

301
00:22:30,711 --> 00:22:32,041
I'm such a scumbag.

302
00:22:33,342 --> 00:22:35,182
Make sure you prepare for the trial.

303
00:23:01,941 --> 00:23:03,612
This is getting interesting, Lee Tae Kyung.

304
00:23:22,092 --> 00:23:24,301
Didn't you get demoted about four years ago?

305
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:26,731
You were transferred to Suncheon where the air was clean.

306
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,201
Are you here to mock me about what happened four years ago?

307
00:23:29,332 --> 00:23:30,741
And when it was you who sent me there?

308
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:33,241
You should've known better. Why were you so stubborn?

309
00:23:33,402 --> 00:23:34,812
It was just a powerless medium-sized company.

310
00:23:34,812 --> 00:23:36,642
That powerless medium-sized company...

311
00:23:36,642 --> 00:23:39,011
started to grow at an abnormal pace.

312
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,511
I gave it my best shot because it was odd.

313
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:42,551
But in the end, you couldn't uncover the truth.

314
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:44,451
It's not that I couldn't.

315
00:23:44,451 --> 00:23:46,422
I was forced to stop by outside pressure.

316
00:23:48,251 --> 00:23:50,221
Jungjin Group did impose a lot of pressure.

317
00:23:52,261 --> 00:23:54,062
- Jungjin Group? - I heard Jungjin Group...

318
00:23:54,062 --> 00:23:56,662
has been backing up Bumjung's capital since seven years ago.

319
00:23:57,531 --> 00:23:59,501
I got demoted when I was investigating that.

320
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,971
You didn't know.

321
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:28,491
Is this your first time dealing with Tak Soo Ho then?

322
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:29,832
It's my first time.

323
00:24:30,562 --> 00:24:32,501
We met at several business meetings here and there.

324
00:24:32,501 --> 00:24:34,872
We just knew each other's name. That's about it.

325
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:47,812
I'm sure he had his reasons.

326
00:24:48,412 --> 00:24:49,951
Let me look into it.

327
00:24:49,951 --> 00:24:52,182
I doubt that Lee Tae Kyung will bend his will that easily.

328
00:24:52,182 --> 00:24:54,352
No, I will make sure...

329
00:24:54,352 --> 00:24:56,652
Make sure that there are no problems.

330
00:24:57,862 --> 00:24:59,761
That's why I warned you...

331
00:25:00,092 --> 00:25:02,491
that you ought to take better control of him.

332
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:05,562
I'll fix it.

333
00:25:07,701 --> 00:25:09,531
How will you fix it?

334
00:25:10,572 --> 00:25:11,842
To be honest,

335
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:17,142
this isn't just about that 150-story building.

336
00:26:06,322 --> 00:26:07,432
What happened?

337
00:26:08,491 --> 00:26:10,731
Didn't you hear about it already? It's just as you heard.

338
00:26:10,801 --> 00:26:12,902
You can't suddenly do this by yourself.

339
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:17,102
Woo Yong, let's fight them properly with this case.

340
00:26:17,402 --> 00:26:18,842
I really feel like I can win.

341
00:26:19,872 --> 00:26:21,011
Tae Kyung, this is...

342
00:26:21,011 --> 00:26:22,211
You said this is business.

343
00:26:22,672 --> 00:26:25,082
You just have to make money no matter what you do, right?

344
00:26:25,142 --> 00:26:29,112
I'll help you build up a building 200 stories tall, not just 150.

345
00:26:29,652 --> 00:26:31,481
Jungjin requested us to take this case.

346
00:26:31,481 --> 00:26:33,251
So why did you take the case?

347
00:26:33,481 --> 00:26:36,852
You want a 150-story building after destroying Contra Building.

348
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:38,622
And Jungjin said they'll do it for you.

349
00:26:38,622 --> 00:26:40,761
I'll make sure you can do that.

350
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:42,662
I'll make sure you make even more than that.

351
00:26:42,662 --> 00:26:45,332
It's not just because of the financial relationship.

352
00:26:45,602 --> 00:26:48,201
If we become enemies of Jungjin, things will get tough for us.

353
00:26:54,142 --> 00:26:56,771
I have evidence that Jungjin used methanol...

354
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:58,981
knowing it can damage the eyes...

355
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:01,481
in order to meet the deadline for the launch of their smartphone.

356
00:27:03,051 --> 00:27:05,281
What do you think will happen when the world finds out?

357
00:27:06,352 --> 00:27:07,392
Woo Yong.

358
00:27:08,152 --> 00:27:10,092
This can be a global issue.

359
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:14,132
We can make an astronomical fortune by giving over their documents...

360
00:27:14,531 --> 00:27:16,862
which we found in our investigation to their competitors.

361
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,031
Do you think Jungjin will just sit around?

362
00:27:20,201 --> 00:27:22,501
We can't pass on this just because we're scared of them.

363
00:27:23,432 --> 00:27:25,842
I'm doing this to help you.

364
00:27:25,842 --> 00:27:28,271
Then there's no reason for you to bow to that jerk.

365
00:27:28,872 --> 00:27:32,711
And I thought this was your first deal with him.

366
00:27:39,322 --> 00:27:41,251
I have a plan too.

367
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:43,521
It's not only about the 150-story building.

368
00:27:43,521 --> 00:27:46,062
We can't do that for our future.

369
00:27:46,822 --> 00:27:48,231
Drop the suit immediately.

370
00:27:50,531 --> 00:27:52,231
I have a plan too.

371
00:27:52,231 --> 00:27:54,801
So please do what I say this one time.

372
00:27:55,602 --> 00:27:56,672
Tae Kyung.

373
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,072
What are you so worried about?

374
00:27:59,642 --> 00:28:00,941
I told you that I'm confident.

375
00:28:00,941 --> 00:28:02,572
Can't you trust me this once?

376
00:28:02,572 --> 00:28:04,481
Why do you keep letting him have the upper hand?

377
00:28:05,211 --> 00:28:08,511
Is something going on between you and him behind my back?

378
00:28:24,701 --> 00:28:26,902
Hey, you're here.

379
00:28:29,172 --> 00:28:30,801
I read through Jungjin's paperwork,

380
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:32,172
so I came to get something else.

381
00:28:32,271 --> 00:28:34,211
Oh, okay. One second.

382
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,152
Here.

383
00:28:46,322 --> 00:28:48,051
What do you think after reading it through?

384
00:28:48,191 --> 00:28:50,622
The more I look into it, the more obvious that it's Jungjin's fault.

385
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:52,691
There have been victims at a consistent rate,

386
00:28:52,721 --> 00:28:55,592
and the headquarters were aware of the problem,

387
00:28:55,832 --> 00:28:57,332
but they didn't do anything.

388
00:28:57,332 --> 00:29:01,701
Exactly. We have to destroy them for good.

389
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:05,201
Woo Yong, your son is an excellent lawyer.

390
00:29:52,521 --> 00:29:54,922
I'm doing this to help you.

391
00:29:54,922 --> 00:29:57,251
Then there's no reason for you to bow to that jerk.

392
00:29:57,961 --> 00:29:59,021
And...

393
00:30:00,021 --> 00:30:02,392
I thought this was your first deal with him.

394
00:30:03,892 --> 00:30:05,001
You can't...

395
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:10,001
keep testing me, Tae Kyung.
