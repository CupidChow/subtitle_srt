six months before the Ahyeon-dong case, then?

3
00:00:05,991 --> 00:00:07,891
Yes, she was 17 at the time.

4
00:00:08,561 --> 00:00:10,862
Jang Young Mi was close with Choi Soo Jeong,

5
00:00:10,862 --> 00:00:12,232
so let's meet her first...

6
00:00:12,232 --> 00:00:13,462

7

Hello.

10
00:00:26,312 --> 00:00:27,451
Anything to drink?

12
00:00:30,011 --> 00:00:31,021
Sure.

13
00:00:32,382 --> 00:00:33,792
Did I shock you?

14
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:35,792
A little.

15
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:39,521
Right.

16
00:00:40,432 --> 00:00:42,532
I'm Prosecutor Seo Yeon Ah of Seoul Central Prosecutors’ Office.

It hasn't been long since she got in,

20
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:54,612
so we weren't very close.

21
00:00:57,242 --> 00:00:58,481
I see.

22
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:01,311
Then you must know Choi Soo Jeong well,

23
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,082
who was killed seven years ago.

24
00:01:04,382 --> 00:01:07,591
I heard you, her, and Lee Ju Hyeon of Hanbit Entertainment were close.

25
00:01:10,522 --> 00:01:12,162
Yes, a little.

26
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:25,542
Did anything seem odd back then?

27
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:27,272
It can be something very small too.

28
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:30,712
No.

29
00:01:32,182 --> 00:01:33,751
I don't really remember.

30
00:01:34,182 --> 00:01:36,611
Did you meet Soo Jeong or Ju Hyeon on that day?

31
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:38,382
Or the day before?

32
00:01:39,322 --> 00:01:41,621
Well, on that day,

33
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:43,192
I didn't meet them.

34
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:46,722

41
00:02:55,532 --> 00:02:57,431
She looked very anxious.

42
00:02:59,331 --> 00:03:01,701
It seemed like she definitely knows something.

43
00:03:01,902 --> 00:03:03,771
I don't think she'll tell us easily, though.

44
00:03:04,342 --> 00:03:05,972
You're right. This isn't good.

45
00:03:07,141 --> 00:03:10,842
My daughter also wants to be an idol star,

46
00:03:12,842 --> 00:03:15,312
so I told her that I'll break her legs...

47

if she ever says that again.

48
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:19,551

00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:25,222
You said you were confident.

184
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:27,022
Let's do the lawsuit against Jungjin.

185
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:28,952
I heard Jungjin Group has been backing up...

186
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:30,551
Bumjung's capital since seven years ago.

187
00:19:47,242 --> 00:19:49,611
(Jang Young Mi)

188
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,581
(Jang Young Mi)

189
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,361
(Trash)

190
00:20:06,361 --> 00:20:08,591
No, no. I'll make the call.

191
00:20:10,631 --> 00:20:11,631
Okay.

192
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:13,801
Exactly. I'll call.

193
00:20:14,502 --> 00:20:15,502
Okay, bye.

194
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:18,472
Hey, go to a department store...

195
00:20:18,472 --> 00:20:20,042
and buy yourself expensive clothes.

196
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:21,611
Buy shoes and bags too.

197
00:20:23,012 --> 00:20:24,012
Really?

198
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:26,242
I can just buy cheap ones.

199
00:20:26,242 --> 00:20:27,881
It's not for you.

200
00:20:27,982 --> 00:20:29,551
It's for my business.

201
00:20:29,752 --> 00:20:32,182
Don't embarrass me at a business meeting with the staff.

202
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:33,982
Take it.

203
00:20:38,522 --> 00:20:39,621
Thank you.

204
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:41,692
I'm really going to do my best, sir.

205
00:20:41,831 --> 00:20:43,661
Go. Buy some pretty clothes.

206
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,682
(Trash)

207
00:21:08,551 --> 00:21:09,551
(Trash)

208
00:21:34,911 --> 00:21:35,952
What is it?

209
00:21:37,851 --> 00:21:39,782
Because you wouldn't answer my calls.

210
00:21:43,992 --> 00:21:44,992
You met with Chairman Song...

211
00:21:44,992 --> 00:21:46,222
of Bumjung Construction yesterday, right?

212
00:21:48,732 --> 00:21:49,792
Why did you meet him?

213
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:53,032
It was just for business.

214
00:21:53,032 --> 00:21:54,101
What business?

215
00:21:54,101 --> 00:21:55,301
For my agency.

216
00:21:55,432 --> 00:21:56,631
I don't know why either.

217
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,702
How long have you been with Jang Entertainment?

218
00:22:01,972 --> 00:22:02,972
Seven years.

219
00:22:03,672 --> 00:22:04,672
Why?

220
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,742
Did you meet with Chairman Song seven years ago too?

221
00:22:09,081 --> 00:22:10,081
No.

222
00:22:12,252 --> 00:22:15,022
Then did Yang Chul Ki tell you to get the USB...

223
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,752
from my brother that time?

224
00:22:20,692 --> 00:22:22,532
I thought you were going to bury it.

225
00:22:23,932 --> 00:22:25,702
I was going to, but things keep popping up.

226
00:22:25,702 --> 00:22:26,831
It's annoying.

227
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:29,002
I really don't know anything.

228
00:22:30,702 --> 00:22:32,571
So there's no point in coming to me.

229
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:34,401
Do you really not know anything?

230
00:22:34,401 --> 00:22:36,341
Or are you not supposed to know anything about this?

231
00:22:38,782 --> 00:22:41,081
He died without knowing why he had to die.

232
00:22:41,081 --> 00:22:42,952
The same goes for Choi Soo Jeong and Cha Eun Bi.

233
00:22:43,651 --> 00:22:44,911
I bet they had no idea...

234
00:22:45,252 --> 00:22:46,682
why they had to die.

235
00:22:47,682 --> 00:22:50,192
They didn't do anything other than living diligently.

236
00:22:50,851 --> 00:22:52,022
Then they should...

237
00:22:52,321 --> 00:22:54,192
at least know why they were murdered.

238
00:22:54,192 --> 00:22:55,192
So what then?

239
00:22:57,361 --> 00:22:58,962
What will that change?

240
00:22:59,432 --> 00:23:01,672
Will those dead people come back to life?

241
00:23:02,232 --> 00:23:04,401
It's already hard enough to take care of myself as it is.

242
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,341
Why must I care about them?

243
00:23:12,742 --> 00:23:14,782
If you gained a lot of things from it,

244
00:23:15,452 --> 00:23:16,682
that's all there's to it.

245
00:23:18,452 --> 00:23:20,282
Just bury it and live the rest of your life.

246
00:23:22,391 --> 00:23:23,851
So what about you? Did you decide to bury it?

247
00:23:34,002 --> 00:23:35,371
Don't ever come to see me again.

248
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:40,841
If you need my help by any chance,

249
00:23:41,341 --> 00:23:42,712
call me any time.

250
00:23:46,611 --> 00:23:47,641
That won't happen.

251
00:24:23,452 --> 00:24:26,321
("Dream in a Dream")

252
00:24:27,982 --> 00:24:29,992
We're going to invest in this piece,

253
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:32,722
but I don't really know this industry.

254
00:24:35,022 --> 00:24:36,331
I'll do my best.

255
00:24:37,692 --> 00:24:39,202
Is your dream to be an actress?

256
00:24:41,002 --> 00:24:42,071
Yes.

257
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,532
Desperately?

258
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:46,972
Yes.

259
00:24:47,772 --> 00:24:48,772
Good.

260
00:24:50,411 --> 00:24:53,282
I like people who desperately want something.

261
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:55,042
That desperation is...

262
00:24:56,381 --> 00:24:59,151
the power to drive them to do anything.

263
00:25:04,891 --> 00:25:06,962
Let me ask you a question.

264
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:11,061
I heard people have been coming to you,

265
00:25:12,232 --> 00:25:14,861
asking about what happened seven years ago.

266
00:26:26,101 --> 00:26:27,472
(Video play)

267
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:55,232
Can you keep this?

268
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:04,772
You have to keep it with you until I come back to get it.

269
00:27:06,182 --> 00:27:07,212
Okay.

270
00:27:10,611 --> 00:27:11,811
Thank you.

271
00:27:11,982 --> 00:27:14,051
Did you see what it was?

272
00:27:18,452 --> 00:27:20,292
Oh, no. I didn't.

273
00:27:35,002 --> 00:27:43,012
(Jang Young Mi)

274
00:27:43,012 --> 00:27:51,022
(Jang Young Mi)

275
00:28:04,371 --> 00:28:05,601
(Lee Ju Hyeon, missing, Cha Eun Bi, murdered)

276
00:28:06,442 --> 00:28:09,672
(Choi Soo Jeong, 20 years old, rookie actress)

277
00:28:19,422 --> 00:28:20,422
(Suspect of murder: Yang Chul Ki)

278
00:28:20,422 --> 00:28:23,051
I came to see you regarding Cha Eun Bi, who was recently killed.

279
00:28:24,522 --> 00:28:27,591
It hasn't been long since she got in, so we weren't very close.

280
00:28:52,782 --> 00:28:54,381
(3 missed calls from Jang Young Mi, a message from Jang Young Mi)

281
00:29:00,161 --> 00:29:01,161
(I saw what's in the USB. I know why Soo Jeong and your brother died.)

282
00:29:01,821 --> 00:29:03,131
I saw what's in the USB.

283
00:29:04,032 --> 00:29:05,462
I know why...

284
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,861
Soo Jeong and your brother died.

285
00:29:11,932 --> 00:29:13,002
(Jang Young Mi)

286
00:30:07,621 --> 00:30:12,061
(Trash)

287
00:30:42,561 --> 00:30:45,631
(Justice)

288
00:30:45,702 --> 00:30:47,032
Where's Jang Young Mi?

289
00:30:47,032 --> 00:30:49,601
I want her to return safely too.

290
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:50,901
Please!

291
00:30:51,232 --> 00:30:52,702
Did you do that, you jerk?

292
00:30:52,702 --> 00:30:55,672
I don't care who took her. Bring her here immediately.

293
00:30:55,672 --> 00:30:56,972
There are Jang Young Mi's journals.

294
00:30:56,972 --> 00:30:59,341
But we're only missing the years 2012 and 2019.

295
00:30:59,341 --> 00:31:01,442
Information about the Ahyeon-dong Murder Case might be in there.

296
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,212
We'll have to make use of Seo Dong Suk.

297
00:31:04,212 --> 00:31:05,851
Who's this? Wait.

298
00:31:05,851 --> 00:31:08,551
You did something unbelievable seven years ago.

299
00:31:08,551 --> 00:31:09,792
Where is Jang Young Mi?

300
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:11,692
Lee Tae Kyung keeps on provoking me.

301
00:31:11,692 --> 00:31:13,992
If he gets too annoying, we can just kill him,

302
00:31:13,992 --> 00:31:15,891
just like his brother seven years ago.
