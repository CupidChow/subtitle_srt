4
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:51,720
getting distracted with a glass of single-malt whiskey around you is...

5
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:54,751
like watching a rerun on TV...

6
00:01:55,421 --> 00:01:57,861
instead of listening to an orchestra of angels.

7
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:02,861
Do you regret it?

8
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,761
Enjoy the price of this deal...

Raising 10,000 dollars.

12
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,710
It's 10,000 dollars to call.

13
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,111
10,000 dollars, call.

14
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:02,111
Call.

15
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:03,111
It's 10,000 dollars to call.

16
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,481
And I raise it by 20,000 dollars.

17
00:04:04,851 --> 00:04:05,951
It's 30,000 dollars to call.

18
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:12,421
- All-in. - All-in.

19
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,690
So?

20
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,291
Is she dead?

21
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:01,041
He has a week mind,

22
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,411
but he got involved with a nasty girl.

23
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,680
She doesn't have much,

24
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,180
so I'm sure it'll be a piece of cake.

25
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:15,591
I don't think I can help you.

26
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,430
An ill-mannered businessman like me tends to be very simple.

27
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,560
We do not make any deals...

28
00:05:25,831 --> 00:05:27,901
with someone that lost our trust once.

29
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,031
So what? You can't help me out?

30
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:33,671
When I took care of your daughter's illicit admission,

31
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:34,911
the National Tax Service...

32
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:37,940
came after me with a club in their hands.

33
00:05:38,341 --> 00:05:39,440
I had no choice...

34
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,250
because the prosecution gave me so much pressure...

35
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,050
You came a long way,

36
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,351
but I'm sorry I couldn't help you out.

37
00:05:53,091 --> 00:05:54,961
Please help me out, Chairman Song.

38
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:02,130
Goodness, how embarrassing.

39
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:06,440
The director of the National Tax Service is...

40
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,171
kneeling down to a construction worker like me?

41
00:06:29,831 --> 00:06:30,831
Great place.

42
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:47,341
What a huge mess. A huge mess.

43
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:26,481
Darn it, this is so annoying.

44
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:28,151
Call 911 immediately.

45
00:07:28,151 --> 00:07:29,651
And report it to the police too.

46
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,291
My dad called you here to stop me from doing that!

47
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:36,461
That's why you need to make a report, you idiotic son,

48
00:07:36,461 --> 00:07:38,500
if you don't want to go to prison for special violence and rape...

49
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,401
and destroy your father's career as a public officer.

50
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:43,831
What did you say, jerk?

51
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,341
And clean up this place first.

52
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,570
Tell them you were both wasted.

53
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,041
And you know...

54
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:53,740
Tell them she consented, that it wasn't forced.

55
00:07:54,211 --> 00:07:55,611
She got a little hurt...

56
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:57,981
while you two fooled around after getting wasted.

57
00:07:58,721 --> 00:08:00,620
And you won't remember anything that can be used against you.

58
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,151
If she wakes up, try to settle the case first.

59
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,791
- If she reports it, it'll be... - It's a rape.

60
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,260
I was raped.

61
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:17,430

(Criminal Division 2 Courtroom)

63
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:29,211
Ms. Jang Young Mi...

64
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,681
followed the defendant, Do Yong Jin, back to his house...

65
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:34,120
because he agreed to lend her his book...

66
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,691
which she wanted that was no longer being printed.

67
00:08:36,691 --> 00:08:38,461
However, the moment they entered his house,

68
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:41,120
the defendant became aggressive...

69
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,630
and started assaulting her.

70
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,400
Witness, you have testified...

71
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,571
that you clearly refused his approach.

72
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,370
How did he react to that?

73
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,640
When I refused,

74
00:08:58,311 --> 00:08:59,910
he tore my clothes.

75
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:06,380
And then, he put his hand...

76
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,821
inside my skirt.

77
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:12,490
That's enough.

78
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,530
It's a painful memory for her to look back on.

79
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:18,260
The witness considered the defendant...

80
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,660
nothing more than a senior from her school.

81
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,770
She agreed to drink with him so she could talk about her career.

82
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:28,740
She never imagined something so horrendous would happen to her.

83
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,341
Mr. Do Yong Jin severely assaulted Ms. Jang Young Mi,

84
00:09:32,341 --> 00:09:34,441
and she had to receive treatment for two weeks.

85
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:37,010
On top of that, he raped her.

86
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,250
Given that his sperm was found inside of her,

87
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,591
her two weeks' worth of treatment,

88
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:46,461
and his past two records of the same crime,

89
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,260
it is clear that he needs...

90
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,931
to be charged with special assault and rape.

91
00:09:50,931 --> 00:09:51,931

95
00:10:19,961 --> 00:10:21,990
Have you ever had a boyfriend?

96
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:26,361
Sorry?

97
00:10:26,361 --> 00:10:27,931
Have you ever been in a relationship?

98
00:10:28,331 --> 00:10:29,731
That's ridiculous.

99
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,101
No one has claimed to have gotten hit,

100
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:33,900
so of course, there's no case of assault here.

101
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,870

he's the son of an assemblyman.

105

He's connected with the higher-ups as well.

106

Yes.

109
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,660
I've been in relationships.

110
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:00,231
Then I'm guessing you've shared intimacy as well,

111
00:11:00,231 --> 00:11:01,971
given that you're an adult.

112
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:04,900
Your Honor, this has nothing to do with the case.

113
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,000
These are crucial questions that will help us determine...

114
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,510
her state of mind on that day.

115
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,841
Continue.

116
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,380
You and Do Yong Jin drank until late at night,

117
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,380
and the mood was nice.

118
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,750
Afterward, you followed him to his house.

119
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,420
Since you've been in relationships before, I'll ask you this.

120
00:11:23,591 --> 00:11:24,650
That night,

121
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,821
did you truly not expect...

122
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:29,490
to be intimate with him?

123
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,530
Your Honor, this is a defamation of character.

124
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:34,431
He is insulting her with provocative questions.

125
00:11:34,431 --> 00:11:36,471
We're talking about sexual assault here.

126
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,971
We need to determine if there was coercion...

127
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:40,801
or if she was willing.

128
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,640
All right. Continue.

129
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,711
Did you really not expect anything?

130
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:54,920
I... I was very drunk.

131
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,721
And it's true that I felt comfortable around him.

132
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,130
But I didn't expect such a thing.

133
00:12:05,361 --> 00:12:07,961
Then what did you expect?

00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,731

Yes.

136
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,510

Did Chief Prosecutor Cha talk to you?

141
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,160
Of course.

00:12:46,801 --> 00:12:48,971
You assaulted a driver with a beer bottle,

145
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:50,311
not to mention, habitually.

146
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,481

She was a customer at our store.

156

How do you remember her when you have so many customers?

157
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,981
She was looking for something unusual.

158
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,620
"Unusual"?

160
00:13:38,321 --> 00:13:40,020
It's a lingerie store.

161
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,331
Did she purchase underwear?

162
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:45,760
- Yes. - You just mentioned...

163
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,660
that she was looking for an unusual type of underwear.

164
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,831
Could you explain to us what kind of underwear it was?

165
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,841
That is a private matter,

166
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:54,500
and he is defaming her character.

167
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,140
Her answer will help us determine...

168
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,711
whether or not the sexual intercourse was coerced.

169
00:13:58,471 --> 00:13:59,540
Continue.

170
00:14:00,981 --> 00:14:02,211
What kind of underwear was it?

171
00:14:07,051 --> 00:14:09,790
It was a black, mesh lingerie.

172
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,961
The back side was tied.

173
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,290

175
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,571
That's so provocative.

176
00:14:29,071 --> 00:14:31,170
I can't believe she bought that.

177
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:36,150
Is this what she had purchased?

178
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:38,081
Yes, it is.

179
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,321
Your sales statement says...

180
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:45,420
that she bought this on June 9. Is this correct?

181
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,630
Yes, we have statements for each day, so it's accurate.

182
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,630
I see.

183
00:14:50,061 --> 00:14:52,130

00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:55,370
When did you meet Jang Young Mi?

185
00:14:56,071 --> 00:14:57,571
It was on June 10.

186
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,370
That means she purchased this one day before meeting him.

187
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,640
Your Honor, he is making provocative speculations...

188
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,910
to distort the truth.

189
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,380
It's a reasonable suspicion.

190
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,510
The defense may continue.

191
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:15,280
Is this the same underwear she wore that night?

192
00:15:16,221 --> 00:15:17,390
Yes, it is.

193
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:25,231
I will now conclude my interrogation.

194
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,670
Prosecution, would you like to ask some questions?

195
00:15:29,571 --> 00:15:30,971
I'm not ready yet, Your Honor.

196
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,900
The witness may return to her seat.

197
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,540
She expected to be intimate that night.

198
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,410
(Additional witness: Employee at the lingerie store)

199
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,280
This is all a lie. It's all a lie.

200
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,821
I had to play the role of a prostitute for my audition.

201
00:15:49,051 --> 00:15:51,691
I wanted to focus on the role.

202
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,990
I bought it to boost my confidence.

203
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,760
- I was a prostitute for... - Right.

204
00:15:58,231 --> 00:16:00,431
What she's claiming could be true.

205
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:03,530
In order to focus on her role for the audition,

206
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,170
she wore the provocative underwear. It could've been a coincidence...

207
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:09,640
that she drank with him that night.

208
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,181
She wore such underwear, was intoxicated,

209
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,351
and followed him to his house when she met him for the first time.

210
00:16:16,551 --> 00:16:18,111
We can't tell that she had certain intentions...

211
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,250
just because of that.

212
00:16:20,551 --> 00:16:23,351
We need to focus on the essence.

213
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,691
Late at night,

214
00:16:25,691 --> 00:16:28,020
two young and good-looking man and woman were together.

215
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,561
And then, it happened.

216
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,790
Isn't that natural?

217
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:35,030
Is there any evidence?

218
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,670
Is there any proof that he assaulted...

219
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,400
and raped her?

220
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,040
Unfortunately, the only so-called proof that we have...

221
00:16:43,441 --> 00:16:45,071
is her testimony.

222
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:46,380
She needed two weeks' worth of treatment for her injuries.

223
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,111
You could get that much for a scratch.

224
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,910
Is there any proof that it was...

225
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,380
a one-sided and coerced assault on his part?

226
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,520
Are you saying that the witness harmed herself?

227
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,051
She could've been too rough while being heavily intoxicated,

228
00:16:57,051 --> 00:16:58,991
bumped into something,

229
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,660
or...

230
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,991
they could've had some sort of a fetish.

231
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:08,460
Your Honor, he's defaming her character...

232
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,001
with uncertain assumptions.

233
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:11,930
I'm just saying that there are many possibilities.

234
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,541
It may not have been a one-sided and coerced assault...

235
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:14,700
on his part.

236
00:17:18,241 --> 00:17:20,541
Which one of you wanted to meet first?

237
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,081
It was her.

238
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:23,781
Why did she want to see you?

239
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:25,251
She said she was a junior at our club...

240
00:17:25,351 --> 00:17:26,880
and was training to become an actress.

241
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,291
She had a favor.

242
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,521
What was the favor?

243
00:17:32,521 --> 00:17:33,561
She knew...

244
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,561
that my older brother was a movie director.

245
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:43,001
She wanted me to introduce her to him.

246
00:17:46,001 --> 00:17:47,571
("Self-Fabricated Scenario by a Rookie Actress")

247
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:48,670
("Intentional Approach for Screen Time")

248
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,811
- Sir! - Sir!

249
00:17:56,811 --> 00:17:58,281
- Please comment! - Sir!

250
00:17:58,281 --> 00:18:00,480
- What happened? - Please tell us!

251
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,321
I'm glad the truth was unveiled.

252
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,890
I hope this case will speak to society...

253
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:11,291
so that such a wrongful incident won't ever happen again.

254
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,160
Calumny will only ruin...

255
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,301
- one's life. - Sir.

256
00:18:15,831 --> 00:18:17,730
You'll be receiving a fridge soon.

257
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,450
All right.

258
00:18:33,251 --> 00:18:34,251
Okay.

259
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:35,551
Legal fee?

260
00:18:36,091 --> 00:18:38,091
Of course, we only take cards.

261
00:18:38,091 --> 00:18:39,261
We run a transparent business.

262
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:41,491
My gosh, sir. Don't you know the era we live in now?

263
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:43,791
We don't take any incentives for winning the criminal cases.

264
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:47,460
Listen. We are very different...

265
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,801
from those lawyers who don't have a clear conscience.

266
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,601
No, no.

267
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:53,841
I should thank you.

268
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:57,541
Okay. Why don't we grab soju some other time?

269
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,410
Bye.

270
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,321
This looks nice.

271
00:19:23,331 --> 00:19:24,331
You jerk.

272
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:29,311
That's not true.

273
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,410
I trusted him because we go to the same college.

274
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,041
And I only went there because he said...

275
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,410
he would give me useful materials for my acting.

276
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:37,111
I didn't want to do that with him.

277
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:39,351
But you turned me into a prostitute...

278
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:42,021
who would sleep with men for a role in a drama.

279
00:19:42,321 --> 00:19:44,150
Everything that jerk said was a lie.

280
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,660
I know.

281
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:47,920
I'm sure he wanted to sleep with you from the get-go.

282
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,930
He probably knew how to set up a trap...

283
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:52,130
for aspiring actresses like you.

284
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:56,470
You knew everything, but how could you...

285
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,170
So what if I knew?

286
00:19:58,801 --> 00:20:00,970
- What? - What did you expect?

287
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,940
Did you expect a sense of justice from a man...

288
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,771
who defends a sexual offender?

289
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:07,341
You saw everything that jerk did to me.

290
00:20:07,341 --> 00:20:08,880
Why is that important here?

291
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,450
Don't you know who his father is?

292
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,051
Don't you know how powerful he is?

293
00:20:12,051 --> 00:20:14,821
But what about you? I'm sure you know your place.

294
00:20:15,351 --> 00:20:17,251
Whether what he did to you...

295
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:18,251
or the truth is,

296
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:20,291
the outcome of the trial was set from the start.

297
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:22,291
The world is a trashy place.

298
00:20:23,261 --> 00:20:25,091
So put yourself together.

299
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,361
Without power, the world will trample on you.

300
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,670
Don't be a fool who dreams about bringing him to justice...

301
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,370
or revealing the truth.

302
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,170
Scumbag.

303
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,271
Give up on the appeal...

304
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,041
if you want some settlement money.

305
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,111
I heard that the kid was a piece of trash.

306
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,910
I don't care if he's a piece of trash or rubbish.

307
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,551
I had to get him out.

308
00:21:16,551 --> 00:21:18,551
You gave me this case, after all.

309
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,680
No, no.

310
00:21:26,091 --> 00:21:27,091
This is good.

311
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,061
Good job.

312
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,291
Don't mention it.

313
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:33,361
I got handsomely paid for it.

314
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:37,101
By the way, shouldn't we charge Director Do a bit more?

315
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:38,700
He's a regular.

316
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:48,440
Hello, sir.

317
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,811
I owe you big time.

318
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:52,380
No.

319
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,051
Gosh, don't say that. It's between us.

320
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:55,450
I think you'll be able to start the construction...

321
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,720
for the Island Tower.

322
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,720
I can't help you much...

323
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,861
as the director of the National Tax Service.

324
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:02,991
The least I can do is lessening your worry for taxes.

325
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,101
Welcome, sir.

326
00:22:13,101 --> 00:22:16,940
My party members are pestering me to scout you to our party.

327
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,710
Please give it some thought.

328
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,140
I'm sorry.

329
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,351
How could a mere construction worker work for this country?

330
00:22:23,351 --> 00:22:25,210
Democracy Fighter, Song Woo Yong!

331
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,351
Isn't this common knowledge in Korea?

332
00:22:30,591 --> 00:22:32,491
That's part of my embarrassing past.

333
00:22:32,491 --> 00:22:34,791
Gosh, will you be getting into politics?

334
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:37,430
Does it mean I get to take your scoop?

335
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:40,561
You were great today.

336
00:22:40,801 --> 00:22:43,771
You won the sexual assault case with a thong.

337
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,101
Sir, he must be a genius.

338
00:22:46,271 --> 00:22:48,101
You must feel reassured.

339
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:51,640
Gosh, how did you find this gem?

340
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:55,910
All right. Why don't we take a seat?

341
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,120
Let's have some fun today.

342
00:22:59,251 --> 00:23:03,690
Okay. Chairman Song, you invited everyone to this beautiful meeting.

343
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,120
To his good health! Cheers!

344
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,220
Cheers. Cheers.

345
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,291
Cheers.

346
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:11,331
- Cheers. - You were great.

347
00:23:12,061 --> 00:23:13,130
Cheers.

348
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,111
Scumbag.

349
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,210
Bring him back.

350
00:24:33,581 --> 00:24:35,741
You have to bring him back, you jerks!

351
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,150
Let go!

352
00:24:37,511 --> 00:24:39,351
I'm going to kill you all!

353
00:24:40,081 --> 00:24:41,720
How can this be the law?

354
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,091
Let go! Let go of me! Bring him back, you jerks!

355
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,561
Come here, you scumbags.

356
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:48,690
Come here!

357
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,531
Darn it. You scared me for a second.

358
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,470
Goodness.

359
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,470
Hey.

360
00:25:39,241 --> 00:25:40,841
Why do you come to my house...

361
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:42,851
more frequently than you go to your house?

362
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,450
I booked a VIP medical checkup at Hanjoo Hospital.

363
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,551
It's in two days.

364
00:25:47,351 --> 00:25:49,491
Gosh, my health is just fine.

365
00:25:50,991 --> 00:25:52,351
You went to sleep this morning, didn't you?

366
00:25:53,791 --> 00:25:56,690
You'll die if you don't sleep after drinking that much.

367
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:01,930
That's not a bad idea.

368
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,440
What is it this time?

369
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,021
Get this thug out from prison.

370
00:26:23,521 --> 00:26:26,361
It looks like he got himself arrested for an assault case.

371
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:28,561
Thug?

372
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:33,831
Come on. If he's a thug, he has to stay in the slammer,

373
00:26:33,831 --> 00:26:35,801
so he doesn't lose his edge.

374
00:26:36,031 --> 00:26:38,301
You'll spoil him if you keep getting him out.

375
00:26:50,781 --> 00:26:54,521
I'm thinking of building the tallest building...

376
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:57,450
at the most expensive area in Korea.

377
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:01,091
I can't let my company's reputation getting marred because of a thug.

378
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,291
I don't want to risk it.

379
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:10,700
He's the small fry. He just provides me labor.

380
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:24,581
The tallest building at the most expensive area in Korea?

381
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:28,980
There's a piece of land that I want too.
