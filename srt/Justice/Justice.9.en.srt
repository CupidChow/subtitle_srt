(All characters, places, companies, )

2
00:00:01,872 --> 00:00:03,702
(and incidents in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:12,852
Are you still not over Seo Yeon Ah?

4
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:15,251
What?

5
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:18,091
I think you still have regrets.

6
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:25,492
What are you suddenly saying?

7
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:28,232
Why are you bringing her up?

8
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:31,371
She keeps getting on my nerves.

9
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:37,172
After I finished my business, I stopped...

10
00:00:37,172 --> 00:00:39,212
by the police station which is in charge of Detective Kang's case...

11
00:00:39,212 --> 00:00:40,681
because it was nearby.

12
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:43,712
Nothing much.

13
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:46,952
Okay, see you tomorrow.

14
00:00:57,092 --> 00:00:58,562
What was that?

15
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:06,072
(52D 2740)

16
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,842
Can you check a license plate number?

17
00:01:50,682 --> 00:01:52,952
It seems like Seo Yeon Ah is coming after me.

18
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:55,751
I think she is...

19
00:01:56,322 --> 00:01:59,622
tracking down the source of our company's funds.

20
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:04,162
Well, then.

21
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:08,561
Is there anything that you should be concerned about?

22
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:10,931
Once someone decides to look into a company,

23
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:13,132
everything can become a problem.

24
00:02:14,771 --> 00:02:16,771
And with what happened before,

25
00:02:17,172 --> 00:02:18,542
I don't feel too reassured.

26
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:23,012
I'm sure it'll be fine.

27
00:02:23,111 --> 00:02:24,281
There's nothing special.

28
00:02:27,422 --> 00:02:28,922
I let her be,

29
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:31,252
yet she keeps on picking a fight.

30
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:34,861
Seo Yeon Ah.

31
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,192
What should I do about her, Tae Kyung?

32
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:56,611
(Seo Yeon Ah)

33
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:05,151
Oh, that was Mr. Nam.

34
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:16,002
(Lee Tae Kyung)

35
00:03:24,811 --> 00:03:25,811
Hey.

36
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:28,211
Hey, what's up?

37
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:30,681
Is everything okay?

38
00:03:31,681 --> 00:03:32,681
What do you mean?

39
00:03:33,352 --> 00:03:35,922
Does anyone else know that we met up today?

40
00:03:35,922 --> 00:03:37,952
No, why do you ask?

41
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:39,551
You need to take an X-ray right away.

42
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,292
Your bone may be broken.

43
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:43,922
What's going on?

44
00:03:44,461 --> 00:03:46,031
If everything is fine, it's okay.

45
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:47,031
Bye.

46
00:03:58,412 --> 00:03:59,412
Mr. Nam.

47
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:02,042
Can you find out if there are...

48
00:04:02,482 --> 00:04:05,382
any reports of car accidents or treatment reports at a hospital?

49
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:07,621
For Prosecutor Seo Yeon Ah.

50
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:12,091
(Episode 9)

51
00:04:13,992 --> 00:04:15,562
Great work today.

52
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:18,132
I'll give you a ride home.

53
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,132
Gosh.

54
00:04:19,762 --> 00:04:23,331
It's probably too tough for them to do that twice in a day.

55
00:04:24,872 --> 00:04:25,901
Okay.

56
00:04:27,132 --> 00:04:28,142
Bye.

57
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:35,841
Goodness.

58
00:05:08,812 --> 00:05:09,812
What happened?

59
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:11,612
A truck charged at my car...

60
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:13,981
on my way back after seeing you.

61
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,622
What do you mean?

62
00:05:15,622 --> 00:05:16,921
No idea.

63
00:05:17,122 --> 00:05:18,892
There are so many odd things about this.

64
00:05:18,892 --> 00:05:21,562
I told you not to touch that without any hard evidence.

65
00:05:21,562 --> 00:05:23,421
Touch whom? Why not?

66
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:25,992
Did Chairman Song say he's going to kill me?

67
00:05:28,132 --> 00:05:31,002
Stop blaming the innocent and get a grip on the situation.

68
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:33,231
Find out who did it and why.

69
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:35,271
I wonder. What are they so afraid of...

70
00:05:35,271 --> 00:05:37,101
that they would do this to a prosecutor?

71
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:38,211
Afraid of?

72
00:05:40,411 --> 00:05:42,812
If they did this in the face of a prosecutor,

73
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:45,882
it means they will use all means to harm you.

74
00:05:45,952 --> 00:05:47,781
Today, they let you off after scaring you,

75
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:50,081
but they can hit your car in the future.

76
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:51,091
So what?

77
00:05:51,822 --> 00:05:53,052
Do you want me to sit still?

78
00:05:53,952 --> 00:05:56,492
Because I might die if I dig into this case?

79
00:05:57,692 --> 00:05:58,961
You should know who has the upper hand...

80
00:05:58,961 --> 00:06:00,432
before you go into something.

81
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:03,202
You'll end up like this if you keep poking around.

82
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,872
Is that all you can say to someone who just almost died?

83
00:06:13,142 --> 00:06:14,682
I really don't get it.

84
00:06:22,651 --> 00:06:23,921
Why did you come here?

85
00:07:26,882 --> 00:07:29,721
(Bumjung Construction)

86
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:45,831
Is something going on?

87
00:07:48,841 --> 00:07:50,442
Prosecutor Seo was harmed.

88
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:53,041
A truck ran into her vehicle.

89
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:56,312
A truck?

90
00:07:57,642 --> 00:07:58,711
Was it you?

91
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:01,322
Were you trying to scare her?

92
00:08:01,322 --> 00:08:03,081
Are you insane? To an incumbent prosecutor?

93
00:08:10,362 --> 00:08:11,632
Then who could have done it?

94
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:32,712
Drink.

95
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:23,602
You should've used your head.

96
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:55,061
Sir.

97
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,462
Could you summon the suspect from my accident?

98
00:09:57,661 --> 00:09:58,701
The suspect?

99
00:09:59,271 --> 00:10:00,872
Did you get something from your dashcam?

100
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:02,142
Did you see his face?

101
00:10:03,171 --> 00:10:04,201
Not yet.

102
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:08,281
But after some thought, I got a hunch.

103
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:11,882
The motive was simple.

104
00:10:12,352 --> 00:10:13,712
The method was poor.

105
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:16,781
And it was pretty obvious too.

106
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:29,732
(President Jang Chi Soo)

107
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:31,201
Please spare my life!

108
00:10:32,472 --> 00:10:33,602
Please!

109
00:10:34,941 --> 00:10:37,071
Please spare my life! I'm sorry.

110
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:39,171
That prosecutor was annoying me.

111
00:10:39,712 --> 00:10:41,382
I was just going to scare her, that's all.

112
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,911
I'm sorry, sir. I truly am.

113
00:10:52,622 --> 00:10:53,752
You should start...

114
00:10:56,362 --> 00:10:57,561
using your head.

115
00:10:58,392 --> 00:10:59,392
Yes, sir.

116
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:10,541
Goodbye, sir.

117
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,451
Did someone beat you up?

118
00:11:31,931 --> 00:11:33,031
No.

119
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:38,171
I wonder why.

120
00:11:43,242 --> 00:11:45,811
If they're sane enough, no one would dare...

121
00:11:45,811 --> 00:11:49,781
to kill an incumbent prosecutor in such an obvious way.

122
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,582
I have no idea what you're getting at.

123
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:56,622
I think you made a rash decision...

124
00:11:56,622 --> 00:11:59,021
and didn't even prepare beforehand.

125
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:02,892
You tried to kill an incumbent prosecutor...

126
00:12:02,892 --> 00:12:04,021
and committed special intimidation.

127
00:12:04,021 --> 00:12:05,791
I wonder how many years you'll have to rot in jail.

128
00:12:06,832 --> 00:12:08,862
The analysis of my dashcam will be revealed soon.

129
00:12:09,732 --> 00:12:12,071
Would you like to wait here until I obtain solid proof?

130
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,301
Or...

131
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:19,212
I have a good idea.

132
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:24,541
What did she want?

133
00:12:28,722 --> 00:12:29,821
The ledger.

134
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:32,752
She wants the breakdown for the funds sent...

135
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,821
from Bumjung to Jang Entertainment.

136
00:12:37,092 --> 00:12:38,232
President Jang.

137
00:12:40,232 --> 00:12:41,232
Yes, sir.

138
00:12:43,832 --> 00:12:45,071
President Jang.

139
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:46,931
Yes, sir.

140
00:12:52,411 --> 00:12:53,972
Have you received any money from me?

141
00:12:59,852 --> 00:13:01,521
Chairman Song was involved in the Ahyeon-dong Murder Case...

142
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:02,882
from seven years ago, wasn't he?

143
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:06,722
How about this murder case?

144
00:13:07,992 --> 00:13:09,262
I don't know.

145
00:13:09,362 --> 00:13:11,262
Try to think.

146
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:13,392
Was he involved or not?

147
00:13:19,472 --> 00:13:21,372
Would you like to rot in jail your entire life?

148
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,602
Or would you like to continue doing what you've been doing?

149
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,372
Think wisely.

150
00:13:30,941 --> 00:13:32,082
Good work.

151
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,102
(Prosecutor Seo Yeon Ah)

152
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,642
It seems like Seo Yeon Ah is coming after me.

153
00:14:00,571 --> 00:14:04,082
I let her be, yet she keeps on picking a fight.

154
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:07,882
What should I do about her, Tae Kyung?

155
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:10,651
I have a feeling that these are all related events.

156
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:12,752
The Jang Entertainment murder.

157
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:15,021
The death of the courier who was there.

158
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:17,592
The death of the prime suspect, Yang Chul Ki,

159
00:14:17,592 --> 00:14:19,992
and Bumjung Construction's funds that went into Jang Entertainment.

160
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,732
Plus, Chairman Song who's behind it all.

161
00:14:31,712 --> 00:14:32,712
Yes?

162
00:14:35,281 --> 00:14:36,582
Okay.

163
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:41,551
Sir.

164
00:14:42,651 --> 00:14:44,051
Is it true...

165
00:14:44,622 --> 00:14:47,622
that Ji Min is suffering like this because of that company?

166
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:51,862
Even Seon Hee and the others are suffering from the same symptoms.

167
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,161
I think it's highly likely.

168
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:56,901
She was a smart student.

169
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,431
But since we were so poor...

170
00:15:00,071 --> 00:15:03,102
I'm fine, Dad. I'll recover.

171
00:15:03,342 --> 00:15:06,872
I'll get better, go to college, and date guys as well.

172
00:15:07,872 --> 00:15:11,441
Once I go back to school, I'm going to start dating first.

173
00:15:11,752 --> 00:15:13,411
Like a player.

174
00:15:14,411 --> 00:15:16,722
You might end up becoming an uncle next year.

175
00:15:16,722 --> 00:15:17,951
Will that be okay for you?

176
00:15:25,362 --> 00:15:27,191
I won't charge you for anything.

177
00:15:27,191 --> 00:15:29,301
But if we win the case or make a settlement,

178
00:15:29,632 --> 00:15:31,571
I'll charge you 20 percent.

179
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,732
If we lose, I won't charge you anything.

180
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,401
Sir, please reveal the truth about why Ji Min...

181
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,411
and Seon Hee...

182
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,342
became like this.

183
00:15:40,771 --> 00:15:42,142
Of course.

184
00:15:42,781 --> 00:15:44,041
Here.

185
00:15:45,181 --> 00:15:47,512
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

186
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:49,321
Thank you.

00:16:05,071 --> 00:16:06,171
Good work.

189
00:16:08,132 --> 00:16:09,171
Woo Yong.

190
00:16:10,901 --> 00:16:13,571
Do you know the characteristics of those who are poor and weak?

191
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,342
They easily trust others...

192
00:16:18,012 --> 00:16:19,512
and are easily moved by others.

193
00:16:22,951 --> 00:16:25,852
They don't know that they'll be deceived. They're fools.

194
00:16:27,752 --> 00:16:29,622
You're going to the factory tomorrow, right?

195
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:31,931
Whatever it may be,

196
00:16:32,262 --> 00:16:34,531
you just need to find one solid evidence.

197
00:16:34,962 --> 00:16:36,431
Solid evidence?

198
00:16:36,931 --> 00:16:38,972
I'm sure they've already taken care of that.

199
00:16:40,472 --> 00:16:41,671
Don't be too hopeful.

200
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,532
Was it for the construction of this building?

201
00:17:39,032 --> 00:17:41,191
The first time you came to me?

202
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:43,832
This building definitely had my attention.

203
00:17:44,661 --> 00:17:46,901
It's in the heart of Gangnam.

204
00:17:47,372 --> 00:17:49,142
Things are getting interesting.

205
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,741
Lawyer Lee must do a good job with this.

206
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:55,082
Right?

207
00:17:57,981 --> 00:18:00,181
This is unlike you. It seems...

208
00:18:01,011 --> 00:18:03,122
as if you're very concerned about this case.

209
00:18:29,382 --> 00:18:30,642
Hello, Lawyer Lee.

210
00:18:35,421 --> 00:18:38,221
Currently, 168 employees are working here.

211
00:18:38,322 --> 00:18:39,751
So far, over 350 employees...

212
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,421
have worked at this factory.

213
00:18:41,651 --> 00:18:44,292
And among those employees, only about seven employees...

214
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:45,862
had a problem with their eyesight.

215
00:18:45,862 --> 00:18:48,431
And 5 of those 7 people admitted that it was their fault.

216
00:18:48,532 --> 00:18:51,772
- Well, they didn't put on proper... - May I see some relevant files?

217
00:18:52,671 --> 00:18:54,572
Sure. It's that way.

218
00:19:03,312 --> 00:19:04,441
Please take your seats.

219
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:06,181
You should have sat down while you waited for me.

220
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:18,592
I'd like to run an inspection at the factory in Changwon.

221
00:19:20,231 --> 00:19:22,201
Is there a problem with our factory?

222
00:19:22,302 --> 00:19:23,302
Pardon?

223
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:27,471
No, you told me to take care of the victims the other day.

224
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:29,042
I told you to get them...

225
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,142
to have the surgery right away and compensate them.

226
00:19:31,701 --> 00:19:33,272
They are our employees.

227
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,642
Yes, that's why I'd like to check if there's a problem...

228
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,711
Is there a problem with our company?

229
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:41,751
Well, no.

230
00:19:41,751 --> 00:19:44,882
I'm trying to extend my courtesy to them.

231
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:54,191
I heard that the victim's lawyer went down to the factory.

232
00:19:54,832 --> 00:19:57,102
Make sure you show him and prove to him...

233
00:19:58,201 --> 00:20:00,471
that nothing is wrong with our company.

234
00:20:00,671 --> 00:20:01,842
Don't worry.

235
00:20:01,842 --> 00:20:03,971
("Jungjin Group Will Take Moral Responsibility")

236
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:06,171
Due to our company policy,

237
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,681
we cannot disclose our files for a long duration.

238
00:20:08,782 --> 00:20:10,981
You must read all of them before the end of the business day.

239
00:20:10,981 --> 00:20:12,151
Will that be okay with you?

240
00:20:12,151 --> 00:20:13,411
No.

241
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:14,812
We're not AlphaGo.

242
00:20:14,812 --> 00:20:16,282
How can we read them in six hours?

243
00:20:16,622 --> 00:20:18,181
It sounds like they want us to fail, isn't it?

244
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:19,792
No, that's not true.

245
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:21,721
The headquarters urged us to cooperate with you.

246
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,721
Where's a good sashimi restaurant here?

247
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:24,822
One that serves wild fish.

248
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:27,991
Pardon?

249
00:20:28,632 --> 00:20:31,461
If you can assemble the relevant personnel by 6pm,

250
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:33,971
I'll just ask a few questions I need and go back to Seoul.

251
00:20:34,272 --> 00:20:36,471
Sure, sure. We can do that.

252
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,272
You came all this way here.

253
00:20:38,272 --> 00:20:40,542
You should get some fresh air by the seaside.

254
00:20:41,011 --> 00:20:42,181
How about we treat you to a meal?

255
00:20:42,181 --> 00:20:43,941
Well, you could do that. Let's go.

256
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:46,782
Okay.

257
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,731
Ma'am, another one of this, please.

258
00:21:08,772 --> 00:21:10,671
What's your plan?

259
00:21:10,872 --> 00:21:14,211
- What do you mean? - There were boxes of files.

260
00:21:14,312 --> 00:21:15,741
If it's before the end of the business day,

261
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:17,481
we have less than four hours.

262
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:21,552
This is a free drink which you love.

263
00:21:22,651 --> 00:21:25,892
I never said that I liked free drinks.

264
00:21:43,441 --> 00:21:44,441
Lawyer Lee.

265
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:47,711
I'm really disappointed.

266
00:21:49,882 --> 00:21:50,882
All of a sudden?

267
00:21:51,181 --> 00:21:52,181
Listen.

268
00:21:52,981 --> 00:21:54,211
In five years,

269
00:21:54,582 --> 00:21:56,882
be it a river or a mountain, at least one of them...

270
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,451
would have changed.

271
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,221
I know...

272
00:22:00,892 --> 00:22:04,022
we're not real family.

273
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,392
But we're colleagues, you know?

274
00:22:06,691 --> 00:22:07,691
Colleagues.

275
00:22:08,231 --> 00:22:10,832
I think you're cursing me out indirectly.

276
00:22:11,332 --> 00:22:12,332
I am?

277
00:22:14,802 --> 00:22:17,772
You're right. It's already been five years.

278
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:19,772
Back then,

279
00:22:20,711 --> 00:22:22,511
if you didn't...

280
00:22:23,411 --> 00:22:24,582
take me in,

281
00:22:24,582 --> 00:22:27,451
I would've been homeless with my siblings...

282
00:22:27,451 --> 00:22:29,721
- and starved to death. - No, no.

283
00:22:30,451 --> 00:22:32,151
Why are you telling me your sob story all of a sudden?

284
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:34,151
You know that I hate sob stories the most.

285
00:22:34,852 --> 00:22:36,461
Wasn't that about your brother's case?

286
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:39,362
The thing you told me to look into the other day.

287
00:22:40,991 --> 00:22:43,362
Jang Young Mi and the delivery man.

288
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:49,142
I was just so happy to earn a bit more money...

289
00:22:49,142 --> 00:22:51,542
when I had no idea what the task was about.

290
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:56,711
I don't know what exactly happened to him,

291
00:22:57,211 --> 00:23:00,052
but if you need my help next time, don't hesitate at all.

292
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:01,751
Just say the word.

293
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,892
But what is the connection...

294
00:23:05,892 --> 00:23:07,751
between your brother...

295
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:10,122
and Jang Young Mi?

296
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:36,751
Murder case for an aspiring actress?

297
00:23:37,052 --> 00:23:39,822
A while ago, an aspiring actress or a trainee...

298
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:42,622
died at Mount Uhwa.

299
00:23:43,191 --> 00:23:45,221
Ma Dong Hyuk was looking into that.

300
00:23:45,392 --> 00:23:48,731
And I found a trace that he looked up...

301
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:50,761
a few aspiring actresses.

302
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:53,971
It's a statement about the capital from Bumjung Construction.

315
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:18,951
Yes, sir.

316
00:25:21,451 --> 00:25:22,592
Has it been decided?

317
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:53,592
He's totally out.

318
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:55,721
Wake up. Wake up now.

320
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:12,042
All right. Shall we start?

321
00:26:15,272 --> 00:26:16,782
Was the company aware...

322
00:26:16,782 --> 00:26:18,782
that methanol was harmful to people...

323
00:26:18,782 --> 00:26:20,251
and it may cause vision loss?

324
00:26:20,251 --> 00:26:22,052
We were not aware of that.

325
00:26:22,052 --> 00:26:23,721
It's just like it says on the file.

326
00:26:23,721 --> 00:26:26,292
Yes, I found this file on box three.

327
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:29,191
Manager Park Ho Young.

328
00:26:29,761 --> 00:26:32,431
- Yes? - On December 7, 2017,

329
00:26:32,431 --> 00:26:34,191
you wrote this on your work log.

330
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:35,602
You wrote that...

331
00:26:35,602 --> 00:26:38,802
"There's a risk of vision loss due to methanol."

332
00:26:38,802 --> 00:26:40,532
I wrote that?

333
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,802
Yes, that's why...

334
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:45,941
I took a photo of the log with my phone. Here.

335
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:47,272
Right here.

336
00:26:47,411 --> 00:26:50,112
Although you were fully aware of the dangerousness,

337
00:26:50,112 --> 00:26:52,112
the company continued to use methanol.

338
00:26:52,382 --> 00:26:54,151
It was because methanol was 70 cents cheaper...

339
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:55,681
than the other chemical.

340
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:58,852
It's clearly shown in box five, the cost analysis.

341
00:26:59,721 --> 00:27:02,151
- The company definitely knew... - He's annoying but kind of cool.

342
00:27:02,151 --> 00:27:04,322
- Right? - about this problem.

343
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:06,961
However, you failed to install multiple numbers of vents.

344
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:12,401
I have a question for you.

345
00:27:13,272 --> 00:27:15,132
When you had the first victim,

346
00:27:15,741 --> 00:27:17,471
although he was abroad,

347
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:19,411
the paperwork showed it was reported to the vice-chairman.

348
00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:21,711
Then was Vice-Chairman Tak Soo Ho...

349
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:24,481
already aware of this?

350
00:27:28,852 --> 00:27:31,282
Jungjin must be a bit anxious too.

351
00:27:32,122 --> 00:27:34,852
Lawyer Lee Tae Kyung won't go easy on them.

352
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:37,062
You took the case on purpose...

353
00:27:37,062 --> 00:27:39,062
to give a blow to Jungjin.

354
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:43,761
Figures. Jungjin Construction caused so many problems already.

355
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:45,832
Goodness, that's not the case.

356
00:27:46,372 --> 00:27:48,372
That happens often in business.

357
00:27:48,632 --> 00:27:52,441
I think he just took up Jungjin's case on his own.

358
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:55,372
I heard he's defending the victims.

359
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,481
Vice-Chairman Tak must be really concerned...

360
00:27:59,951 --> 00:28:01,552
as he was about to succeed the group.

361
00:28:11,592 --> 00:28:13,362
Although he was abroad,

362
00:28:13,362 --> 00:28:15,592
the paperwork showed it was reported to the vice-chairman.

363
00:28:16,701 --> 00:28:18,661
Then was Vice-Chairman Tak Soo Ho...

364
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,802
already aware of this?

365
00:28:24,201 --> 00:28:25,342
Already aware of this?

366
00:28:27,171 --> 00:28:28,272
Already aware of this?

367
00:28:30,181 --> 00:28:31,312
