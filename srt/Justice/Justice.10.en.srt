1
00:00:01,156 --> 00:00:04,667
Soo Ho is probably anxious to death right now.

2
00:00:05,167 --> 00:00:07,667
He probably couldn't imagine that I would go through...

3
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:09,237
the mountains of paperwork.

4
00:00:09,897 --> 00:00:11,766
I think I have a shot at this.

5
00:00:12,566 --> 00:00:13,807
That's good.

6
00:00:14,737 --> 00:00:16,636
I thought it wouldn't be that easy.

7
00:00:17,106 --> 00:00:19,446
Goodness, I'm a good lawyer...

8
00:00:19,446 --> 00:00:22,017
who would do anything for you.

9
00:00:22,447 --> 00:00:23,816
Yes, great job.

10
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:36,326
Yes.

11
00:00:38,027 --> 00:00:39,027
Lawyer Lee.

12
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:02,077
If a human loses their soul,

13
00:02:04,116 --> 00:02:05,917
do you think they are still human?

14
00:02:09,817 --> 00:02:12,257
If they earnestly wish to get it back again,

15
00:02:13,287 --> 00:02:14,697
don't you think they're still human?

16
00:02:15,496 --> 00:02:16,596
Get it back?

17
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:20,096
Could we do that?

18
00:02:23,996 --> 00:02:26,237
Goodness, I'm sorry. I left my guest standing here.

19
00:02:27,906 --> 00:02:29,207
What is it?

20
00:02:29,637 --> 00:02:31,176
I had something to tell you,

21
00:02:31,176 --> 00:02:33,207
but there are too many people watching out there.

22
00:02:33,447 --> 00:02:35,817
I know it's bad manners, but I had to invite you home.

23
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:37,616
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:39,086 --> 00:02:40,086
Why don't we...

25
00:02:40,846 --> 00:02:42,257
head over there?

26
00:02:55,637 --> 00:02:57,037
Is this because of the lawsuit?

27
00:02:58,607 --> 00:03:00,406
I'm really sorry,

28
00:03:00,737 --> 00:03:01,836
but please persuade the victims...

29
00:03:01,836 --> 00:03:03,477
to drop the lawsuit.

30
00:03:03,936 --> 00:03:06,077
I'll give you as much compensation as you want.

31
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:08,676
Last time, you asked me...

32
00:03:08,676 --> 00:03:10,977
to find out exactly what the problem is.

33
00:03:11,487 --> 00:03:13,716
I asked you to find out what the problem is,

34
00:03:13,716 --> 00:03:16,216
not to win the lawsuit.

35
00:03:18,487 --> 00:03:20,926
Oh, is that how you took that?

36
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:27,026
I can't do that.

37
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:31,067
There's a reason why I must win this case too.

38
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:33,366
It'll be much better if you dropped it.

39
00:03:39,447 --> 00:03:40,846
Please excuse me.

40
00:03:55,357 --> 00:03:58,396
If you have to win the case because of Chairman Song,

41
00:03:59,227 --> 00:04:01,836
then I think we can talk about this a little more.

42
00:04:07,867 --> 00:04:09,437
Woo Yong, what is he saying?

43
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:14,406
I can explain.

44
00:04:41,807 --> 00:04:44,377
- Tae Kyung. - Was this your plan all along?

45
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:45,776
Why didn't you tell me?

46
00:04:45,776 --> 00:04:47,776
Because the case was too high-profile,

47
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:49,046
with all kinds of the press...

48
00:04:49,046 --> 00:04:50,817
and human rights lawyer dying to take the case.

49
00:04:51,077 --> 00:04:52,617
The problem would have blown up...

50
00:04:52,617 --> 00:04:54,017
if people found out we're on Jungjin's side.

51
00:04:54,017 --> 00:04:55,387
Even so, how can you deceive me?

52
00:04:55,387 --> 00:04:57,916
I didn't want to bother you with this.

53
00:04:58,457 --> 00:05:00,557
As you said, there's no way they can win against Jungjin,

54
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:03,396
so they will lose naturally if we let the case go on.

55
00:05:03,497 --> 00:05:04,767
I thought it would save your image...

56
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:06,026
if you took the victim's side...

57
00:05:06,026 --> 00:05:08,796
and use the press to make sure people know.

58
00:05:13,236 --> 00:05:15,077
Woo Yong, isn't this a bit odd?

59
00:05:15,336 --> 00:05:17,106
You always made me...

60
00:05:17,106 --> 00:05:19,447
take evil men's side and defend them.

61
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:21,416
I really don't get why you didn't tell me...

62
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,247
about this particular case.

63
00:05:23,247 --> 00:05:25,216
Why is this case different from the other ones...

64
00:05:25,216 --> 00:05:26,447
that we took before?

65
00:05:27,017 --> 00:05:28,957
It was a term on Jungjin's side.

66
00:05:29,017 --> 00:05:30,986
They asked me to keep it a secret from you.

67
00:05:33,387 --> 00:05:35,497
This is a whole different case compared to personal lawsuits...

68
00:05:35,497 --> 00:05:36,757
that you took on until this day.

69
00:05:36,757 --> 00:05:38,197
It's a corporate litigation.

70
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,767
Jungjin is known to be picky.

71
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:41,396
Their case comes with dozens of terms.

72
00:05:41,396 --> 00:05:44,067
And one of them was keeping confidentiality.

73
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:47,906
And you didn't need to know either.

74
00:05:48,877 --> 00:05:50,976
I thought it wouldn't be a huge problem if you didn't know.

75
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,046
That's why you didn't tell me?

76
00:05:53,046 --> 00:05:54,776
Do you expect me to believe that?

77
00:05:55,077 --> 00:05:57,817
- Tae Kyung. - You took that jerk's side and...

78
00:06:01,557 --> 00:06:03,887
How can you deceive me? Why?

79
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:05,557
I really don't understand.

80
00:06:47,997 --> 00:06:49,637
It's been a while, sir.

81
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:55,207
Woo Yong, is he Tak Soo Ho from Jungjin Group?

82
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:56,536
Tae Kyung.

83
00:06:58,207 --> 00:06:59,447
It looks like...

84
00:07:00,146 --> 00:07:02,216
you will have to win that case no matter what.

85
00:07:04,046 --> 00:07:06,247
Why do you keep lying?

86
00:07:07,387 --> 00:07:09,586
He committed the murder that day.

87
00:07:10,057 --> 00:07:12,156
And your brother unluckily went there that day...

88
00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:13,757
and got involved.

89
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:15,827
That's why he...

90
00:07:21,736 --> 00:07:23,067
That could be possible.

91
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,736
They aren't the real culprits who killed your brother.

92
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:30,437
The real culprit is someone else!

93
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:34,747
You'll find the reason why your brother had to die...

94
00:07:35,346 --> 00:07:36,716
if you look into his phone.

95
00:09:13,947 --> 00:09:15,547
What would a middle-schooler know?

96
00:09:16,647 --> 00:09:18,216
I think they'll wrap up the case.

97
00:09:18,817 --> 00:09:19,947
Those scumbags.

98
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:23,016
That portrait looked like...

99
00:09:26,687 --> 00:09:28,187
her profile photo.

100
00:09:31,126 --> 00:09:32,897
She must've been eager and on cloud nine...

101
00:09:33,427 --> 00:09:35,466
when she took it.

102
00:09:39,336 --> 00:09:41,907
Why do you think they keep killing these helpless girls?

103
00:09:43,836 --> 00:09:45,506
Their eagerness was...

104
00:09:48,077 --> 00:09:49,147
so easily destroyed.

105
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:52,547
Those dirtbags.

106
00:10:14,537 --> 00:10:17,006
Did you find any leads from the Mount Uhwa case?

107
00:10:20,476 --> 00:10:21,606
(Ahyeon-dong Studio Apartment Murder Case Victim)

108
00:10:21,606 --> 00:10:23,177
This is Choi Soo Jeong who was murdered seven years ago.

109
00:10:23,577 --> 00:10:24,616
(Mount Uhwa Murder Case Victim)

110
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:26,246
And this is Cha Eun Bi from the recent murder case.

111
00:10:26,246 --> 00:10:28,557
They were both from Jang Entertainment.

112
00:10:28,856 --> 00:10:32,386
Lee Ju Hyeon and Hong So Eun were from different agencies.

113
00:10:32,386 --> 00:10:33,427
Lee Ju Hyeon was from Hanbit Entertainment,

114
00:10:33,427 --> 00:10:34,657
and Hong So Eun was from Seoul Entertainment.

115
00:10:34,986 --> 00:10:38,027
Hanbit Entertainment was founded by Kim Choong Sik,

116
00:10:38,027 --> 00:10:39,667
a former manager at Jang Entertainment.

117
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:42,537
As for Seoul Entertainment, Seo Jun Cheol is the president.

118
00:10:42,537 --> 00:10:44,167
He's Jang Chi Soo's mistress' older brother.

119
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:48,907
That means the four victims are all related to Jang Entertainment.

120
00:10:49,136 --> 00:10:50,407
They tried to dupe us...

121
00:10:50,677 --> 00:10:52,947
into thinking that they weren't related.

122
00:10:53,177 --> 00:10:54,707
Could you and Hyo Lim look into...

123
00:10:54,707 --> 00:10:56,746
Lee Ju Hyeon and Hong So Eun who are missing?

124
00:10:56,746 --> 00:10:57,746
Yes, ma'am.

125
00:10:58,077 --> 00:11:00,417
By the way, two actresses from Jang Entertainment...

126
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:02,187
were there since the Choi Soo Jeong case.

127
00:11:02,486 --> 00:11:04,886
The late Cha Eun Bi was the only one who joined them six months ago.

128
00:11:05,016 --> 00:11:06,187
Who are these two?

129
00:11:07,687 --> 00:11:08,797
They're Jung Hae Jin and Jang Young Mi,

130
00:11:08,797 --> 00:11:10,496
who was in high school back then.

131
00:11:10,726 --> 00:11:13,027
Their contracts will last for another three years.

133
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:36,216
Those mobile products are trendy overseas.

134
00:11:37,457 --> 00:11:40,327
But this one is...

135
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:43,226
Really? You should make sure they're copyrighted.

136
00:11:43,697 --> 00:11:45,897
If there are duplicates abroad, it'll be hard to make money.

137
00:11:46,626 --> 00:11:49,197
Our legal team has already taken care of that.

138
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:51,236
Hello, I'd like to introduce you to the girls.

139
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:53,136
- Hello. - No.

140
00:11:54,766 --> 00:11:55,836
You, come here.

141
00:11:57,236 --> 00:11:58,277
Yes, sir.

142
00:11:59,707 --> 00:12:00,907
You look young.

143
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:06,287
What are you doing? You should sit here.

144
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,256
How old are you?

145
00:12:11,216 --> 00:12:13,386
- Let me pour you a glass. - Sure.

146
00:12:15,697 --> 00:12:17,226
- Let me. - All right.

147
00:12:29,307 --> 00:12:30,577
Have you eaten?

148
00:12:31,236 --> 00:12:32,506
Have you?

149
00:12:33,647 --> 00:12:34,707
What was that?

150
00:12:34,707 --> 00:12:37,616
She went to the restroom. She'll be back soon.

151
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:44,957
Excuse me for a second.

152
00:12:47,827 --> 00:12:49,927
You can continue chatting. They'll be back soon.

153
00:12:49,927 --> 00:12:52,126

156
00:13:12,317 --> 00:13:14,447
I don't know what to do.

157
00:13:16,417 --> 00:13:17,486
I understand.

158
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:20,386
What should you do?

159
00:13:22,897 --> 00:13:25,327
I'll tell them that you're feeling ill. Go home first.

160
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:28,327
Excuse me.

161
00:14:29,226 --> 00:14:31,327

162
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:32,996
Sorry?

I saw something interesting.

174
00:16:07,486 --> 00:16:08,856
I wasn't meaning to.

175
00:16:10,027 --> 00:16:11,327

00:17:37,316 --> 00:17:38,516
- Keep singing. - No.

185
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:39,587
Turn that off.

186
00:17:39,587 --> 00:17:41,246
- Okay, okay. - Turn it off.

187
00:17:41,246 --> 00:17:42,617
- Turn it off. - You punk.

188
00:17:42,617 --> 00:17:43,687
You squirrel.

189
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:44,786
- Sing it now. - Erase it.

190
00:17:44,786 --> 00:17:47,187
- Is it impossible - Is it impossible

191
00:17:47,187 --> 00:17:48,556
You have to pout your lips like this.

192
00:17:48,556 --> 00:17:50,056
For you

193
00:17:50,056 --> 00:17:52,996
- To accept my love? - You sound just like him.

194
00:17:52,996 --> 00:17:55,427
- You sounded just like that singer. - You sing it too.

195
00:17:55,427 --> 00:17:56,437
Sing it now.

196
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:10,677
There was nothing there.

197
00:18:11,246 --> 00:18:13,347
You were deceived by Yang Chul Ki.

198
00:18:41,347 --> 00:18:42,976
What did you want to talk about?

199
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,786
Goodness, look at you.

200
00:18:46,786 --> 00:18:48,687
You're still upset.

201
00:18:49,457 --> 00:18:50,457
I'm sorry.

202
00:18:53,627 --> 00:18:55,226
Then, explain everything to me.

203
00:18:55,226 --> 00:18:56,496
Make me understand.

204
00:18:56,496 --> 00:18:57,556
Okay.

205
00:18:58,256 --> 00:18:59,796
Let's have dinner first.

206
00:19:00,326 --> 00:19:02,097
And I need to introduce you to someone too.

207
00:19:23,857 --> 00:19:26,627
Hello, I've heard a lot about you from my father.

208
00:19:27,857 --> 00:19:29,296
Isn't this your first time meeting him in person?

209
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:31,226
I see. You're Dae Jin.

210
00:19:31,357 --> 00:19:32,627
I've only seen your photos.

211
00:19:32,627 --> 00:19:34,296
I can't recognize you now in person.

212
00:19:34,597 --> 00:19:37,097
He moved back to Korea for good after graduating from law school.

213
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:38,466
Nice to meet you.

214
00:19:38,796 --> 00:19:40,207
I've heard a lot about you too.

215
00:19:42,506 --> 00:19:44,976
Let's eat. There's something we must discuss too.

216
00:19:49,816 --> 00:19:52,016
If you moved back to Korea for good,

217
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:53,147
will you work at a law firm?

218
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:55,887
Tae Kyung.

219
00:19:56,516 --> 00:19:58,016
Take Dae Jin under your wings.

220
00:19:58,516 --> 00:20:00,087
- What? - He graduated...

221
00:20:00,087 --> 00:20:01,457
from Stanford Law School with honors.

222
00:20:01,457 --> 00:20:02,957
He's pretty smart.

223
00:20:03,657 --> 00:20:05,496
I want you to teach him.

224
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:09,066
I'm not that bright,

225
00:20:09,066 --> 00:20:10,837
but I'm pretty resolute when I set my mind to something.

226
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:14,837
I won't be lazy. I'll do my best.

227
00:20:34,056 --> 00:20:36,097
There are other big law firms like Inchang.

228
00:20:36,097 --> 00:20:37,697
Why are you sending him to me?

229
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:39,927
I'll set him up with a good law firm.

230
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:43,066
He graduated from Stanford. He can work at any law firms.

231
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:44,837
I can't trust the other law firms.

232
00:20:47,036 --> 00:20:48,867
You're the only one whom I can trust in this world.

233
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:50,437
I can't send him somewhere else.

234
00:20:51,407 --> 00:20:52,576
You know me.

235
00:20:56,177 --> 00:20:58,647
I don't want him to be a great lawyer.

236
00:20:59,587 --> 00:21:01,447
Even if he doesn't do anything,

237
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:03,957
I'll make sure that...

238
00:21:04,587 --> 00:21:06,826
no one can touch my son for the rest of his life.

239
00:21:09,157 --> 00:21:10,857
Here I come.

240
00:21:11,256 --> 00:21:13,526
- Hello. - You jerk. Come over here.

241
00:21:16,296 --> 00:21:18,197
Apology?

242
00:21:18,937 --> 00:21:21,966
My son is at the top of his class.

243
00:21:23,036 --> 00:21:25,377
Your son ran into my son who was reading a book.

244
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:26,907
My son lost his concentration,

245
00:21:26,907 --> 00:21:29,617
so he ruined his exams. Got that?

246
00:21:30,316 --> 00:21:31,847
You're not going to do anything?

247
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,816
What? No surgery for your son's leg?

248
00:21:34,286 --> 00:21:36,286
If you apologize to the kids,

249
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:38,756
I will pay for the surgery and medical bills.

250
00:21:39,387 --> 00:21:41,056
Kneel down and apologize right now.

251
00:21:41,587 --> 00:21:43,496
Only that will pacify them.

252
00:21:44,397 --> 00:21:45,996
My son can't go to sleep at night...

253
00:21:45,996 --> 00:21:48,566
when he thinks about how he ruined his exams.

254
00:21:50,036 --> 00:21:51,036
Dad.

255
00:21:51,837 --> 00:21:52,907
Don't do it.

256
00:21:54,137 --> 00:21:56,006
I didn't do anything wrong.

257
00:21:56,306 --> 00:21:57,907
What nonsense is he talking about?

258
00:21:58,236 --> 00:21:59,546
You're going to lose your leg.

259
00:21:59,546 --> 00:22:00,806
Why wouldn't he apologize?

260
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:02,877
You have no money for your surgery.

261
00:22:06,687 --> 00:22:08,986
You participated in the democracy movement.

262
00:22:09,256 --> 00:22:11,587
Let us give you a piece of advice as dads,

263
00:22:11,587 --> 00:22:14,286
not as a prosecutor or an assemblyman.

264
00:22:14,857 --> 00:22:16,657
You failed to protect your own son.

265
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:18,796
But you tried to change the world.

266
00:22:18,996 --> 00:22:22,326
You're only acting pretentious and chasing your ideals.

267
00:22:22,496 --> 00:22:24,667
You should just keep working at your job.

268
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:27,607
If you want him to get surgery so that he can walk again,

269
00:22:28,337 --> 00:22:30,306
apologize to the kids right now.

270
00:22:39,486 --> 00:22:40,486
Dad.

271
00:22:42,347 --> 00:22:43,486
Don't do it.

272
00:22:46,326 --> 00:22:47,457
Don't.

273
00:22:50,226 --> 00:22:51,226
Don't.

274
00:22:51,597 --> 00:22:53,766
Don't do it. Dad, don't.

275
00:22:54,796 --> 00:22:56,367
Dad, don't do it!

276
00:22:56,566 --> 00:22:59,097
Don't do it. Don't.

277
00:22:59,097 --> 00:23:00,736
Dad, don't do it.

278
00:23:00,736 --> 00:23:01,907
Don't do it.

279
00:23:02,776 --> 00:23:03,976
Don't do it.

280
00:23:05,276 --> 00:23:06,276
Don't...

281
00:23:10,877 --> 00:23:12,647
What they said was correct.

282
00:23:14,117 --> 00:23:16,216
I couldn't even protect my own son.

283
00:23:21,887 --> 00:23:23,927
But you had no choice back then.

284
00:23:25,357 --> 00:23:27,526
Failing to protect someone means you're incompetent.

285
00:23:27,927 --> 00:23:29,296
I decided it then.

286
00:23:30,197 --> 00:23:31,496
I decided not to be...

287
00:23:31,496 --> 00:23:33,707
an incompetent dad who couldn't even take care of his own son.

288
00:23:35,266 --> 00:23:36,337
Tae Kyung.

289
00:23:37,937 --> 00:23:40,107
You're the only person who could protect Dae Jin...

290
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:42,347
in place of me.

291
00:23:43,516 --> 00:23:44,746
I don't trust anyone.

292
00:24:47,046 --> 00:24:48,407
I'll work him hard.

293
00:24:48,407 --> 00:24:49,776
I won't go easy on him.

294
00:24:53,316 --> 00:24:54,947
Work him like a slave.

295
00:24:59,157 --> 00:25:00,657
What I told you is true.

296
00:25:01,657 --> 00:25:03,326
I didn't want...

297
00:25:03,326 --> 00:25:05,496
to trouble either Jungjin or you.

298
00:25:06,397 --> 00:25:08,266
I thought it would be okay if I told you...

299
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:09,897
when they withdraw the lawsuit.

300
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:13,667
Besides, there's no reason for me to hide it from you.

301
00:25:16,837 --> 00:25:17,907
I'm sorry.

302
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:21,407
I must have considered this information as too trivial.

303
00:25:30,816 --> 00:25:33,256
Is this your first time dealing with Tak Soo Ho then?

304
00:25:34,387 --> 00:25:35,387
It's my first time.

305
00:25:36,157 --> 00:25:38,097
We met at several business meetings here and there.

306
00:25:38,097 --> 00:25:40,496
We just knew each other's name. That's about it.

307

Woo Yong.

308
00:25:45,736 --> 00:25:48,167
Then, let's not take this case.

309
00:25:48,607 --> 00:25:50,337
I have a bad feeling about this guy.

310
00:25:50,937 --> 00:25:53,377
He offered me the deal for Contra Building in Cheongdam-dong.

311
00:25:54,476 --> 00:25:57,147
If we wrap up this case nicely,

312
00:25:57,147 --> 00:25:58,677
we can build...

313
00:25:59,246 --> 00:26:01,687
a 150-story building in the heart of Gangnam.

314
00:26:04,957 --> 00:26:06,486
It's what we've always been doing.

315
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:07,857
It's business.

316
00:26:23,837 --> 00:26:26,046
I don't need to worry about Lee Tae Kyung, right?

317
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:46,466
Mr. Nam.

318
00:26:47,066 --> 00:26:48,897
Can you find out something for me?

319
00:26:50,296 --> 00:26:51,296
Yes.

320
00:26:52,566 --> 00:26:53,937
I will take care of that.

323
00:27:41,016 --> 00:27:43,486
It looks like the eye damage is severe.

324
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,417
Let's go there.

325
00:27:46,857 --> 00:27:49,187
Are you going to the hospital yourself?

326
00:27:51,457 --> 00:27:52,597
Do you think...

327
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:56,296
the victim went completely blind?

I really don't know what he might do.

333
00:29:11,036 --> 00:29:12,377
Thank you...

334
00:29:13,476 --> 00:29:15,907
for visiting me here yourself.

335
00:29:17,847 --> 00:29:19,177
Don't mention it.

336
00:29:20,647 --> 00:29:21,746
Of course, I should do that.

337
00:29:22,986 --> 00:29:26,087
I couldn't give anything to drink because my brother isn't around.

338
00:29:26,087 --> 00:29:27,286
I'm sorry.

339
00:29:30,526 --> 00:29:32,697
It's okay. Don't mind me.

340
00:29:39,566 --> 00:29:40,837
Are you in a lot of pain?

341
00:29:41,536 --> 00:29:42,937
Should I call the nurse?

342
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:47,306
No, I'm fine.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry that you're in so much pain.

345
00:30:04,197 --> 00:30:06,056
It makes me worried to see you suffer so much.

346
00:30:21,447 --> 00:30:22,506
Anyway.

347
00:30:24,576 --> 00:30:25,776
Did you go...

348
00:30:31,716 --> 00:30:33,026
completely blind?

00:30:37,097 --> 00:30:40,627

00:32:55,427 --> 00:32:57,496
Do you want both of us to go down?

366
00:32:57,496 --> 00:32:59,536
Then should I make a formal request?

367
00:32:59,536 --> 00:33:01,207
Is there something you want?

368
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:03,536
Something I want? I might sound funny to you.

369
00:33:03,937 --> 00:33:05,076
The truth.
