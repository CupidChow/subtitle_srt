00:00:02,063 --> 00:00:03,662
(Episode 16)

2
00:00:28,422 --> 00:00:30,892
(Lee Tae Kyung)

3
00:00:49,642 --> 00:00:52,172
Woo Yong, I was stabbed by a knife.

4
00:00:52,542 --> 00:00:53,782
You should come and visit me.

5
00:00:55,012 --> 00:00:56,012
Are you okay?

6
00:00:58,212 --> 00:00:59,482
Come and see for yourself.

7
00:01:17,902 --> 00:01:19,273
- Are you sure? - Yes.

8
00:01:19,273 --> 00:01:20,643
I checked with the hospital.

9
00:01:22,102 --> 00:01:23,973
Lee Tae Kyung was stabbed by a knife?

10
00:01:26,072 --> 00:01:28,042
Chairman Song, you tried very hard.

11
00:01:43,732 --> 00:01:45,033
Go see the doctor...

12
00:01:45,732 --> 00:01:47,303
and find out how Tae Kyung is doing.

13
00:02:29,603 --> 00:02:31,673
What is this?

14
00:02:32,073 --> 00:02:33,983
People bring fruit baskets and such...

15
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:35,613
when they visit people at the hospital.

16
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:37,113
You brought nothing?

17
00:02:40,353 --> 00:02:41,553
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:46,953 --> 00:02:48,092
Are you all right?

19
00:02:48,763 --> 00:02:50,062
Are you really worried about me?

20
00:03:09,712 --> 00:03:11,083
Tae Ju was...

21
00:03:12,382 --> 00:03:14,853
a killer at singing "Mona Lisa".

22
00:03:16,553 --> 00:03:19,692
I wanted to listen to that song very badly today.

23
00:03:24,062 --> 00:03:28,303
Will you really

24
00:03:28,902 --> 00:03:32,132
Refuse to accept my love?

25
00:03:34,442 --> 00:03:36,372
My Mona Lisa

26
00:03:37,173 --> 00:03:38,613
Mona Lisa

27
00:03:39,673 --> 00:03:43,083
You make me sad

28
00:03:52,993 --> 00:03:53,993
Tae Kyung.

29
00:03:57,993 --> 00:04:00,132
Ask me what you really want to know.

30
00:04:04,432 --> 00:04:06,073
You want to ask me something.

31
00:04:08,303 --> 00:04:09,303
Woo Yong.

32
00:04:11,173 --> 00:04:13,673
I thought about what to ask all night long.

33
00:04:15,182 --> 00:04:17,582
But no matter how much I think about this,

34
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:20,053
I couldn't understand.

35
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:23,122
You wouldn't do that to me.

36
00:04:26,993 --> 00:04:28,062
There was...

37
00:04:29,923 --> 00:04:31,562
a reason why I had to...

38
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,562
I will...

39
00:04:34,033 --> 00:04:35,502
look for the reason myself, Woo Yong.

40
00:04:37,163 --> 00:04:38,173
I will ask you the right questions,

41
00:04:39,072 --> 00:04:40,642
one after the other.

42
00:04:43,673 --> 00:04:44,743
So...

43
00:04:45,872 --> 00:04:48,043
don't get caught lying to me.

44
00:05:12,572 --> 00:05:13,733
Are you all right, sir?

45
00:05:15,502 --> 00:05:16,603
I think Lee Tae Kyung...

46
00:05:16,603 --> 00:05:18,012
How's his wound?

47
00:05:18,913 --> 00:05:20,642
It wasn't deep. He'll recover from it.

48
00:05:21,382 --> 00:05:22,882
There weren't any other injuries?

49
00:05:24,382 --> 00:05:25,413
Sir.

50
00:05:28,853 --> 00:05:30,452
He'll close in on you now.

51
00:05:31,093 --> 00:05:32,392
You must take care of him now.

52
00:05:34,463 --> 00:05:36,192
Are you giving me advice?

53
00:06:04,223 --> 00:06:06,692
(Type in your message.)

54
00:06:14,363 --> 00:06:15,803
(Lee Tae Kyung, Untitled)

55
00:06:23,973 --> 00:06:25,142
What's this photo?

56
00:06:25,142 --> 00:06:28,582
Compare the stab wound with the one on the victim of Mount Uhwa case...

57
00:06:28,582 --> 00:06:31,812
and the Choi Soo Jeong case from seven years ago, too.

58
00:06:31,812 --> 00:06:33,353
Check if it was done by the same guy.

59
00:06:33,483 --> 00:06:34,622
Did you find that jerk?

60
00:06:35,522 --> 00:06:38,192
I'm not sure yet. Compare the wound first.

61
00:06:38,192 --> 00:06:39,252
By the way,

62
00:06:40,322 --> 00:06:41,663
who got stabbed?

63
00:06:42,993 --> 00:06:44,233
Let me know when you get the result.

64
00:07:06,713 --> 00:07:07,822
Can't sleep?

65
00:07:10,723 --> 00:07:11,993
Do you want a glass?

66
00:07:29,142 --> 00:07:30,142
Cheers.

67
00:07:38,613 --> 00:07:39,882
Is something worrying you?

68
00:07:40,682 --> 00:07:41,752
No.

69
00:07:43,223 --> 00:07:44,353
How's work?

70
00:07:46,822 --> 00:07:48,892
You don't need to hide it from me when things are tough.

71
00:07:50,163 --> 00:07:52,332
I can just tell by looking into your eyes.

72
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:02,043
It's just about the company.

73
00:08:06,772 --> 00:08:08,283
Can't you retire now?

74
00:08:09,243 --> 00:08:11,113
You can go fishing and hiking.

75
00:08:12,812 --> 00:08:15,952
You've been living such a diligent life.

76
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:18,892
I'm not sure.

77
00:08:21,122 --> 00:08:22,922
I do think I lived a diligent life,

78
00:08:25,132 --> 00:08:26,933
but it might not have been a proper life.

79
00:08:38,743 --> 00:08:40,983
Excuse me. It's my friend from the States.

80
00:08:47,012 --> 00:08:48,152
Hey, Brian.

81
00:08:49,522 --> 00:08:50,683
How is it going?

82
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:21,052
You are one stubborn guy.

83
00:09:22,122 --> 00:09:25,453
You know? You got stabbed, but no one was here for your surgery.

84
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:27,723
How could you be so...

85
00:09:27,723 --> 00:09:28,892
Aren't I so independent?

86
00:09:31,162 --> 00:09:33,933
You didn't give Chairman Song a call either?

87
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:37,463
He came by yesterday.

88
00:09:40,943 --> 00:09:44,343
What on earth is happening with Jang Young Mi's case?

89
00:09:45,073 --> 00:09:48,782
It has something to do with your brother's death, right?

90
00:09:49,713 --> 00:09:50,912
I think so,

91
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:53,353
but I don't have concrete evidence.

92
00:09:53,953 --> 00:09:56,823
Well, how about asking Chairman Song for help?

93
00:09:56,823 --> 00:09:59,693
I think he'll be able to solve this problem very quickly.

94
00:10:02,162 --> 00:10:04,632
I should solve my own problems, you know?

95
00:10:05,162 --> 00:10:06,292
I'm not a kid.

96
00:10:07,532 --> 00:10:08,532
Let's go.

97
00:10:08,532 --> 00:10:09,802
Okay.

98
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,922
Mr. Nam, please book me an appointment with Reporter Hong...

99
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:31,193
from Chorim Daily.

100
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:33,693
You're going back to work right away?

101
00:10:34,122 --> 00:10:35,522
Let's go to the office now.

102
00:10:37,493 --> 00:10:38,532
Gosh.

103
00:10:41,463 --> 00:10:43,502
(Seo Yeon Ah)

104
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:45,632
Yes.

105
00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:49,272
Sit down.

106
00:10:57,142 --> 00:10:58,483
Where did you get this photo?

107
00:10:59,453 --> 00:11:00,752
Is it the same method?

108
00:11:02,652 --> 00:11:04,022
Who got stabbed?

109
00:11:05,022 --> 00:11:06,823
And any other leads?

110
00:11:06,953 --> 00:11:08,463
Anyone who uses the same method and has previous convictions?

111
00:11:08,463 --> 00:11:10,162
Who is it that got stabbed?

112
00:11:21,743 --> 00:11:22,743
Let me see.

113
00:11:25,243 --> 00:11:26,613
What are you doing?

114
00:11:27,372 --> 00:11:28,412
Let me see.

115
00:11:29,943 --> 00:11:30,943
Gosh.

116
00:11:33,252 --> 00:11:35,823
Mr. Nam, he got stabbed recently, didn't he?

117
00:11:37,052 --> 00:11:38,093
Yes.

118
00:11:38,693 --> 00:11:39,693
No.

119
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,002
Yes. He did.

120
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:56,203
He got stabbed alone and had surgery alone.

121
00:11:56,443 --> 00:11:58,313
He's a very independent man.

122
00:11:58,512 --> 00:11:59,613
Go on.

123
00:12:14,122 --> 00:12:15,262
Are you all right?

124
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:17,292
Shouldn't you stay at the hospital?

125
00:12:17,422 --> 00:12:18,493
I'm fine.

126
00:12:19,463 --> 00:12:20,593
What about the result from the National Forensics Service?

127
00:12:27,032 --> 00:12:29,302
(National Forensics Service)

128
00:12:30,943 --> 00:12:31,943
The method is very similar to the one...

129
00:12:31,943 --> 00:12:33,372
from Jang Entertainment's murder case.

130
00:12:33,743 --> 00:12:35,983
The perpetrator avoided the vital points which means he's a pro.

131
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:38,813
But their conclusion was that it's completely different...

132
00:12:38,813 --> 00:12:40,282
from the murder case seven years ago.

133
00:12:40,782 --> 00:12:42,382
I'm sure Yang Chul Ki was the killer.

134
00:12:46,953 --> 00:12:49,262
(A report on requested analyzation)

135
00:12:49,522 --> 00:12:50,762
It was Cho Hyun Woo, wasn't it?

136
00:12:58,473 --> 00:12:59,933
You're not going to answer me?

137
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:02,402
That jerk has Jang Young Mi with him.

138
00:13:03,002 --> 00:13:04,042
Where is he?

139
00:13:05,943 --> 00:13:07,142
I really don't know.

140
00:13:08,313 --> 00:13:10,542
I followed him thinking I'd find her, but he got me.

141
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:11,953
Why did you assume that?

142
00:13:11,953 --> 00:13:13,882
You must've followed him for a reason.

143
00:13:21,193 --> 00:13:23,122
Are you trying to protect Chairman Song now?

144
00:13:24,122 --> 00:13:27,802
Cho Hyun Woo and Chairman Song are involved in Jang Young Mi's case...

145
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:29,603
and your brother's death too.

146
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,872
You have the files for the Jang Entertainment case...

147
00:13:40,113 --> 00:13:41,542
and the Mount Uhwa case, right?

148
00:13:49,323 --> 00:13:50,483
Are you insane?

149
00:13:50,483 --> 00:13:52,593
If we release articles that Cho Hyun Woo is a suspect,

150
00:13:52,593 --> 00:13:54,252
do you think he'll let Jang Young Mi live?

151
00:13:55,093 --> 00:13:56,723
You don't know what he'll do once he gets riled up.

152
00:13:56,723 --> 00:13:59,162
If we don't pressure him, he won't show himself.

153
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,693
It's not like we have any leads.

154
00:14:00,693 --> 00:14:02,103
Don't you know the basics for abduction cases?

155
00:14:02,103 --> 00:14:04,333
If we provoke Cho Hyun Woo, Jang Young Mi will be in danger.

156
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,473
This case isn't like other abduction cases.

157
00:14:06,973 --> 00:14:08,902
He doesn't want money. There are no demands.

158
00:14:10,002 --> 00:14:13,313
Once she has the public's attention, he can't harm her at all.

159
00:14:15,412 --> 00:14:16,813
If things get complicated,

160
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,683
they might kill Jang Young Mi and pin it on Cho Hyun Woo.

161
00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:22,282
They wrapped up the case by cutting off Yang Chul Ki that time.

162
00:14:22,453 --> 00:14:25,122
I'm sure you know Cho Hyun Woo isn't acting alone.

163
00:14:30,892 --> 00:14:32,032
If we don't,

164
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:34,802
we'll never find Jang Young Mi.

165
00:14:58,922 --> 00:15:01,022
Dad. Dad.

166
00:15:01,963 --> 00:15:04,292
Why did you come all the way here and not call?

167
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:05,993
You must be busy.

168
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:07,662
Did you have dinner?

169
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:13,302
Dad.

170
00:15:14,402 --> 00:15:15,943
I need some money.

171
00:15:17,703 --> 00:15:19,512
To get something nice to eat...

172
00:15:19,642 --> 00:15:21,042
and concentrate on my investigation.

173
00:15:21,882 --> 00:15:23,882
You can be so silly.

174
00:15:36,193 --> 00:15:37,292
Thank you.

175
00:15:37,892 --> 00:15:39,433
Do you have any concerns?

176
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:41,162
I mean...

177
00:15:42,363 --> 00:15:45,073
A kidnapper doesn't ask for a ransom,

178
00:15:45,302 --> 00:15:46,573
doesn't want anything,

179
00:15:46,573 --> 00:15:48,302
and I can't even identify him.

180
00:15:48,843 --> 00:15:50,542
I need a lead if I'm to...

181
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:52,542
You must put pressure on him.

182
00:15:52,772 --> 00:15:54,912
Use your official authority.

183
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:58,353
Like the media?

184
00:15:58,752 --> 00:16:01,953
What if he harms the victim?

185
00:16:01,953 --> 00:16:03,823
The rule of investigating abduction cases is to keep quiet.

186
00:16:03,823 --> 00:16:07,122
The internet has a huge influence these days.

187
00:16:07,752 --> 00:16:09,662
The environment has changed,

188
00:16:09,662 --> 00:16:12,292
but is it right to still go by the same principles?

189
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:13,733
Think about that.

190
00:16:17,032 --> 00:16:19,502
Is that what you think too, Prosecutor Seo?

191
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:23,672
Make the public act like police and pressure the criminal.

192
00:16:23,672 --> 00:16:24,912
A prosecutor...

193
00:16:25,372 --> 00:16:27,443
must stick to their own conviction.

194
00:16:27,672 --> 00:16:29,243
Not others' opinions.

195
00:16:31,412 --> 00:16:32,412
Of course.

196
00:16:32,983 --> 00:16:35,823
Would you like to have some killer cold bean soup noodles?

197
00:16:36,152 --> 00:16:37,683
I had dinner.

198
00:16:37,683 --> 00:16:39,823
You can consider it a snack.

199
00:16:40,622 --> 00:16:41,922
It's on me.

200
00:16:55,772 --> 00:16:57,002
What are you doing?

201
00:16:58,012 --> 00:16:59,873
What with the camera footage,

202
00:16:59,873 --> 00:17:01,383
I've been helping you out.

203
00:17:01,983 --> 00:17:03,683
You're quite selfish.

204
00:17:03,683 --> 00:17:04,752
I gave you the stab wound.

205
00:17:04,752 --> 00:17:05,752
You got me to find out...

206
00:17:05,752 --> 00:17:07,213
what the National Forensics Service thought.

207
00:17:07,852 --> 00:17:09,822
I really hate you now.

208
00:17:10,782 --> 00:17:12,153
What do you want?

209
00:17:13,393 --> 00:17:14,393
First,

210
00:17:16,062 --> 00:17:17,062
smile a bit.

211
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:20,262
You're too rigid.

212
00:17:20,262 --> 00:17:21,862
I can't negotiate like this.

213
00:17:22,403 --> 00:17:24,802
Smile. Relax a bit.

214
00:17:27,802 --> 00:17:28,802
Good.

215
00:17:29,143 --> 00:17:30,903
Is Chairman Song connected to Jang Young Mi?

216
00:17:32,673 --> 00:17:34,072
He's not.

217
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,743
Really?

218
00:17:37,913 --> 00:17:39,413
Then I'll get going.

219
00:17:39,582 --> 00:17:41,052
I really don't know.

220
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:43,223
I followed him, saw him with Cho Hyun Woo,

221
00:17:43,223 --> 00:17:44,893
followed Cho Hyun Woo, and got stabbed.

222
00:17:51,532 --> 00:17:53,933
I'm putting my life on the line giving you this.

223
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:57,633
Find Jang Young Mi.

224
00:18:00,173 --> 00:18:01,173
Okay.

225
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:15,752
Tae Kyung met Seo Yeon Ah as soon as he got discharged.

226
00:18:17,623 --> 00:18:18,693
Okay.

227
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:27,733
(Vice-Chairman Tak Soo Ho)

228
00:18:28,532 --> 00:18:31,473
I admire you so much.

229
00:18:33,173 --> 00:18:35,002
I thought you adored Lee Tae Kyung,

230
00:18:35,002 --> 00:18:36,302
but you got him stabbed.

231
00:18:38,173 --> 00:18:41,312
But then, this is the cleanest solution, isn't it?

232
00:18:41,842 --> 00:18:44,143
The methanol lawsuit and Jang Entertainment.

233
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:47,052
We'll be able to solve it right away if we get rid of Lee Tae Kyung.

234
00:18:48,082 --> 00:18:51,123
The Jang Entertainment case caused a huge ripple.

235
00:18:51,522 --> 00:18:55,262
That's why Tae Kyung got involved.

236
00:18:56,993 --> 00:18:58,022
So what?

237
00:18:58,022 --> 00:19:00,993
I want to help you protect Jungjin Group.

238
00:19:01,663 --> 00:19:03,532
Be cautious so that things...

239
00:19:03,963 --> 00:19:05,403
don't get any worse.

240
00:19:08,943 --> 00:19:11,572
It's been a while since anyone gave me advice.

241
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:15,812
So...

242
00:19:21,183 --> 00:19:24,183
sort it out before things get worse.

243
00:19:24,752 --> 00:19:26,653
You know where she is.

244
00:19:27,752 --> 00:19:29,022
The Jang Entertainment girl.

245
00:19:30,463 --> 00:19:32,633
I don't know at all.

246
00:19:35,463 --> 00:19:38,302
You said Tae Kyung got involved because of Jang Entertainment.

247
00:19:40,832 --> 00:19:42,403
If that's why you scared him,

248
00:19:43,502 --> 00:19:45,213
shall I clean it up?

249
00:19:46,673 --> 00:19:48,983
The lawsuit got me quite annoyed.

250
00:19:54,883 --> 00:19:55,983
This is good.

251
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:12,733
What is it?

252
00:20:13,532 --> 00:20:14,532
Expenses.

253
00:20:16,873 --> 00:20:20,072
What article do you want me to write?

254
00:20:20,413 --> 00:20:23,082
Contact all the online media outlets you know.

255
00:20:23,082 --> 00:20:24,812
I want the article up tomorrow.

256
00:20:24,812 --> 00:20:26,953
- Can you get into the web portals? - Yes.

257
00:20:27,052 --> 00:20:30,383
Make sure to leave out Ilsin Daily.

258
00:20:30,383 --> 00:20:32,552
What is it that's so large-scale?

259
00:20:32,552 --> 00:20:34,552
Just post as many as you can every day.

260
00:20:34,653 --> 00:20:37,163
I don't care if the news is fake or just gossip.

261
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:38,663
Use what's in there...

262
00:20:38,663 --> 00:20:40,393
and make it as scandalous as possible.

263
00:20:40,393 --> 00:20:43,262
Put the emphasis on the suspect.

264
00:21:04,552 --> 00:21:07,623
About Jang Young Mi's two missing diaries.

265
00:21:07,623 --> 00:21:08,623
Did you find them?

266
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,762
I asked the people around her and got nothing.

267
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:14,292
Is there anyone in Jang Entertainment?

268
00:21:14,532 --> 00:21:16,362
I don't want to agitate President Jang,

269
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:18,102
so we're working quietly,

270
00:21:18,102 --> 00:21:19,733
but we have nothing so far.

271
00:21:22,643 --> 00:21:23,873
It's open.

272
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:25,772
Where are you?

273
00:21:25,772 --> 00:21:28,042
Namwon Restaurant. I'll call you later.

274
00:21:39,052 --> 00:21:41,292
- Loach soup, please. - Sure.

(Namwon Restaurant)

276
00:23:29,433 --> 00:23:31,733
Hey. Do Hoon Jae was alone.

277
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:34,002
But there were definitely 3 or 4.

278
00:23:34,173 --> 00:23:36,072
Was Jang Young Mi or Jung Hae Jin there?

279
00:23:36,072 --> 00:23:37,072
I didn't ask...

280
00:23:37,072 --> 00:23:38,973
in case the owner's in cahoots.

281
00:23:38,973 --> 00:23:40,612
But I don't think Jang Young Mi...

282
00:23:40,612 --> 00:23:43,282
and Jung Hae Jin met them here.

283
00:23:43,282 --> 00:23:45,483
If we find Jang Young Mi's missing diaries,

284
00:23:46,012 --> 00:23:48,282
we'll be able to find out why she was there that day.

285
00:23:48,582 --> 00:23:50,383
Did you get anything from her diary?

286
00:23:50,453 --> 00:23:51,522
Not yet.

287
00:23:52,123 --> 00:23:53,493
I'll tell you if I do.

288
00:23:54,022 --> 00:23:55,022
Okay.

Woo Yong, I saw something interesting in the articles.

301
00:25:07,262 --> 00:25:08,602
Are you feeling all right?

302
00:25:09,602 --> 00:25:11,233
You should have stayed at the hospital for a few more days.

303
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:20,342
I came because I was curious about something.

304

What would your face look like after reading this article?

("A Key Suspect of the Abduction of a Rookie Actress")

306
00:25:38,362 --> 00:25:41,393
When you bring up a wolf cub,

307
00:25:42,862 --> 00:25:45,502
the cub thinks of the human as its mother,

308
00:25:46,673 --> 00:25:48,743
and will not follow anything else.

309
00:25:49,772 --> 00:25:50,873
However,

310
00:25:51,873 --> 00:25:54,012
when the wolf grows up...

311
00:25:54,312 --> 00:25:56,483
and begins to show its teeth,

312
00:25:58,282 --> 00:26:00,082
the human must make a decision.

313
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:11,522
Will you keep living with a wolf who has the teeth of the wilderness?

314
00:26:11,693 --> 00:26:12,733
Or...

315
00:26:17,502 --> 00:26:19,802
will you kill it and take its skin?

316
00:26:31,812 --> 00:26:36,022
It'll follow you for a long time, but it won't follow you forever.

317
00:26:38,752 --> 00:26:41,123

If I get stuck here,

323

I can't continue to ask you what I want to ask.

00:33:33,873 --> 00:33:36,203
You brother was called in by Chairman Song.

370
00:33:36,203 --> 00:33:38,673
The video was not supposed to get exposed to the world,

371
00:33:38,673 --> 00:33:40,413
but someone did it.

372
00:33:40,413 --> 00:33:42,582
Who do you think killed Tae Ju?

373
00:33:42,582 --> 00:33:43,683
He was such a nice kid.

374
00:33:43,683 --> 00:33:46,213
You're here. This is your favorite restaurant.

375
00:33:46,683 --> 00:33:48,312
Do you still have nothing to say to me?
