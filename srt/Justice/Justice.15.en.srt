It's him, isn't it?

00:01:10,495 --> 00:01:11,855
The guy who killed your brother.

19
00:01:14,795 --> 00:01:16,126
Bring him back.

20
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:18,596
Bring him back alive, you murderers!

21
00:01:20,236 --> 00:01:22,066
You trash. I'll kill all of you.

22
00:01:22,736 --> 00:01:24,435
This isn't the law!

23
00:01:26,906 --> 00:01:28,445
Do you remember anything?

24
00:01:31,646 --> 00:01:33,846
I think he definitely took Jang Young Mi away.

25
00:02:02,346 --> 00:02:03,346

On paper, it says, this jerk, Cho Hyun Woo,

38
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:23,235
went off to the Philippines based on his medical condition.

39
00:06:23,235 --> 00:06:25,805
And there's no record of his entry back to Korea since then.

40
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:27,136
Any traces in Korea?

41
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:29,875
There's no medical, financial, criminal, entry,

42
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,716

43
00:06:31,716 --> 00:06:32,875
What about drugs?

44
00:06:33,245 --> 00:06:36,216
Well, it looked like he vanished from that circle too.

45
00:06:36,286 --> 00:06:38,716
Since it's a close circle, I would find out once I looked into it,

46
00:06:38,716 --> 00:06:40,656
but oddly, it's too clean.

47
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:42,855
Either he quit drugs...

48
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:45,255
or someone from that circle is helping him out.

49
00:06:45,396 --> 00:06:47,226
But there's no lead.

50
00:06:47,495 --> 00:06:50,795
I gave them my number in case he resurfaces.

51
00:06:52,196 --> 00:06:54,766
By the way, this jerk, Cho Hyun Woo...

52
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:58,206
Why do you think he took Jang Young Mi?

53
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:04,875
I found the recent footage on Jang Young Mi.

54
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:07,516
Let me see.

55
00:07:10,286 --> 00:07:12,255
I got this from Jang Entertainment's company vehicle.

56
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:14,386
I went to the location in the dashcam footage.

57
00:07:14,386 --> 00:07:15,456
Something is odd.

58
00:07:16,555 --> 00:07:18,295
It's a restaurant alley in Jongno.

59
00:07:18,295 --> 00:07:19,526
Jang Young Mi was there.

60
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,826
Aren't they Jang Chi Soo and the new actress, Jung Hae Jin?

61
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:25,536
They were with her.

62
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:28,336
There's only one surveillance camera in this alley.

63
00:07:28,536 --> 00:07:29,665
I got this footage from there.

64
00:07:30,235 --> 00:07:32,776
But on the same day, Chairman Song was here too.

65
00:07:39,245 --> 00:07:41,516
Jang Young Mi and Chairman Song came here on July 16.

66
00:07:42,185 --> 00:07:44,685
Chairman Song went to Namwon Restaurant.

67
00:07:45,485 --> 00:07:47,156
If she came with Jang Chi Soo...

68
00:07:47,786 --> 00:07:49,286
Does it mean Jang Young Mi was there for work?

69
00:07:49,286 --> 00:07:51,526
As a matter of fact, I did check it with Jang Chi Soo.

70
00:07:52,026 --> 00:07:53,526
He said they went there for a meal.

71
00:07:53,925 --> 00:07:56,266
But do you really think he'd tell the truth?

72
00:07:56,396 --> 00:07:59,766
Wait. Isn't that our Prosecutor General?

73
00:08:01,706 --> 00:08:03,206
That's the president from Ilsin Daily.

74
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:05,276
And he's the Director of the National Tax Service.

75
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:08,776
I guess the Prosecutor General meets Chairman Song in private.

76
00:08:08,976 --> 00:08:11,315
On July 29, Chairman Song, President of Ilsin Daily,

77
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:13,776
and Public Prosecutor General came to this restaurant.

78
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,115
Namwon Restaurant.

79
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:21,786
Is that a hideout for the VIPs?

80
00:08:24,226 --> 00:08:26,056
On the day Jang Young Mi went there,

81
00:08:26,056 --> 00:08:27,666
where did Chairman Song go after this?

82
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:33,735
He stayed at the restaurant for 30 minutes and left first.

83
00:08:33,735 --> 00:08:34,966
What about the rest?

84
00:08:36,605 --> 00:08:37,706
After Chairman Song left,

85
00:08:37,706 --> 00:08:39,605
they left the restaurant an hour and a half later.

86
00:08:39,605 --> 00:08:41,206
What about Jang Chi Soo and Jang Young Mi?

87
00:08:41,206 --> 00:08:42,576
That's the odd part.

88
00:08:43,946 --> 00:08:45,916
I saw it on the footage that Jang Chi Soo left...

89
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,946
after 30 minutes to the alley where he came in.

90
00:08:47,946 --> 00:08:49,485
But no sights of Jang Young Mi and Jung Hae Jin.

91
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,255
There must be another exit.

92
00:08:52,456 --> 00:08:53,515
I'm checking on it.

93
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:55,826
- Mr. Guk, contact Jung Hae Jin. - Yes.

94
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,395
Keep Jang Chi Soo out of the picture too.

95
00:08:57,655 --> 00:08:58,655
Okay.

96
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,395
Chairman Song and Jang Young Mi.

97
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,765
Is it a coincidence they went there on the same day?

98
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,196
Excuse me.

99
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,605
I'm inside.

100
00:10:18,706 --> 00:10:20,676
Excuse me. Is anyone out there?

101
00:10:30,645 --> 00:10:31,985
I'm inside!

102
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:35,285
Excuse me. Excuse me!

103
00:10:37,326 --> 00:10:38,556
Come out!

104
00:10:39,395 --> 00:10:40,796
Come out, you jerk!

105
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,995
Come out! Come out here!

106
00:10:49,735 --> 00:10:52,936
Come out, you jerk!

107
00:11:11,226 --> 00:11:12,255
Yes.

108
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:16,265
Okay. I'll be there soon.

109
00:11:29,806 --> 00:11:31,615
By the way, you've never been here with Chairman Song?

110
00:11:32,476 --> 00:11:33,476
Never.

111
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:36,216
(Namwon Restaurant)

112
00:11:38,985 --> 00:11:41,885
When I asked around, they don't regularly open the restaurant.

113
00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:43,456
I'll check it out at night too.

114
00:11:46,296 --> 00:11:48,365
So Jang Young Mi didn't come to this restaurant?

115
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,365
No, she didn't. It's true that she did pass by this restaurant.

116
00:11:51,365 --> 00:11:53,035
That's the last of her whereabouts.

117
00:11:53,995 --> 00:11:56,066
That's the only surveillance camera in this alley.

118
00:11:56,735 --> 00:11:59,505
I asked restaurants around here, but no one remembers.

119
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,235
I even checked out this part too,

120
00:12:27,235 --> 00:12:28,966
but it's all empty because it's a redevelopment area.

121
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:36,245
Did Cho Hyun Woo come to the restaurant or this alley before?

122
00:12:37,005 --> 00:12:38,076
No.

123
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,416
Does Cho Hyun Woo have ties to Chairman Song?

124
00:12:45,655 --> 00:12:46,855
He does, doesn't he?

125
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:16,716
Woo Yong, about that jerk who was blamed in our place...

126
00:13:17,985 --> 00:13:19,615
for the incident at the cabin seven years ago.

127
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:21,485
Was his name Cho Hyun Woo? Where is he now?

128
00:13:22,956 --> 00:13:25,355
You got him out after eight months in prison for medical treatment.

129
00:13:25,355 --> 00:13:27,155
Didn't you say that you handled him in the Philippines?

130
00:13:27,796 --> 00:13:28,926
Why do you ask that all of a sudden?

131
00:13:29,196 --> 00:13:30,726
But that jerk is alive.

132
00:13:34,505 --> 00:13:35,605
What do you mean?

133
00:13:38,706 --> 00:13:40,306
I heard it from Prosecutor Seo.

134
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,645
They found Cho Hyun Woo's fingerprints from a crime scene...

135
00:13:43,645 --> 00:13:45,015
of Jang Entertainment's murder case.

136
00:13:47,816 --> 00:13:48,816
Fingerprints?

137
00:13:48,816 --> 00:13:50,515
That's why she came to see me.

138
00:13:51,985 --> 00:13:53,015
When she looked into the case, she found out...

139
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:54,855
he was the defendant of my brother's death.

140
00:13:55,186 --> 00:13:57,186
She asked me if my brother's death seven years ago had...

141
00:13:57,186 --> 00:14:00,196
anything to do with the murder of the actress from Jang Entertainment.

142
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,365
Did she locate him?

143
00:14:06,995 --> 00:14:08,035
No, not yet.

144
00:14:10,905 --> 00:14:13,306
Seo Yeon Ah's looking for him?

145
00:14:18,046 --> 00:14:19,115
He won't...

146
00:14:19,816 --> 00:14:23,145
get caught and tell everything we did, will he?

147
00:14:25,015 --> 00:14:26,015
Woo Yong.

148
00:14:26,556 --> 00:14:28,826
I think we must find him first.

149
00:15:24,245 --> 00:15:26,245
They found Cho Hyun Woo's fingerprints from a crime scene...

150
00:15:26,245 --> 00:15:27,676
of Jang Entertainment's murder case.

151
00:15:53,576 --> 00:15:54,576
Is everything okay?

152
00:17:57,396 --> 00:17:58,995
Call me with this now.

153
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,466
Don't call unless it's urgent.

154
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,265
Be wary when you're out.

155
00:18:07,176 --> 00:18:08,406
Is something wrong?

156
00:18:10,376 --> 00:18:12,216
A prosecutor's looking for you.

157
00:18:12,515 --> 00:18:13,845
Jang Young Mi...

158
00:18:13,845 --> 00:18:15,686
got things a bit complicated.

159
00:18:19,716 --> 00:18:21,386
I hate things that are complicated.

160
00:18:45,146 --> 00:18:46,245
How is she?

161
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,386
Well...

162
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,315
How long will it take her to die?

163
00:18:52,785 --> 00:18:54,726
You can't kill her this time.

164
00:18:55,585 --> 00:18:57,726
If something happens, call me.

165
00:19:00,495 --> 00:19:01,495
She's pretty.

166
00:19:02,696 --> 00:19:04,065
The girl this time.

167
00:21:28,575 --> 00:21:30,176
Why are you following me?

168
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,676
Where's Jang Young Mi?

169
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:41,956
Why did you kill my brother?

170
00:21:45,025 --> 00:21:47,055
Who made you do that, you jerk?

171
00:21:48,595 --> 00:21:49,726
Do you want to know...

172
00:21:50,696 --> 00:21:52,265
where Jang Young Mi is?

173
00:22:22,696 --> 00:22:23,765
My gosh.

174
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,406
Darn you.

175
00:23:00,035 --> 00:23:03,906
(Call log)

176
00:23:14,275 --> 00:23:15,416
What is it?

177
00:24:03,726 --> 00:24:06,966
You built a 20-story building in the center of Gangnam?

178
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:10,366
You thought I was joking, didn't you?

179
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:13,636
You thought I was a joke.

180
00:24:13,876 --> 00:24:16,745
Yes, I thought you were showing off way too much...

181
00:24:16,745 --> 00:24:20,275
when you were actually running a tiny little construction business.

182
00:24:20,345 --> 00:24:21,916
Or I thought you were a fraud.

183
00:24:22,345 --> 00:24:24,845
- Darn you. - That's gross. You took a bite.

184
00:24:28,686 --> 00:24:31,585
Woo Yong, my dear Chairman Song. I should really give you my trust.

185
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:33,295
You don't know a thing about me.

186
00:24:34,156 --> 00:24:35,626
Don't trust anyone that easily.

187
00:24:37,696 --> 00:24:39,735
Well, you're right about that.

188
00:24:41,095 --> 00:24:42,235
Woo Yong, after...

189
00:24:43,906 --> 00:24:45,376
about 10 years,

190
00:24:46,075 --> 00:24:49,805
let's build up a 150-story building in the middle over there.

191
00:24:50,075 --> 00:24:51,106
Can you do that?

192
00:24:52,015 --> 00:24:53,315
You crazy idiot.

193
00:24:53,315 --> 00:24:54,545
Why not? Are you scared?

194
00:24:55,186 --> 00:24:58,015
We should remember this day. Let's take a picture.

195
00:24:58,245 --> 00:24:59,815
Forget it. We aren't kids.

196
00:24:59,815 --> 00:25:02,555
Learn to live young like kids, you old fogey.

197
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,186
Come here.

198
00:25:08,226 --> 00:25:09,726
Stop eating.

199
00:25:10,726 --> 00:25:14,466
All right. In 1, 2, 3.

200
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,335
Will you show a smile?

201
00:25:18,035 --> 00:25:20,206
In 1, 2, 3.

202
00:25:21,005 --> 00:25:22,005
Good.

203
00:25:30,745 --> 00:25:33,116
Come to think about it, we aren't drinking on a day like this.

204
00:25:39,995 --> 00:25:42,095
Single malt is the best with jjajangmyeon.

205
00:25:42,095 --> 00:25:44,966
Why do you like single malt so much?

206
00:25:54,005 --> 00:25:55,035
Here.

207
00:25:59,545 --> 00:26:03,745
All right, now. To Chairman Song Woo Yong!

208
00:26:09,656 --> 00:26:10,926
Gosh, that's bitter.

209
00:26:12,356 --> 00:26:13,726
Why do you like this so much?

210
00:26:13,726 --> 00:26:14,755
Hey.

211
00:26:15,666 --> 00:26:16,866
Come on, have some.

212
00:26:17,565 --> 00:26:19,136
- Eat up. - Fine.

213
00:27:41,616 --> 00:27:44,146
(Calling)

214
00:27:51,186 --> 00:27:54,795
(Calling)

215
00:28:01,535 --> 00:28:02,565
Chairman Song, it's me.

216
00:28:03,235 --> 00:28:05,376
What happened? What's this phone?

217
00:28:06,406 --> 00:28:08,476
Lee Tae Kyung just came after me.

218
00:28:10,476 --> 00:28:11,545
Okay.

219
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:13,545
Be careful for a while.
