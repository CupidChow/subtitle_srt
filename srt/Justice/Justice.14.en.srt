1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,631
Okay. Cheers.

2
00:00:02,431 --> 00:00:03,560
(Episode 14)

3
00:00:05,931 --> 00:00:07,001
Hey.

4
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:09,541
Jungjin's methanol case is...

5
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:11,940
the hottest issue right now.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,470
Do take care of it.

7
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,810
Goodness.

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,111
Ilsin Daily has...

9
00:00:18,381 --> 00:00:21,821
ten different press outlets including online news media.

10
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:24,521
If all the daily papers and online news media...

11
00:00:24,521 --> 00:00:28,191
continue to pump out articles on this,

12
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,091
the foolish public will...

13
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:32,460
easily get brainwashed.

14
00:00:32,591 --> 00:00:34,901
You're my most reassuring support.

15
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:36,930
I will make sure I repay you.

16
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,131
Come on.

17
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,271
Anyway,

18
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,971
I thought you were in an awkward relationship with Jungjin,

19
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,341
and you're asking me to write up good articles about them.

20
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,251
You are a true man of business.

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,450
I'm trying to make a living.

22
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,221
My gosh.

23
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:01,861
Goodness.

24
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,131
That's why I want to ask you for a favor too,

25
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,760
but I feel too bad.

26
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,331
There's a guy named Choi Joon Gil.

27
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,870
He's the chief judge...

28
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,801
of Jungjin's case...

29
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,600
and my friend from the training institute.

30
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:18,510
My gosh, thank you.

31
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,210
I'm not trying to play any games,

32
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:22,980
but I'm sure Jungjin will...

33
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,680
have the upper hand in this case.

34
00:01:25,811 --> 00:01:27,620
There isn't enough evidence.

35
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:30,051
We'll do this fairly by the law.

36
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:35,490
You need to make your way into the Blue House...

37
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:37,930
by becoming the Minister of Justice,

38
00:01:38,561 --> 00:01:40,600
then into the master bedroom of that place.

39
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,271
I'll help you with everything I can.

40
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,131
Come on.

41
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,771
All right.

42
00:01:50,771 --> 00:01:51,771
Okay.

43
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:56,081
I'm sure I will have to ask you for many more favors.

44
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,081
I should serve you well.

45
00:01:58,881 --> 00:01:59,881
- Goodness. - Cheers.

46
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,621
Now that we got enough energy,

47
00:02:09,221 --> 00:02:13,290
why don't we work out a little?

48
00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:16,931
In that case, please excuse me. I have to do something.

49
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,741
I hope you have a great time.

50
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,651
Should we go as well?

51
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,621
All right, then. Let's go.

52
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:01,540
Sir.

53
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:03,540
I don't think we'll be able...

54
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,610
to find the whereabouts of that vehicle.

55
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,181
Prosecutor Seo already requested...

56
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:09,781
for all footages in the area and even those...

57
00:03:09,781 --> 00:03:12,621
used for crime preventions.

58
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,691
(Prosecutor's Office, Seo Yeon Ah)

59
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,760
We've obtained all the footages from the highways.

60
00:03:23,061 --> 00:03:24,330
We'll look into them now.

61
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,741
But there are too many eyes on us, so I don't think...

62
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,670
we should do this at the police station.

63
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,140
I'll lend you my place.

64
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,871
I don't see anywhere else that's safer.

65
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,080
All right.

66
00:03:35,211 --> 00:03:36,841
What about Jang Chi Soo's dashcam footage?

67
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,711
Did he meet her that day?

68
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:39,781
Yes, but they only talked...

69
00:03:39,781 --> 00:03:42,350
for 10 minutes or so and parted ways.

70
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,350
There was nothing much I could get out of it,

71
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,991
so I'm looking through dashcam footages...

72
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:47,661
from other vehicles that are owned by that agency.

73
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,061
I see.

74
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:51,860
Right. Did you check her call log?

75
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:54,401
I did, but she only talked with her grandmother...

76
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,860
and people from work.

77
00:03:56,031 --> 00:03:58,031
Their alibis checked out.

78
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,730
The message she sent...

79
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:03,800
to Lawyer Lee Tae Kyung is the strangest.

80
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,871
I think Lawyer Lee's brother...

81
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,611
is related to Choi Soo Jeong's murder.

82
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,450
You're right.

83
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,280
During the murder at Ahyeon-dong,

84
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,791
a delivery man visited Soo Jeong's home.

85
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,351
And he died a mysterious death the day after.

86
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,090
That delivery man was Lawyer Lee's brother.

87
00:04:23,421 --> 00:04:26,631
Did he die because of the Ahyeon-dong Murder Case?

88
00:04:27,631 --> 00:04:28,960
I'm not sure yet.

89
00:04:29,431 --> 00:04:33,171
But seeing what Young Mi wrote,

90
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:34,640
I think so.

91
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:44,611
One second.

92
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,320
What is it?

93
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:58,760
We took them.

94
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,900
Why should I show them to you?

95
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,700
You wanted to know about the USB.

96
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,671
What are you doing?

97
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,410
Seven years ago,

98
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,611
Young Mi and my brother met.

99
00:05:53,181 --> 00:05:55,921
Yang Chul Ki probably received the USB from that day.

100
00:05:56,921 --> 00:05:59,351
So what is this other USB that Young Mi had?

101
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,260
I don't know. She disappeared right after texting me.

102
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,361
Seven years ago, Soo Jeong was supposed...

103
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:09,931
to receive the USB, but she died.

104
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,270
And this time, Young Mi saw what was in it and disappeared.

105
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:17,200
Who sent that USB to Soo Jeong?

106
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:21,681
I looked into it, and the identity was fabricated.

107
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:23,381
It was sent discreetly.

108
00:06:27,251 --> 00:06:30,121
Does that mean the culprit took the USB and the diary?

109
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,820
The diary?

110
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,921
Young Mi's diary from seven years ago disappeared.

111
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:39,291
I'm certain she wrote about the Ahyeon-dong Murder Case.

112
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,131
I don't think Young Mi took it.

113
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:49,101
It's probably the one who kidnapped Young Mi.

114
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:50,970
That person took both her diary and the USB.

115
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:53,441
Does this case have...

116
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,010
any similarities to the Mount Uhwa Murder Case?

117
00:06:58,811 --> 00:06:59,881
No.

118
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,760
Could they be the same culprit?

119
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,160
(Woo Yong)

120
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,330
(Woo Yong)

121
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:20,830
(Woo Yong)

122
00:07:33,881 --> 00:07:35,820
Did you find anything suspicious about Chairman Song?

123
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,320
No.

124
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:50,061
Why did these innocent girls get killed?

125
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,131
I can't seem to put my finger on the motive.

126
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,150
Hey.

127
00:08:10,481 --> 00:08:13,450
I was nearby. You didn't pick up, so I just came in.

128
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,421
Did you call me? I guess I was too busy.

129
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:18,590
Sit down.

130
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:25,670
I think you two were talking about something important.

131
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:27,701
You know Jang Young Mi, right?

132
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:29,701
She was involved in that incident with Director Do's son.

133
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,770
She suddenly disappeared.

134
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:35,440
Since Lawyer Lee was present during her trial,

135
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,711
I asked him some questions.

136
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,111
You're working so hard.

137
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,881
I ought to.

138
00:08:41,081 --> 00:08:43,221
I need to do everything I can to catch the culprit.

139
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,851
Please help me out.

140
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:48,321
Sure.

141
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,461
Bye.

142
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,140
I didn't know you were this close.

143
00:09:05,471 --> 00:09:07,211
Well, we're not strangers.

144
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,140
Manager Choi told me...

145
00:09:10,581 --> 00:09:11,951
that he ran into you at Jang Entertainment.

146
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:15,881
I wanted to ask Young Mi something,

147
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:17,751
but she disappeared.

148
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,420
By the way, why was he there?

149
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,361
To consult regarding the company's magazine model.

150
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:25,760
Why would he do it instead of the PR team?

151
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,231
He's acquainted with them.

152
00:09:28,331 --> 00:09:29,501
Is he?

153
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:37,170
Be careful. Jang Entertainment seems fishy.

154
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,571
Several of their actresses died.

155
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:41,481
Who knows? Young Mi could also be one of them.

156
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,851
Do you know what's odd?

157
00:09:47,081 --> 00:09:48,780
Why didn't that issue arise even once?

158
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,390
That's exactly why I'm concerned about Prosecutor Seo.

159
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,690
I'm worried she'll keep digging...

160
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,030
and end up putting herself at risk.

161
00:10:02,731 --> 00:10:04,571
It's none of our business, anyway.

162
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:23,050
Prosecutor Seo is closing in on the Jang Entertainment case?

163
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:26,550
That'll be fascinating.

164
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,131
I think we should use Seo Dong Suk this time.

165
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:36,930
If we don't hurry, we'll be in danger.

166
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:40,601
I guess you've failed to find out her weakness.

167
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,940
Mr. Seo is an old acquaintance of my father's.

168
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,381
I've known him since I was young.

169
00:10:50,481 --> 00:10:51,510
But...

170
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,481
I never liked his gaze.

171
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,851
It was as if he could...

172
00:11:00,221 --> 00:11:01,260
see through me.

173
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:16,971
("Court Battle over Methanol Poison, the Lawyer Is Feeling Confident")

174
00:11:16,971 --> 00:11:21,581
("Court Battle over Methanol Poison, the Lawyer Is Feeling Confident")

175
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:47,371
You must recover, sir.

176
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,270
I owe you...

177
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,040
so much.

178
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,780
I beg you.

179
00:11:58,711 --> 00:11:59,751
I don't know...

180
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,851
I don't know what he'll do.

181
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,491
Please keep him close...

182
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:14,900
and...

183
00:12:17,101 --> 00:12:20,101
take care of him, Prosecutor Seo.

184
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:22,071
Who are they?

185
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:27,170
I knocked, but you didn't answer. What had all of your attention?

186
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,540
The boy in that photo. Who is he?

187
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:30,881
You don't need to know.

188
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,881
Is he my half brother you've been hiding from me?

189
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,390
The files you requested for the hearing.

190
00:12:41,091 --> 00:12:43,821
Do you need to submit files on Jungjin for the hearing?

191
00:12:43,821 --> 00:12:45,961
It's late. Go home.

192
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,930
It's been less than 10 minutes since I got here.

193
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:51,770
You always tell me to leave.

194
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,770
Oh, right.

195
00:12:55,101 --> 00:12:56,101
Here.

196
00:12:56,971 --> 00:12:59,010
I've put together unsolved missing cases.

197
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,071
All of the victims were women in their early 20s.

198
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,851
Find a common ground why those became cold cases.

199
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,251
I'm so lucky to have you as my dad.

200
00:13:10,881 --> 00:13:12,091
I'm leaving now.

201
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,321

204
00:13:42,451 --> 00:13:44,650
Hello, Lawyer Lee Tae Kyung sent me here.

205
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,221
Prosecutor Seo already told me.

206
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,520
Let's hurry. We don't have much time.

207
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,071
We must finish this before the evening.

208
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,770
You were quite a runner that day at Cheonggye Stream.

209
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,310
Hello. Why don't we introduce ourselves first?

210
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,810
Ma Dong Hyuk from Gangnam Police Station.

211
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,940
31 years old.

212
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,381
Do you want to know my blood type too? It's type B.

213
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:13,711
Hello, Detective Ma Dong Seok...

214
00:14:13,711 --> 00:14:16,121
No, Detective Ma Dong Hyuk. Nice to meet you.

215
00:14:16,451 --> 00:14:17,451
Blood type B.

216
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:19,751
Let's see.

217
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,091
Okay.

218
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:33,400
They went to Yangpyeong from Dongjak Bridge.

219
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,841
From this point on, they went out of Seoul.

220
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,701
I can't find them on the footages.

221
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:38,711
Of course, he kidnapped the girl.

222
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,140
It would take a long time to check out...

223
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,640
all the possible routes.

224
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:45,150
We must finish before this evening.

225
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,091
(I saw what's in the USB. I know why Soo Jeong and your brother died.)

226
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,260
It's probably the one who kidnapped Young Mi.

227
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:06,530
That person took both her diary and the USB.

228
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,711
You said her diary from seven years ago is missing, right?

229
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,341
One from seven years ago. And this year's diary too.

230
00:15:17,341 --> 00:15:18,410
Why do you ask?

231
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,010
How many diaries were there in total?

232
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,451
- 11. - The culprit didn't take them.

233
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:25,550
The culprit would have taken all of them...

234
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,190
because he wouldn't have known what was in the diaries.

235
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,121
- So what then? - Bring all of her diaries.

236
00:15:45,741 --> 00:15:46,810
What's your plan?

237
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,180
I'll explain it later.

238
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:03,260
What's all this?

239
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,091
Jang Young Mi's diaries.

240
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:07,831
So what?

241
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,060
Why did you bring them here?

242
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:17,071
Read it.

243
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:22,881
(President Jang got drunk and touched So Eun's thigh.)

244
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,881
(When she moved away from him, he slapped her.)

245
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,520
She wrote crazy stuff in here.

246
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:34,420
She kept her diary very diligently.

247
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:37,961
What does that have to do with me?

248
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,430
Seven years ago,

249
00:16:40,591 --> 00:16:42,660
you guys committed something unimaginable.

250
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:44,631
It was all written in her diary.

251
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,371
You killed people because of the USB.

252
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:01,351
If the content of the diary gets disclosed,

253
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,521
it looks like that will be the end of your lives.

254
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,690
You're bluffing.

255
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,801
Why don't you test me to see if I'm bluffing or not?

256
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:19,101
If you don't send Jang Young Mi back right away,

257
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,841
the diaries will be public knowledge.

258
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,950
I even checked her handwriting.

259
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,920
He even knew about the USB.

260
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,950
What did Lawyer Lee say about the USB?

261
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:42,460
Because of the USB,

262
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:45,190
people died.

263
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:46,930
I think he knows everything.

264
00:17:47,261 --> 00:17:48,331
Please help me.

265
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm about to go down for this.

266
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,170
When you met Jang Young Mi that day,

267
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:54,601
she didn't say anything else?

268
00:17:55,101 --> 00:17:56,740
I don't know why,

269
00:17:57,101 --> 00:17:58,341
but she was scared to death.

270
00:17:58,341 --> 00:18:00,410
She cried and threw a fit that she wouldn't go back.

271
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:03,011
But...

272
00:18:05,381 --> 00:18:06,881
where is Jang Young Mi?

273
00:18:09,581 --> 00:18:10,821
President Jang.

274
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,821
What are you saying?

275
00:18:13,821 --> 00:18:16,291
I can't go down for something I didn't even do.

276
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,960
He said everything was written in that diary.

277
00:18:18,761 --> 00:18:20,261
Then, I'll tell everything...

278
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,980
What should I do?

279
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,990
We must check what he knows...

280
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,261
for sure.

281
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,170
Wait, hold on.

282
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:06,771

283
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,740
Okay.

Is it?

287
00:19:17,021 --> 00:19:18,821
Yes, it is.

take care of this task? No?

295

298
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,801

00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:29,351
I don't think she will.

366
00:26:32,021 --> 00:26:35,121
There's probably a reason why she couldn't return until now.

367
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:40,761
That's something I must find out, so I'll do that.

368
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,400
I'll find out why she didn't return.

369
00:26:43,261 --> 00:26:47,101
You can't expose the truth with personal journal entries.

370
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,500
I'm sure you know that as a lawyer.

371
00:26:57,811 --> 00:26:59,051
What do they...

372
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:03,021
want to hide so badly at the expense of erasing someone's life?

373
00:27:08,051 --> 00:27:09,690
I thought you already knew.

374
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,150
I found nothing much.

375
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,321
I was just trying to see if Jang Chi Soo was the culprit.

376
00:27:45,761 --> 00:27:47,131
I didn't know you would come.

377
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,281
The background check based on the cigarette's fingerprint.

378
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:15,990
Thank you.

379
00:28:37,811 --> 00:28:38,851
Goodness.

380
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,611
Hello.

381
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,281
Hey, Prosecutor Seo...

382
00:28:54,831 --> 00:28:57,031
The background check based on the cigarette's fingerprint.

383
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,230
(Analysis Result)

384
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,871
I found the alibi of everyone else...

385
00:29:03,101 --> 00:29:04,470
except for one person.

386
00:29:07,611 --> 00:29:08,980
It's someone you know.

388
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:24,521
(Cho Hyun Woo)

(Match, match, match)

392
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,980
I heard this jerk died.

393
00:29:44,111 --> 00:29:45,140
It's him, isn't it?

394
00:29:47,381 --> 00:29:48,650
The guy who killed your brother.

395
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,750
Bring him back.

396
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,420
Bring him back alive, you murderers!

397
00:29:57,091 --> 00:29:58,990
You trash. I'll kill all of you.

398
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,390
This isn't the law!

399
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,400
Do not forget...

400
00:30:04,061 --> 00:30:07,400
what I did for you today.

401
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,771
(Justice)

402
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,781
Why do you think Cho Hyun Woo took Jang Young Mi with him?

403
00:30:51,781 --> 00:30:54,680
Woo Yong, about that jerk who was blamed in our place,

404
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,521
Cho Hyun Woo or something, right? He's still alive.

405
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,150
It's a restaurant street in Jongno. Jang Young Mi was there,

406
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,220
and so was Chairman Song.

407
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,890
You know where the girl from Jang Entertainment is.

408
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,521
Does Chairman Song have a connection with Cho Hyun Woo?

409
00:31:05,521 --> 00:31:06,861
You wouldn't do that to me.

410
00:31:06,861 --> 00:31:09,900
When you bring up a wolf cub,

411
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,131
you must make a decision.

412
00:31:11,131 --> 00:31:12,831
Will you keep living with him?

413
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:14,930
Or will you kill him and take his skin?

414
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,470
Why did you kill my brother?

415
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,341
Who told you to do it?
