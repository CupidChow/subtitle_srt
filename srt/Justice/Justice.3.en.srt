Delivery. Are you in?

4
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:14,458
Do you know this guy?

5
00:01:18,068 --> 00:01:19,129
I'm asking you.

6
00:01:21,538 --> 00:01:22,898
Do you know him, you jerk?

7
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:33,419
Darn it.

8
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:36,818
How should I know who he is?

9
00:01:36,818 --> 00:01:38,288
A delivery man who was at a murder scene...

10
00:01:38,288 --> 00:01:39,749
died the next day in a car accident.

11
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:42,558
Are you sure this has nothing to do with you?

12
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,189
You guys are driving me insane.

13
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:47,398
Does that make any sense?

14
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:50,269
Does it?

15
00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:02,609
It doesn't. Does it?

That's my seat.

19
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:29,639
Despite the solid evidence, it became a cold case.

20
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,338
Seven years have passed,

21
00:02:33,338 --> 00:02:35,278
but we're still getting pressured not to investigate it.

22
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:37,748
This isn't a simple murder case.

23
00:02:38,678 --> 00:02:40,319
What does that have to do with me?

24
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:42,878
Perhaps, your brother...

25
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,718
could've been a witness of Yang Chul Ki's murder.

26
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:50,188
He was murdered the day after he visited the crime scene.

27
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:54,628
That accident might not have been a coincidence.

28
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:56,058
That's impossible.

29
00:02:57,069 --> 00:02:58,169
It was an accident.

30
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:00,838
The assailants were evident, and the ruling was given.

31
00:03:03,868 --> 00:03:04,908
Why didn't you tell me...

32
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:07,778
about your brother?

33
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:11,808
Why did I have to?

34
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,678
What did you say?

35
00:03:47,378 --> 00:03:48,579
A settlement?

36
00:03:48,748 --> 00:03:50,188
Why should I?

37
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,019
I'm just trying to help you.

38
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:55,319
The assailants are from wealthy families.

39
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,859
So you're telling me to accept Tae Ju's wrongful death?

40
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,829
Since they're from wealthy families?

41
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,229
Since I won't win the trial?

42
00:04:03,468 --> 00:04:05,599
I heard you passed the bar exam.

43
00:04:06,568 --> 00:04:10,109
You'll soon be working in this field as well.

44
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:12,539
No. I will never do that.

45
00:04:13,578 --> 00:04:15,678
So relay my message to the scumbags.

46
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:18,649
Tell them to come here immediately,

47
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:20,678
kneel, and ask my brother for forgiveness.

48
00:04:22,318 --> 00:04:23,719
If not,

49
00:04:25,549 --> 00:04:26,589
tell them I'll kill them.

50
00:04:31,388 --> 00:04:34,959
This DUI case occurred on November 21, 2012,

51
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,768
at 5:30am,

52
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:41,198
at Mullae-dong, Yeongdeungpo-gu.

53
00:04:41,438 --> 00:04:44,839
Lee Tae Ju, a delivery man, died in the accident.

54
00:04:45,438 --> 00:04:48,438
Defendants Kang Ho Young, Koo Dae Hwan,

55
00:04:48,438 --> 00:04:50,149
and Jo Yeon Woo will be given the following verdicts.

56
00:04:51,008 --> 00:04:52,808
According to Article 3, Clause 1...

57
00:04:52,808 --> 00:04:54,049
of Act on Special Cases concerning the Settlement of Traffic Accidents,

58
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:56,049
I declare them innocent.

59
00:04:56,448 --> 00:04:58,818
According to Article 268 of the Criminal Code,

60
00:04:58,818 --> 00:04:59,849
I declare them innocent.

61
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:03,888
According to Article 44, Clause 1 of the Road Traffic Act,

62
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:05,258
I acknowledge a part of the crime.

63
00:05:05,428 --> 00:05:09,998
Defendants Kang Ho Young, Koo Dae Hwan, and Jo Yeon Woo...

64
00:05:09,998 --> 00:05:11,229
will be sentenced to eight months in prison,

65
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:13,498
and a year and six months of probation.

66
00:05:13,638 --> 00:05:15,498
They'll be fined 6,000 dollars,

67
00:05:15,498 --> 00:05:18,438
and they'll perform community service for 81 days.

68
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,448
Shouldn't they pay...

69
00:05:32,388 --> 00:05:34,359
according to what's right?

70
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,558
An innocent boy died, yet you declared this...

71
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:38,558
an accidental homicide?

72
00:05:38,828 --> 00:05:40,258
81 days of community service?

73
00:05:40,859 --> 00:05:43,428
How was this accidental? How?

74
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:46,268
Are you smiling?

75
00:05:46,938 --> 00:05:47,969
What's wrong with him?

76
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,669
- Bring my brother back! - You shouldn't do this.

77
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,479
You. I'll kill you all.

78
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,709
You can't do this.

79
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:57,349
How is this the law?

80
00:05:57,349 --> 00:05:59,349
Let me go! Let me go!

81
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:00,948
Let me go!

82
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:04,318
Come here. Come here!

83
00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:06,089
Come here right now!

84
00:06:07,518 --> 00:06:08,818
You scumbags.

00:07:38,609 --> 00:07:39,779
Hey, Tae Kyung.

90
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:25,359
You're fearless.

91
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:27,498
You haven't changed.

92
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:30,059
Aren't you scared to come here alone so late at night?

93
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:31,298
Even the light was off.

94
00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:33,268
I'm not.

95
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:36,538
I wish her ghost would appear and tell me...

96
00:08:36,668 --> 00:08:38,439
what happened that night.

97
00:08:39,638 --> 00:08:42,878
I chose the right person to hand this case over to.

98
00:08:44,309 --> 00:08:47,979
Oh, right. You asked me for the delivery man's call log.

99
00:08:48,748 --> 00:08:50,589
Did he call the victim?

100
00:08:51,918 --> 00:08:55,158
During the accident, his phone was destroyed.

101
00:08:55,158 --> 00:08:56,989
It wasn't in the list of lost articles either.

102
00:08:56,989 --> 00:08:58,089
It's been way too long, so the telecommunication company...

103
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:00,128
doesn't have any records left either.

104
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:02,829
His number wasn't canceled though.

105
00:09:03,258 --> 00:09:05,368
The phone was re-registered under his older brother's name.

106
00:09:06,628 --> 00:09:08,138
His older brother?

107
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:12,069
They couldn't keep the number under a deceased's name.

108
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:19,079
I looked through the past two years' worth of call logs.

109
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:21,579
But it was never used.

110
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:26,788
We couldn't find the victim's phone either, right?

111
00:09:26,788 --> 00:09:28,288
The culprit probably took it.

112
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:31,788
And her number was canceled a few hours after the murder.

113
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:34,929
I'm sure there was some crucial information in it.

114
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:41,038
The delivery man came to the crime scene...

115
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:43,199
and got into an accident the day after.

116
00:09:50,778 --> 00:09:52,109
You ran out of side dishes, right?

117
00:09:52,979 --> 00:09:54,248
Goodness.

118
00:09:54,648 --> 00:09:57,849
You've been giving me food for the past several years.

119
00:09:57,849 --> 00:09:59,788
I ought to do it until the day I die.

120
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:03,018
You were my mentor when I first joined this line of work.

121
00:10:06,788 --> 00:10:08,758
I heard your wife's ill.

122
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,268
Make sure you eat well.

123
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:15,398
All right. Thank you for the food.

124
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,719
What do you mean?

125
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:39,258
Yang Chul Ki seems suspicious.

126
00:10:41,998 --> 00:10:43,128
Yang Chul Ki?

127
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:47,839
My brother had visited the crime scene seven years ago...

128
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,199
when Chul Ki committed the murder.

129
00:10:50,739 --> 00:10:52,609
And the day after, my brother got into an accident.

130
00:10:53,538 --> 00:10:55,579
Are you saying he's related to your brother's accident?

131
00:10:57,248 --> 00:10:58,908
But it doesn't make any sense.

132
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,449
My brother died in a DUI incident.

133
00:11:03,148 --> 00:11:04,719
And those scumbags who caused the accident were...

134
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:08,189
Remember?

135
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:18,028
It's a coincidence.

136
00:11:18,768 --> 00:11:19,929
That can't be.

137
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:21,599
You're probably right.

138
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,109
But...

139
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:27,309
he smiled.

140
00:11:27,878 --> 00:11:28,878
That jerk smiled.

141
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:31,548
I saw it clearly.

142
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:33,819
You met this delivery man...

143
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,248
on the day of her murder.

144
00:11:37,888 --> 00:11:40,118
For some reason, it's been bothering me.

145
00:11:40,118 --> 00:11:43,059
I will look into Yang Chul Ki.

146
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:45,459
No. I will look into him myself.

147
00:11:47,658 --> 00:11:48,658
I'll get going.

148
00:11:50,229 --> 00:11:51,668
What will that change?

149
00:11:56,969 --> 00:11:58,439
Even if you find out more about this,

150
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:02,038
our decision won't be...

151
00:12:06,248 --> 00:12:07,778
Right. It's probably a coincidence.

152
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:09,219
Forget about it.

153
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:14,689
But Woo Yong,

154
00:12:17,758 --> 00:12:20,258
why are you trying to get Yang Chul Ki out?

155
00:12:28,168 --> 00:12:29,798
Forget I asked. I'm leaving.

156
00:13:07,908 --> 00:13:09,479
Even if you find out more about this,

157
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:11,849
our decision won't be...

158
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:14,079
What will that change?

159
00:13:17,418 --> 00:13:18,949
Report this.

160
00:13:19,689 --> 00:13:20,959
Jerk.

161
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:24,128
Darn it. Is this your first time seeing someone die?

162
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:27,859
Do a better job filming this.

163
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:44,849
(You've passed the final round of the 53rd Bar Exam.)

164
00:14:53,778 --> 00:14:55,418
Are you planning to kill them?

165
00:15:02,288 --> 00:15:04,788
At times like this, there are only two options.

166
00:15:05,888 --> 00:15:07,189
Either you forgive them...

167
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,128
or get back at them.

168
00:15:11,298 --> 00:15:12,298
Who are you?

169
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,038
After you kill them, are you planning...

170
00:15:16,368 --> 00:15:18,439
to end your life as well?

171
00:15:29,349 --> 00:15:30,989
What choice do I have?

172
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:35,288
I've tried everything I could, but it's not working.

173
00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:37,729
My little brother faced a wrongful death.

174
00:15:38,128 --> 00:15:39,729
But the law is a load of trash, and those jerks...

175
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:41,758
aren't sorry for what they've done to my brother at all.

176
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:44,028
What else could I do now?

177
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,729
Do exactly what they did to you.

178
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:49,668
However, you should do that...

179
00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:53,038
without hurting yourself.

180
00:15:53,038 --> 00:15:54,038
That's how you...

181
00:15:55,378 --> 00:15:56,878
take your revenge.

182
00:16:04,018 --> 00:16:05,148
I've been wondering...

183
00:16:06,349 --> 00:16:08,258
if I could help you out...

184
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:13,528
as long as...

185
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:16,128
you can give me what I want.

186
00:17:07,518 --> 00:17:15,159
(Namwon Restaurant)

187
00:18:03,598 --> 00:18:05,008
(Surveillance cameras from Seohwa Villa)

188
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:08,578
(Yang Chul Ki)

189
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,848
(7 previous convictions, Yang Chul Ki)

190
00:18:23,788 --> 00:18:24,929
Oh, right. Detective Kang.

191
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:49,219
Hey!

192
00:18:49,548 --> 00:18:50,619
My partner!

193
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:52,018
Goodness.

194
00:18:52,588 --> 00:18:53,788
If you're drunk,

195
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:55,758
just go home like a good boy.

196
00:18:56,358 --> 00:18:57,518
Have you gone mad?

197
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,758
Do you know how much the cab would cost to Ilsan?

198
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:03,498
Were you looking into the unsolved case again before you left?

199
00:19:04,298 --> 00:19:06,828
Come on. That case is so obvious.

200
00:19:06,998 --> 00:19:08,338
Why do you think a pretty girl got murdered?

201
00:19:08,338 --> 00:19:10,239
I'm 100 percent sure it was a crime of passion.

202
00:19:10,699 --> 00:19:11,808
Detective Ma.

203
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:15,179
There are no obvious cases in the world.

204
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,778
There are only detectives who can't see beyond the obvious.

205
00:19:20,808 --> 00:19:22,848
Let me give you a piece of advice since you're my partner.

206
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:25,949
Try to spend your last days at the station quietly.

207
00:19:26,788 --> 00:19:28,258
When you're about to retire, you have to watch out...

208
00:19:28,258 --> 00:19:30,119
- even for the falling leaves. - Come on.

209
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:33,088
- You're the one to talk. - Darn it.

210
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,899
Cut down on drinking.

211
00:19:35,129 --> 00:19:36,459
- Gosh. - You're pretty decent...

212
00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:37,869
when you're sober.

213
00:19:40,768 --> 00:19:42,838
Come on. Get a new car.

214
00:19:43,338 --> 00:19:45,639
No one drives a car that ran 380,000km.

215
00:19:45,639 --> 00:19:47,008
It's working fine.

216
00:19:47,008 --> 00:19:48,479
It's better than you, actually.

217
00:19:49,308 --> 00:19:52,808
Hey, do me a favor. Stop causing trouble.

218
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,078
Darn it. Come on.

219
00:19:56,848 --> 00:19:58,548
Go, go. Go then.

220
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:23,998
- What happened? - He only worked all the time.

221
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:26,709
- There he is. - He's coming.

222
00:21:26,808 --> 00:21:28,139
Get back to work.

223
00:21:32,748 --> 00:21:35,278
What? Did something happen?

224
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,219
- Mr. Guk, about Detective Kang's... - Prosecutor Seo.

225
00:21:47,028 --> 00:21:49,058
Yes, go ahead.

226
00:21:50,858 --> 00:21:52,028
Oh, well...

227
00:21:58,439 --> 00:22:00,709
- Bring it in a little more. - Yes.

228
00:22:17,318 --> 00:22:18,729
Hey, who's that?

229
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:20,429
Hold him down!

230
00:22:20,629 --> 00:22:22,328
Hey, get him! Stop him!

231
00:22:24,058 --> 00:22:25,629
- Goodness. - Let go of me!

232
00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:26,869
Let go, you jerks!

233
00:22:27,268 --> 00:22:29,038
I'm his partner, you jerks!

234
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:30,498
Move, you jerks!

235
00:22:30,498 --> 00:22:31,709
Let him go.

236
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,209
He was his partner.

237
00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:19,788
Prosecution. We're with the prosecution.

238
00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:29,699
What happened?

239
00:23:29,858 --> 00:23:31,699
The car was pretty old.

240
00:23:31,699 --> 00:23:34,429
There was no light in the night, so he hit the rail by accident...

241
00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:37,169
Stop talking nonsense. We said goodbye in Seoul yesterday.

242
00:23:37,498 --> 00:23:38,939
Are you saying he came here all night long?

243
00:23:39,939 --> 00:23:42,038
That he hit the rail and killed himself?

244
00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:45,209
I'm telling you. The car is really old.

245
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:47,449
Do you know who he is?

246
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:50,048
Do you know how many criminals he put behind bars?

247
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:53,288
Do the investigation right.

248
00:24:13,308 --> 00:24:15,608
Okay. Thanks. Yes.

249
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,048
I'm going to the prosecutors' office.

250
00:24:18,048 --> 00:24:20,008
Do you want a ride?

251
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:22,248
It's right around the corner. I'll walk as my workout.

252
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:23,518
Oh, wait.

253
00:24:24,248 --> 00:24:26,788
It looks like something happened with Prosecutor Seo's side.

254
00:24:27,518 --> 00:24:29,189
The detective who investigated...

255
00:24:29,189 --> 00:24:31,959
Yang Chul Ki's case seven years ago with her...

256
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:34,429
suddenly died in an accident.

257
00:24:35,298 --> 00:24:36,929
Doesn't feel right, does it?

258
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:57,179
You idiot.

259
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:03,248
You're defending a guy who could have killed your brother.

260
00:26:07,518 --> 00:26:08,758
Idiot.

261
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,268
They're making his funeral arrangements.

262
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:25,838
His family is against getting an autopsy.

263
00:26:27,268 --> 00:26:29,608
The case will be closed as death by accident.

264
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:57,869
(7 previous convictions, Yang Chul Ki)

265
00:26:57,869 --> 00:26:59,669
(32 years old at the time, 39 years old now)

266
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:01,508
(Initial caller of the murder case, Choi Soo Jeong's manager)

267
00:27:27,469 --> 00:27:29,298
A detective died yesterday.

268
00:27:29,469 --> 00:27:31,768
He was reinvestigating the Ahyeon-dong Murder Case.

269
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,078
What does that have to do with me?

270
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:39,709
I'm like a sewer, aren't I? Throwing at me when things happen.

271
00:27:40,748 --> 00:27:41,778
Prosecutor Seo.

272
00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:44,048
I was in prison.

273
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,449
You told them to do it.

274
00:27:48,588 --> 00:27:49,788
What are you talking about?

275
00:27:50,858 --> 00:27:53,528
There was a message from you on his phone.

276
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,659
"If you continue to dig up the case from seven years ago,"

277
00:27:56,828 --> 00:27:58,528
"I'll hire someone to kill you."

278
00:28:02,739 --> 00:28:03,768
How does that make any sense?

279
00:28:03,768 --> 00:28:05,709
I'm going to make sure it makes sense starting now.

280
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:09,439
You can fabricate the evidence...

281
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:11,778
to be innocent after killing someone.

282
00:28:11,778 --> 00:28:14,608
It's a piece of cake to fabricate something on a phone.

283
00:28:18,248 --> 00:28:19,389
A prosecutor shouldn't do that.

284
00:28:20,788 --> 00:28:21,919
The security camera.

285
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:23,858
Is there a security camera in here?

286
00:28:23,858 --> 00:28:25,088
There's nothing like that.

287
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:27,058
Listen up.

288
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:30,058
You will be indicted for instigating murder...

289
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:31,358
of the detective who died yesterday.

290
00:28:31,358 --> 00:28:33,229
And I will throw in a charge for murder as the key suspect...

291
00:28:33,229 --> 00:28:34,629
of the Ahyeon-dong Murder Case.

292
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:37,798
The evidence will include the threatening message you sent...

293
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:40,409
along with a weapon that you used seven years ago,

294
00:28:40,808 --> 00:28:42,108
with your fingerprint all over it.

295
00:28:42,108 --> 00:28:43,379
What are you doing?

296
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:45,248
Are you insane?

297
00:28:45,248 --> 00:28:47,709
I'll make sure it's not too obvious. Don't worry.

298
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:49,748
I have enough experience as a prosecutor.

299
00:28:52,548 --> 00:28:54,149
You can take responsibility...

300
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,889
for all of these cases just as you wished.

301
00:28:59,528 --> 00:29:00,758
Oh, on top of that,

302
00:29:02,098 --> 00:29:05,129
I will include all the wicked deeds that you have done, including...

303
00:29:05,129 --> 00:29:06,998
violence, fraud, threats, and everything else,

304
00:29:07,528 --> 00:29:09,939
so that you can rot in prison for life.
