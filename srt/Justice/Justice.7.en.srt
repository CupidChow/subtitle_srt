00:00:07,563 --> 00:00:13,133
Is it impossible for you to accept my love?

2
00:00:13,933 --> 00:00:17,343
My Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

3
00:00:17,343 --> 00:00:20,172
I don't like that look on your face

4
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:26,913
Is it impossible for you to accept my love?

5
00:00:27,453 --> 00:00:31,083
You're Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

6
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:33,993
You're making me sad

7
00:00:35,422 --> 00:00:41,032
Is it impossible for you to accept my love?

8
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:45,432
My Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

9
00:00:45,803 --> 00:00:48,072
I don't like that look on your face

10
00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:52,902
Is it impossible for you to accept my love?

11
00:01:03,553 --> 00:01:04,622
Tae Kyung.

12
00:01:11,592 --> 00:01:14,562
Wouldn't it be better to continue doing things as we always have?

13
00:01:17,402 --> 00:01:18,932
I hire you for a case,

14
00:01:19,562 --> 00:01:21,273
you take care of it,

15
00:01:21,303 --> 00:01:22,932
and we both stay silent.

16
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,042
That's our deal, right?

17
00:01:32,243 --> 00:01:33,383
Let us...

18
00:01:35,783 --> 00:01:37,423
keep our eyes ahead from now on,

19
00:01:38,283 --> 00:01:39,482
Tae Kyung.

20
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:48,752
Woo Yong.

21
00:02:50,152 --> 00:02:51,293
What have you done?

22
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:53,462
You're right.

23
00:02:55,532 --> 00:02:57,032
Your brother's accident might not have been...

24
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:00,773
a coincidence.

25
00:03:04,243 --> 00:03:05,342
Who killed...

26
00:03:07,673 --> 00:03:08,972
my brother?

27
00:03:18,252 --> 00:03:20,923
(Episode 7)

28
00:03:28,592 --> 00:03:30,493
Mom, don't cry.

29
00:03:47,453 --> 00:03:48,983
It has been ruled as a suicide.

30
00:03:49,483 --> 00:03:51,282
His family didn't want an autopsy either.

31
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,152
Everyone involved in the murder case...

32
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:55,523
from seven years ago...

33
00:03:56,953 --> 00:03:58,222
has died.

34
00:04:01,393 --> 00:04:04,032
Do you truly not know who killed Yang Chul Ki?

35
00:04:04,962 --> 00:04:06,002
And about your brother's accident...

36
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:07,303
Knowing it won't change anything.

37
00:04:40,772 --> 00:04:41,973
Is the next date...

38
00:04:43,002 --> 00:04:44,072
fixed yet?

39
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,002
I think we need to quickly get on it.

40
00:04:49,312 --> 00:04:51,043
Be careful.

41
00:04:52,343 --> 00:04:53,413
Yes, sir.

42

43
00:06:20,202 --> 00:06:22,973
(My Brother)

44
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,613
Is this why you suspected me?

45
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,192
(Call Logs)

46
00:06:47,562 --> 00:06:48,663
(This is delivery. We broke your goods by accident.)

47
00:06:49,663 --> 00:06:50,963
There was nothing there.

48
00:06:51,303 --> 00:06:53,103
You were deceived by Yang Chul Ki.

49
00:06:53,603 --> 00:06:54,702
He killed...

50
00:06:55,572 --> 00:06:56,973
your brother.

51
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:02,543
He killed Tae Ju?

52
00:07:02,812 --> 00:07:05,283
Why do you think he had your brother's phone?

53
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,153
They aren't the real culprits who killed your brother.

54
00:07:15,053 --> 00:07:17,122
The real culprit is someone else!

55
00:07:19,392 --> 00:07:21,733
He committed the murder that day.

56
00:07:22,262 --> 00:07:24,332
And your brother unluckily went there that day...

57
00:07:24,332 --> 00:07:25,803
and got involved.

58
00:07:26,303 --> 00:07:27,903
That's why he...

59
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:38,243
That could be possible.

60
00:07:47,223 --> 00:07:48,353
But why would he?

61
00:07:49,993 --> 00:07:51,293
For what?

62
00:07:51,363 --> 00:07:54,062
When he made you run that far to get your brother's phone,

63
00:07:54,262 --> 00:07:55,762
he blackmailed me as well.

64
00:07:56,533 --> 00:07:58,663
He said he knew what we did seven years ago.

65
00:08:00,603 --> 00:08:01,673
How would he know that?

66
00:08:01,673 --> 00:08:03,072
That's not important.

67
00:08:03,572 --> 00:08:05,043
What's important is that he's dead.

68
00:08:05,502 --> 00:08:07,372
And if the world finds out about what we did that day,

69
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:09,043
we'll lose everything.

70
00:08:21,452 --> 00:08:23,423
If it was truly Yang Chul Ki's doing,

71
00:08:25,863 --> 00:08:26,892
that means...

72
00:08:28,493 --> 00:08:30,063
we got the wrong individuals.

73
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,902
Or he could've ordered them to do so.

74
00:08:32,963 --> 00:08:34,262
Even if that's not the case,

75
00:08:35,172 --> 00:08:38,502
those scumbags would've killed more people...

76
00:08:38,502 --> 00:08:39,943
and lived useless lives.

77
00:08:41,512 --> 00:08:43,012
Don't feel guilty.

78
00:08:44,412 --> 00:08:45,412
But...

79
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,683
That means we weren't aware of the truth.

80
00:08:54,792 --> 00:08:56,993
Do you think there is an ultimate truth?

81
00:08:58,063 --> 00:09:00,022
Truth shines more brightly...

82
00:09:00,892 --> 00:09:02,632
when you add lies to it.

83
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:13,272
Woo Yong.

84
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:17,372
What have we done?

85
00:09:18,113 --> 00:09:19,813
Don't you know what I've been doing all along?

86
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:22,652
Don't you know why I had to come this far?

87
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:33,593
Is it truly because of your brother?

88
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,233
Is he truly the reason why you came this far?

89
00:09:38,863 --> 00:09:39,902
What do you mean?

90
00:09:40,502 --> 00:09:42,032
In the beginning, you made a choice.

91
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:44,402
And now that choice has become your life.

92
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:46,902
Your fate was chosen by you,

93
00:09:47,402 --> 00:09:48,843
not by your brother.

94
00:09:51,683 --> 00:09:53,683
I had no other choice.

95
00:09:53,683 --> 00:09:54,752
You're wrong.

96
00:09:54,953 --> 00:09:57,152
You knew exactly what choice you made.

97
00:09:57,453 --> 00:10:00,853
That's why you were in pain, couldn't sleep properly,

98
00:10:00,853 --> 00:10:02,823
drank yourself to sleep every night,

99
00:10:02,823 --> 00:10:04,823
and spent your money like water.

100
00:10:06,963 --> 00:10:08,632
Then what else could I've done?

101
00:10:08,632 --> 00:10:11,363
You hid behind your brother and pretended to be tormented.

102
00:10:11,363 --> 00:10:14,103
But you went on and enjoyed the life that you chose to live.

103
00:10:14,473 --> 00:10:16,502
You didn't want to go back...

104
00:10:16,502 --> 00:10:18,103
to your powerless and penniless life.

105
00:10:18,103 --> 00:10:19,772
You hypocrite.

106
00:10:36,252 --> 00:10:37,593
Now, you need to make a choice.

107
00:10:40,662 --> 00:10:41,863
Either use your brother as an excuse...

108
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:45,502
to wrap up your current lifestyle and go back to your old life.

109
00:10:50,573 --> 00:10:52,573
Or keep living the life you have now.

110
00:11:07,483 --> 00:11:08,652
I'm sorry, Tae Kyung...

111
00:11:11,052 --> 00:11:12,363
for making you doubt me...

112
00:11:15,363 --> 00:11:16,833

It's an honor, sir.

00:17:13,552 --> 00:17:15,493

No wonder the drink tasted especially sweet today.

158
00:17:28,572 --> 00:17:30,703

I've been paying close attention to her.

162
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:42,612
She could just pretend to be a prosecutor...

163
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:44,153
with that silver spoon in her mouth.

164
00:17:44,153 --> 00:17:46,653
I don't know why she's so adamant in stirring things up.

165
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,022
She shouldn't be so rash...

I'm sorry.

170
00:18:15,352 --> 00:18:17,282
I begged them to invite me.

171

I'm not the minister yet!

172
00:18:19,653 --> 00:18:21,282
Don't you invite me to this kind of meetings again.

173
00:18:55,252 --> 00:18:56,693
Now, you need to make a choice.

174
00:18:57,723 --> 00:18:59,123
Either use your brother as an excuse...

175

00:22:33,173 --> 00:22:35,342
and I just made my own.

187
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,082
What do you want from me?

188
00:22:46,683 --> 00:22:48,123
To not forget...

189
00:22:49,052 --> 00:22:52,223
what I did for you tonight.

190
00:23:32,502 --> 00:23:34,362
Have you ever recognized someone...

191
00:23:36,473 --> 00:23:39,272
who had a soul just like yours right away?

192
00:24:16,973 --> 00:24:17,973
Woo Yong.

193
00:24:19,983 --> 00:24:21,883
I must be real trash.

194
00:24:23,453 --> 00:24:25,953
After what I did, I still want to have a good life.

195
00:24:30,123 --> 00:24:31,723
Why did you really do it?

196
00:24:32,893 --> 00:24:35,433
You smashed a fake and acted out of character.

197
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,502
Because you suspected me over that.

198
00:24:41,163 --> 00:24:42,903
After a mere comment from a thug.

199
00:24:48,203 --> 00:24:49,243
You're right.

200
00:24:51,012 --> 00:24:52,183
I guess...

201
00:24:52,913 --> 00:24:54,213
I was just afraid.

202
00:24:55,012 --> 00:24:56,082
About what happened.

203
00:25:02,893 --> 00:25:04,352
If they could get away with it,

204
00:25:05,123 --> 00:25:06,562
any human being...

205
00:25:07,663 --> 00:25:11,233
would choose their well-being over the lives of hundreds.

206
00:25:12,102 --> 00:25:13,433
Is it because of strong desires?

207
00:25:14,562 --> 00:25:15,572
No.

208
00:25:20,443 --> 00:25:22,173
It's because we're normal people.

209
00:25:25,542 --> 00:25:27,542
Humans choose between good and evil...

210
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:29,413
based on need, not conscience.

211
00:25:31,913 --> 00:25:33,383
That's just what we did.

212
00:25:34,352 --> 00:25:35,653
Like normal people.

213
00:25:40,022 --> 00:25:41,092
You're right.

214
00:25:42,963 --> 00:25:46,903
Human beings are all made of the same stuff.

215
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:48,532
Right?

216
00:26:36,082 --> 00:26:37,953
(Device option)

217
00:26:37,953 --> 00:26:40,423
(Power off)

218
00:26:40,423 --> 00:26:41,752
(Yes)
