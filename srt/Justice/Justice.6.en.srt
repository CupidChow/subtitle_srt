00:00:01,071 --> 00:00:02,731
(Episode 6)

2
00:00:05,901 --> 00:00:07,201
Where is Yang Chul Ki?

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,440
- No idea. - This is...

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,910
concealment of an offender and obstruction of justice.

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,910
If you blame me as a suspect and pressure me with no evidence,

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,711
it goes against the investigation rules regarding human rights,

7
00:00:15,711 --> 00:00:17,180
and it's also considered a targeted investigation.

8
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,351
A person died as soon as Yang Chul Ki got out.

9
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:20,450
Someone in the same agency as the girl...

10
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,551
who died seven years ago died,

11
00:00:21,551 --> 00:00:23,220
and the crime method is similar too.

12
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,391
We don't know what he'll do if you let him go on.

13
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:27,830
That's none of my business.

14
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,461
What's your business with Yang Chul Ki?

15
00:00:31,461 --> 00:00:32,961
Why did you let him go?

16
00:00:33,131 --> 00:00:34,430
Was it Chairman Song?

17
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,900
At least tell me the reason.

18
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,911
I won't let this slide once I catch him.

19
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:15,441
Are you after a huge case?

20
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:17,111
Why are your shoulders so droopy?

21
00:01:18,881 --> 00:01:20,280
You've been waiting for me?

22
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,161
Have you been well, sir?

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,420
I should have set up a meeting for us,

24
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:35,030
but I thought things may be too sensitive...

25
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,661
right before your promotion.

26
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,661
I will set up a meeting very soon.

27
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:40,831
For what?

28
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,900
There is no meeting without a reason.

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
Let's go.

30
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:47,741
Okay.

31
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:13,300
Chairman Song...

32
00:02:13,431 --> 00:02:15,931
definitely has a connection with the unresolved murder case.

33
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:18,300
A prosecutor...

34
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:20,841
shouldn't speak out on suspicion that easily.

35
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,811
It's a reasonable doubt.

36
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:29,311
This is all you're eating?

37
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,621
I said I can buy you something delicious.

38
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:34,151
I just need to eat something for a meal.

39
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:38,260
I'm sure there's something,

40
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,121
but I can't find anything.

41
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,990
There's no lead, and the case gets more complicated.

42
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,501
I feel like I'm catching a whale with a fishing line.

43
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:51,300
When you can't get out of a maze,

44
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,170
try to draw a bird's-eye view.

45
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,210
If you look at something from the top,

46
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,811
it might be simpler than you think.

47
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,181
That's what I'm trying to do.

48
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,450
Nothing can win against the foolish truth.

49
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,251
Just like people who pan for gold,

50
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:08,890
if you gather thousands of documents...

51
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,121
and filter through them,

52
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,091
the sunken truth will have to rise to the top.

53
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:22,931
- Let's go. - It's still my lunch time.

54
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:24,971
You said you don't even have a lead.

55
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:26,640
Get back to work.

56
00:03:33,441 --> 00:03:34,681
Yes, sir.

57
00:03:36,681 --> 00:03:37,920
Don't worry.

58
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,661
Here is the weekly report.

59
00:03:48,931 --> 00:03:52,230
What's the case that Seo Yeon Ah is working on?

60
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:55,401
Chairman Song, that jerk...

61
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,270
Recently, it was the assault case by Yang Chul Ki...

62
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,240
from Bumjung Construction.

63
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,311
Other cases that she has recently been assigned to are...

64
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:02,841
mostly petty crimes.

65
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:04,270
No, not those.

66
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,580
Is she looking into something unofficially?

67
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,351
There is something suspicious.

68
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,181
She has been looking into an unresolved murder case...

69
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,921
from seven years ago, which Yang Chul Ki was the key suspect.

70
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,191
A murder case?

71
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,960
Did you say that thug works for Bumjung Construction?

72
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:24,390
Yes, you're right.

73
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,431
Chairman Song...

74
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,140
seems to be extremely interested in this case.

75
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:35,010
I need to use Seo Yeon Ah...

76
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,941
to have the upper hand on that jerk.

77
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:39,381
In that case,

78
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,681
it would be better if Seo Yeon Ah could go a bit bolder,

79
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:46,950
so that Chairman Song needs your power desperately.

80
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,621
I'll look into that.

81
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:52,421
Okay.

82
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:07,001
They aren't the real culprits who killed your brother.

83
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,910
The real culprit is someone else.

84
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,731
What was it?

85
00:06:03,691 --> 00:06:05,131
The thing you got on that day.

86
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:08,301
No idea.

87
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:11,571
That delivery man died because of that thing you got.

88
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,580
Yang Chul Ki said you know everything.

89
00:06:19,381 --> 00:06:20,710
He said you played a part.

90
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,280
It wasn't me.

91
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:26,850
I just did as I was told.

92
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:28,950
You know what that thing is.

93
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,321
That means you assisted murder.

94
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:34,220
If you don't tell me now, you'll have to tell me at the court.

95
00:06:36,491 --> 00:06:38,561
What was the thing that you got?

96
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:43,001
You said you just did as you were told.

97
00:06:49,571 --> 00:06:50,571
What was it?

98
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:55,311
I really don't know anything.

99
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,751
All that I did was receive that USB and hand it over.

100
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,691
"USB"?

101
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,390
Who is he?

102
00:07:16,931 --> 00:07:18,200
Get in the car.

103
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,580
It seems like Lee Tae Kyung met that woman.

104
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:35,421
I thought she was involved with Do Hoon Jae.

105
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:39,361
But it seems like she's pretty close to Tae Kyung.

106

(Daily Work Report, Lee Tae Ju)

107
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,580

(Seohwa Villa B Room 102, 200, Ahyeon-dong)

110
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,691
The damaged item was a crystal music box,

111
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:19,361
but she received a USB?

112
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:24,671

(November 20, 2012)

115
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,181
Goodness.

116
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,151
What is this?

(Namwon Restaurant)

118
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:11,080
Hello?

119
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,120
Excuse me.

120
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,860
Hello, are you the one who called me?

121
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:22,490
- I see. I'm sorry. - It's okay.

122
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,401
Are you sure this is all that you need?

123
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,330
I can compensate for the music box.

124
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,941
It looked pricey.

125
00:09:32,301 --> 00:09:33,500
That's fine.

126
00:09:35,071 --> 00:09:36,071
By the way,

127
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,840
did you look at it?

128
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,880
No, I didn't.

129
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,720
All right, then.

130
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,691
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:20,151
(If you need my help, please don't hesitate to call me.)

132
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,230
Hello?

133
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,541
Something's wrong, isn't it?

134
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,311
Should I report this to the police?

135
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,561
Listen carefully.

136
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,230
Don't tell anyone and come alone.

137
00:11:57,011 --> 00:11:58,551
Are you joking around with me?

138
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,250
Where are you, you scumbag?

139
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,651
I'm changing our location.

140
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,301
Didn't I tell you that I'd kill you if you messed around with me?

141
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,891
What are you doing?

142
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,830
Your brother's phone is in there.

143
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:21,460
On the day he died,

144
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:23,901
I picked it up from the crime scene.

145
00:13:26,401 --> 00:13:29,311
In that phone, you'll find evidence...

146
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:31,411
for the reason for his death.

147
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,610
So who killed him, you dirtbag?

148
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,250
Like I said, it's all in there.

149
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:45,391
If you're messing around again, I will kill you.

150
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,620

I'll give you the phone.

161
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,730
Also,

162
00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:11,230
this needs to be a secret.

163
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,571
Especially from Chairman Song.

164
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,941

I'll give you that money right now, so let's meet!

Don't forget.

167
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,911
Chairman Song can never know about this.

168
00:16:23,681 --> 00:16:24,980
Don't trust him.

Okay.

175
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:29,180
This is 1.5 million dollars you asked for.

176
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,481
That's 1.5 million dollars?

177
00:17:34,481 --> 00:17:36,120
- Pack them for me. - Yes, sir.

178
00:17:56,271 --> 00:17:57,471
Why do you look surprised?

179
00:17:57,771 --> 00:17:59,580
Surprised? Me? No.

180
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,051

183
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:14,221
Did he contact you again?

184
00:18:16,761 --> 00:18:17,860
He did.

185
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,430
But Woo Yong,

186
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,870
he told me something very interesting.

187
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,340
He told me not to trust you.

188
00:18:29,471 --> 00:18:30,870
That crazy jerk.

189
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,910
It's rubbish, isn't it?

190
00:18:37,251 --> 00:18:38,251
(Restricted Number)

191
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,731
Yes, Mr. Choi.

192
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:55,701
The thing you asked for the other day?

193
00:18:56,771 --> 00:18:58,471
I did look into it, but...

194
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,701
Hold on a second.

195
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,180
Where are you?

196
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:33,801
Let's take a rain check on our lunch.

197
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,771
It looks like you're busy today.

198
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,170
Okay, sure. Let's do that.

199
00:20:25,551 --> 00:20:26,561
You're back.

200
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:27,860
Here is 1.5 million dollars you asked for.

201
00:20:29,531 --> 00:20:31,590
Did Chairman Song see this?

202
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,031
(Woo Yong)

203
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:20,811
Yes, Woo Yong.

204
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,610
Come out. Let's have a drink.

205
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,150
Right now?

206
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,451
Gosh, what a shame.

207
00:21:27,451 --> 00:21:29,221
I haven't finished my work yet.

208
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,590
Something came up. I need to take care of this.

209
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:33,890
Let's grab a drink later, Woo Yong.

210
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:36,761
Okay.

211
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,291
Woo Yong, you're here.

212
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,201
Gosh, it's so hot today.

213
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:48,830
I can't seem to focus on my work.

214
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,731
Actually, I thought about calling you earlier.

215
00:22:51,731 --> 00:22:52,940
Did you eat dinner?

216
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,201
You ought to drink single-malt whiskey...

217
00:22:54,201 --> 00:22:55,501
on an empty stomach.

218
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:57,370
Gosh, you old geezer.

219
00:23:22,731 --> 00:23:25,071
Why do you think Yang Chul Ki said such rubbish?

220
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,771
Why did he tell you not to trust me?

221
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,680
I'm not sure.

222
00:23:35,711 --> 00:23:38,481
Why are you thinking about something a lowlife said?

223
00:23:38,481 --> 00:23:39,481
What about you?

224
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,350
That's not on your mind?

225
00:23:50,031 --> 00:23:51,690
No way.

226
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:41,011
(Restricted Number)

227
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,221
I'm changing our location.

228
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,551
Make sure you come alone.

229
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:56,311
Hey. Yang Chul Ki!

230
00:26:56,981 --> 00:26:58,211
Wake up!

231
00:27:52,301 --> 00:27:55,241
Are you curious about how your little brother died?

232
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,481
Delivery service. Are you in?

233
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,791
(Delivery service. You weren't home, so...)

234
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,880
Yang Chul Ki died.

235
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,981
Who do you think killed him?

236
00:30:26,261 --> 00:30:29,390
You must want to know that, my dear Tae Kyung.

237
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:50,981
Is it impossible for you to accept my love?

238
00:30:51,051 --> 00:30:54,951
You're Mona Lisa

239
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:58,291
I don't like that look on your face

240
00:30:58,551 --> 00:31:04,690
Is it impossible for you to accept my love?

241
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:08,531
You're Mona Lisa

242
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,001
You're making me sad

243
00:31:12,001 --> 00:31:18,170
Is it impossible for you to accept my love?

244
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:25,811
You're Mona Lisa

245
00:31:36,531 --> 00:31:37,630
Tae Kyung.

246
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:47,501
Wouldn't it be better to continue to do things like we always did?

247
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,870
I hire you for a case,

248
00:31:52,471 --> 00:31:54,281
you take care of it,

249
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:55,910
and we both stay silent.

250
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,021
That's our deal, right?

251
00:32:05,221 --> 00:32:06,420
Let us...

252
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,261
keep our eyes ahead from now on,

253
00:32:11,231 --> 00:32:12,291
Tae Kyung.

254
00:33:23,023 --> 00:33:25,793
(Justice)

255
00:33:26,063 --> 00:33:28,194
Another actress went missing two years ago.

256
00:33:28,194 --> 00:33:29,533
They all have no parents or they're disabled.

257
00:33:29,533 --> 00:33:31,303
They only had family members who couldn't make a living.

258
00:33:31,303 --> 00:33:34,333
Bumjung's money went into Jang Entertainment.

259
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:35,333
"Bumjung"?

260
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:37,444
You hide behind your brother and pretend to be tormented.

261
00:33:37,444 --> 00:33:40,214
But you go on and enjoy the life that you chose to live.

262
00:33:40,214 --> 00:33:42,013
You don't want to go back...

263
00:33:42,013 --> 00:33:43,813
to your powerless and penniless life!

264
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,243
You hypocrite.

265
00:33:45,243 --> 00:33:47,384
If this case has nothing to do with you,

266
00:33:47,384 --> 00:33:48,813
help me go after Chairman Song.

267
00:33:48,813 --> 00:33:50,523
Why don't you work with me?

268
00:33:50,523 --> 00:33:53,124
I think it's about time you stopped working with him.

269
00:33:53,124 --> 00:33:54,854
- Who killed... - Dad.

270
00:33:55,023 --> 00:33:56,253
my brother?

271
00:33:57,023 --> 00:33:58,124
I'm sorry, Tae Kyung.
