00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:06,000
[Episode 7]

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,104
Grandfather!

3
00:01:09,248 --> 00:01:10,359
Grandfather!

4
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:13,200
Wan, you are back.

5
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,040
What are you doing here?

6
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:31,040
Wan, His Highness
is looking for you with urgent matters.

7
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,879
He's been waiting for hours.

8
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,239
Grandfather, let me talk to him alone.

9
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:44,000
Why don't you go and take a rest?

10
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,920
Okay, I will go for a walk with birds.

11
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,159
Wan, I am here today to--

12
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,799
I don't care what you want.

13
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:02,040
Don't come near my grandfather.

14
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,239
What's wrong with you today?
Why are you acting so weird?

15
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,599
If you take one step closer,
I won't go easy on you.

16
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,639
What on earth is wrong with you?

17
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:15,120
I heard that there has been a major case
at Flower Pavilion.

18
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,680
Rather than wasting time with me here,

19
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,000
Your Highness should go and investigate
official affairs first.

20
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,000
Please see yourself out.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,840
Why is she suddenly so cold to me?

22
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,919
I had no dealings with Xiao Chen before.

23
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,360
Why is he suddenly so affectionate to me
in this life?

24
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,907
Moreover, he doesn't seem to have a grudge
against the Wen family by his looks.

25
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,360
[Condolence]

26
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,000
I have already died once.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,080
I am not afraid to die again.

28
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
But you are different.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,680
How do you know I haven't died?

30
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
I am not talking about
the kind on the battlefield.

31
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,159
Neither am I.

32
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,664
Could it be that he also…

33
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,479
Your Highness, someone witnessed
this afternoon that

34
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,199
Lady Wen of the county
and Su Xuanjing got together here.

35
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,159
Shall we investigate this matter?

36
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,080
I think these three characters
are more suspicious.

37
00:03:14,931 --> 00:03:16,520
[Seeking Fragrance Feast]

38
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,120
Seeking Fragrance Feast?

39
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,000
Seal off the scene.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,159
Whoever fears the Seeking Fragrance Feast
being exposed is the murderer.

41
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,936
Well…

42
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,936
As you command.

43
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,784
Lord Sun.

44
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,416
Your Highness is here too.

45
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:48,639
So, the Supreme Court is overreaching
its authority to investigate?

46
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,956
We wouldn't dare.

47
00:03:51,956 --> 00:03:54,760
[Seeking Fragrance]

48
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,840
Based on my experience,

49
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,360
Master Su died from Jocundity Powder.

50
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,560
Didn't Lord Sun see the characters
next to the body?

51
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,000
[Seeking Fragrance]

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,039
Seeking Fragrance…

53
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,439
This lad usually put on a decent front.

54
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,319
He must have incurred
quite a few emotional debts.

55
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,680
Come on! Let's close the case.

56
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,480
Why is Lord Sun closing the case so hastily?

57
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,199
Your Highness,
there is something you are not aware of.

58
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,959
Su Xuanjing used to be frivolous by nature.

59
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:40,360
It's not surprising at all
that he died of a crime of passion.

60
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,920
Your Highness, I am also aware of this hearsay.

61
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,879
Su Xuanjing's known for his frivolous behavior.

62
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,720
He indeed broke many women's hearts
before his death.

63
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
Master Su!

64
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,728
Wan.

65
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,079
Who on earth…!

66
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:15,040
The deceased has passed.

67
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,319
Lady Wen, don't burn yourself out crying.

68
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,040
Your Highness, Lord Sun,

69
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,120
my fiancé died for no reason.

70
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,279
I beg both of you
to thoroughly investigate this matter,

71
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,279
and give us justice.

72
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,240
Miss Wen, it's not that I, Sun Cheng,
do not care.

73
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,920
This is clearly a crime of passion.

74
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:47,079
I am afraid that further investigation
will damage the reputation of your Wen family.

75
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,000
Lady Wen, with all due respect,

76
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,160
there are plenty of good men out there.

77
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,680
Lady Wen, why waste your time

78
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,744
on that heartbreaker?

79
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,360
What about Prince Ning?

80
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,439
Your Highness, do you also believe this
to be a crime of passion?

81
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,319
This case cannot be concluded just yet.

82
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,639
It wouldn't hurt to investigate
a few more days.

83
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,560
Miss, you're not really going to mourn
for that heartbreaker, are you?

84
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,560
Now that my fiancé has passed away,

85
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,040
I can't celebrate with firecrackers every day,
can I?

86
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,040
But I'm always feeling uneasy.

87
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,079
Miss, do you think they will suspect us?

88
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,360
If they dare to openly investigate
Seeking Fragrance Feast,

89
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,639
then they would be qualified to suspect us.

90
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,240
Could it be that all three of them
have hidden agendas?

91
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,920
You think so too?

92
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,879
The attitude of the Imperial Guard is better.

93
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,759
But he does not seem like a good official?

94
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,360
A good official should be,

95
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,879
"This case is definitely suspicious.
I will thoroughly investigate it to the end."

96
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
Do you want to eat this?

97
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,399
Yes!

98
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,680
There you go.

99
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,680
Thank you, sister.

100
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,519
You're welcome. This is for you.

101
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:25,199
Thank you, sister.

102
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,199
And here's yours.

103
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,560
Thank you.

104
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,079
Your Highness, why did you give her your cape?

105
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:33,096
It doesn't matter.

106
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,000
Who sent you over without my permission?

107
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,959
Su Xuanjing dropped dead at Flower Pavilion.

108
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,160
Three words "Seeking Fragrance Feast" were
written beside the corpse.

109
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,000
This matter is of great importance.
I wouldn't dare…

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,879
Your Highness, after much thought,

111
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,120
this matter is definitely not something
that the two of us can…

112
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,480
Is Su Xuanjing's death really that important?

113
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,800
More important than my day of rest?

114
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,904
Your Highness…

115
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,519
As the Deputy Minister of the Supreme Court,

116
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:11,439
you should handle this matter on your own.

117
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,279
And you, I instructed you to follow Xiao Chen.

118
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,920
What does Su Xuanjing's death
have to do with you?

119
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,920
He was talking nonsense!

120
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,279
What about our day of rest?

121
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:27,432
Just drop it.

122
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,120
Why is Zhuo You with Sun Cheng?

123
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,808
Could it be…

124
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,919
Your Highness, Lady Wen is here.

125
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,279
What brings you here?

126
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,200
Have you encountered any trouble?

127
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,799
Your Highness has got it right.

128
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,440
I have indeed come with a request

129
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,919
to Your Highness.

130
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,919
How do I use this?

131
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:16,120
If you want to interrogate a prisoner,
just hand him over to me.

132
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,159
Why do you need to handle it yourself?

133
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,440
You cannot interrogate this person.

134
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,519
The person you want to interrogate is me.

135
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:59,399
Ask whatever you want to.

136
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,240
I am investigating a murder case.

137
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,240
It has both occurred and has not yet happened.

138
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,919
For example, that person is dead.

139
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,879
If she were to have a reborn,

140
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,360
how should she get the truth from the person
who killed her

141
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,399
in the previous life?

142
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,360
And with what kind of feelings,

143
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,120
can she face that person again?

144
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,224
I only know

145
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:45,519
that love and murderous intent

146
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,200
are both impossible to conceal.

147
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:54,200
Only with time can one's true heart be seen.

148
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:10,080
♫ The sea gazes at the clouds,
unexpectedly enamored ♫

149
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,832
♫ Without a single word ♫

150
00:11:12,832 --> 00:11:18,856
♫ Embrace with all our might

151
00:11:20,128 --> 00:11:23,136

♫ All that's left is each other ♫

153
00:11:25,632 --> 00:11:31,968
♫ Gazing from afar,
we've known each other long before ♫

154
00:11:31,968 --> 00:11:36,296
♫ One day the clouds fall into the sea,
my heart remains unchanged ♫

155
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,948
♫ The light of the fireflies scatters away ♫

156
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:53,268
♫ Swaying in the wind within wind ♫

157
00:11:53,268 --> 00:11:56,001
♫ The wind and the moon arrive
as promised on long nights ♫

158
00:11:56,001 --> 00:11:59,753
♫ Granting me dreams within dreams ♫

159
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:03,009
♫ Words ready to be spoken
ultimately fall silent ♫

160
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:06,881
♫ Reunite with you after lives apart ♫

161
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:14,164
♫ Love and hate pass by in haste ♫

162
00:12:14,164 --> 00:12:21,121
♫ Winter has its arrival,
flowers have their withering ♫

163
00:12:21,121 --> 00:12:28,033
♫ The light in your eyes remains evergreen
through the years ♫

164
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:35,201
♫ Just like the wind blows out the flames
into ashes ♫

165
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:41,281
♫ Recognize you beneath your name ♫

166
00:12:41,281 --> 00:12:45,321
♫ Willing to write for you,
against the current ♫

167
00:12:46,452 --> 00:12:53,313
♫ Spring has the intention to come,
you have the intention to return ♫

168
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:59,425
♫ Two flustered souls meet ♫

169
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:03,049
♫ The foreshadowing has been set ♫
