[Episode 14]

2
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,200
The Crown Prince is blackmailing
with the life of my uncle.

3
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,439
I had no choice
but to agree to marry him first.

4
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,159
Don't take it to heart.

5
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,000
Are you sure your uncle is in his hands?

6
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,879
Find a way to delay the wedding
and I will rescue him.

7
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,519
No.

8
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,599
The Crown Prince is still cautious for now.

9
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,599
Military power is in the hands
of the Wen family.

10
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,359
He won't dare to do anything to me.

11
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,319
As long as I keep searching,
I am sure I can find it.

12
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:46,560
But if you go.

13
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,680
I will be very worried.

14
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,640
- But--
- Let's not talk about the Crown Prince.

15
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,112
Is that okay?

16
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,392
Did you bring the sky lantern?

17
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,520
Last time at the Lantern Festival,

18
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,159
we said we would release sky lanterns together.

19
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,319
One lantern represents one wish.

20
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,720
Xiao Chen,

21
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,479
aren't you being too greedy?

22
00:02:35,558 --> 00:02:38,879
[Wish Wan]

23
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,048
What did you write?

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,159
If I tell you, the wish won't come true.

25
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,376
You are so stingy.

26
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,680
I still have so many wishes to write.

27
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,719
But there are not enough sky lanterns.

28
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,960
So, who's the greedy one after all?

Judging by the color of the sky,

55
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:53,079
this snow won't stop tonight.

56
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:03,560
I hope tonight would never end.

57
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:08,776
I hope so too.

58
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,480
Don't you think the snow tonight

59
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,879
is just like that of the northern frontier?

60
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,320
Do you miss your parents?

61
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,279
When I was little at the border,

62
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,560
every time it snowed,

63
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,720
my mother would stay with me.

64
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,040
Don't you miss the border
after spending over a decade there?

65
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:40,720
I didn't really get to see snow much
in the northern frontier.

66
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,040
At that time, I had only one thing on my mind.

67
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,920
Killing.

68
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,600
As long as I killed one more enemy,

69
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,120
I could return to the capital one day sooner,

70
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,480
and see you one day earlier.

71
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:06,759
Let's wait for the turmoil to subside,

72
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:09,519
and leave this place of disputes together.

73
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,319
I'll take you to see the snow
in the northern frontier.

74
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,720
I'll also take you to have the best barbecue
in the northern frontier.

75
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,279
Anywhere is fine,

76
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:26,240
as long as you don't forget me.

77
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,399
How could I forget you?

78
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,320
You don't believe me?

79
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,600
Your Highness, please have some tea.

80
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,000
Is there anything you want to ask?

81
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,279
What is the Crown Prince referring to?

82
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:56,872
The Crown Princess.

83
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,720
Your Highness is secure in the Eastern Palace.

84
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,480
You are bound to marry a lady of noble birth.

85
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,360
I should not inquire more about this.

86
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,399
I'm going to marry Wen Wan

87
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,279
only for the military power of the Wen family.

88
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,480
It has nothing to do with anything else.

89
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,000
Feel free to ask me from now on.

90
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
You may leave.

91
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,920
Yes.

[Hall of Yanming]

93
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,160
The auspicious time has come.

94
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,319
The first bow to heaven and earth.

95
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,079
Who would have thought that the Crown Prince
would give up even the beloved one

96
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:43,839
just for the military power of the Wen family.

97
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:48,199
I was born for the sake of the realm.

98
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,079
The affection of a man and a woman is nothing.

99
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,399
The second bow to the parents.

100
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,879
The couple bows to each other.

101
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,560
The Crown Princess is unwell.

102
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,920
Please keep the ceremony as simple as possible.

103
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,199
Help her back and take a rest.

104
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,640
Yes.

106
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,639
I do not like to threaten people like this.

107
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,000
Therefore, such matters

108
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,960
had better not happen again.

109
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,639
The cross-cupped wine…

110
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,840
How can there be a reason to drink it alone.

111
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,720
When did you poison this pot of wine?

112
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,440
Not just this pot, all of them.

113
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,399
As long as your uncle is still in his hands,

114
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,200
you won't be able to leave the Eastern Palace.

115
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,879
Therefore…

116
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:30,080
