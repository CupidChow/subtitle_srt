00:01:03,155 --> 00:01:06,480
[Episode 5]

2
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,879
I remember that the ladies
of Flower Pavilion never wield swords.

3
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,640
My lord, my ancestors were butchers.

4
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,840
Interesting.

5
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,696
You can stay.

6
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,400
- Let's go.
- Hurry.

7
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,959
We are indeed right about it.

8
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,640
There's something fishy
about this Flower Pavilion.

9
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,200
It's not just about sending dancing girls.

10
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,200
Tonight is the Seeking Fragrance Feast.

11
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,400
All the attendees are dignitaries.

12
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,560
Make sure to serve them well, understood?

13
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,599
Understood.

14
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,879
Do these dignitaries have anything
to do with the list?

15
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,064
Her…

16
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,319
Distinguished guests coming from afar,

17
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,960
welcome to the Seeking Fragrance Feast.

18
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,680
To show my sincerity,

19
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,360
tonight, I will arrange
a special highlight for you all.

20
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,719
As you can see,
she is the top prize of the evening.

21
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:32,199
Lady Wen of the county,
the granddaughter of Lord Wen.

22
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,840
I heard that,
in order to attend the Seeking Fragrance Feast,

23
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,439
Lady Wen even threw herself a fake funeral.

24
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,919
That being the case,
we might as well indulge Lady Wen's death wish.

25
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,039
You will be rewarded with ten thousand taels
of gold for her capture.

26
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:51,759
I hope you will not let her down.

27
00:04:53,984 --> 00:04:55,079
Are you alright?

28
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,096
I am fine.

29
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,032
Quick.

30
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,720
Go! Get down on your knees.

31
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,104
Take them all away.

32
00:05:35,104 --> 00:05:36,959
Yes!

33
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,080
Go!

34
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,399
Now, it's your turn to be the highlight.

35
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,399
Winner takes all.

36
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,480
Now that I have lost,

37
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,319
you can kill me as you wish.

38
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,720
Then let's start with death
by cutting in pieces.

39
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,360
You have served in the Supreme Court
for many years.

40
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,560
You must know the pain
that pierces the heart and bones.

41
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,680
If you have any questions, just ask.

42
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,800
There's no need to be pretentious.

43
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:15,360
Who sent you to deal with the Wen family?

44
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,800
What a joke.

45
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,240
I am the honorable Deputy Minister
of the Supreme Court.

46
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,600
Do I need to follow orders from others?

47
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,240
Years ago, your grandfather, Lord Wen,
ruined my bright future.

48
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,000
It's not too much
to eliminate his entire family, is it?

49
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,839
How come I didn't know there was such a past
between you and the Wen family?

50
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:47,720
I used to be the top scholar
in the imperial examination.

51
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,680
The former Emperor had promised
to betroth the Princess Royal to me.

52
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,040
If it weren't for that old fox Wen
reporting to the Emperor,

53
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,040
I would now be
a distinguished and noble consort prince.

54
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,199
It was you who deceived first,

55
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,759
yet you blame it on my grandfather.

56
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,920
With such disdain for the poor
and love for the rich,

57
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,480
how dare you wish to be a consort prince!

58
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,920
That a position belonging to royalty
and a man of men.

59
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,560
Not only could I bring glory to my family,

60
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,600
but also enjoy endless wealth and honor.

61
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:26,360
If I had actually become a consort prince
back then,

62
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,759
how could I be like this today,

63
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,360
anxiously scrambling for mere silver
every single day?

64
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:36,040
Every time I think of this,

65
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,519
I can't help
but wish to execute the entire Wen family.

66
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:41,040
And hang the corpse of old fox Lord Wen
high up on the city walls,

67
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,279
for all to scorn.

68
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,639
He also mentioned to hang the corpse
of your grandfather high up on the city walls,

69
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,079
and have him scorned by all.

70
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:54,120
So, it was you…

71
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,600
All the suffering my grandfather endured
was thanks to you!

72
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:09,079
What? Lord Wen is in trouble?

73
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,759
This is truly a stroke of great news.

74
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:18,199
It seems that I am not the only one

75
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:22,000
who hates him.

76
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,079
Do you dare kill me?
I am an official appointed by the court.

77
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,559
I have already reported the evidence
of your collusion with the enemy to the court.

78
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,919
You deserve to die.

79
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,648
Are you alright?

80
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,279
Now that Sun Cheng is dead,

81
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,279
I will take you home.

82
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,320
Going home like this,

83
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,799
will worry my grandfather.

84
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:42,195
♫ Catch the last butterfly of spring ♫

85
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:48,264
♫ Exchange for the distant moon in the sky ♫

86
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:55,072
♫ I ask the moon why it's hard to stay full ♫

87
00:09:55,072 --> 00:10:01,792
♫ Unable to retain the yearning
buried deep in the heart ♫

88
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:04,800
♫ If sleepless in the mountains,
gazing at the moon face to face ♫

89
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,128
♫ Whispering secrets,
the evening breeze never rests ♫

90
00:10:08,128 --> 00:10:16,128
♫ Carry away the long-lasting yearning ♫

91
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,288
♫ The waves embrace the rocks ♫

92
00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:24,000
♫ Have they waited for a thousand years ♫

93
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,112
♫ Sweep away the gravel ♫

94
00:10:26,112 --> 00:10:30,528
♫ Wait for the next tide to meet again ♫

95
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:33,472
♫ The spring breeze
blows away the fleeting time ♫

96
00:10:33,472 --> 00:10:38,279
♫ Yet only caring for the waxing and waning
of the moon ♫

97
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,328
Your face…

98
00:10:41,235 --> 00:10:48,168
♫ Falling upon your brows ♫

99
00:10:57,555 --> 00:11:00,723
♫ If weary in the mountains,
the moon serves as a pillow ♫

100
00:11:00,723 --> 00:11:04,192
♫ Floating and sinking in the dreams,
the footsteps never cease ♫

101
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:09,888
♫ Just for that fleeting glimpse
of astonishment ♫

102
00:11:09,888 --> 00:11:13,720
♫ You are the late-coming moon
over the mountains ♫

103
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,840
A moment like this,

104
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,799
must remind her of the Wen family
in the past life.

105
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:23,000
Wen Wan, from now on, I will keep you safe.

106
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,200
I will kill for you.

107
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,960
I will witness this scene
of corpses scattered everywhere for you.

108
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,976
Do you believe in me?

109
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,984
Let's go.

110
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:39,104
♫ An affection that cannot be touched ♫

111
00:11:39,104 --> 00:11:45,587
♫ The story of characters in the song is told ♫

112
00:11:45,587 --> 00:11:50,408
♫ Who will untie this knot ♫

113
00:11:51,104 --> 00:11:56,384
♫ Sit withered beneath the moon,
snow covering my shoulders ♫

114
00:11:56,384 --> 00:11:59,264
♫ The waves embrace the rocks ♫

115
00:11:59,264 --> 00:12:02,824
♫ Have they waited for a thousand years ♫

116
00:12:12,115 --> 00:12:14,963
♫ The light of the fireflies scatters away ♫

117
00:12:14,963 --> 00:12:19,283
♫ Swaying in the wind within wind ♫

118
00:12:19,283 --> 00:12:22,016
♫ The wind and the moon arrive
as promised on long nights ♫

119
00:12:22,016 --> 00:12:25,768
♫ Granting me dreams within dreams ♫

120
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,024
♫ Words ready to be spoken
ultimately fall silent ♫

121
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:32,896
♫ Reunite with you after lives apart ♫

122
00:12:32,896 --> 00:12:40,179
♫ Love and hate pass by in haste ♫

123
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:47,136
♫ Winter has its arrival,
flowers have their withering ♫

124
00:12:47,136 --> 00:12:54,048
♫ The light in your eyes remains evergreen
through the years ♫

125
00:12:54,048 --> 00:13:01,216
♫ Just like the wind blows out the flames
into ashes ♫

126
00:13:01,216 --> 00:13:07,296
♫ Recognize you beneath your name ♫

127
00:13:07,296 --> 00:13:11,336
♫ Willing to write for you,
against the current ♫

128
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:19,328
♫ Spring has the intention to come,
you have the intention to return ♫

129
00:13:19,328 --> 00:13:25,440
♫ Two flustered souls meet ♫

130
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,064
♫ The foreshadowing has been set ♫
