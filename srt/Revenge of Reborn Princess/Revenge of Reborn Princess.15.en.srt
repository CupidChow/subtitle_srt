00:01:03,332 --> 00:01:06,906
[Episode 15]

2
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,719
How is it going? Did you find him?

3
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,439
I got this map

4
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,480
from the craftsman

5
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,480
who repaired the Eastern Palace.

6
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,959
We have searched

7
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,439
all the rooms and secret chambers on it.

8
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,760
There's no trace of your uncle.

9
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,000
Could there be secret chambers
we haven't discovered?

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,656
Then it will be hard to find.

11
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,519
It's almost dawn.

12
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:40,079
You take your men back first.

13
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,680
I'll stay behind and take my time to search.

14
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,040
You must be careful.

15
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,439
Why doesn't Your Highness have them arrested?

16
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,439
Trespassing the Eastern Palace…

17
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,599
This crime, for them,

18
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,599
is too trivial.

19
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,200
In the dead of night,

20
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,920
it is inevitable

21
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,200
that they trespass the Eastern Palace

22
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,200
and are mistakenly killed as assassins.

23
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:12,000
They killed the one I love.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,800
I must give them a taste of it too.

25
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,039
Only then is it a tit-for-tat.

26
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,960
Beloved one…

27
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,680
His Highness actually has beloved one?

28
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,919
Why are you exerting so much force today, Ziyu?

29
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,000
Why is it you?

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,680
I was overwhelmed by wine last night,

31
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,280
leaving you to the empty room alone.

32
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,960
It was my fault.

33
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,000
Tonight, I will make it up to you properly.

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,400
There is never any affection between us.

35
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,400
Why put on an act and play tricks here.

36
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,919
I have promised you

37
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,080
that the military power of the Wen family
will not be in the hands of others.

38
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,280
From now on,
you should live in the side chamber.

39
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,919
This is the Eastern Palace.

40
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,120
Then I'll go to the side chamber.

41
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,039
If it weren't for you and Xiao Chen

42
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,360
poisoning me last night,

43
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,879
I wouldn't mind spend the night with you.

44
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,759
Don't forget

45
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,879
you also have weaknesses.

46
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,519
Your Highness.

47
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,279
You can't even handle such little thing right.

48
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,839
There's no place for you in the Eastern Palace
from now on.

49
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:28,480
Your Highness, are you trying to drive me away?

50
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,480
Yes.

51
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,560
No, your mother asked me

52
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,399
to stay in the Eastern Palace
and protect Your Highness.

53
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,720
I cannot leave.

54
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,240
Do you listen to me or my mother?

55
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,399
Of course,
I obey the commands of Your Highness.

56
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:44,319
But I've grown up in the Eastern Palace
since I was little.

57
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,319
Where can I go if I leave the Eastern Palace?

58
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,279
It's up to you.

59
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,959
It's fine as long as you're not by my side.

60
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:53,120
It's best for you to leave the capital.

61
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,879
Miss!

62
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,639
The Crown Prince drove the lady musician away.

63
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,879
He drove the lady musician away?

64
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:40,648
This is odd.

65
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,040
We must find my uncle as soon as possible.

66
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,560
Such a big guy needs to eat and drink.

67
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,592
Where could he be hidden?

68
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,519
Go check the accounts of Eastern Palace.

69
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,800
- Hurry!
- Yes.

70
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:03,839
What brings you here?

71
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,879
I just saw the Crown Prince's carriage pass by,

72
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:08,759
so I wanted to come see you.

73
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,959
Candied hawthorn.

74
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,480
I saw it on the street.

75
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,839
I remember you like it,

76
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,008
so I bought it for you.

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,232
Anything wrong?

78
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,639
It's the Crown Prince again, isn't it?

79
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,592
I'll go find him.

80
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,199
You be falling into his trap
if you go like this.

81
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,120
Are we just going to let him
bully you like this?

82
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,800
He's just taking advantage of
having my uncle in his hands.

83
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
That's why he dares to treat me this way.

84
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,600
Once I get my uncle back,

85
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,600
I will definitely let him suffer a lot more.

86
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,839
I will rescue your uncle as soon as possible.

87
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,040
I've checked the accounts.
Starting three months ago,

88
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,079
the kitchen has been preparing meals
for one extra person.

89
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,560
But no one knows where the meals are sent.

90
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,560
That's the Crown Prince's study?

91
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,880
Exactly.

92
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,439
Your Royal Highness, you are back.

93
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,360
What are you doing here?

94
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,592
Where is the Crown Princess?

95
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,959
I've said before,
I don't like others touching my stuff,

96
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,079
especially in the study.

97
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,160
I just thought it was a bit messy.

98
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,240
I wanted to help you tidy up.

99
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,680
I won't do it again.

100
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,439
Are you alone?

101
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,744
Or what?

102
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,000
Lunch is ready.

103
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,720
Let's have lunch together.

104
00:08:55,477 --> 00:08:58,480
[Hall of Yanming]

105
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,776
Wan!

106
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,759
What are you doing here?

107
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:07,360
His Highness has brought
a storybook for my lady.

108
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,879
Storybook…

109
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:12,279
From now on, let servants send these things.

110
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:14,440
There is no need to bother my seventh brother.

111
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,279
The Old Marquis told me

112
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,200
to deliver it to her personally.

113
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,080
Did the Old Marquis ever say

114
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,679
that Wan is the principal wife of me?

115
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,080
As her brother-in-law,

116
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,279
you should keep a distance.

117
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,600
Lest it leads to misunderstandings.

118
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,399
I haven't heard him mention that.

119
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,879
The Old Marquis only said

120
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,600
that the daughter of the Wen family

121
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,679
has the freedom to marry.

122
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,840
Should she become a widow,

123
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,424
she can remarry.

124
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,879
From now on, the Crown Princess will be
taken care of by my people.

125
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:02,080
I am the handmaid
who accompanied my lady during her marriage.

126
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,440
Why won't you let me serve her.

127
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,240
I am merely asking you
to return to the Wen Residence.

128
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,320
If you dare to disobey again,
I'll make sure you don't return alive.

129
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,440
What do you want to do?

130
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,919
You and I are now in the same boat.

131
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:19,720
Please properly perform your duties
as the Crown Princess.

132
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,200
Why is he acting so out of character?

133
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,600
Could it be that he has discovered something?

134
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,519
Lady Wen,

135
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:44,759
long time no see.

136
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:47,720
If you really have my uncle,

137
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,440
let him go.

138
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,600
Our Wen family will give you whatever you want.

139
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,240
Miss Wen is virtuous and generous,

140
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,720
gentle and honest.

141
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,080
I want you to be the Crown Princess.

142
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,879
You can't even handle such little thing right.

143
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,039
There's no place for you in the Eastern Palace
from now on.

144
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,200
It's best for you to leave the capital.

145
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,519
Could it be that he also…
