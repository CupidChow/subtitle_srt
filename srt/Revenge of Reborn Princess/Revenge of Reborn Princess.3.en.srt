00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,824
[Episode 3]

2
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:11,519
Take him down.

3
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,576
You…

4
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,920
I'm not sure what crime I have committed,

5
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,439
to make Your Highness come in person.

6
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,599
You know what you have done.

7
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:24,640
That's not good. If he arrests Su Xuanjing,

8
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,879
my plans will be ruined.

9
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,079
Your Highness, don't forget

10
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,799
I am the son-in-law of the Wen family!

11
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,480
What of it? No one is above the law.

12
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,280
You--

13
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,040
What crime my fiancé has committed.

14
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,120
Wan…

15
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,959
It's my wedding is tomorrow.

16
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,640
You're deliberately trying to ruin my marriage.

17
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,120
He is not a good-hearted fellow.

18
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,272
Are you such a fellow?

19
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,840
I must go through with this marriage.

20
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,879
Wait until after the ceremony,
it's not too late to take him away then.

21
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,919
That's fine.

22
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,599
It's just that on the day of the wedding,
my men must follow the entire time.

23
00:02:25,236 --> 00:02:27,720
[Orchids sing in harmony]

24
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,759
Miss, Master Su is about to set off.

25
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,599
If we don't get ready, I'm afraid…

26
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,712
Go get a jug of wine.

27
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,672
Your Highness,

28
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,784
please have a cup of wedding wine.

29
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:07,840
I have official duties to tend to,
I will not drink.

30
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,400
Your Highness fears the wine is poisoned?

31
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,879
Or are you unwilling to offer me your blessing?

32
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,879
Then it seems to be the latter.

33
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,599
I don't know
when I have offended Your Highness.

34
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,319
Your Highness is even unwilling to
offer the slightest blessing.

35
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:36,072
Congratulations.

36
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,759
No matter if you are foe or friend,

37
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,479
no one can stop my vengeance.

38
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,319
It was he who saved me.

39
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:40,308
[Wen Residence]

40
00:04:40,308 --> 00:04:43,656
[Blessing]

41
00:04:44,308 --> 00:04:47,464
[Wen Residence]

42
00:04:53,812 --> 00:04:56,232
[Condolence]

43
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,136
Wan.

44
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,879
Wan, today…

45
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,896
Today,

46
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,352
is our wedding.

47
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,288
I know.

48
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,680
Why? Why do you treat me like this?

49
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,680
Why?

50
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,120
You have the nerve to ask me why?

51
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,759
Do you think by killing me,
you can save the Wen family?

52
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:05,240
The evidence of the Wen family's
collusion with the enemy is conclusive.

53
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,959
The imperial edict to eliminate the Wen family
is already on its way.

54
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,160
The evidence is conclusive?

55
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,519
You refer to the letters of treason

56
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:17,600
you forged in my handwriting?

57
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,584
Your handwriting?

58
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:24,279
From the first day you entered the study,

59
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:28,879
my uncle's handwriting was all changed to mine.

60
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,759
The so-called evidence is, of course,
my handwriting.

61
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,040
I, Wen Wan, am just a woman.

62
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,160
Having been in the capital for over a decade,
I have never been out.

63
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,560
You said I colluded with the enemy
and committed treason.

64
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,199
Who would believe it?

65
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,720
Su Xuanjing,
you are talented but without virtue.

66
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,480
What a waste of the opportunity
to become a valued son-in-law of my Wen family.

67
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,279
I hope in your next life--

68
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,959
Wait a minute!

69
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,759
D-Don't you want to know
who wants to deal with the Wen family?

70
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,720
That mysterious person from Flower Pavilion?

71
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,800
I'm afraid you haven't even seen his true face.

72
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,000
No, he let me into the Wen family.

73
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,879
Besides getting Wen Churan's letters,

74
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:21,439
he also asked me to find a list

75
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,519
written in Qinglan cipher.

76
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,920
If he knows the list is in my hands,

77
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,199
He will surely come to see me.

78
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,696
Fine.

79
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,959
Why…

80
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:46,279
The letter is in my hands.

81
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,920
Why don't I lure him out myself?

82
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,279
Your Highness,

83
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,279
I want to surrender.

84
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:52,115
♫ The light of the fireflies scatters away ♫

85
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:56,435
♫ Swaying in the wind within wind ♫

86
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:59,168
♫ The wind and the moon arrive
as promised on long nights ♫

87
00:08:59,168 --> 00:09:02,920
♫ Granting me dreams within dreams ♫

88
00:09:03,552 --> 00:09:06,176
♫ Words ready to be spoken
ultimately fall silent ♫

89
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:10,048
♫ Reunite with you after lives apart ♫

90
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:17,331
♫ Love and hate pass by in haste ♫

91
00:09:17,331 --> 00:09:24,288
♫ Winter has its arrival,
flowers have their withering ♫

92
00:09:24,288 --> 00:09:31,200
♫ The light in your eyes remains evergreen
through the years ♫

93
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,368
♫ Just like the wind blows out the flames
into ashes ♫

94
00:09:38,368 --> 00:09:44,448
♫ Recognize you beneath your name ♫

95
00:09:44,448 --> 00:09:48,488
♫ Willing to write for you,
against the current ♫

96
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:56,480
♫ Spring has the intention to come,
you have the intention to return ♫

97
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,592
♫ Two flustered souls meet ♫

98
00:10:02,592 --> 00:10:06,216
♫ The foreshadowing has been set ♫
