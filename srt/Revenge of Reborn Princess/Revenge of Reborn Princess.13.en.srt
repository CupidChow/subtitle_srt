[Episode 13]

2
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:15,079
Miss, you are up.

3
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:17,544
Xiao Chen!

4
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,599
- Wan…
- Get out!

5
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,439
Your Highness!

6
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,680
What is wrong, Your Highness?

7
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,920
Your Highness, I'll get the imperial physician.

8
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,319
Come with me.

9
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,480
I am here with you.

10
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,519
Our Wen family will keep you safe.

11
00:01:54,935 --> 00:01:58,683
♫ The wind and the moon arrive
as promised on long nights ♫

12
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,978
Xiao Chen!

13
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:05,691
♫ Years pass by like a dream ♫

14
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,879
You are kind to me.

15
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,159
I cannot drag you down.

16
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:14,888
♫ Vivid memories of love and loathing ♫

17
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:23,852
♫ Spring has the intention to come,
you have the intention to return ♫

18
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,879
You don't understand.

19
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,960
Some wishes

20
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,639
are worth dying for.

21
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:37,104
♫ Like wind through the pavilion,
destined to bring rain on the mountain ♫

22
00:02:37,104 --> 00:02:40,384
♫ Two flustered souls meet ♫

23
00:02:40,384 --> 00:02:46,422
♫ The foreshadowing has been set ♫

24
00:02:46,422 --> 00:02:53,379
♫ Winter has its arrival,
flowers have their withering ♫

25
00:02:53,379 --> 00:03:00,291
♫ The light in your eyes remains evergreen
through the years ♫

26
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:07,459
♫ Just like the wind blows out the flames
into ashes ♫

27
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:13,539
♫ Recognize you beneath your name ♫

28
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:17,579
♫ Willing to write for you,
against the current ♫

29
00:03:18,614 --> 00:03:25,571
♫ Like wind through the pavilion,
destined to bring rain on the mountain ♫

30
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:31,488
♫ Two flustered souls meet ♫

31
00:03:31,488 --> 00:03:35,208
♫ The foreshadowing has been set ♫

32
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,159
The Crown Prince is full of schemes.

33
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,039
He said that my uncle is at the Eastern Palace.

34
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,159
It is very likely a trap.

35
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,000
It's hard not to let out the secret when
hiding such a big guy.

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,639
He has always been cautious.

37
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,719
He surely would not take such a risk.

38
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,000
We must not fall for his trick.

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,080
Exactly.

40
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,719
We cannot go to the Eastern Palace.

41
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:06,400
We need to think this over in the long term.

42
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,120
It's best to wait for him
to give himself away first.

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,720
I'll go home and see my grandfather first.

44
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,480
We can discuss more when I get back.

45
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,480
Alright.

46
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,160
I'll go help Zhuo You find his sister,

47
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,512
to avoid further complications.

48
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,432
Xiao Chen…

49
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,240
I told you not to go to the Eastern Palace.
Why did you still do go there?

50
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,519
Didn't you go as well?

51
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,920
It's a shame that the dignified Seventh Prince
actually break a promise.

52
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,639
- The same to you.
- The same to you!

53
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,360
You also think my uncle is
in the Eastern Palace?

54
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,560
Men speak kindly in the presence of death.

55
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,759
Your uncle is so important to you.

56
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,000
Even if it's false,
we should still go and take a look.

57
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,959
Well, considering today's situation,

58
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:35,560
it won't be easy
to enter the Eastern Palace again.

59
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,240
Then we must outsmart them.

60
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,759
We already know your identity.

61
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,959
As you already know,

62
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:58,720
why haven't you taken action?

63
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,279
Zhuo You,

64
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,000
I am well aware of how you treat me.

65
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,839
I sought you out today,

66
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:09,079
not to denounce your crime
and impose punishment.

67
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,560
We know that your sister is
in the hands of the Crown Prince.

68
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,879
That's why you would work for him.

69
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,199
As long as you are willing to do us a favor,

70
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,264
we'll come to rescue

71
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,439
your sister.

72
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,519
Do you know where she is?

73
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,480
His Highness is unwell, he cannot go.

74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,360
Indeed, he seemed much weaker
when I saw him yesterday.

75
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,879
Could it be related to that piece of jade?

76
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,439
Your Highness.

77
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:56,680
What is it?

78
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,600
Xiao Chen and Wen Wan have captured Sun Cheng.

79
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,439
They want to force him
to falsely accuse Your Highness.

80
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,480
Just him?

81
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,000
I want to hear the truth.

82
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,199
Xiao Chen has uncovered my identity.

83
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,240
He forced me to say these to you.

84
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,399
Actually, they are planning to capture someone
at the Seeking Fragrance Feast tomorrow.

85
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,600
Then…

86
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,279
Then what?

87
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,639
With the charge of colluding with the enemy,

88
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,288
force His Majesty to depose the heir.

89
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:34,920
What a strategy
to "lure the tiger away from the mountain".

90
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,319
I will counter with a move of

91
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,920
"catching turtles in a jar".

92
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,879
Why isn't the contract
in its original place anymore?

93
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,639
Lady Wen,

94
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,048
long time no see.

95
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,799
How does it feel

96
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,112
to be suffered from your own scheme.

97
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:44,960
Zhuo You just reported to me

98
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,200
that you want to find the prince of Qinglan.

99
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,120
And Xueji was taken away right after.

100
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,759
If it were you,

101
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:55,320
would you believe his words?

102
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,240
Well then, why don't we

103
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,799
get honest with each other.

104
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,360
If you really have my uncle,

105
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,240
let him go.

106
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,360
Our Wen family will give you whatever you want.

107
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,919
No problem.

108
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,399
I have prepared a gift for you.

109
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Open it and take a look.

110
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,840
Your uncle has a scar on his finger.

111
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,000
You should remember it.

112
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,919
What on earth do you want?

113
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,759
Miss Wen is virtuous and generous,

114
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:52,399
gentle and honest,

115
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,559
outstanding in character and appearance.

116
00:09:54,559 --> 00:10:00,080
You are betrothed to the Crown Prince
as the principal wife.

117
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,159
Decree by the Emperor.

118
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,519
Miss Wen,

119
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:07,016
why don't you accept the decree
and express gratitude?

120
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,560
My lord,

121
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
His Majesty has betrothed Wen Wan
to the Crown Prince.

122
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,039
What should I do?

123
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,320
Are you sure?

124
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,519
L-Lord Sun,

125
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,840
it's you!

126
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,919
My lord, my official position is yet…

127
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,559
My lord, a seventh-rank will do.

128
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,960
Eighth-rank, eighth-rank will also do, my lord.

129
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,679
Your Highness, do we need to call
the imperial physician?

130
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:00,808
It doesn't matter.

131
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,399
You go take a look at the Wen Residence.

132
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,320
I don't know why…

133
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,879
I feel uneasy today.

134
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,720
Lady Wen of the county

135
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,152
is going to be the Crown Princess.

136
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,544
Your Highness!

137
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,559
What did you say?

138
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,080
It's all my fault.

139
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,399
That day, Lady Wen let me lead the Crown Prince
away from the Eastern Palace,

140
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:27,120
so she could go to the Eastern Palace
to find someone.

141
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,639
But she was detained by the Crown Prince.

142
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,320
If it is really so,

143
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,559
then Wan is

144
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,559
in danger.

145
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,919
Zhuo You,

146
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,679
you go quickly and gather a team.

147
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,039
Your Highness intends to force your way
into the Eastern Palace?

148
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,039
When necessary,

149
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:51,080
kill the Crown Prince,

150
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,480
and end it all.

151
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,639
Your Highness, well…

152
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,080
Go!

153
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,279
Your Highness,
are you trying to make me a widow?

154
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,960
Do you really intend to regard the Crown Prince

155
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,279
as your husband?

156
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,600
I'm not talking about the Crown Prince.
