00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:06,856
[Episode 10]

2
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,760
Sun Cheng is not good at martial arts.

3
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,159
I've had people follow him several times.

4
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,359
But he has shaken them off every time.

5
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,519
Sun Cheng is a cautious person.

6
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,359
He always has experts by his side.

7
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,840
Their capability may not be inferior
to you and me.

8
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,359
We must be even more cautious in the future.

9
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,760
I originally planned
to start with Sun Cheng's family.

10
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,000
Unexpectedly, although Sun Cheng has many
wives and concubines,

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,719
he doesn't care deeply about any of them.

12
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,879
I vaguely know
that Sun Cheng is greedy for wealth.

13
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,439
I checked several properties registered
under his name,

14
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,080
but I didn't find any problems.

15
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,240
I can tell

16
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,439
Wan truly likes you.

17
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:35,080
You must treat her well.

18
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,240
Rest assured, grandfather.
She is the one I've chosen.

19
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,319
I will never let her down.

20
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,280
Why do you have to do this?

21
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,599
Miss Wen, please tell His Highness,

22
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,960
there's no need to order the prison guards

23
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,120
to give me preferential treatment
in food and clothing.

24
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,960
It was me who wronged His Highness first.

25
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,199
Since you know you've wronged him,

26
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,360
why don't you apologize to him?

27
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,879
I would like to see His Highness.

28
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,240
Can you let me see His Highness?

29
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,800
I know Your Highness wants to
deal with Sun Cheng.

30
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:56,280
There is a confidential letter in my room.

31
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,479
Inside are the

32
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,360
evidences I've found over the years
about Sun Cheng's corruption.

33
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,159
Your Highness just needs to
have this confidential letter

34
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,240
and threaten him with it.

35
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,759
He can then take you
to the Seeking Fragrance Feast.

36
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,360
At that time, the truth will come to light.

37
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,479
What I don't understand is

38
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,144
why.

39
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,800
Why you've become one of them.

40
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:36,279
Do you remember what I once told Your Highness?

41
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,560
About my younger sister

42
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,440
with a plum blossom birthmark
on her right shoulder?

43
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,519
They took her,

44
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:45,360
and used this to force me
into working for them.

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,079
I hope Your Highness,
considering the many years I have followed you,

46
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,560
can help me rescue my sister.

47
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,680
I am determined to work
like a horse to serve you in the next life,

48
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,120
to repay Your Highness's kindness!

49
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:33,000
[Peace and Prosperity]

50
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,279
Xueji.

51
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,079
You know me?

52
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:41,800
I also know you have
a plum blossom birthmark on your back.

53
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,839
How do you know that?

54
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,879
Do you have a brother?

55
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,439
Do you know my brother's whereabouts?

56
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:53,448
I will take you to see him.

57
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,720
It's said that Your Highness
never visits without a reason.

58
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,480
What brings you here to meet me today?

59
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,680
I indeed have an important matter.

60
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,120
I would like to ask you for a favor.

61
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,560
Your Highness, please feel free to ask me.

62
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,279
I have 35,800 taels of silver.

63
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,680
I need you

64
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,639
to find me a reliable place to hide the silver.

65
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,560
Your Highness, why bother

66
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,759
for a trivial Seeking Fragrance Feast.

67
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,079
Since you said
it's a trivial Seeking Fragrance Feast,

68
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:38,199
then I would ask you to be my referral.

69
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,279
That shouldn't be too much to ask.

70
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,079
35,800 taels.

71
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,199
Let's go, I will take Your Highness
to the Seeking Fragrance Feast.

72
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,959
Women of the Central Plains

73
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,079
are indeed beautiful and slender-waisted.

74
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:15,800
Why not come back with me to Qinglan?

75
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,399
How could I have such luck?

76
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:23,240
My lord doesn't know, the redemption price
at the Seeking Fragrance Feast is quite high.

77
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,920
My lord, are you really willing to redeem me?

78
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,039
In Qinglan, I, Datar, never go back on my word.

79
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,279
Moreover, the deal I made today

80
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:40,039
is enough to redeem you with the change alone.

81
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,840
Anyway, the official business is yet to begin.

82
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,960
You might as well have fun with me first.

83
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,799
Didn't you say you would come to be with me?

84
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:02,000
Why have you kept me waiting for so long?

85
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,320
That guy is called Datar,
the prince of Qinglan.

86
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,639
There's an important transaction
going on tonight.

87
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,559
This Seeking Fragrance Feast is surely
more than just seeking pleasures.

88
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:32,919
If I have it right, he's waiting for

89
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:36,240
the person we're looking for.

90
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,559
Such a familiar scent.

91
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:26,360
You said earlier that you were thirsty.

92
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,384
Try this cup of tea.

93
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,376
Thank you, young master.

94
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:47,679
You asked me to meet you
at this Seeking Fragrance Feast.

95
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:52,559
But you yourself showed up late.
What's your intention?

96
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,559
Before I came, I read a confidential report.

97
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:01,399
I am very upset about the report.

98
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:05,519
Upset? Why waste the time of our prince?

99
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,519
It's said on that confidential report

100
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,639
that you detained my goods at the border,

101
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:14,159
and wanted to
take seventy percent of the profits.

102
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,136
Get out of my way!

103
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,039
We had a deal.

104
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,240
You eliminated the Wen family,

105
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,759
and I handed over
the secret agent of Qinglan in Da'an.

106
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,639
Now, I have given you the secret agent.

107
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:32,519
Yet, the Wen family live on well.

108
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,639
The previous way of sharing profits
no longer counts.

109
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:40,639
Wen Churan has already disappeared.

110
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,200
Could it be your credit?

111
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
If it weren't for our prince catching it early.

112
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,600
The deal you made with our prince
at the Seeking Fragrance Feast

113
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,360
would have been reported
to the Emperor of Da'an long ago.

114
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,919
All of you in Da'an are incompetents.

115
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:05,679
What do you mean?
You're not cooperating anymore?

116
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:37,840
I will take care of the Wen family myself.

117
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,120
As for you, are you still doing business?

118
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:54,912
[Certificate Issuer]

119
00:12:54,912 --> 00:12:57,240
That's more like it.

120
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,559
Why make it unhappy for everyone, right?

121
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:06,120
Imperial brother, today is your grand wedding.

122
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,720
Let's have one more drink.

123
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,792
It's him!
