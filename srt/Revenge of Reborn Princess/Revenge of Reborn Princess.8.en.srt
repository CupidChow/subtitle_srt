[Wen Residence]

3
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,239
Miss has been on the go all day today.

4
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,208
Has there been any progress made?

5
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,920
A little bit.

6
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,000
I'll soon find out whether he's human or ghost.

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Which one is he?

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,799
Aren't there three ghosts?

9
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,359
I only care about that one.

10
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,159
That one…

11
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,800
Do you want me to pick a few deft ones,

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,879
and keep an eye on him at all times?

13
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:32,400
It doesn't work to switch to anyone else.

14
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,400
Only I can tell if he's a human or a ghost.

15
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,840
He's right, murderous intent
cannot be concealed.

16
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,280
If he really wants to make a move against me,

17
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,200
I just need to stay by his side every day.

18
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,280
Sooner or later, he will give himself away.

19
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,640
Your Highness, you are injured!

20
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,760
It's nothing serious.

21
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,959
I was bored and tried out the newly arrived
torture devices in the prison,

22
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,560
and got myself trapped.

23
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,704
Bored?

24
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,199
By the way, I heard that Miss Wen
also went to the prison today.

25
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:15,240
Your Highness, didn't you see her?

26
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:21,240
Wen Wan must still be suspicious of me.

27
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,400
Instead of letting her exhaust her mind
every day,

28
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,520
it's better for me to take the initiative
to show up and help her ease her concerns.

29
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:33,639
Zhuo You, do you think it's better to wear
blue or white for proposing marriage?

30
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,879
Why are you talking about proposing marriage
all of a sudden?

31
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,599
I have been thinking.

32
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,879
Instead of worrying about her day and night,

33
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,840
I might as well marry her to the family.

34
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,520
With you, me, and so many guards
and personal soldiers around,

35
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,639
it's safer than where she is now.

36
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,319
What reason could there possibly be

37
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,439
that would allow me to rightfully

38
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:03,080
stay by Xiao Chen's side all day long?

39
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,439
How about kidnapping him?

40
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,639
Miss, something's up!

41
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,439
You should go and check it out.
His Highness Prince Ning, he…

42
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:28,159
I have admired Miss Wen for a long time.

43
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,840
Today, I would like to offer this jade pendant
as a betrothal gift,

44
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,080
and ask to marry Miss Wen Wan
from the Wen family as my wife,

45
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,120
entrusted with mutual support from now on.

46
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,919
Treat each other with courtesy,
and love each other without doubt.

47
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,536
Stay together until the end of life.

48
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,544
♫ Clouds and the sea,
separated by mist and haze ♫

49
00:03:48,544 --> 00:03:50,840
♫ Minds hard to guess ♫

50
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,479
Today, I came to congratulate you.

51
00:03:58,432 --> 00:04:01,960
♫ Where the clouds form, stirring up dust ♫

52
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,008
What's wrong?

53
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,368
It's nothing.

54
00:04:11,456 --> 00:04:14,360
♫ The sea gazes at the clouds,
unexpectedly enamored ♫

55
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,120
He's doing this to prove his innocence.

56
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,240
♫ Embrace with all our might
until the day comes ♫

57
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,240
This happened out of the blue,

58
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,360
I haven't prepared anything for you.

59
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,512
It doesn't matter.

60
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,439
You just need to give me your handkerchief

61
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,480
as proof.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,720
My handkerchief?

63
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:42,560
♫ Wait until the clouds to fall into the sea,
I wouldn't change this life ♫

64
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,824
♫ Even if only for a moment of brilliance ♫

65
00:04:45,824 --> 00:04:48,352
♫ Eyes meet, temptation can't be hidden ♫

66
00:04:48,352 --> 00:04:52,224
♫ Like a dream, like an illusion ♫

67
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:55,360
♫ Disregarding the winter chills,
give me warmth for a lifetime ♫

68
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,976
♫ Persistently expecting,
to the ends of the world ♫

69
00:04:58,976 --> 00:05:00,480
♫ If love stirs up waves ♫

70
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,839
♫ Beating through the railings,
worldly affairs scatter with the wind ♫

71
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:08,279
The Wen family will surely prepare
a generous dowry.

72
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:10,279
- His Highness--
- There is no need.

73
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,839
To be able to regain what was lost,

74
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,120
I am already fully satisfied.

75
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,960
Your Highness.

76
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,279
Both Prince Ning and the Wen family
hold military power.

77
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,360
If they join forces,

78
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,160
how can I, Lord of the Eastern Palace,
maintain my position?

79
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,160
Where is Zhuo You?
He usually checks in for every little thing.

80
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,759
Where is he now?

81
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,560
Well, he serves two masters,

82
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,704
and may have trouble getting away.

83
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,408
Your Highness, please calm down.

84
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,792
Go prepare a congratulatory gift.

85
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,000
I want to go and see for myself.

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,680
Yes.

87
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,072

00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:36,768
♫ The wind and the moon arrive
as promised on long nights ♫

91
00:06:36,768 --> 00:06:41,332

♫ If love carries faith,
it's the guidance of time ♫

97
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:11,199
His Royal Highness the Crown Prince is here.

98
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:21,360
Your Royal Highness the Crown Prince.

99
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,360
My imperial brother, make yourself comfortable.

100
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,439
Today, there is only brotherhood
between you and me, no ruler and subject.

101
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,480
Have you forgotten that your sister is still
in my hands?

102
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,680
I acknowledge my mistake.

103
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,519
Please, Your Highness,
show mercy and do not harm her.

104
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:50,560
I will not lay a hand on a vulnerable woman.

105
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,720
But if you disobey…

106
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,680
I dare not disobey the orders of Your Highness.

107
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,920
I want you to sow discord
between the Wen family and Prince Ning.

108
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,399
But… Your Highness, you have promised

109
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,000
not to harm Prince Ning.

110
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,839
What if the county lord of the Wen family
dies in the Palace of Prince Ning?

111
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,839
Imperial brother, today is your grand wedding.

112
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,759
Let's have one more drink.

113
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,519
Crown Prince, we should not drink anymore.

114
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,640
Come on. let's go.

115
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,552
[Harmony and Abundance]

116
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,120
Who is he?

117
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,279
I didn't know he was capable of disguise.

118
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,456
Disguise?

119
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,080
Guards!

120
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,128
Drag him away.

121
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,752
Keep a tight watch on him.

122
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,759
Take him to the Imperial Prison first.

123
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,200
Keep those criminals away from him.

124
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,639
He used to follow Your Highness

125
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,399
and captured many vicious criminals.

126
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,360
Don't let him be bullied.

127
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,400
As you command!

128
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,919
The three moles were from a disguise.

129
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:11,200
The one who wants to kill me is not him.

130
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,639
Aren't you going to ask me anything?

131
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,080
If you want to talk, you'll talk.

132
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,279
I'm always here anyway.

133
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,360
Thank you for what happened last night.

134
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,720
If it were you, you would do the same.

135
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:49,519
The murder case you mentioned last time

136
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:53,159
should have been Zhuo You's doing as well.

137
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,200
He must have had his reasons.

138
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,600
I met Zhuo You when I was still nothing.

139
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,960
Back then, he didn't know I was a prince.

140
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,360
Once I was captured by people from the Qinglan.

141
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,679
It was he who rushed into the enemy camp,

142
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:14,080
risking his life, and rescued me.

143
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:18,000
Such a person,

144
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,919
I don't believe he would easily
betray a friend.
