00:01:03,155 --> 00:01:06,760
[Episode 18]

2
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,480
I didn't expect you to be a great chef.

3
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,040
There's a lot you don't know.

4
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:26,536
Try it.

5
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:31,976
How is it?

6
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,632
Delicious!

7
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:41,288
Have a bite.

8
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:58,719
I think I mistook the sugar for salt.

9
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,080
We don't need these items.

10
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,439
Wrap up the rest for me.

11
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,639
Alright.

12
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,640
Thank you very much.

13
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:18,120
Lady Wen,
I see a crack on your husband's jade pendant.

14
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,800
How about getting a new one?

15
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,080
Crack?

16
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,039
There is nothing much to see.

17
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,879
Since you bought me so many clothes,

18
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,719
should I also get a gift for you?

19
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,864
One good turn deserves another.

20
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,319
Let's split up and no peeking.

21
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,840
You've finally come.

22
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,680
There's a crack on the jade chain.

23
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,479
It's a shame that the fine jade is flawed.

24
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,599
Let me go, I didn't steal anything.

25
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,864
Cut the crap.

26
00:03:20,864 --> 00:03:23,840
Such fine jade… If you didn't steal it,

27
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,000
where else could it have come from?

28
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,280
Tell the truth, or else--

29
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,680
Stop!

30
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,879
Your Highness.

31
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:35,639
You say she stole it. Do you have any evidence?

32
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,680
Your Highness, look at her.

33
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,080
And look at this jade chain.
It's out of her league.

34
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:51,879
If the law enforcers judge by appearance,

35
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,960
where would there be fairness in the world?

36
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,800
- Your Highness--
- Get out!

37
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,856
Yes.

38
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,039
He has wronged you. I apologize on his behalf.

39
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,360
Do you believe me?

40
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,360
I believe in evidence.

41
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,319
Let's go, I'll take you home.

42
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:25,439
I have no home.

43
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,519
Come with me.

44
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,600
I am here with you.
Our Wen family will keep you safe.

45
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:41,079
Then, do you want to come home with me?

46
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,639
I will take care of you from now on.

47
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,879
I can't go home with you.

48
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,959
But you are kind of nice.

49
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,680
I can help you fulfill any wish you have.

50
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,959
My wish

51
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,199
is that you won't be bullied by others anymore.

52
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,240
Is there anything else?

53
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:08,720
I hope that my beloved one will have
a life of peace and prosperity.

54
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,360
Your beloved one will suffer a disaster.

55
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,279
I can help you turn things around

56
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:27,000
and alter her destiny.

57
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,712
However, you must pay a price for this.

58
00:05:31,712 --> 00:05:33,319
I accept your offer.

59
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:36,040
Even if you cannot have a good ending with her,

60
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,800
you are still determined to save her?

61
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,879
I ask for nothing in return from her.

62
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:46,120
I only wish for her to have a safe life.

63
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,480
If danger arises,

64
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:54,759
lead the blood of you both into the jade chain.

65
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:58,720
It will take you back to the starting point
of the disaster.

66
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:02,079
But you have to use it carefully.

67
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,800
This jade chain can only be used three times.

68
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,759
Or the jade will be broken, people will die,
and the soul will be destroyed,

69
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,800
leaving a life without traces.

70
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,519
How much longer can I live?

71
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,560
Why are you so late?

72
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,648
Is this for me?

73
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,079
Where is my gift?

74
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:45,120
Close your eyes first.

75
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,104
Open your eyes.

76
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:11,920
Do you like it?

77
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,960
Yes, I like it!

78
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,800
But it's early spring now,

79
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,480
where did you get these fireflies?

80
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,879
You just need to like it.

81
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,312
Then hold it tight.

82
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,959
This makes my gift seem particularly insincere.

83
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,199
Just give me a second. I'll be right back.

84
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:53,096
The day…

85
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,879
has finally come.

86
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,632
Xiao Chen!

87
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,840
Are you feeling better?

88
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:54,480
I've felt uneasy lately.

89
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,679
When it gets warmer, let's…

90
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,919
go to the border together.

91
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:10,000
We haven't named the little rabbit yet.

92
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,080
How about we call it Little Dumpling.

93
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,039
Little Dumpling… that's a good name.

94
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,759
Little Dumpling, you have parents now.

95
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,176
Little Dumpling.

96
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:02,952
Wan.

97
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,880
Wan.

98
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,744
I'm here.

99
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,848
What's up?

100
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,696
Promise me…

101
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,080
If one day I make you sad,

102
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:32,200
just forget me.

103
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,879
Why should I forget you?

104
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,720
Didn't we just agree to
spend our life together?

105
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,848
Why?

106
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,176
Do you want to go back on your words?

107
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,200
I am just saying.

108
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,559
I won't forget you.

109
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,799
You're also not allowed to talk nonsense.

110
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:01,000
Okay, you are the boss.

111
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,320
I won't mention it anymore.

112
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,360
You're not even allowed to think about it.

113
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:08,080
I won't think about it anymore.

114
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,120
Let's sleep now.

115
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:15,072
♫ Jade has chains,
and falling leaves have floating roots ♫

116
00:11:15,072 --> 00:11:18,920
♫ Layers of snow falls upon me ♫

117
00:11:19,475 --> 00:11:22,240
♫ With pen in hand,
I depict the old friend on paper ♫

118

00:11:33,248 --> 00:11:40,499
♫ Love and hate pass by in haste ♫

122
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:47,360
♫ Winter has its arrival,

♫ The light in your eyes remains evergreen

124
00:11:54,803 --> 00:12:01,536
♫ Just like the wind blows out the flames
into ashes ♫

125
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:07,584
♫ Recognize you beneath your name ♫

126
00:12:07,584 --> 00:12:11,336
♫ Willing to write for you,
against the current ♫

127
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:22,515
♫ The light of the fireflies scatters away ♫

128
00:12:22,515 --> 00:12:26,835
♫ Swaying in the wind within wind ♫

129
00:12:26,835 --> 00:12:29,568
♫ The wind and the moon arrive
as promised on long nights ♫

130
00:12:29,568 --> 00:12:33,320
♫ Granting me dreams within dreams ♫

137
00:13:08,768 --> 00:13:14,848
♫ Recognize you beneath your name ♫
