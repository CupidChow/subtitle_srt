00:01:03,155 --> 00:01:06,760
[Episode 20]

2
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,680
Don't make a sound, or I'll kill you.

3
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,799
You came here after reading the storybook,
didn't you?

4
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,480
What?

5
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,000
You are already the fifth one today.

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,680
Who on earth wrote this storybook?

7
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,680
You don't recognize me?

8
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,120
I have never been to the capital.

9
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,599
How could I possibly recognize you?

10
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,159
It's my fault for putting too many details
in the storybook.

11
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,003
There must be a way.
I will definitely make you remember me.

12
00:01:58,003 --> 00:02:04,079
[Palace of Prince Ning]

13
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,760
Little Dumpling,
I entrust my marital fate to you.

14
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,319
Lady Wen, why are you here again?

15
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,360
My rabbit just ran inside.

16
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,479
May I go look for it?

17
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,759
R-Rabbit?

18
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,800
Your Highness,
Lady Wen's rabbit has run in here.

19
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,439
Your Highness, could you please do us a favor?

20
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:35,080
My rabbit just ran in there.

21
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,360
Aren't you already in here?

22
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,544
So many rabbits!

23
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:55,552
Your rabbit is also named Little Dumpling?

24
00:02:55,552 --> 00:02:56,680
Yes, it is.

25
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,680
Your Highness, people have been stuffing
rabbits into the palace lately.

26
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,360
All of them came after reading the storybook.

27
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,039
Really don't know who is so wicked
as to write a storybook about Your Highness.

28
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,512
Thank you, Your Highness.

29
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:40,159
He did come back.

30
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,439
But he doesn't remember me anymore.

31
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,520
Is this what you call fate?

32
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,120
Not only can't he remember,

33
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,560
but he won't remember you
no matter what you do.

34
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,479
In his eyes, the time you spent with him

35
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,520
all goes blank.

36
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,400
Is it the same every day?

37
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,439
Yes, the same every day.

38
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,759
What on earth have you done!

39
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,184
This is fate.

40
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:15,479
I only believe that man can conquer fate.

41
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,480
Lady Wen… L-Lady Wen…

42
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,800
Lady Wen, please don't go in there.

43
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,319
Your Highness, I couldn't stop her.

44
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,600
Thank you, Prince Ning,
for helping me find Little Dumpling yesterday.

45
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,800
I have prepared some modest gifts
to express my gratitude.

46
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Did we meet yesterday?

47
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,952
We did.

48
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,680
This is what I painted three years ago.

49
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
If we have never met,

50
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,959
how could I have painted you?

51
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,560
If you can't remember,
then write it down with a pen.

52
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:43,199
This is where we exchanged wedding vows.

53
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:01,680
What are you staring at? Write it down!

54
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,360
This is where you cooked for me.

55
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,680
You mistook sugar for salt.

56
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:16,120
I can't be that stupid.

57
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,672
This is where we…

58
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,720
Together…

59
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,800
What have we been doing here?

60
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,768
Sleeping, of course.

61
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,079
You couldn't have forgotten this, could you?

62
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,399
Then, it's…

63
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:50,279
such a pity.

64
00:07:20,947 --> 00:07:21,651
[Place where we slept together]

65
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:24,552
[Place where Wen Wan and Xiao Chen
exchanged wedding vows]

66
00:07:43,059 --> 00:07:48,584
[On Yihai Day, Lady Wen gifted…]

67
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,360
Lady Wen gifted me a portrait,

68
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,439
saying we've known each other for a long time.

69
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,856
[On Yihai Day, Lady Wen gifted me a portrait,
saying we've known each other for a long time]

70
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,560
Speaking of Lady Wen and the Seventh Prince,

71
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,360
it's truly a case of mutual affection.

72
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,656
A match made in heaven.

73
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:29,639
[The place where Wen Wan and Xiao Chen
exchanged wedding vows] A match set by fate.

74
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,360
This Seventh Prince is indeed decisive.

75
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,039
[Place where we cooked together]

76
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,960
To save our Lady Wen,

77
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,000
he truly spared no effort,
even risking his life.

78
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,679
He fought in and out of the Hall of Hell
three times.

79
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,519
It's said that don't mention streams to him
who has seen the vast ocean.

80
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:50,639
The clouds that circle Mount Wu's peak
are the only clouds for him.

Do you still remember this place?

85
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,080
Does this bring anything to mind?

86
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:31,000
Miss,
could you tell me who you really are first?

87
00:09:33,363 --> 00:09:35,039
[On Dingchou Day,
went to the lakeside with Wen Wan]

88
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,240
Do you remember this place?
It's right up ahead.

89
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,080
I told you I don't remember anything.

90
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,256
