[Episode 12]

2
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,000
They deliberately set a trap.

3
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,760
It must be aimed at
His Royal Highness the Crown Prince.

4
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,560
[Hall of Yanming]

5
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,560
The Imperial Guard is on a case!

6
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,560
It's against the rules for the imperial brother
to break into the Eastern Palace.

7
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,280
Last night, Sun Cheng, Deputy Minister
of the Supreme Court, was assassinated.

8
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,000
This jade pendant was found at the scene.

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Upon investigation, it is worn daily
by a lady musician in your residence.

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,599
This type of jade pendant is quite common.

11
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,319
Everyone on the street has one.

12
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,840
How can you prove it's mine.

13
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,760
Lady Wen and I have fought against the person.

14
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,159
That person was injured on the arm… right here.

15
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:12,199
How dare you get presumptuous
in the Eastern Palace!

16
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,439
What caused the injury?

17
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:28,080
The secret weapon of Lady Wen.

18
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,240
I was injured by the tip of the sword
while practicing last night.

19
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,919
If Your Highness does not believe,

20
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,960
feel free to have it verified.

21
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,064
This way please.

22
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,719
Lady Wen, did you take a close look
at the injury?

23
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,159
It is indeed a sword cut.

24
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:11,599
That person also took
a piece of specially made Pass Permit

25
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,960
from Sun Cheng.

26
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,319
There is scented powder on the document.

27
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,159
Anyone who comes into contact of the powder

28
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,639
will have an exotic fragrance on their hands
when they are to touch tea within one day.

29
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:26,056
Lady musician.

30
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,759
Since Lady Wen and Your Highness suspect me,

31
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,639
I will just come with you.

32
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,080
Why bother to come up with such lies.

33
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,920
[Hall of Yanming]

34
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,439
Your Highness,
there is news from the Imperial Prison.

35
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,479
Prince Ning found a contract with Qinglan
from Sun Cheng.

36
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,120
The lady musician confessed upon seeing it.

37
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,296
Yes.

38
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,520
The contract?
There are only two copies of the contract.

39
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,240
One was taken back to Qinglan by Datar

40
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,519
One is in my possession.

41
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,079
Why would Sun Cheng have it?

42
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,199
Could it be my copy?

43
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,376
The contract was indeed hidden by you.

44
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:45,448
[Contract. Signatories Xiao Heng and Datar]

45
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,639
Your Highness intents to
use these to force my confession.

46
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,519
You were selected
from dozens of loyal retainers

47
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,800
by the birth mother of the Crown Prince.

48
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,120
These are just kid's stuff for you.

49
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,480
Since you already know, why bother?

50
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,199
[Contract. Signatories Xiao Heng and Datar]
What if I use this?

51
00:05:23,027 --> 00:05:26,728
[Hall of Yanming]

52
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,040
Your Highness, here is the lady musician.

53
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,120
Your Highness, what is your intention?

54
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,920
Selling purple gold to the people of Qinglan

55
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,560
was my doing alone.

56
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,920
It has nothing to do
with His Royal Highness the Crown Prince.

57
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,079
It is your master who wishes to see you.

58
00:05:47,712 --> 00:05:49,360
Your Highness.

59
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,432
Rat!

60
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,920
Do you plead guilty?

61
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,199
I admit my mistake.

62
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:03,160
It was my greed
that led me to my own destruction.

63
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:06,959
I dare not ask Your Highness for forgiveness.

64
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,120
I only beg Your Highness
to take care of yourself.

65
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,399
Is that what I'm talking about?

66
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,920
Do you still remember

67
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,560
what was said

68
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,360
when my mother took you
into the Eastern Palace?

69
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,240
The noble lady said, after entering the palace,

70
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,240
my life belongs to Your Highness.

71
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,160
Through life and death,
my heart is solely for Your Highness.

72
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,759
I have never betrayed my promise.

73
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,040
She meant that you should act on my commands.

74
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,560
You are now pleading guilty without permission.

75
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,040
Do you still see me as your master?

76
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,399
Your Highness,
conducting transactions with Qinglan

77
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,160
was solely my doing.
It has nothing to do with Your Highness.

78
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,959
It seems you still do not heed my words.

79
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:56,040
If that's the case,
get out of the capital from tomorrow.

80
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,279
Do not return without being summoned.

81
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,399
Your Highness, the Emperor has already decreed.

82
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,000
This matter will be over as long as I die.

83
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,736
Is this the decree?

84
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,640
Get out!

85
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:23,600

ordered by your mother.

I bear no grudge against you.

98
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:02,759
Why do you hate me so much?

99
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,600
No grudge, no enmity?

100
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
You let Su Xuanjing get close to me.

You still have the nerve
to talk about no grudge, no enmity!

103

And my uncle.

104
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:14,519
Do you dare say
his death has nothing to do with you?

105
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,759
Who told you that Wen Churan is dead?

106
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,559
He's not dead.

107
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,320
If you kill me,

108
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,320
you will never know his whereabouts.

109
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,600
Where is he?!
