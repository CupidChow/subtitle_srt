00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,400
[Episode 11]

2
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,712
[Palace of Prince Ning]

3
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:10,680
[See you at the same place]

4
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,712
See you at the same place.

5
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,840
Your Highness,
blue is prudent, purple is noble,

6
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,439
white is lively.

7
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:27,280
Which outfit shall you put on
to meet the consort today?

8
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,120
We're going to talk business today.

9
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,680
Yellow is good, majestic.

10
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,680
The consort will surely like it.

11
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,760
I've told you that we have important matters
to discuss today.

12
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,552
This outfit works.

13
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,359
Aren't we here to discuss countermeasures?

14
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,599
Aren't you dressed a little…

15
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,599
The Crown Prince holds
the secret agent of Qinglan.

16
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,479
He's got his people all over the place.

17
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:16,039
No matter what you wear,
you will be discovered.

18
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:24,120
Then we won't put on a show.

19
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,336
Let's sit down and talk.

20
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,759
Does this look like a romantic meeting?

21
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:59,719
You don't have to hold me like this, do you?

22
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:03,560
Zhuo You are not the only secret agent
in this palace.

23
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,840
Did you find the person
who is trading with Datar?

24
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,936
The Crown Prince.

25
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,319
You still have to find his weak spot.

26
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,280
My brother is ruthless by nature.

27
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,719
He doesn't have any weak spot.

28
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,919
Not necessarily.

29
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:25,360
The maid beside him that day

30
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,840
is not just anybody to him.

31
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,159
But we have no evidence.

32
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,000
If there is no evidence,
we can create evidence.

33
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,240
I have one more thing to ask you.

34
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,439
Why did you leave
without saying goodbye that day?

35
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,408
I…

36
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,319
I ran into some trouble that day.

37
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,000
Y-You didn't run into any danger that day?

38
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,719
Ran into some trouble that day.
Is that all you can say?

39
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,159
Do you know how worried I was about you?

40
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,360
Little dumpling!

41
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,519
Little dumpling!

42
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,399
Little dumpling!

43
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:45,839
Little dumpling, little dumpling!

44
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:51,120
Little dumpling, little dumpling,
where are you?

45
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:59,027
♫ Jade has chains,
and falling leaves have floating roots ♫

46
00:04:59,027 --> 00:05:03,008
♫ Layers of snow falls upon me ♫

47
00:05:03,008 --> 00:05:05,888
♫ With pen in hand,
I depict the old friend on paper ♫

48
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:09,319
♫ Your brows and eyes are as fresh as ever ♫

49
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,720
So, you went looking for me?

50
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,992
I've been looking for you
ever since I returned to the capital.

51
00:05:12,992 --> 00:05:14,040
Why haven't I ever run into you?

52
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,759
When have you ever come looking for me?

53
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:19,839
I have been there every day
since the beginning of winter.

54
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:23,199
It was the day you met me.

55
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,079
When I see injustice on the road,
I will draw my sword to assist.

56
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,920
This is what my grandfather has taught me
since I was little.

57
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,600
And if you really are a big shot,

58
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,240
then I saved you today,

59
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,387
and you must repay me a great deal one day.

60
00:05:38,387 --> 00:05:45,184
♫ Just like the wind blows out the flames
into ashes ♫

61
00:05:45,184 --> 00:05:52,040
♫ Recognize you beneath your name ♫

62
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,152
The beginning of winter?

63
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:01,920
Then I have indeed seldom been there.

64
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,439
Miss, are you going to wait for him again?

65
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,360
He is but a passerby.

66
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,399
Miss, there is no need to be so concerned.

67
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,199
It's our fate to meet each other.

68
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,439
He doesn't seem like someone who has a family.

69
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,240
If I am not concerned,

70
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,920
then there will be no one else
to care about him.

71
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,800
Perhaps he has long forgotten about you.

72
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,904
It's good enough to be alive.

73
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,879
How is it that you, a young child,
are alone on the mountain?

74
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:32,000
How did you get up here?

75
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,879
Let me tell you,
the person you're looking for is back.

76
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,079
Thank you, young lady.

77
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:28,399
If there is a future, I'll repay with my life.

78
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,639
If there is a future, I'll repay with my life.

79
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,160
Fate really toys with people.

80
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,720
If the one I had met in the forest
that day was you,

81
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,800
our Wen family might not have to go through
all these.

82
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,079
Do you mean, if you had met me,

83
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:56,040
you would not have gotten engaged
to someone else?

84
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,680
When did I ever say such a thing.

85
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,959
It's getting late.

86
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,079
After talking for so long,
I have to take my leave.

87
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,240
What the consort said is absolutely true.

88
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,219
What consort?

89
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:21,800
[Hall of Yanming]

90
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,000
Your Majesty, my father,
I beg you to spare my mother.

91
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,759
It's our rule that the birth mother
of the prince selected as heir must die.

92
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,600
To become the Emperor, your mother must die!

93
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,360
You are the Crown Prince.
You are not allowed to have any weak point!

94
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,759
Heng, you must become the Crown Prince,

95
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:37,960
become the Emperor,
and overturn the case for your uncle.

96
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,256
Your Highness, are you alright?

97
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,799
Your Highness had a dream of your mother again?

98
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,960
I will get the calming incense.

99
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:52,639
You go and send someone…
Send someone to inform Datar.

100
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,519
He acts recklessly.
Don't let him cause trouble in the capital.

101
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,240
Datar is so unscrupulous.

102
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,320
Your Highness, do you still wish
to continue cooperating with him?

103
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,720
The Seventh Prince married
the Prime Minister's daughter,

104
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,879
forming factions in the court.

105
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,279
Xiao Chen, with his military achievements,
has gained the trust of the Emperor again.

106
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,559
If I lose

107
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,879
the soldiers and gold of the Qinglan now,

108
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,360
what will I use to contend against them.

109
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,440
My mother must not die in vain.

110
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,296
Your Highness, Zanda, the prince of Qinglan,

111
00:09:27,296 --> 00:09:30,039
has been wanting to replace Datar
in trading with us.

112
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,759
I'll go and contact him.

113
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:37,519
Good. As for others who pose a threat to me,
eliminate them all.

114
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,528
Yes.

115
00:09:51,764 --> 00:09:54,664
[Evidence of Sun Cheng's Betrayal is
at Flower Pavilion]

116
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:05,320
Lord Sun, have you heard about what happened
at the Seeking Fragrance Feast the other day?

117
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,399
The Crown Prince did it
to carry on with the business.

118
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,480
Nowadays, the court is conducting
strict investigation.

119
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,440
This purple gold clearance must go through
several checkpoints.

120
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,279
But I've heard

121
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,679
that all the people
at these checkpoints are yours now.

122
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:33,480
Let's do it this way.
When you do business with our prince,

123
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,720
you get sixty percent,
and we get forty percent of the profits.

124
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,279
How does that sound?

125
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,840
What about the Crown Prince then?

126
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,559
Even a great general
from the Wen family can disappear…

127
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,960
The Crown Prince, well,
everyone covets his position,

128
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,559
and he has got many enemies.

129
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:53,080
Who knows, maybe one day he will disappear too.

130
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,279
My Lord, you should not talk such nonsense.

131
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,759
I'm not insisting on your promise today.

132
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,159
I just have a few boxes of gold,

133
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:08,240
that I need you to deliver in person.

134
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,039
One of these boxes is for you.

135
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:18,840
Thank you very much then, my Lord.

136
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,080
Are you a man of the Qinglan prince?

137
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,039
How come it's just you alone?

138
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:54,919
You can't carry so much gold by yourself.

139
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,919
[Pass Permit]
This is the pass permit.

140
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,279
I've already taken mine.

141
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,368
This box is for you.

142
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,784
I didn't embezzle it.

143
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,240
Those at His Highness's side
cannot be traitors.

144
00:12:25,683 --> 00:12:27,720
[Pass Permit]

145
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,440
I thought I would lure out
that prince of Qinglan.

146
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,559
Didn't expect it to be these people.

147
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,504
Are you alright?

148
00:12:57,504 --> 00:12:59,592
It's nothing.

149
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,664
She is also injured.

150
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,448
Let's go.

151
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,919
How much are you keeping from me?

152
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,548
From the beginning to the end,
I've only kept one thing from you.

153
00:13:50,548 --> 00:13:57,512
