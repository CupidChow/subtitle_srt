00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:05,736
[Episode 1]

2
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,519
Wan,
are you satisfied with our wedding ceremony?

3
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:35,079
You don't really want to marry me.

4
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:39,159
That's right, it's a complete and utter sham.

5
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,280
Su Xuanjing!

6
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,799
You're in over your head.

7
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,439
I had already put muscle relaxant
in the wedding wine.

8
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,599
Tonight, all of your Wen family
will die at my hands.

9
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,520
What about my grandfather?
What have you done to him?

10
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,520
Wan, don't cry.

11
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,656
Grandfather!

12
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,159
Every second he lives is suffering for him.

13
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,960
I gave him a quick end.

14
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,120
Aren't you going to thank me?

15
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,400
Su Xuanjing!

16
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,479
What is the intention of your Qinglan caravan

17
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,599
to sneak into Da'an?

18
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,400
Sooner or later,
your Da'an will belong to Qinglan.

19
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,360
I come and go as I please.

20
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:00,120
Such crazy talk.

21
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,840
How many defeats has Qinglan suffered

22
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,199
from the Wen family's army?

23
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:12,759
You've only had a few years of peace,
and now you're courting death again.

24
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:16,919
[Prisoner]
The Wen family? Haven't you heard?

25
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:20,000
Your Da'an has rotted from the root up.

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,879
What good is the Wen family?

27
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:23,039
Dare to scorn Da'an again,

28
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,240
and I slaughter you right now.

29
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,800
Today she is getting married,
it is not fitting to see blood.

30
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:35,719
The wedding… you're talking about Miss Wen?

31
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:39,520
Since you're so affectionate towards her,

32
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,120
why don't you go and have a wedding drink
to send her off on her final journey?

33
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,184
What do you mean?

34
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,800
Gather the troops.
Quickly to the Wen Residence.

35
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,880
Yes.

36
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,800
I trusted you, loved you.

37
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:05,319
Yet you slaughtered my entire Wen family.

38
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,280
I, Wen Wan, swear here today.

39
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,480
If there is an afterlife,
I will make sure you suffer.

40
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,560
A debt of blood--

41
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:28,160
I, Su Xuanjing, don't believe in an afterlife.

42
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:23,000
Your Highness, what does this mean?

43
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,279
You killed them.

44
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,000
Your Highness, I am here by imperial decree.

45
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,639
The Wen family's collusion
with Qinglan is an unforgivable crime.

46
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,560
I think you are the one
whose crime is unforgivable.

47
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,608
Kill them all!

48
00:06:01,171 --> 00:06:04,136

Miss, you are up.

Ziyu…

62
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,776
Ziyu…

63
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,480
What's up with you?

64
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,319
Where are we?

65
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:11,639
Miss, you are dazed from your sleep.

66
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,879
Didn't you say we're to celebrate
Master Su's birthday

67
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,399
at Flower Pavilion?

68
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,319
Why do you seem to have amnesia now?

69
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:20,120
Flower Pavilion… Birthday?

70
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,800
Wasn't that a month ago
on the day Su Xuanjing proposed?

71
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,680
Where's Grandfather?

72
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,279
Old Marquis is surely at home.

73
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,399
Miss, Master Su is coming right--

74
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,440
Wan.

75
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,480
Su Xuanjing…

76
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,240
Wan, hear me out.

77
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,240
I-I was late,
because I was preparing a gift for you.

78
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,600
The Su family heirloom bracelet?

79
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,648
How did you know?

80
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:04,759
Tomorrow,
take it to propose at the Wen Residence.

81
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:08,559
We'll get married in three days.

82
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,992
What did you say?

83
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,759
Wan, are you really willing to marry me?

84
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:23,080
Of course, and not only that,

85
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,424
I also want you to enter officialdom
as the Wen family's son-in-law.

86
00:09:27,424 --> 00:09:28,480
Wan…

87
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,200
The position of Prince's Master of Ceremonies
is still vacant, a proper sixth rank.

88
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,879
I don't know if it's worthy of your talents.

89
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,639
But Old Marquis Wen never likes his descendants
to gain positions through family influence.

90
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:45,159
I'll persuade Grandfather myself.

91
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,440
I'm just afraid I don't deserve it.

92
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,840
You treat me with such deep affection
and righteousness.

93
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,728
The Wen family

94
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:04,120
will surely treat you fairly.

95
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,759
Wan, you are so kind to me.

96
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,320
You deserve all of this.

97
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,600
Starting over again,
I must make you pay the price.
