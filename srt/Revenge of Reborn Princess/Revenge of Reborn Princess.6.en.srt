00:01:03,123 --> 00:01:06,856
[Episode 6]

2
00:01:10,547 --> 00:01:16,128
♫ Catch the last butterfly of spring ♫

3
00:01:16,128 --> 00:01:22,088
♫ Exchange for the distant moon in the sky ♫

4
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,024
♫ I ask the moon why it's hard to stay full ♫

5
00:01:29,024 --> 00:01:35,648
♫ Unable to retain the yearning
buried deep in the heart ♫

6
00:01:35,648 --> 00:01:38,624
♫ If sleepless in the mountains,
gazing at the moon face to face ♫

7
00:01:38,624 --> 00:01:42,336
♫ Whispering secrets,
the evening breeze never rests ♫

8
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:50,184
♫ Carry away the long-lasting yearning ♫

9
00:01:51,507 --> 00:01:54,240
♫ The waves embrace the rocks ♫

10
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,952
♫ Have they waited for a thousand years ♫

11
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:00,288
♫ Sweep away the gravel ♫

12
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:04,512
♫ Wait for the next tide to meet again ♫

13
00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:07,360
♫ The spring breeze
blows away the fleeting time ♫

14
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,488
♫ Yet only caring for the waxing and waning
of the moon ♫

15
00:02:11,488 --> 00:02:15,136
♫ How many hardships and wanderings
have been endured ♫

16
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:22,216
♫ Falling upon your brows ♫

17
00:02:31,456 --> 00:02:34,944
♫ If weary in the mountains,
the moon serves as a pillow ♫

18
00:02:34,944 --> 00:02:38,016
♫ Floating and sinking in the dreams,
the footsteps never cease ♫

19
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:43,552
♫ Just for that fleeting glimpse
of astonishment ♫

20
00:02:43,552 --> 00:02:47,328
♫ You are the late-coming moon
over the mountains ♫

21
00:02:47,328 --> 00:02:50,304
♫ I am the lingering wind
that once brushed by ♫

22
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:52,992
♫ Toss and turn through the mortal world ♫

23
00:02:52,992 --> 00:02:57,152
♫ Only to linger in each night sky ♫

24
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:00,416
♫ May we have a moment, shoulder to shoulder ♫

25
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:04,096
♫ Time is but in the blink of an eye ♫

26
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:07,680
♫ It becomes an insurmountable divide
between mountains and seas ♫

27
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,928
♫ An affection that cannot be touched ♫

28
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:19,208
♫ The story of characters in the song is told ♫

29
00:03:19,712 --> 00:03:24,456
♫ Who will untie this knot ♫

30
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,120
Come on.

31
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,152
Let's go.

32
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:36,083
♫ Have they waited for a thousand years ♫

33
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,599
♫ Sweep away the gravel ♫

34
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,159
Don't force yourself
to like something you don't.

35
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,272
♫ The spring breeze
blows away the fleeting time ♫

36
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:50,496
Come on.

37
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:54,504
♫ How many hardships and wanderings
have been endured ♫

38
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,960
You've found out so much about my preferences.

39
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,280
What exactly are you after?

40
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:11,319
Do you like releasing sky lanterns?

41
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,759
It is said that
as long as the sky lanterns are high enough,

42
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:19,519
they can make the deity hear our wishes.

43
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,504
And you believe that?

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,759
I would rather believe

45
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,199
that the wishes fulfilled by the deity

46
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,959
have already been compensated for
in the unknown.

47
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,624
You don't understand.

48
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:52,319
Some wishes are worth dying for.

49
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,439
But if you die,

50
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,720
how would you know if your wish is fulfilled?

51
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,759
The deity is trustworthy.

52
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:09,800
He will surely keep you alive
until the moment your wish comes true.

53
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,319
As long as someone is willing to pay the price,

54
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,920
the deity will grant him a wish.

55
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,279
Little deity, where should I go to make a wish?

56
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:29,120
Someone has already made your wish for you.

57
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,936
What's the matter?

58
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:48,488
It's nothing.

59
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,959
Well, thank you, my lord, for today.

60
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,352
I have to go.

61
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,920
Wan'er, run!

62
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:45,040
Grandfather!

63
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,616
Why…

64
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,600
It's time for me to give you the jade pendant
I prayed for you.

65
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,039
Wan, Wan!

66
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,848
Wan!

67
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:48,000
Wan, what's going on?

68
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:51,480
Wan, how could this happen?

69
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,279
We have already caught the real culprit behind.

70
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:59,392
♫ The wind and the moon arrive
as promised on long nights ♫

71
00:08:59,392 --> 00:09:03,763
♫ Granting me dreams within dreams ♫

72
00:09:03,763 --> 00:09:06,899
♫ Years pass by like a dream ♫

73
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:11,304
♫ Unite with you after lives apart ♫

74
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:15,000
I cannot keep you safe in this life.

75
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,683
I shall pray for another life.

76
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:24,704
♫ Like wind through the pavilion,
destined to bring rain on the mountain ♫

77
00:09:24,704 --> 00:09:30,803
♫ Two flustered souls meet ♫

78
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:34,408
♫ The foreshadowing has been set ♫

79
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,080
Miss, you are up.

80
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,679
Where is Su Xuanjing?

81
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,399
He said he would celebrate your birthday.

82
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,080
He should be arriving soon.

83
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,000
Wan, I am late.

84
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,840
Ziyu, off you go now.

85
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,440
I have something to say to Master Su alone.

86
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,919
Who is the person behind Sun Cheng?

87
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,928
What are you talking about?

88
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:15,639
I forgot, you haven't seen his face.

89
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:19,240
It seems you also don't know
what his relationship is with Xiao Chen.

90
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,440
Xiao Chen… Sun Cheng?

91
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,960
Su Xuanjing,
you're now nothing but a pretty face.

92
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:35,879
How could I have been so blind
to have loved you that much?

93
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:40,559
Wan, why are you acting so weird today?

94
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:42,919
It's nothing.
I just don't want to pretend anymore.

95
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:46,080
You can do as you please in front of me.

96
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:52,639
Is that so? Then I won't hold back.

97
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,879
Wait, I got a wrong move.

98
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,392
Please, my lord.

99
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,440
You little rascal, blocking my way again.

100
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,320
Can you just lay low a bit?

101
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,240
Let's have another round. One more round.

102
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,200
My lord, once or twice is tolerable,
but not a third time.

103
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
I've made concessions,
if not ten steps, then at least eight.

104
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,240
- You cannot possibly--
- Grandfather!

105
00:11:41,888 --> 00:11:42,960
Grandfather!

106
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,799
Wan, you are back.

107
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:01,267
♫ The light of the fireflies scatters away ♫

108
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:05,587
♫ Swaying in the wind within wind ♫

109
00:12:05,587 --> 00:12:08,320
♫ The wind and the moon arrive
as promised on long nights ♫

110
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,072
♫ Granting me dreams within dreams ♫

111
00:12:12,704 --> 00:12:15,328
♫ Words ready to be spoken
ultimately fall silent ♫

112
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:19,200
♫ Reunite with you after lives apart ♫

113
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:26,483
♫ Love and hate pass by in haste ♫

114
00:12:26,483 --> 00:12:33,440
♫ Winter has its arrival,
flowers have their withering ♫

115
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:40,352
♫ The light in your eyes remains evergreen
through the years ♫

116
00:12:40,352 --> 00:12:47,520
♫ Just like the wind blows out the flames
into ashes ♫

117
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:53,600
♫ Recognize you beneath your name ♫

118
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,640
♫ Willing to write for you,
against the current ♫

119
00:12:58,771 --> 00:13:05,632
♫ Spring has the intention to come,
you have the intention to return ♫

120
00:13:05,632 --> 00:13:11,744
♫ Two flustered souls meet ♫

121
00:13:11,744 --> 00:13:15,368
♫ The foreshadowing has been set ♫
