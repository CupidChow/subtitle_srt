00:01:03,123 --> 00:01:06,760
[Episode 19]

2
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,784
Xiao Chen…

3
00:01:55,763 --> 00:01:58,451
♫ The light of the fireflies scatters away ♫

4
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:01,640
♫ Swaying in the wind within wind ♫

5
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,120
I have no idea
where all these fireflies came from.

6
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,875
I know you like it.

7
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,352
♫ Granting me dreams within dreams ♫

8
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,107
♫ Years pass by like a dream ♫

9
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:16,512
♫ Unite with you after lives apart ♫

10
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:22,632
♫ Vivid memories of love and loathing ♫

11
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:30,880
♫ Spring has the intention to come,
you have the intention to return ♫

12
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,039
♫ If love carries faith,
it's the guidance of time ♫

13
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:38,131
You scared me to death.

14
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:44,960
♫ Like wind through the pavilion,
destined to bring rain on the mountain ♫

15
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,155
♫ Two flustered souls meet ♫

16
00:02:51,155 --> 00:02:54,088
♫ The foreshadowing has been set ♫

17
00:03:34,304 --> 00:03:37,267
♫ Jade has chains,
and falling leaves have floating roots ♫

18
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:40,584
♫ Layers of snow falls upon me ♫

19
00:03:41,331 --> 00:03:44,032
♫ With pen in hand,
I depict the old friend on paper ♫

20
00:03:44,032 --> 00:03:47,720
♫ Your brows and eyes are as fresh as ever ♫

21
00:03:48,544 --> 00:03:51,040
♫ Words ready to be spoken
ultimately fall silent ♫

22
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,912
♫ Reunite with you after lives apart ♫

23
00:03:54,912 --> 00:04:02,259
♫ Love and hate pass by in haste ♫

24
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:09,280
♫ Winter has its arrival,
flowers have their withering ♫

25
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:16,640
♫ The light in your eyes remains evergreen
through the years ♫

26
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:23,616
♫ Like wind through the pavilion,
destined to bring rain on the mountain ♫

27
00:04:23,616 --> 00:04:29,779
♫ Two flustered souls meet ♫

28
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:33,256
♫ The foreshadowing has been set ♫

29
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,399
Ziyu, Ziyu!

30
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,680
Miss.

31
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,480
When did I get back?

32
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,319
Wasn't I in the prince's residence?

33
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,360
Last night you went to play with
the young lady of the Palace of Prince Qi.

34
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,480
You must have drunk too much
and forgotten all about it.

35
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:15,000
What Palace of Prince Qi?
I'm talking about the Palace of Prince Ning.

36
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,279
Miss, what are you talking about?

37
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:19,959
There is no such thing
as the Palace of Prince Ning in the world.

38
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:23,959
Xiao Chen's Palace of Prince Ning.

39
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:27,040
W-What Xiao Chen?

40
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,920
The Seventh Prince, Xiao Chen.

41
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,800
There are only six princes.

42
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,160
Who is Xiao Chen?

43
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,600
Miss, perhaps you've read too many storybooks.

44
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,519
Is there still a way out?

45
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,680
This is the fate of his choice.

46
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,079
At this point,
the outcome can no longer be changed.

47
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:57,319
Just accept it.

48
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:04,240
After today,
everything related to him will disappear.

49
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,680
You will forget about him too.

50
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,680
I can't! I can't!

51
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,720
If someone still remembers him
after three years,

52
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,040
he might be able to come back.

53
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,040
This is all I can help you with. The rest…

54
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,759
He was able to rescue me from your hands,

55
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,319
I will certainly be able to rescue him too.

56
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,208
It's him again.

57
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,439
He is the current Emperor's seventh prince.

58
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,240
The spirited Imperial Guard.

59
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,399
He saved your life three times
at the risk of his own.

60
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,879
He loves you desperately.

61
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,240
The only flaw is he doesn't exist.

62
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,040
He did exist before.

63
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:07,000
You just don't remember.

64
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,279
Miss, not a single person
in the entire capital remembers him.

65
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,399
What does that prove?

66
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,600
It proves that such a person never exists.

67
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,519
So, you need to stop being so stubborn.

68
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,392
Go hang it up.

69
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,816
Yes.

70
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,519
Xiao Chen, I will definitely bring you back.

71
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,120
Wan, do you like the portrait
I painted for you yesterday?

72
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,000
Leave me alone.

73
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,216
Hi, here is your tea.

74
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,319
Don't behave like this,
or you won't be able to see me.

75
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:53,040
What are you doing? Let me go!

76
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,560
Dear sister, don't you remember me?

77
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,319
You used to laugh and sing for money.

78
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,279
I have spent quite a bit of silver on you.

79
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,560
That was before.

80
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,639
Flower Pavilion is no longer
a place of romance.

81
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,744
Let me go!

82
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,959
Why are you pretending between the two of us?

83
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,240
Did you not understand what she said?

84
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,480
Who are you?

85
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,240
Mind your own business, or I'll beat you up.

86
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,600
Go ahead and let me see.

87
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,680
Only when you beat him up,

88
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,176
can I, the county lord,
bring someone to uphold justice,

89
00:08:26,176 --> 00:08:27,279
and arrest you.

90
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,040
C-County lord…

91
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,039
The new owner of Flower Pavilion,
L-Lady Wen of the county?

92
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,192
You know who owns this place
and still dare to run wild here.

93
00:08:36,192 --> 00:08:37,240
Do you want to die?

94
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,039
Lady Wen, spare me, spare my life!

95
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,039
I wouldn't dare!

96
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:43,120
If you dare come to Flower Pavilion again,
I will break your legs.

97
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,360
- I wouldn't dare.
- Hurry up and get out!

98
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
- Wan--
- You get out too.

99
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:00,600
Thank you, Lady Wen of the County.

100
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,960
Are you alright?

101
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,008
I'm fine.

102
00:09:04,672 --> 00:09:05,799
Where is Xueji?

103
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,816
She…

104
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,440
What a perfect match!
A noble lady and a young general.

105
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,759
The county lord and the prince.

106
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,320
You have no idea.
It's all thanks to your storybook,

107
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,879
that the business of my tea house
is getting better and better.

108
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,720
How did you come up with it?

109
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,720
I've told you many times.

110
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,080
These are all real experiences
between me and Xiao Chen.

111
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's just way too real.

112
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,080
He is a very popular figure now.

113
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,120
The women of the capital

114
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,704
all look forward to having such a gentleman.

115
00:09:40,704 --> 00:09:41,728
I've heard that

116
00:09:41,728 --> 00:09:44,799
not only was his portrait made into
a life-size doll,

117
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:47,320
but also a jade statue was carved for him.

118
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,559
Miss! Miss!

119
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,799
Outside… Outside…

120
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:06,200
[Gamble]

121
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,480
Who is he?

122
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,879
Looks exactly like the character
from Lady Wen's storybook.

123
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,639
This is Xiao Chen, the Seventh Prince.

124
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,600
There really is a Seventh Prince?!

125
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,840
Miss, you're so incredible.

126
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,519
The Seventh Prince is really named Xiao Chen.

127
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,039
And he is exactly the same as
described in your storybook.

128
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,360
He is also a member of the Imperial Guard.

129
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,279
It is said
that he is the Emperor's illegitimate son.

130
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:24,200
He was taken out of the imperial palace
shortly after birth.

131
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,200
He was only summoned back to the capital
after what happened to the Crown Prince.

132
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,360
Miss, he looks exactly like the portrait
you painted.
