00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,792
[Episode 4]

2
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,200
If I remember correctly,

3
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,719
at this time in the previous life,

4
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:12,760
The Imperial Guard caught a Qinglan felon.

5
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,040
If I can find him,

6
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,159
and convince him to help me
decode the Qinglan cipher,

7
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,000
I would surely know
who is after the Wen family.

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,160
Young man,

9
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,239
I'd like to ask a favor of you.

10
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,280
In the Imperial Prison,
it's better to find me than him for help.

11
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:37,096
Your Highness.

12
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,439
I just want someone to buy me
some quality food and wine.

13
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,640
I won't trouble Your Highness.

14
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,344
Are these enough?

15
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,480
Is this an inn or a prison?

16
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,840
The Imperial Prison never mistreats prisoners.

17
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,599
The evidence is conclusive
that Su Xuanjing framed a meritorious official.

18
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,039
His Majesty has ceased to pursue
your fault in killing him.

19
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,680
Why do you still choose to stay
in the Imperial Prison?

20
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,879
The Imperial Prison is cozier and safer
than an inn.

21
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,520
I wish to stay a few more days.

22
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,080
Are you treating me as your guard?

23
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,759
Your Highness, that Qinglan prisoner
in the dungeon is causing trouble again.

24
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,816
He's clamoring to see you.

25
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,960
Give me the key.

26
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,400
I will meet him in person.

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,159
I am encumbered with official duties today.

28
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:56,759
I won't disturb your dinner then.

29
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,759
Your Highness, why not stay for a drink?

30
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:06,879
Your Highness once said that the man I married
was not a good-hearted fellow.

31
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,680
Now he's dead,

32
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,479
shouldn't we celebrate?

33
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:14,976
Last time I drank your wedding wine,

34
00:03:14,976 --> 00:03:18,960
I still remember how I came to bad end.

35
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,639
I won't use the same tactic twice.

36
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:24,719
Especially, the wine today

37
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,719
is brought by you.

38
00:03:46,592 --> 00:03:48,319
And what is this for?

39
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,560
I haven't thanked Your Highness
for what happened outside Flower Pavilion.

40
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,279
So, this is your purpose in approaching me.

41
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,399
Your Highness do know how to play drunk.

42
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,079
If I don't get drunk, the wine might run out.

43
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,279
If Your Highness knows my purpose,

44
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,959
why do you treat me with false courtesies?

45
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,759
Miss Wen, please do not be annoyed.

46
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,560
I wish to cooperate with you.

47
00:05:26,803 --> 00:05:29,704
[Prisoner]

48
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,279
The clouds part to reveal Qinglan.

49
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,519
Iron cavalry breaks through Da'an.

50
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,720
You're a person of Qinglan?!

51
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,040
I am the crown prince's secret agent
in the capital.

52
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:43,199
I thought the crown prince had abandoned me.

53
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,199
If you have confessed,
I am here to kill you today.

54
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,639
Of course, I haven't.

55
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,199
Regarding his business of coming to the capital
to meet with the noble,

56
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,199
I haven't said a word to anyone from Da'an.

57
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,879
That is awesome.

58
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,319
Do you still remember the names
of those people?

59
00:05:58,163 --> 00:06:01,448
[Seeking Fragrance Feast Name List]

60
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,560
How could the noble's name be on the list?

61
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:09,199
You are not from Qinglan--

62
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,800
You do have a strong sense of caution.

63
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,839
Did he admit?

64
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,560
He only mentioned a noble in the capital,

65
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,399
who would work with the Qinglan crown prince.

66
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,759
Lady Wen really has a good strategy.

67
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:31,560
Clues that I couldn't find out
even with all my efforts,

68
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,240
you elicited them with just a few words.

69
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,800
It's just a trick.

70
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,600
Your Highness could try it out next time.

71
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,952
You are really drunk?

72
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,759
Go sober up. I still have things for you to do.

73
00:06:58,944 --> 00:07:00,032
Let's go over there.

74
00:07:00,032 --> 00:07:01,040
Alright, let's go.

75
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,600
Your Highness, why come here all of a sudden?

76
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,480
Investigate a case.

77
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,519
Investigate a case?

78
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,480
There is more to Lady Wen
killing her husband in public.

79
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,519
Su Xuanjing has a list in his hands.

80
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,480
This list is of great importance.

81
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,839
Have you heard?

82
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,879
The granddaughter of Lord Wen
killed her husband in public,

83
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,759
because she discovered a list

84
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,360
in Su Xuanjing's hands.

85
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,279
It is said that this list is critical.

86
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,720
She wanted to present it personally
to the Emperor.

87
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,720
You must get the list.

88
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,040
You're dead if you fail to do so.

89
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,152
As you command.

90
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,720
Fire! Hurry and put it out!

91
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,744
Help!

92
00:07:55,744 --> 00:07:56,832
Help!

93
00:07:56,832 --> 00:07:57,856
Help, please!

94
00:07:57,856 --> 00:07:59,519
I haven't opened the door here yet.

95
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,608
- Quick!
- Quick!

96
00:08:00,608 --> 00:08:03,079
- Over here, over here!
- Over here!

97
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,560
Hand over the list you have.

98
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,800
What list?

99
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,000
Quit playing innocent.

100
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,680
Surely it is Su Xuanjing's
list of the Seeking Fragrance Feast.

101
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,240
I know nothing
about the Seeking Fragrance Feast.

102
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,720
He did give me a list.

103
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,920
Is this the list you are looking for?

104
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,279
Has anyone else seen it?

105
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,232
That's good.

106
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,080
Help!

107
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,480
Fire! Hurry, put it out!

108
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:47,000
Have you looked over the list?

109
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,440
No, I dare not.

110
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,600
You've done a good job.

111
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,559
I believe only dead people can keep secrets.

112
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,039
She is dead,
and you still have the nerve to stand here.

113
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,840
I know I am guilty.

114
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,679
This is the granddaughter of Lord Wen.

115
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:21,399
I will immediately dispatch someone
to investigate.

116
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:23,840
We will surely capture the murderer
and bring them to justice.

117
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,720
Is that all?

118
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,360
Well, Your Highness's intention is…

119
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,799
Increase manpower,
and closely monitor all parts of the city.

120
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:35,320
One must have the order
from the Imperial Guard to enter and exit.

121
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,384
As you command.

122
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,639
Everyone's gone, you can get up now.

123
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,216
How is your wound?

124
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,679
I have practiced martial arts
since I was little.

125
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:54,879
Use this minor injury
to lure out the true mastermind.

126
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,480
It's very thoughtful of Your Highness.

127
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,039
Because your opponent is Sun Cheng.

128
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:04,480
Sun Cheng…

129
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,360
What is the deal with
the Seeking Fragrance Feast?

130
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,240
I'm afraid only upon your death

131
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,399
that Sun Cheng will reveal
the Seeking Fragrance Feast.

132
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,639
And he is cunning by nature.

133
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,240
He will personally confirm your death.

134
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,559
Therefore, I need a funeral.

135
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,200
Master Wen,
please bear your sorrow and accept the change.

136
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,360
Your health is of utmost importance.

137
00:10:45,555 --> 00:10:48,232
[Hall of Yanming]

138
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,159
How is it going?

139
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,519
Your Highness, rest assured.

140
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,960
I have personally inspected it.

141
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,759
Wen Wan is indeed dead.

142
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,080
The Seeking Fragrance Feast…

143
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,360
Yes, we must hold the feast,
and hold it with grandeur.

144
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:28,159
If she were alone,

145
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:31,480
how could she possibly send the message
out of the prison.

146
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:36,120
Your Highness wants to catch a turtle in a jar?

147
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,120
You must remember,

148
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,480
anyone who knows about this list must die.

149
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,000
In just a few days,
you have managed both a wedding and a funeral.

150
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,279
Do you have any plans
for dealing with Sun Cheng after this?

151
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,440
I have thought long and hard.

152
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,159
Your Highness is royal
with a conspicuous status.

153
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,240
You're really not suitable to get involved in

154
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,200
the right and wrong of our Wen family.

155
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,840
You are trying to draw a clear line with me.

156
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:13,159
I have already died once.

157
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:15,279
I am not afraid to die again.

158
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,320
But you are different.

159
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,960
How do you know that I haven't died?

160
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,320
I am not talking about
the kind on the battlefield.

161
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,399
Neither am I.

162
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,799
In any case, you have saved my life.

163
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:33,320
I definitely cannot abandon you
at a time like this.

164
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,720
When have I ever saved your life?

165
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,840
Do you really not remember?

166
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,080
Back then, I was being hunted down.

167
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,240
If there is a future, I'll repay with my life,
and pledge myself to you.

168
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,519
Here is a dagger for you.

169
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,960
If you can really make a name for yourself,

170
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,159
be sure to come back to the capital,
and repay the favor.

171
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,240
Okay.

172
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,919
It was just a child's jest.

173
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:18,480
How can I possibly exploit the favor for gain?

174
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,960
Why can't you?

175
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,519
I will obey any command for your sake.

176
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,640
Stop, stop, stop.

177
00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:00,159
How come I've never seen you before?

178
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,840
You do look good, though.

179
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,720
It would be a waste to send you
to the Seeking Fragrance Feast. How about…

180
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,080
My lord, she is just a blockhead.

181
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,919
Let me serve you instead, my lord.

182
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,639
As long as you tell me, my lord,

183
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,639
what exactly
is this Seeking Fragrance Feast about?

184
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,480
Serve what! Just go back and get ready.

185
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,600
Not one of you can be missing
from the Seeking Fragrance Feast.

186
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,279
Thanks a lot.

187
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,600
Someone like you can't be a dancing girl.
Let's go.

188
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,720
Stop right there.

189
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,080
Tonight's Seeking Fragrance Feast is critical.

190
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,240
I must oversee it myself.

191
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:14,759
There are calluses on your hand.

192
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:19,200
I remember that the ladies
of Flower Pavilion never wield swords.

193
00:15:32,883 --> 00:15:35,731
♫ The light of the fireflies scatters away ♫

194
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:40,051
♫ Swaying in the wind within wind ♫

195
00:15:40,051 --> 00:15:42,784
♫ The wind and the moon arrive
as promised on long nights ♫

196
00:15:42,784 --> 00:15:46,536
♫ Granting me dreams within dreams ♫

197
00:15:47,168 --> 00:15:49,792
♫ Words ready to be spoken
ultimately fall silent ♫

198
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:53,664
♫ Reunite with you after lives apart ♫

199
00:15:53,664 --> 00:16:00,947
♫ Love and hate pass by in haste ♫

200
00:16:00,947 --> 00:16:07,904
♫ Winter has its arrival,
flowers have their withering ♫

201
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:14,816
♫ The light in your eyes remains evergreen
through the years ♫

202
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:21,984
♫ Just like the wind blows out the flames
into ashes ♫

203
00:16:21,984 --> 00:16:28,064
♫ Recognize you beneath your name ♫

204
00:16:28,064 --> 00:16:32,104
♫ Willing to write for you,
against the current ♫

205
00:16:33,235 --> 00:16:40,096
♫ Spring has the intention to come,
you have the intention to return ♫

206
00:16:40,096 --> 00:16:46,208
♫ Two flustered souls meet ♫

207
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,832
♫ The foreshadowing has been set ♫
