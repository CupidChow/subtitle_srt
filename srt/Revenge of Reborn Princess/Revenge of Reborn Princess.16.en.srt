00:01:03,782 --> 00:01:06,760
[Episode 16]

2
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,760
[Palace of Prince Ning]
Thank Your Highness for rescuing my sister,

3
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,959
allowing me to have no worries behind.

4
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,920
It's alright.

5
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,920
The guards in the Eastern Palace
change every two hours.

6
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,239
We can disguise ourselves
and enter while they are changing guards.

7
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,560
Your Highness, Miss Ziyu requests to see you.

8
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,519
Ziyu?

9
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,040
Isn't she in the Eastern Palace?

10
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,319
- Let her in quickly.
- Yes.

11
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:37,400
Your Highness, my lady has been placed
under house arrest by the Crown Prince.

12
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,319
What?

13
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,359
Zhuo You,

14
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,760
quickly send someone to investigate
in the Eastern Palace.

15
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,224
Yes, Your Highness.

16
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,040
Your Highness, the envoy
of the prince of Qinglan has come to inquire

17
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,319
if the Seeking Fragrance Feast should continue.

18
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,879
I already have the Wen family.

19
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,040
There is no need to collude
with Qinglan anymore.

20
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,159
Holding the Seeking Fragrance Feast?

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,560
It's better to have Wen Wan behave herself

22
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,479
to be the Crown Princess.

23
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,639
Then what should we do
about the prince of Qinglan?

24
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,199
He sneaked into Da'an and died accidentally.

25
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:16,879
Do I still need to teach you?

26
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,272
I understood.

27
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,400
Your Highness, I have another matter to report.

28
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,879
Someone is investigating Wen Churan.

29
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,680
The Crown Princess has been working hard.

30
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,888
Why not wipe off the sweat.

31
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,280
Go tell the Crown Prince,
there's no need to send someone again.

32
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,360
I won't run away.

33
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,360
It was Prince Ning who sent me.

34
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,159
The Crown Prince's people didn't see you?

35
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,199
With a little trick, it was easily settled.

36
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:16,919
You are just in time.
I have something to tell you.

37
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:19,360
What is it?

38
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,360
I think the prince might remember things
from his past life,

39
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,879
just like we do.

40
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,000
Upon seeing Xiao Chen again,

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,560
arrest him for stain upon the harem.

42
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,040
Yes.

43
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,400
Where is Xiao Chen?

44
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,039
Prince Ning is surely in Palace of Prince Ning.

45
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,080
He really wasn't here?

46
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,000
He is a prince.

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,479
I am the Crown Princess.

48
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,520
We shall follow ethic.

49
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,360
How could we meet in the sleeping quarters?

50
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,992
Are you telling the truth?

51
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,736
I don't believe it.

52
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,439
Why do you care so much about him?

53
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:26,824
Could it be…

54
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,528
that you are jealous?

55
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,480
I am not one to be jealous over everything.

56
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,920
I simply wish to kill him as soon as possible

57
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,160
to spare future troubles.

58
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,879
I heard you even dismissed the lady musician
for my sake.

59
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,824
Then why don't we

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,480
stop the pretense and make it real between us?

61
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,544
What do you say?

62
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,040
You must be crazy.

63
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,120
There's something I've been wanting to ask you.

64
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,759
I've heard that Xiao Chen accompanied you
in reading for half a year.

65
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,759
Just because you received a praise
from the emperor

66
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,199
of being talented and intelligent,

67
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,800
he got hunted down

68
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,959
and fled all the way to the border.

69
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,079
Is it you who sent people hunting him down?

70
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,439
Are you trying to infuriate me?

71
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,800
You really are jealous of him.

72
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,000
- Guards!
- At your service.

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,839
The Crown Princess has gone mad.

74
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,439
- Get someone to watch her closely.
- Yes!

75
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:51,199
Call me crazy when you can't take my words.

76
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,720
You really have some nerve.

77
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,800
Without my permission,

78
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,120
no one is allowed to see her.

79
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,224
Yes!

80
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,360
Are you alright?

81
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,399
I'm fine.

82
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,879
He wouldn't dare hurt me badly.

83
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,639
Come with me.

84
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,639
I will take you away from here.

85
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,879
I haven't found my uncle yet.

86
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,192
Your uncle…

87
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,160
He's dead already.

88
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,360
What nonsense are you talking about?

89
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,000
I've seen

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,600
his severed finger.

91
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,759
That wasn't your uncle's.

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,519
There was a servant in the Eastern Palace

93
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,720
who had a similar scar on his hand.

94
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,120
The Crown Prince spent a hundred taels of gold

95
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,920
to have his finger cut off,

96
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,959
and tricked you into the Eastern Palace.

97
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,240
How could that be?

98
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,959
You've also said,

99
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,199
that men speak kindly

100
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:00,040
in the presence of death.

101
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,600
He had no reason…

102
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:08,839
Who told you that Wen Churan is dead?

103
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:11,304
He's not dead.

104
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,360
If you kill me,

105
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,439
you'll never know his whereabouts.

106
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,144
That's why.

107
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,360
In his previous life, he fought to survive.

108
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,079
In this life,
for military power of the Wen family.

109
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,392
Who killed him?

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,240
It was the Crown Prince.

111
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,000
Your uncle

112
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
was his credential to Qinglan.

113
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,560
Who else knows about this?

114
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,879
I've investigated as much as I could,

115
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,879
but the Crown Prince has
eyes and ears everywhere.

116
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,360
The things I've looked into

117
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,079
will soon reach his ears.

118
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,720
We don't have much time left.

119
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,759
We can't let the Crown Prince know

120
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:38,559
that we are aware of this already.

121
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,799
What's your plan?

122
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,960
Deal with him

123
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,039
as he deals with us.

124
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:50,440
- Here you go.
- Thank you, sister.

125
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,039
- You have one too.
- Thank you, sister.

126
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:54,080
Sister, where is the big brother

127
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,039
you came with last time?

128
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,480
He… He is not able to make it.

129
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,600
From now on, I will come by myself.

130
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,399
Why isn't he coming?

131
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,679
Did he also go to a faraway place?

132
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,159
Here you go.

133
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,200
Lady musician,

134
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,639
once I firmly secure the throne

135
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:13,559
and have the power to protect you,

136
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,639
we shall meet again.

137
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:19,120
Here, have some more.

138
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,639
You're quite nice.

139
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,799
I can help you fulfill

140
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:24,080
whatever wishes you have.

141
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,639
I want to be a good emperor.

142
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,039
What is a good emperor?

143
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,928
I don't know either.

144
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,879
Kid, who gave this to you?

145
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,600
The big brother who was here just now.

146
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,880
Big brother?

147
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,264
Your Highness,

148
00:10:23,264 --> 00:10:25,440
we've found the lady musician.

149
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,480
It seems the Crown Prince
sent the lady musician away

150
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,000
to protect her.

151
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,664
So what do we do next?

152
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,919
What's that sound?

153
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:42,408
I'll go take a look.

154
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,752
Hurry up!

155
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,720
Speak up, who sent you?

156
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,879
I-It's Lord Sun.

157
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:00,200
Sun Cheng?

158
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:05,519
Zhuo You,

159
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,399
do you have another letter

160
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,176
regarding Sun Cheng?

161
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,440
Your Highness, Lord Sun is here.

162
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:25,440
Lord Sun, have you been well?

163
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,480
I have no involvement with Prince Ning.

164
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,600
Have no involvement?

165
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,320
You sent people to my residence

166
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,600
sneaking around.

167
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,639
Isn't that involvement?

168
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:39,120
I am the honorable Deputy Minister
of the Supreme Court.

169
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
I don't need to report to Prince Ning

170
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,879
on my investigation.

171
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:46,320
Investigation.

172
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,080
Why don't you investigate yourself first?

173
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,080
You've embezzled 35,800 taels of silver
in three years.

174
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,000
If my imperial father were to find out,

175
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,879
would you still be able to keep your position?

176
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,320
Your Highness, since you haven't yet

177
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,120
handed the letter over to the Emperor,

178
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,279
but instead summoned me over,

179
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,120
it seems

180
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,759
there's room for negotiation on this matter.

181
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,519
Tell me all about the Crown Prince's plans.

182
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,799
How do you know it's the Crown Prince?

183
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:30,000
He wants me to besiege Palace of Prince Ning
and kill you.

184
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Then place the corpse of the prince of Qinglan

185
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,399
inside your palace,

186
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,960
falsely accusing you of colluding with Qinglan.

187
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,320
Killing two birds with one stone.

188
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,919
Killing two birds with one stone.

189
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,080
I want you to go ahead
and kill the prince of Qinglan.

190
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,000
But as for the rest,

191
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,200
you'll follow my arrangements.

192
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,228
♫ The light of the fireflies scatters away ♫

193
00:13:06,228 --> 00:13:10,548
♫ Swaying in the wind within wind ♫

194
00:13:10,548 --> 00:13:13,281
♫ The wind and the moon arrive
as promised on long nights ♫

195
00:13:13,281 --> 00:13:17,033
♫ Granting me dreams within dreams ♫

196
00:13:17,665 --> 00:13:20,289
♫ Words ready to be spoken
ultimately fall silent ♫

197
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:24,161
♫ Reunite with you after lives apart ♫

198
00:13:24,161 --> 00:13:31,444
♫ Love and hate pass by in haste ♫

199
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:38,401
♫ Winter has its arrival,
flowers have their withering ♫

200
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:45,313
♫ The light in your eyes remains evergreen
through the years ♫

201
00:13:45,313 --> 00:13:52,481
♫ Just like the wind blows out the flames
into ashes ♫

202
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:58,561
♫ Recognize you beneath your name ♫

203
00:13:58,561 --> 00:14:02,601
♫ Willing to write for you,
against the current ♫

204
00:14:03,732 --> 00:14:10,593
♫ Spring has the intention to come,
you have the intention to return ♫

205
00:14:10,593 --> 00:14:16,705
♫ Two flustered souls meet ♫

206
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:20,329
♫ The foreshadowing has been set ♫
