00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,920
I know you want to ask me
who is trying to kill you.

3
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,840
I will not tell you.

4
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,879
If you can't kill me,

5
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:18,040
he will send someone else to do so.

6
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,200
Why should I bother asking you.

7
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,519
Then why are you here?

8
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,719
Xiao Chen is a person
who values loyalty and friendship.

00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:27,120
If you die in his Imperial Prison,

10
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,879
he will be the one who suffers.

11
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:31,599
I didn't expect you to be so kind to him.

12
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,359
He would surely be happy to know it.

13
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,440
Mind your own business.

14
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,319
It turns out she does care about me.

look, this is for you. Here you go.

This one is mine.

Wan,

19
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,504
what do you want to tell me?

21
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:17,280
I misunderstood Your Highness earlier.

22
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,759
That's why I wanted to feign marriage,

23
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,039
to lurk on your side.

24
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:25,360
Now that the misunderstanding has been cleared,

25
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,000
I should not continue to occupy
the position of the consort.

26
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,560
Your Highness just needs to press
your fingerprint on the Divorce Agreement.

27
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,599
Our marriage

28
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,039
can thus be dissolved.

29
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,400

00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,799
From today on,
I will settle down in this palace.

Wan, I am not old-fashioned.

67
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:00,720
If you two are incompatible,
divorce is permissible.

But if you act impulsively…

69
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,080

we get along pretty well.

73

then I can go home with peace of mind.

we're sleeping in separate rooms.

There's still something fishy
about this matter.

83
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,679
That day, I followed Zhuo You.

84

that he was meeting with Sun Cheng in private.

You… followed Zhuo You?

86
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,200
Then you knew all along
that I was suspecting you.

87
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,960
Why didn't you explain?

88
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:53,000
I had no evidence.

If there are still questions on this matter,

we must continue to investigate Sun Cheng.

But Grandfather is now in your palace,

94
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,639
it's really inconvenient for us to investigate.

95
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,000
It seems we have to find a way
to make him leave soon.

96
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,320
I didn't expect Sun Cheng
to be so meticulous in his actions.

97
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,080
You've known all along that Zhuo You
and he are serving the same master.

98
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,039
Why have you never brought up
interrogating Zhuo You?

99
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,360
Didn't you say he must have had his reasons?

100
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:09,080

he surely would have done so already.
