00:01:03,156 --> 00:01:06,920
[Episode 2]

2
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:22,760
My lord,
Wen Wan has proposed to marry me in three days.

3
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,560
You sure are good at dealing with women.

4
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,599
Rest assured, after this is settled,

5
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:33,519
the position
of Prince's Master of Ceremonies will be yours.

6
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,400
I will surely repay your kindness with loyalty.

7
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,359
It's just that the Wen family

8
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:44,760
has also offered me the position
of Prince's Master of Ceremonies.

9
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,959
That Lord Wen is already advanced in years.

10
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:51,480
How much longer
can he protect you in the court.

11
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,200
That being said,

12
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,280
Wen Wan is, after all, my wife-to-be.

13
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,560
And the position of Prince's Attendant,
a proper fifth rank,

14
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,400
is not an insignificant official position.

15
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,640
I see.
Thanks much for your high regard, my lord.

16
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,199
I will surely serve my lord with all my effort.

17
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,800
Who do you think you are?

18
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,319
In that case, die along with the Wen family.

19
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,199
Don't make a sound, or I will kill you.

20
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,479
Your Highness, I am back.

21
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,560
Let's set off.

22
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,720
As you command, Your Highness.

23
00:03:45,811 --> 00:03:49,064
[Wen Residence]

24
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,080
Miss Wen,
we have arrived at the Marquis's residence.

25
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,120
You do recognize me.

26
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,439
Rest assured, Miss Wen.

27
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,840
We haven't met each other tonight.

28
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,039
If what happened today ever become known,

29
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:08,800
I will surely come back to take your life.

30
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,520
I will take it to heart.

31
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,399
Your hand was a bit cold just now.

32
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,040
Thank you.

33
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,168
Miss.

34
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,360
Miss, how did you get involved with him.

35
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,120
Him? Do you know him?

36
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,480
He is Prince Ning,

37
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,279
quite a hit in the capital lately.

38
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,759
He went missing mysteriously
at the age of seven,

39
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,920
and came back from the frontier out of the blue
three months ago,

40
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,480
being transformed into
a member of the Imperial Guard.

41
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,839
It is said that the Emperor favors him greatly.

42
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,680
He has even sent a card to our residence.

43
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,639
But it was declined by the Master
on the pretext of illness.

44
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,639
Grandfather doesn't favor him?

45
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:29,120
Indeed, we do not welcome such celebrities.

46
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,959
It's not because of that.

47
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,480
There's a widespread rumor in the capital,

48
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,160
His Highness carries a fierce aura
and has a very tough fate.

49
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,639
Isn't it good to have a tough fate?

50
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,759
A tough fate is good indeed.

51
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,199
If he causes trouble,
even Death dare not take him,

52
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,920
and would send him back to us with respect.

53
00:06:00,372 --> 00:06:03,144
[Wen Residence]

54
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,439
Young master, our Miss is not in at the moment.

55
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,680
Let me take you to rest first.

56
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,079
Has everyone left the study?

57
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,040
They've all left.
Let's just wait for the fish to bite.

58
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,560
Wen Wan, let me tell you the truth.

59
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,839
The letter of recommendation
that I used to knock on

60
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:25,120
the door of your Wen family,

61
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,839
and the letter of treason
that I presented to His Majesty today,

62
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:31,720
were both forged
in your uncle's handwriting by me.

63
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,959
As for your uncle…

64
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,120
What happened to my uncle?

65
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,800
What happened to my uncle?

66
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:44,480
Su Xuanjing,
what you did to me on our wedding day,

67
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,680
I will surely double it to you.

68
00:07:05,204 --> 00:07:10,504
[Wen Churan]

69
00:07:14,163 --> 00:07:17,576
[Memorial to the Emperor]

70
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,839
Secretary Supervisor?

71
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:23,639
The Wen family intends to promote me
to Secretary Supervisor?

72
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,199
This is a fourth-rank official position.

73
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,680
You dare to steal my seal,

74
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,079
and petition for an official position
for that guy.

75
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,439
You've completely disgraced the Wen family.

76
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,800
Grandfather, please hear me out.

77
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,399
As long as I can keep him by my side,

78
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,720
I will help him
even if you don't see me as your granddaughter.

79
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,920
Y-You are going to infuriate me to death.

80
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,720
Grandfather, please help him
for the sake of your granddaughter

81
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,160
He truly is a rare talent.

82
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,720
I never thought
that she would have such affection for me.

83
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:04,120
With the assistance of the Wen family,

84
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,360
why would I need to beg at Flower Pavilion?

00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:29,171
