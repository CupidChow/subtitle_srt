1
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:02,702
In 9th grade,

2
00:01:04,203 --> 00:01:09,702
I suddenly collapsed in the winter
and was laid up for a week.

3
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:20,690
When I woke up, there was no sound...
Of the clock ticking, or cars running...

4
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,690
It was an awfully quiet morning.

5
00:01:24,037 --> 00:01:26,537
I remember feeling extremely lonely...

6
00:01:30,702 --> 00:01:35,037
until I heard that warm voice,
like a place in the sun.

7
00:01:39,702 --> 00:01:46,703
[Silhouette of Your Voice]

8
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,866
What? 1,500 yen per hour?

9
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:37,366
This pays great.

10
00:02:38,037 --> 00:02:42,412
That's normal for a tutor.
Maybe even lower than average.

11
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,702
Besides... Taichi, you as a tutor...

12
00:02:45,702 --> 00:02:50,870
I need to make the impossible possible.
Or else I'm gonna starve.

13
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,162
What about the Chinese place that provided meals?

14
00:02:54,162 --> 00:02:55,537
It didn't suit me!

15
00:02:55,537 --> 00:02:56,828
Your voice is loud.

16
00:02:56,828 --> 00:02:59,370
- Don't say that!
- See, again.

17
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:02,702
C'mon, buy me lunch.

18
00:03:02,702 --> 00:03:04,703
If you win at rock-paper-scissors.

19
00:03:10,702 --> 00:03:11,995
Are you serious?

20
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:16,495
I never heard of being fired for having a big voice.

21
00:03:16,495 --> 00:03:18,495
Is your voice that loud?

22
00:03:18,495 --> 00:03:21,912
You're the one who was just saying so!

23
00:03:21,912 --> 00:03:24,078
Yup, it's loud.

24
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,579
Oh, sorry.

25
00:03:28,702 --> 00:03:31,662
Am I just getting used to it?

26
00:03:31,662 --> 00:03:36,912
At first, the boss was telling me
how he liked my energy, you know?

27
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:41,870
You didn't tell off a rude customer
or anything, did you?

28
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:47,579
So you did. That would get you fired.

29
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:50,745
You have a strong sense of justice.

30
00:03:50,745 --> 00:03:51,995
It's not like that.

31
00:03:55,412 --> 00:03:58,037
Man, I'm hungry...

32
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:00,203
Me too. I'm going to the caff.

33
00:04:00,995 --> 00:04:04,621
You're gonna leave a starving friend behind?

34
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:06,120
You can come.

35
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,078
I told you, I don't have money.

36
00:04:09,078 --> 00:04:11,287
Bummer. See you later then.

37
00:04:14,702 --> 00:04:16,078
You ruthless bastard!

38
00:04:18,786 --> 00:04:19,912
Sorry.

39
00:04:24,702 --> 00:04:26,702
This won't buy me anything.

40
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,662
Oh man, I'm hungry...

41
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,343
I was gonna find a job after high school.

42
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:46,953
But a teacher recommended college
and now look where I am.

43
00:04:49,828 --> 00:04:54,495
Man, I'm hungry... I don't think I can make it.

44
00:05:02,662 --> 00:05:04,454
I'm starving...

45
00:05:09,329 --> 00:05:10,702
Ow...

46
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:17,329
Sorry to surprise you.

47
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:23,981
What's he doing in such a place?

48
00:05:26,454 --> 00:05:27,702
That looks good!

49
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:42,896
What? I can have it?

50
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,636
Really? You're so nice!

51
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:51,136
Anyone who offers food can't be a bad person.

52
00:05:51,136 --> 00:05:52,216
Thanks!

53
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:56,547
This is so good!

54
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,485
Hey, what about this?

55
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:09,235
What the hell?

56
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,900
- That must be Sugihara.
- Sugihara?

57
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,026
Kohei Sugihara. A freshman law student.

58
00:06:19,026 --> 00:06:21,610
You know him from a different department?

59
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,943
You're always out working,
but he's known around campus.

60
00:06:25,943 --> 00:06:29,527
Plus, his looks make him popular with girls.

61
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,276
Oh, yeah... And this here.

62
00:06:35,276 --> 00:06:37,984
Note-taker wanted?

63
00:06:37,984 --> 00:06:42,819
Take notes on classroom lectures
and provide explanations

64
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:47,819
to accommodate hard of hearing students.

65
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,495
He can't hear?

66
00:06:49,495 --> 00:06:51,652
I wouldn't know.

67
00:06:51,652 --> 00:06:53,735
See, look.

68
00:06:57,276 --> 00:06:59,860
He's surrounded by girls.

69
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:06,360
Looks like sign language. Maybe he really can't hear.

70
00:07:07,391 --> 00:07:10,485
Anyway, why're you looking for Sugihara?

71
00:07:10,485 --> 00:07:12,370
I owe him for something...

72
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,578
Owe him?

73
00:07:18,777 --> 00:07:20,235
I'm gonna go see him.

74
00:07:20,235 --> 00:07:22,193
Wait, Taichi!

75
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:24,900
- What?
- Stay away from him.

76
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,193
He stands out too much. And there are bad rumors.

77
00:07:29,193 --> 00:07:34,203
He flirted with an upperclassman's girlfriend.
You'll be caught up in trouble.

78
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:37,537
- For what?
- C'mon, let's just go.

79
00:07:45,193 --> 00:07:48,193
[I can't believe what you've done!]

80
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,900
Ow!

81
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:58,742
Hi. I thought that I could find you here.

82
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:00,901
I was right.

83
00:08:02,318 --> 00:08:03,693
Oh, yeah.

84
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,276
Here. I came to give this back.

85
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,693
Don't worry, it's clean.

86
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,901
The food was so good!

87
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,900
It was a lifesaver. I would've starved without it.

88
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:29,026
You have a bad rep, but someone like that
wouldn't give away their lunch.

89
00:08:30,568 --> 00:08:33,485
Not to repay for what you did, but...

90
00:08:33,485 --> 00:08:35,652
Can you let me do this?

91
00:08:38,411 --> 00:08:41,118
You know, in return for the meal.

92
00:08:41,735 --> 00:08:44,235
Why can I hear him so clearly?

93
00:08:44,235 --> 00:08:48,870
Oh, yeah. You have a hard time hearing.
I need to write...

94
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,411
I can understand... if you speak slowly.

95
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:58,943
Hey, you can talk normally. I thought you can't speak.

96
00:08:58,943 --> 00:09:02,693
Thank god. I was worried about how to communicate.

97
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:07,055
You can hear my voice, right?

98
00:09:08,763 --> 00:09:12,805
Um... Can you tell me your name first?

99
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:17,103
Taichi Sagawa!

100
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:02,608
Taichi's in class!

101
00:10:02,608 --> 00:10:04,573
You haven't found work yet?

102
00:10:04,573 --> 00:10:06,792
I'm working right this moment.

103
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:08,667
Huh? What kind of work?

104
00:10:09,698 --> 00:10:11,365
Note-taking.

105
00:10:11,365 --> 00:10:12,365
No way...

106
00:10:13,407 --> 00:10:15,524
For Sugihara?

107
00:10:15,524 --> 00:10:16,458
Yep.

108
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,834
That's volunteer work.

109
00:10:18,396 --> 00:10:22,646
I meant to do it just a bit,
but he asked me for long-term.

110
00:10:24,198 --> 00:10:26,157
Guess what the pay is?

111
00:10:26,157 --> 00:10:28,448
One boxed meal per note taken!

112
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:34,782
Can you believe it? It's a dream job.

113
00:10:34,782 --> 00:10:37,949
The wheels are finally starting to turn on me.

114
00:10:39,197 --> 00:10:41,074
You sure about this?

115
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:44,197
It's just taking notes. Easy peasy!

116
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:50,407
The sociologist, John Urry adapted this concept of gaze

117
00:10:50,407 --> 00:10:54,621
in relation to tourism and the tourist environment,

118
00:10:54,621 --> 00:11:00,157
discussing how a gaze is formed in his book,
"The Tourist Gaze".

119
00:11:00,157 --> 00:11:04,074
This gaze has changed form due to various influences.

120
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,240
Likewise,

121
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,458
understanding that various sociological
concepts are constantly changing

122
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:15,207
will make this lecture more meaningful.

123
00:11:16,157 --> 00:11:18,207
First and foremost,

124
00:11:18,207 --> 00:11:20,834
gaze has changed over time as well.

125
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:23,824
This is a piece of cake.

126
00:11:23,824 --> 00:11:28,197
Under Fordism, farms were
solely a place of production...

127
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:33,074
And this is what's important here...

128
00:11:33,074 --> 00:11:37,157
Whereas in post-Fordism,
the meaning of production

129
00:11:37,157 --> 00:11:41,490
was completely redefined.

130
00:11:42,897 --> 00:11:47,204
For consumers, it meant a return to humanity

131
00:11:47,204 --> 00:11:51,081
while the government perceived it as...

132
00:11:52,197 --> 00:11:58,157
A transformation in gaze can occur from
the consumer, or governmental policies.

133
00:11:59,407 --> 00:12:05,698
The gaze emanating from consumers created
a change in lifestyle and nature...

134
00:12:06,657 --> 00:12:08,157
Yummy!

135
00:12:13,157 --> 00:12:14,240
Sagawa.

136
00:12:15,448 --> 00:12:17,532
The key point is missing.

137
00:12:18,865 --> 00:12:20,532
Er, for that section...

138
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:23,074
Sorry, I doze off.

139
00:12:24,407 --> 00:12:27,197
I won't sleep anymore. I promise.

140
00:12:42,157 --> 00:12:47,188
It's harder than I thought, to write out everything.

141
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:50,606
Usually you get training or work in pairs.

142
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:56,407
I could catch half the stuff,
so just the main points...

143
00:12:57,532 --> 00:12:59,116
Hm? What's up?

144
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,323
Those girls... Don't you know them?

145
00:13:06,032 --> 00:13:10,157
They're from the sign language club.
I've been asked to join many times.

146
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:17,074
That's why they're using sign language.
I've never seen it firsthand.

147
00:13:17,074 --> 00:13:18,281
Me neither.

148
00:13:20,197 --> 00:13:24,032
The degree to which one can hear depends.

149
00:13:24,032 --> 00:13:28,740
Many people don't know Sign.
It's annoying how they think it's a given.

150
00:13:31,197 --> 00:13:33,074
I don't need that stuff.

151
00:13:37,032 --> 00:13:40,407
Plus, it's easier to read the lips.

152
00:13:41,381 --> 00:13:42,807
Isn't that harder?

153
00:13:42,807 --> 00:13:46,126
Not really. With training, anyone can.

154
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:50,698
Although it's unnecessary with you.

155
00:13:50,698 --> 00:13:52,207
How come?

156
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,208
Your voice carries well.

157
00:13:55,397 --> 00:13:58,197
Ahh, yeah. I've been told.

158
00:13:58,197 --> 00:14:00,143
Your voice is so loud!

159
00:14:01,197 --> 00:14:02,657
People say.

160
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,990
That's a good thing.

161
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,197
It means your feelings are conveyed well, too.

162
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:18,376
That's why you're easy to talk to, Sagawa.
I don't need you to repeat yourself either.

163
00:14:19,869 --> 00:14:22,453
Can you stop with that Sagawa?

164
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:26,485
Sounds like some delivery service.

165
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:29,207
Besides, it seems...

166
00:14:29,207 --> 00:14:30,500
What?

167
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,907
Anyways, just call me by my name. I will too.

168
00:14:36,865 --> 00:14:38,198
Okay.

169
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:54,500
Excuse me, Taichi.

170
00:14:55,365 --> 00:14:58,116
What's been up with you lately?

171
00:14:58,116 --> 00:15:03,197
You're coming to school and
even attending classes regularly.

172
00:15:03,197 --> 00:15:05,990
Well, I found work that suits me.

173
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,698
Working for Mr. Sugihara?

174
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,281
Those meals are amazing, really.

175
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:16,197
Lunch break is what I live for now.

176
00:15:16,197 --> 00:15:19,865
Are you serious? Isn't Sugihara a hassle?

177
00:15:19,865 --> 00:15:22,657
What? Not at all!

178
00:15:22,657 --> 00:15:25,157
I can't believe people who say that.

179
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:28,740
Why're you so defensive? Sorry. C'mon, let's go.

180
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:31,597
Don't get so mad.

181
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:38,493
His voice really carries well.

182
00:15:46,686 --> 00:15:47,770
Hey, Taichi.

183
00:15:50,103 --> 00:15:51,686
You're drooling, dude.

184
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,644
What happened to class?

185
00:15:54,644 --> 00:15:56,560
It's been long over.

186
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,395
Oh, crap.

187
00:15:59,728 --> 00:16:02,103
I'm so sorry! My apologies.

188
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,560
I fell asleep again.

189
00:16:06,978 --> 00:16:08,228
I'm sorry.

190
00:16:08,978 --> 00:16:11,603
I forgot your meal at home.

191
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,853
What? You don't have my lunch?

192
00:16:13,853 --> 00:16:14,728
No...

193
00:16:14,728 --> 00:16:17,936
Well then, that works out perfectly.

194
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:20,895
Actually, you wanna go to the cafeteria?

195
00:16:22,187 --> 00:16:25,811
I mean, it's cheaper than eating out.

196
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,020
It'll be good for a change.

197
00:16:31,187 --> 00:16:32,561
What? You don't want to?

198
00:16:32,561 --> 00:16:34,978
Well, it's not that, but...

199
00:16:34,978 --> 00:16:37,895
- Then let's go.
- I don't go much.

200
00:16:37,895 --> 00:16:39,312
How much you got?

201
00:16:39,312 --> 00:16:42,560
- Why should I tell you?
- Oh, come on.

202
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:53,479
Oh my god, they look so good!
I can't make up my mind.

203
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:56,315
- It's that hard?
- Of course.

204
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:59,177
Oh, my god! Isn't that Sugihara?

205
00:16:59,177 --> 00:17:00,560
You never come here.

206
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,895
Do you have lunch now?

207
00:17:02,895 --> 00:17:07,395
Let's eat together. You're on your own, right?

208
00:17:07,395 --> 00:17:10,560
- Am I invisible?
- Our club is going drinking tonight.

209
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,270
- Yeah, it'll be so fun.
- You should come!

210
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,560
We'll be glad if you can make it.

211
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,270
Can you?

212
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:21,395
- Will you?
- Please!

213
00:17:21,395 --> 00:17:24,561
Yo yo yo. Mind if we join in tonight?

214
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:26,560
You guys aren't in our club.

215
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,020
So? Sugihara ain't either.

216
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,479
He's special.

217
00:17:31,479 --> 00:17:33,270
The more, the merrier.

218
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,560
He's right.

219
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,978
Sugihara...

220
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,853
Don't ignore us.

221
00:17:41,312 --> 00:17:42,145
Kohei!

222
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,560
Who does he think he is?

223
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,479
Stop. He can't hear you.

224
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:47,560
You should feel sorry for him.

225
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,603
What? So we're the bad guys?

226
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:51,780
That's right. Who else?

227
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,570
You just like hot guys.

228
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:56,270
I can't believe it.

229
00:17:57,228 --> 00:18:00,770
You were there alone because of these idiots?

230
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:05,187
So not to deal with anyone?

231
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,560
Damn pity-bragger.

232
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:19,853
Don't get full of yourself.

233
00:18:21,936 --> 00:18:23,479
Stop, you guys!

234
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:47,452
I missed out on eating lunch because of those guys.

235
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:53,785
Taichi...

236
00:18:55,827 --> 00:18:56,952
You said my name!

237
00:18:58,411 --> 00:19:01,910
Uh, well... You haven't called my name though...

238
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:04,659
I just did back there.

239
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:07,494
Although it sounded like Ko-hey!

240
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:13,369
Did you just laugh?

241
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:14,879
No. No I didn't.

242
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:16,212
Yes, you did.

243
00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:21,659
You laugh a lot, Taichi.
I can hear your laughter very well.

244
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:24,494
Do I laugh that much?

245
00:19:25,452 --> 00:19:27,702
Yes, you do.

246
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:32,286
Really? I think I feel down more often.

247
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:40,952
About those guys back there...

248
00:19:42,486 --> 00:19:43,986
Why did you do that?

249
00:19:45,244 --> 00:19:47,578
It has nothing to do with you.

250
00:19:50,494 --> 00:19:54,659
Leave things alone. I can't hear anyway.

251
00:19:56,077 --> 00:20:00,659
Just because you can't hear
doesn't make it okay to say anything.

252
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,418
Are you always like that?

253
00:20:06,191 --> 00:20:11,037
If you can't hear, say so.
Ask to repeat however many times.

254
00:20:11,037 --> 00:20:12,954
Why're you holding back?

255
00:20:14,264 --> 00:20:15,846
It's not your fault...

256
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:18,886
that you can't hear!

257
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,747
Kohei... Why are you crying?

258
00:21:00,452 --> 00:21:03,202
It's a case of sudden hearing loss.

259
00:21:04,536 --> 00:21:07,201
Perhaps due to the high fever.

260
00:21:07,201 --> 00:21:12,874
It has been a while since first onset.
Most likely his hearing will not return.

261
00:21:14,494 --> 00:21:18,659
A hearing aid is recommended. Would you want one?

262
00:21:20,066 --> 00:21:22,692
You can receive a subsidy for it.

263
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,217
Should I issue a disability certificate?

264
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,035
Congratulations on your entrance.

265
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:43,205
My name is Seiichi Kitano. I'll be your teacher.

266
00:21:45,452 --> 00:21:51,369
I'd like to start off
with you introducing yourselves as well.

267
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:56,994
But first, there is something
I need to tell all of you.

268
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,244
This man, Mr. Sugihara...

269
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,994
is hard of hearing.

270
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:15,019
Please help him out if necessary.

271
00:22:22,815 --> 00:22:24,815
Quiet there.

272
00:22:26,514 --> 00:22:28,581
That's so sad.

273
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:31,884
I never felt sorry for myself.

274
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:36,566
So I couldn't understand why I get treated like this.

275
00:22:36,566 --> 00:22:39,033
Or why I have to go through this.

276
00:22:39,033 --> 00:22:41,743
I feel so sorry for him.

277
00:22:41,743 --> 00:22:43,659
Damn, is this real?

278
00:22:45,035 --> 00:22:47,411
Holy... That's so crazy.

279
00:22:47,411 --> 00:22:49,702
You better not post it.

280
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,160
Cut it out.

281
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,494
What's up?

282
00:22:53,494 --> 00:22:57,619
- His sister's a model.
- She's so hot.

283
00:22:57,619 --> 00:22:59,712
You guys have bad taste.

284
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,669
She's just a skinny beast.

285
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:05,869
Sorry, what was that?

286
00:23:09,178 --> 00:23:12,970
Forget it. It's nothing important anyway.

287
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,894
I'm not talking to you.

288
00:23:38,953 --> 00:23:42,910
Sugihara! I'll help with taking out the trash.

289
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:46,078
Oh, sorry. It's hard to hear from behind.

290
00:23:46,078 --> 00:23:47,242
Let me help.

291
00:23:47,242 --> 00:23:48,729
I can handle it myself.

292
00:23:48,729 --> 00:23:51,475
It's okay. Your condition must make it hard.

293
00:23:51,475 --> 00:23:53,500
I don't see how it does.

294
00:23:54,765 --> 00:23:58,382
I'm bad with fast-talking, high-pitched voices.

295
00:23:58,382 --> 00:24:00,932
It's even harder to pick up.

296
00:24:00,932 --> 00:24:03,476
Are you down with a cold?

297
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,542
- Do you have a cold?
- What?

298
00:24:06,542 --> 00:24:10,959
A cold! Your voice sounds a bit nasal and different.

299
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:19,924
What's wrong? Are you sick?

300
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:27,680
Hey, why are you so quiet today?

301
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,762
It's been a while. Let's talk more.

302
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:35,283
What's that on your ear? Are they earphones?

303
00:24:42,131 --> 00:24:43,339
Kohei.

304
00:24:44,464 --> 00:24:46,088
You've become boring.

305
00:24:54,673 --> 00:24:57,673
I'll see you again next month. Good work.

306
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:00,756
Wanna go downstairs together?

307
00:25:02,214 --> 00:25:04,298
Your speech is improving.

308
00:25:05,382 --> 00:25:08,642
In sign language, this is soda.

309
00:25:08,642 --> 00:25:09,979
Sign language?

310
00:25:14,131 --> 00:25:19,048
Are they all hard of hearing people?

311
00:25:21,088 --> 00:25:26,131
No, many of them are here
to obtain a license and stuff.

312
00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:32,673
The deaf usually go to deaf schools.
Those people wouldn't come here.

313
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:41,089
Am I a part of those people?

314
00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:43,141
You're not getting on?

315
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:46,224
Oh, I'll get on. I'm sorry.

316
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,506
Is that why I feel so uncomfortable?

317
00:25:51,673 --> 00:25:55,881
Because I don't belong anywhere outside of this room?

318
00:26:05,089 --> 00:26:10,423
That upperclassman...
I can't blame him for disliking me.

319
00:26:10,423 --> 00:26:12,017
Why's that?

320
00:26:12,017 --> 00:26:18,423
The person who was note-taking for me before you
was his girlfriend.

321
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:22,088
I refused her invite to a love hotel.

322
00:26:23,608 --> 00:26:25,283
Things got weird after that.

323
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:26,586
But you refused!

324
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:31,172
Somebody must have seen us together
and spread a rumor.

325
00:26:36,256 --> 00:26:41,423
I don't care what people think of me anymore.

326
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:49,631
Similar things are going to happen again anyway.

327
00:26:49,631 --> 00:26:51,840
Why do you presume like that?

328
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,506
- Everybody's the same.
- I'm not!

329
00:26:57,471 --> 00:27:01,972
I mean, I think there are people who aren't like that.

330
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:11,139
Taichi, you know how you showed up
out of nowhere all of a sudden?

331
00:27:11,139 --> 00:27:12,220
More than once.

332
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,055
What about it?

333
00:27:14,055 --> 00:27:17,555
I thought this boy was so silly.

334
00:27:17,555 --> 00:27:21,304
When you said a bad person
wouldn't give away their food.

335
00:27:27,555 --> 00:27:29,097
You laughed this time.

336
00:27:35,097 --> 00:27:36,930
I saw you laugh for the first time.

337
00:27:39,228 --> 00:27:41,430
I knew it.

338
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:44,220
You look better when you're laughing.

339
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:18,220
Come to think of it, what's Taichi's favorite food?

340
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:34,481
What a rare sight to see you in the kitchen.
Are you hungry?

341
00:28:34,481 --> 00:28:36,440
What's tomorrow's menu?

342
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,847
What's for lunch?

343
00:28:39,847 --> 00:28:42,763
You've never asked such a thing.

344
00:28:44,304 --> 00:28:49,888
Well... The person note-taking
is always looking forward to lunch.

345
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:56,146
Is that so. Maybe I'll make something special
for tomorrow, then.

346
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:07,763
Taichi... I wonder if he'll be happy again tomorrow.

347
00:29:19,672 --> 00:29:21,727
Oh yeah.

348
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:24,934
There was no class for Taichi to take notes today.
[Class Cancelled]

349
00:29:28,471 --> 00:29:30,888
It was such a nice day, too...

350
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:35,930
Tai...

351
00:29:36,763 --> 00:29:39,220
Taichi!

352
00:29:44,013 --> 00:29:45,388
That's right.

353
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,863
Taichi lives in a place I can't go...

354
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,847
and he has his own circle.

355
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,375
Hey, Kohei!

356
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,220
I'll see you guys later.

357
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,638
Hey. What about lunch?

358
00:30:01,638 --> 00:30:02,972
- Taichi?
- Later.

359
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,271
Taichi!

360
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,888
I was expecting too much.

361
00:30:10,783 --> 00:30:14,930
Taichi pays mind to me only because there's a return.

362
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,638
He wouldn't be with me otherwise.

363
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,442
But even so...

364
00:30:20,442 --> 00:30:24,471
It's not your fault that you can't hear!

365
00:30:25,352 --> 00:30:26,979
I was happy.

366
00:30:30,013 --> 00:30:31,388
Kohei!

367
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:34,180
What the hell, man?

368
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,388
Why'd you ignore me back there? You hurt me.

369
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:40,639
Why would it hurt you?

370
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:43,541
- What do you mean?
- There's no note-taking today.

371
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:45,540
I can't talk to you unless?

372
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,596
Why else would you?

373
00:30:58,684 --> 00:30:59,791
For lunch?

374
00:31:00,383 --> 00:31:04,383
It's not about the lunch! Don't treat me like a dog.

375
00:31:05,766 --> 00:31:08,705
See, now that you talked about it,

376
00:31:08,705 --> 00:31:11,373
you reminded me I'm hungry.

377
00:31:15,742 --> 00:31:20,673
Hey, um... If you haven't yet,
want to eat lunch together?

378
00:31:20,673 --> 00:31:22,432
I don't have money.

379
00:31:22,432 --> 00:31:23,432
I brought...

380
00:31:25,071 --> 00:31:26,071
a lunch box.

381
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:29,404
You're a savior!

382
00:31:31,644 --> 00:31:34,359
You exaggerate too much.

383
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:37,900
You're too generous. Did something good happen?

384
00:31:38,926 --> 00:31:41,786
Who knows? I wonder...

385
00:31:41,786 --> 00:31:44,577
Come on, why can't you tell me?

386
00:31:48,956 --> 00:31:50,329
I'm so hungry.

387
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,451
A hamburger steak!

388
00:31:55,911 --> 00:31:56,911
You dislike it?

389
00:31:56,911 --> 00:32:00,827
No way! I love it so much I want to get married.

390
00:32:01,827 --> 00:32:03,036
I'm glad to hear.

391
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:14,403
I always wanted to know.

392
00:32:14,403 --> 00:32:18,484
Are you making these meals? You're good at cooking.

393
00:32:18,484 --> 00:32:23,363
No way. It's my mother.
She runs a cooking class, so...

394
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:28,902
Your mother's taste, huh?
I don't remember mine now.

395
00:32:28,902 --> 00:32:30,079
How come?

396
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:33,037
My parents divorced when I was in junior high.

397
00:32:34,777 --> 00:32:38,568
They both got remarried,
so my grandpa looked after me.

398
00:32:39,236 --> 00:32:40,204
Sorry...

399
00:32:40,204 --> 00:32:42,704
That's okay. I'm not bothered by it.

400
00:32:43,934 --> 00:32:47,902
At any rate, this hamburger is delicious.

401
00:32:47,902 --> 00:32:50,494
There you are. Hey, Taichi.

402
00:32:50,494 --> 00:32:51,870
What's up, Yoko?

403
00:32:55,142 --> 00:32:59,069
I forgot to tell you earlier. You know my cousin, Miho?

404
00:32:59,069 --> 00:33:00,484
She's also a student here.

405
00:33:00,484 --> 00:33:02,444
Never heard about her.

406
00:33:02,444 --> 00:33:06,277
So guess what? She asked me for your number.

407
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:07,527
What? Why?

408
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,484
She saw you in the cafeteria.

409
00:33:09,484 --> 00:33:10,485
Stop playing.

410
00:33:10,485 --> 00:33:12,484
And wants to talk to you.

411
00:33:12,484 --> 00:33:15,527
What if she's fallen for you?

412
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:18,484
- No way!
- Jeez, don't take it seriously.

413
00:33:19,735 --> 00:33:23,902
Anyways, I'll leave it up to you. Good luck.

414
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:25,652
Hey, wait. Yoko!

415
00:33:26,985 --> 00:33:28,484
What was that?

416
00:33:34,485 --> 00:33:36,453
What's wrong?

417
00:33:36,453 --> 00:33:38,330
Oh, ah... nothing.

418
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:48,568
Wow, this is good stuff.

419
00:34:11,484 --> 00:34:12,527
Sagawa?

420
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:15,069
Are you Yoko's cousin?

421
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:18,484
My name is Miho Yokoyama.

422
00:34:18,484 --> 00:34:19,902
Nice to meet you.

423
00:34:19,902 --> 00:34:22,236
Sorry for the sudden call-out.

424
00:34:22,236 --> 00:34:23,484
No, it's okay.

425
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:31,485
They have a ton of books here, don't they.

426
00:34:31,485 --> 00:34:36,459
This used to be a bookstore. Isn't this a nice place?

427
00:34:36,459 --> 00:34:37,669
What can I get for you?

428
00:34:40,403 --> 00:34:41,944
The wage is good here!

429
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:45,194
- Iced tea, please.
- Certainly.

430
00:34:51,652 --> 00:34:52,902
So today...

431
00:34:54,111 --> 00:34:55,944
I wanted to talk about...

432
00:34:58,111 --> 00:34:59,985
Sugihara.

433
00:34:59,985 --> 00:35:02,568
Huh? About Kohei?

434
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:08,944
I saw him in the cafeteria the other day.
And he was so cool...

435
00:35:08,944 --> 00:35:11,944
Okay, now I get it.

436
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:16,735
Sorry. You seemed to be friends
with both him and my cousin, so...

437
00:35:17,484 --> 00:35:18,886
Am I troubling you?

438
00:35:18,886 --> 00:35:20,121
No, it's okay.

439
00:35:20,121 --> 00:35:24,704
So what are his hobbies? What does he like to do?

440
00:35:27,152 --> 00:35:30,111
I don't know about those things.

441
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:32,329
You're in the same department?

442
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:34,494
No... we're not.

443
00:35:35,142 --> 00:35:37,027
The same club?

444
00:35:37,027 --> 00:35:39,652
Nope. Neither of us are in one.

445
00:35:41,027 --> 00:35:43,484
Then how do you know him?

446
00:35:43,484 --> 00:35:48,027
Actually, we kind of met by chance...

447
00:35:48,027 --> 00:35:52,819
Anyhow, I'm working as his note-taker now.

448
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:54,484
Note-taker?

449
00:35:54,484 --> 00:35:57,319
You know, he can't hear well.

450
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:01,735
So I take notes in class of things
he couldn't catch, or key points,

451
00:36:01,735 --> 00:36:03,735
and hand them to him.

452
00:36:03,735 --> 00:36:06,111
Sugihara can't hear?

453
00:36:06,111 --> 00:36:11,194
Ah... Well, it's not like he can't hear at all.
Just difficulty...

454
00:36:11,194 --> 00:36:12,403
Oh my gosh.

455
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:16,175
It's like "The God of Ringbell"!

456
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:17,484
What?

457
00:36:17,484 --> 00:36:23,444
A novel about a girl who falls in love with
a boy who lost his hearing in an accident.

458
00:36:23,444 --> 00:36:25,484
I'm really into it now.

459
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:29,527
She dedicates herself to this boy
who can't do anything.

460
00:36:29,527 --> 00:36:34,954
I always wanted to try sign language,
but nobody around me knows it.

461
00:36:34,954 --> 00:36:37,348
It's like I've become that girl.

462
00:36:38,975 --> 00:36:39,975
Mom.

463
00:36:40,925 --> 00:36:42,925
Can you make lunch again?

464
00:36:42,925 --> 00:36:45,550
Sure. For two, right?

465
00:36:49,467 --> 00:36:51,592
- Also...
- Hm?

466
00:36:54,634 --> 00:36:56,133
I want to ask a favor...

467
00:36:59,806 --> 00:37:02,557
Why are you being so serious?

468
00:37:07,219 --> 00:37:08,520
What is it?

469
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,925
Kohei doesn't use sign language. And he can still hear.

470
00:37:12,925 --> 00:37:15,592
Kohei can take care of himself.

471
00:37:16,592 --> 00:37:18,758
He's not a character from a book!

472
00:37:21,592 --> 00:37:22,550
Sorry.

473
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:28,060
It might be a fantasy to you, but it's reality for him!

474
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:39,383
Sorry.

475
00:37:56,467 --> 00:37:57,799
I'm home.

476
00:37:58,883 --> 00:38:00,258
Grandpa?

477
00:38:01,432 --> 00:38:02,515
Are you home?

478
00:38:09,057 --> 00:38:12,722
[I'm off to this.]
[Hot Spring Tour]

479
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:16,175
Tell me before you leave.

480
00:38:19,216 --> 00:38:20,715
What a day.

481
00:38:28,966 --> 00:38:31,342
Why did I say such a thing?

482
00:38:37,425 --> 00:38:39,216
Who do I think I am?

483
00:38:41,588 --> 00:38:46,711
All I wanted was to see Kohei laugh more.

484
00:38:57,715 --> 00:39:00,675
Here. Today's notes.

485
00:39:22,675 --> 00:39:24,133
What's wrong?

486
00:39:24,133 --> 00:39:27,715
Um... You seem unusually out of energy today.

487
00:39:27,715 --> 00:39:30,715
Uh... No, I'm just hungry.

488
00:39:31,715 --> 00:39:34,258
I wonder what today's lunch is.

489
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,887
Hamburger steak!

490
00:39:37,887 --> 00:39:39,606
You love it, right?

491
00:39:39,606 --> 00:39:41,715
I do. I love it!

492
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:44,067
I'm not sure of its taste...

493
00:39:44,067 --> 00:39:46,850
Why? Of course it's good.

494
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:50,143
Your mom's food is always delicious!

495
00:39:54,607 --> 00:39:57,814
So tasty. This is replenishing.

496
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,733
I'm so relieved.

497
00:40:05,649 --> 00:40:07,814
I'll be looking over the notes.

498
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:26,343
Remember how I said...

499
00:40:29,263 --> 00:40:31,928
I'm not bothered about my parents?

500
00:40:32,814 --> 00:40:35,733
Actually, at one point I was.

501
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:39,840
You get made fun of without parents.

502
00:40:40,673 --> 00:40:42,964
Being poor made things worse.

503
00:40:43,923 --> 00:40:46,234
Always getting in fights...

504
00:40:46,234 --> 00:40:48,735
Man, I was peevish back then.

505
00:40:50,316 --> 00:40:56,964
But when Grandpa made a charcoal-black
hamburger steak for my birthday,

506
00:40:58,472 --> 00:41:03,887
it made me realize how lucky I was
to be living with him.

507
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:07,715
It's as good as that one.

508
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:10,433
Thanks.

509
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:12,934
What? Did you say something?

510
00:41:14,368 --> 00:41:15,535
Forget it.

511
00:41:17,012 --> 00:41:18,055
It's nothing.

512
00:41:18,055 --> 00:41:20,398
Sorry. Somehow I couldn't hear.

513
00:41:20,398 --> 00:41:22,022
It's embarrassing for me.

514
00:41:25,222 --> 00:41:26,472
Okay...

515
00:41:30,222 --> 00:41:32,180
My ear's ringing again.

516
00:41:34,012 --> 00:41:35,012
What's wrong?

517
00:41:37,472 --> 00:41:38,805
Hey.

518
00:41:40,012 --> 00:41:41,639
Kohei.

519
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:50,012
I can't hear...

520
00:41:53,019 --> 00:41:54,129
Taichi's voice.

521
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,012
Your hearing loss is progressing.

522
00:42:50,972 --> 00:42:55,639
The gradual loss may have made it hard to notice.

523
00:42:56,805 --> 00:42:59,138
Your tinnitus could be related.

524
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:04,305
Perhaps there's a complication with another disease.

525
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:08,203
Please come in for a detailed examination.

526
00:43:08,203 --> 00:43:09,244
Excuse me.

527
00:43:11,544 --> 00:43:15,168
Is it normal to keep getting worse?

528
00:43:21,388 --> 00:43:23,263
And will I someday....

529
00:43:24,931 --> 00:43:26,972
lose my hearing completely?

530
00:43:28,555 --> 00:43:31,263
I cannot deny that possibility.

531
00:43:31,263 --> 00:43:35,639
What's important is to avoid negative thoughts.

532
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:38,555
The worst is to stress about it too much.

533
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:45,425
Although that could very difficult

534
00:43:45,425 --> 00:43:49,467
when living in a society built for those who can hear.

535
00:43:59,177 --> 00:44:00,887
I'm losing my hearing.

536
00:44:02,345 --> 00:44:07,177
One day I won't be able to hear
what I've always been able to.

537
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:16,970
Can you let me do this?

538
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:19,177
Call me by my name. I will too.

539
00:44:19,177 --> 00:44:21,177
Taichi Sagawa.

540
00:44:21,177 --> 00:44:22,220
Kohei!

541
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:25,177
You look better when you're laughing.

542
00:44:25,177 --> 00:44:26,637
A hamburger steak!

543
00:44:26,637 --> 00:44:28,096
I do. I love it!

544
00:44:28,096 --> 00:44:31,177
So tasty. This is replenishing.

545
00:44:31,177 --> 00:44:34,303
Why'd you ignore me back there? You hurt me.

546
00:44:34,303 --> 00:44:37,054
If you can't hear, say so.

547
00:44:37,054 --> 00:44:39,220
Ask to repeat however many times.

548
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,929
Kohei.

549
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:41,929
Kohei?

550
00:44:43,762 --> 00:44:47,762
All of what I've been hearing.

551
00:44:51,929 --> 00:44:54,804
Is that you, Sugihara?

552
00:44:58,177 --> 00:45:00,512
It is you.

553
00:45:09,762 --> 00:45:12,512
Did you hear from Taichi?

554
00:45:12,512 --> 00:45:13,637
Hm?

555
00:45:13,637 --> 00:45:15,177
About Miho.

556
00:45:15,177 --> 00:45:17,220
Sorry, I can't hear well.

557
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,855
Don't worry. It's not much.

558
00:45:19,855 --> 00:45:21,187
Sorry about that.

559
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:26,845
You shouldn't feel responsible. Miho was insensitive.

560
00:45:28,387 --> 00:45:30,054
Miho?

561
00:45:31,845 --> 00:45:35,096
So you really haven't heard anything.

562
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:38,345
It's between them.

563
00:45:38,345 --> 00:45:41,177
Well... That's not quite the case.

564
00:45:42,096 --> 00:45:45,613
You may have noticed, but to tell you the truth,

565
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:48,309
my cousin Miho...

566
00:45:49,762 --> 00:45:52,487
Taichi isn't who she likes.

567
00:45:52,487 --> 00:45:57,345
She's actually attracted to you, Sugihara.

568
00:45:57,345 --> 00:46:00,595
Taichi must have felt like a clown.

569
00:46:01,387 --> 00:46:06,855
She did something to piss Taichi off
and he's feeling down about it.

570
00:46:12,184 --> 00:46:13,435
What's wrong?

571
00:46:16,811 --> 00:46:17,852
Sugihara?

572
00:46:21,341 --> 00:46:26,341
I wonder why Taichi didn't tell me about her?

573
00:46:39,637 --> 00:46:41,522
[I want to see you at Hachiman Shrine.]

574
00:46:41,522 --> 00:46:43,187
Kohei?

575
00:46:47,177 --> 00:46:48,345
Kohei.

576
00:46:50,178 --> 00:46:52,512
Sorry I'm late.

577
00:46:52,512 --> 00:46:54,057
Taichi...

578
00:46:54,057 --> 00:46:56,514
Why aren't you using your umbrella?

579
00:46:58,452 --> 00:47:00,429
Do you mind my towel?

580
00:47:00,429 --> 00:47:01,458
Stay still.

581
00:47:04,177 --> 00:47:05,220
It's okay.

582
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:08,178
No it's not. You'll catch a cold.

583
00:47:13,467 --> 00:47:17,636
I realized all of a sudden.

584
00:47:17,636 --> 00:47:19,095
What?

585
00:47:21,325 --> 00:47:23,660
That I really wanted to see you.

586
00:47:24,495 --> 00:47:27,411
What? You like me that much?

587
00:47:30,092 --> 00:47:31,340
Yes.

588
00:47:34,326 --> 00:47:37,283
I like you, Taichi.

589
00:47:41,527 --> 00:47:46,360
When I see you eating heartily, I feel so relieved.

590
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,694
Huh? What're you talking about?

591
00:47:49,736 --> 00:47:51,486
When you say you like the food,

592
00:47:52,881 --> 00:47:54,548
it makes me happy too.

593
00:47:57,274 --> 00:48:03,153
That's something I don't want to lose hearing.

594
00:48:03,153 --> 00:48:05,819
What's wrong? Did something happen?

595
00:48:08,602 --> 00:48:12,061
Kohei? Hey, are you alright?

596
00:48:12,894 --> 00:48:14,312
Kohei!

597
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:23,694
Taichi, what do you think about Miho?

598
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:26,444
You met her, right?

599
00:48:26,444 --> 00:48:27,837
Y-Yeah.

600
00:48:27,837 --> 00:48:30,616
Why did you get mad at her?

601
00:48:31,539 --> 00:48:32,800
That's because...

602
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,550
How do you know about that?

603
00:48:36,923 --> 00:48:41,173
Why are you asking? What difference does it make?

604
00:48:46,262 --> 00:48:47,636
It worries me.

605
00:48:49,883 --> 00:48:52,525
What you two talked about,

606
00:48:52,525 --> 00:48:54,525
how you feel about her.

607
00:48:55,847 --> 00:48:56,847
No!

608
00:48:58,868 --> 00:48:59,868
Taichi?

609
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:04,160
Sorry, but I'm not going to tell you.

610
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:06,243
I don't want to.

611
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:34,400
To Taichi,

612
00:49:36,383 --> 00:49:37,841
Pardon the suddenness.

613
00:49:45,327 --> 00:49:47,618
Because you saved me a lot,

614
00:49:48,784 --> 00:49:52,357
I don't want to cause you any more trouble.

[Note-taker Wanted]

616
00:49:53,595 --> 00:49:57,403
So I've decided to ask someone else
to be my note-taker.

617
00:50:07,826 --> 00:50:10,118
Where the hell are you, Kohei?

618
00:50:16,327 --> 00:50:18,781
[From: Kohei To Taichi...]

619
00:50:18,781 --> 00:50:20,697
Thanks for putting up with me.

620
00:50:23,743 --> 00:50:25,160
Goodbye.

621
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,682
This doesn't make sense!

622
00:50:47,639 --> 00:50:49,349
He's not here today either.

623
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:50,849
What? Him again?

624
00:50:50,849 --> 00:50:53,224
It's been an entire week!

625
00:50:53,224 --> 00:50:56,442
Maybe he's avoiding you. What did you do?

626
00:50:56,442 --> 00:50:57,817
Nothing!

627
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:00,433
I think...

628
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:02,682
He does seem like a difficult guy.

629
00:51:03,432 --> 00:51:08,307
Although he was rather easy to talk to the other day.

630
00:51:08,307 --> 00:51:09,890
When did you...

631
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:12,516
To update on Miho's situation.

632
00:51:12,516 --> 00:51:14,807
You talked to him about Miho?

633
00:51:14,807 --> 00:51:17,307
Ow, ow, ow! That hurts.

634
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:18,640
What did you say?

635
00:51:19,266 --> 00:51:23,807
That she likes him, and not you.

636
00:51:23,807 --> 00:51:24,640
You!

637
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,765
If you need to see him, go to his house.

638
00:51:27,765 --> 00:51:29,025
I don't know the address.

639
00:51:29,025 --> 00:51:29,952
Ow, ow, ow!

640
00:51:29,952 --> 00:51:34,649
His place runs some kind of class, right?
You can probably search...

641
00:51:34,649 --> 00:51:36,775
- Good idea!
- Ow.

642
00:51:51,349 --> 00:51:53,765

00:51:55,015 --> 00:51:56,723
I'm getting nervous.

645
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:04,639
Coming!

646
00:52:09,558 --> 00:52:11,099
Who may you be?

647
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:14,005
I'm Kohei's friend.

648
00:52:15,723 --> 00:52:16,974
Is Kohei home?

649
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:25,932
I'm sorry. Kohei's never had a friend come over.

650
00:52:25,932 --> 00:52:28,349
I assumed it was my student.

651
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:30,391
Make yourself at home.

652
00:52:41,516 --> 00:52:45,807
He should at least let me know
someone's coming over.

653
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,015
They're leftovers, but feel free.

654
00:52:50,015 --> 00:52:52,516
No, I just came willfully.

655
00:52:52,516 --> 00:52:55,765
It's okay, go ahead. Please have some.

656
00:52:56,307 --> 00:52:58,640
Well then... Thank you.

657
00:53:04,432 --> 00:53:05,682
Yummy!

658
00:53:10,266 --> 00:53:14,890
Ahh... so you're the lunch-box kid, I presume.

659
00:53:16,182 --> 00:53:17,391
Yes.

660
00:53:18,822 --> 00:53:23,365
Kohei always talks about how you eat so heartily.

661
00:53:25,926 --> 00:53:28,760
So where's Kohei?

662
00:53:29,281 --> 00:53:33,490
Kohei? Actually, he's at the hospital now.

663
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:34,822
The hospital?

664
00:53:34,822 --> 00:53:40,198
Yes. You know, his hearing... He's losing it again.

665
00:53:40,198 --> 00:53:43,738
He's had checkups and IV treatment the past week.

666
00:53:44,615 --> 00:53:47,989
It's better to be hospitalized, but he refuses.

667
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:54,114
So that's why...

668
00:53:58,738 --> 00:54:00,003
I've got work now.

Don't forsake him, will you?

674
00:54:19,615 --> 00:54:24,738
He's gloomy, untalkative, unfriendly
and hard to handle,

675
00:54:25,989 --> 00:54:31,738
but I could tell he really cares for you.

676
00:54:34,365 --> 00:54:37,114
When he found out you liked hamburger steak,

677
00:54:37,114 --> 00:54:41,249
he unusually requested me to make it extra good

678
00:54:41,249 --> 00:54:43,333
so I had him make it himself.

679
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:46,989
It was so funny, you know.

680
00:54:46,989 --> 00:54:51,573
He'd never made anything before,
but he was so serious.

Slap-slap.

685
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:12,114
He must have really wanted
to hear you say it was good.

He was waiting for you until just now.

690
00:55:53,163 --> 00:55:56,580
Why didn't he tell me about anything?

691
00:55:57,870 --> 00:56:01,288
How come he decides everything by himself?

692
00:56:02,747 --> 00:56:05,870
Maybe he's avoiding you. What did you do?

693
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:07,871
Nothing!

694
00:56:07,871 --> 00:56:09,288
Taichi,

695
00:56:10,171 --> 00:56:12,254
what do you think about Miho?

696
00:56:13,497 --> 00:56:16,747
Why did you get mad at her?

697
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:25,421
Kohei... He can't be...

698
00:56:39,913 --> 00:56:43,288
Yo, Taichi. Why don't you pick up your phone?

699
00:56:43,288 --> 00:56:45,870
Oh, sorry. I dropped my cell.

700
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:47,330
What're you doing?

701
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:50,371
So, were you able to see Sugihara?

702
00:56:53,121 --> 00:56:54,538
No, I couldn't.

703
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,799
I think it's my fault.

704
00:56:57,799 --> 00:56:58,880
What is?

705
00:56:59,837 --> 00:57:02,877
He probably likes Miho.

706
00:57:04,111 --> 00:57:05,747
I don't think so.

707
00:57:05,747 --> 00:57:07,080
But...

708
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:12,538
It makes sense if you think
he mistakenly believes that I like Miho.

709
00:57:13,944 --> 00:57:17,330
And that he's holding back for me...

710
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:20,330
He must believe he's in our way.

711
00:57:21,246 --> 00:57:22,747
He's that kind of guy.

712
00:57:24,288 --> 00:57:26,371
I don't get it.

713
00:57:26,996 --> 00:57:30,330
Why are you so concerned about Sugihara?

714
00:57:32,242 --> 00:57:36,954
He's smart,

715
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:41,663
lives in a huge house, popular with girls...
Simply amazing.

716
00:57:41,663 --> 00:57:43,340
I wish I were him.

717
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:47,131
But he lacks self-confidence,

718
00:57:48,163 --> 00:57:52,870
keeps his distance from others,
takes everything upon himself...

719
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:59,121
And that's only because he's had bad experiences
due to his hearing.

720
00:57:59,121 --> 00:58:04,298
If that's the reason
he was stripped of all his confidence,

721
00:58:04,298 --> 00:58:06,340
that's such a shame.

722
00:58:07,747 --> 00:58:11,080
What's wrong with not being able to hear?

723
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:14,038
Well... nothing.

724
00:58:14,038 --> 00:58:16,662
Kohei has a good soul!

725
00:58:16,662 --> 00:58:20,454
He's untalkative and unfriendly, but he's generous.

726
00:58:22,205 --> 00:58:26,038
Everyone just doesn't know how much he's trying.

727
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:29,622
Or of his pleasant smile.

728
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:35,528
They write him off without trying to understand him

729
00:58:35,528 --> 00:58:37,580
and leave him behind.

730
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,705
I guess you can say that...

731
00:58:39,705 --> 00:58:44,330
In any case, he can't be left alone. He just can't!

732
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:46,205
Taichi, you okay about this?

733
00:58:46,205 --> 00:58:47,590
About what?

734
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:51,335
He's here in person.

735
00:58:53,622 --> 00:58:56,163
You idiot. Tell me earlier.

736
00:58:56,163 --> 00:58:57,870
You were so enthusiastic...

737
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:03,580
Here... Did you forget this at my house?

738
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:05,262
- Thanks...
- Bye.

739
00:59:05,262 --> 00:59:06,595
Kohei!

740
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:10,067
Taichi.

741
00:59:10,067 --> 00:59:11,402
Wait up.

742
00:59:12,112 --> 00:59:14,747
Did you hear what I said?

743
00:59:14,747 --> 00:59:16,928
I'm asking, did you hear!

744
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:20,473
Kohei!

745
00:59:25,066 --> 00:59:26,900
Hear what?

746
00:59:32,706 --> 00:59:36,706
You know my hearing is getting worse, right?

747
00:59:41,088 --> 00:59:42,881
Even if you spoke,

748
00:59:44,256 --> 00:59:45,673
I wouldn't hear.

749
00:59:47,779 --> 00:59:49,337
I see...

750
00:59:54,002 --> 00:59:55,128
Sorry.

751
00:59:56,503 --> 00:59:57,754
I lied.

752
01:00:05,378 --> 01:00:07,295
I may not hear anything else,

753
01:00:09,295 --> 01:00:11,002
but somehow your voice...

754
01:00:15,837 --> 01:00:17,587
I can hear clearly.

755
01:00:23,226 --> 01:00:25,226
Why did you say such things?

756
01:00:26,969 --> 01:00:29,134
To say that now isn't fair.

757
01:00:29,134 --> 01:00:31,719
You're the one who's not fair.

758
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:34,719
Trying to cut me off like that.

759
01:00:35,726 --> 01:00:38,392
You need to voice your thoughts more!

760
01:00:42,594 --> 01:00:44,094
Even if I do...

761
01:00:45,635 --> 01:00:48,552
- You wouldn't understand!
- Understand?

762
01:00:49,886 --> 01:00:51,635
Maybe not everything,

763
01:00:52,677 --> 01:00:54,719
but I'm trying my best to.

764
01:00:57,886 --> 01:00:59,927
From that moment I saw you cry.

765
01:01:02,134 --> 01:01:04,844
But I can't if you stay silent.

766
01:01:06,134 --> 01:01:08,094
Say what you're thinking!

767
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:16,238
About Miho, it was my fault. She made it sound...

768
01:01:18,469 --> 01:01:23,135
like you couldn't do anything and I got angry.

769
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:29,385
I should've told you than getting misunderstood.

770
01:01:31,134 --> 01:01:32,427
So...

771
01:01:33,802 --> 01:01:36,134
don't keep things in anymore!

772
01:01:37,469 --> 01:01:40,134
Let out your feelings.

773
01:01:40,969 --> 01:01:42,886
Don't give up willfully.

774
01:01:56,309 --> 01:02:00,011
Why are you crying, Taichi?

775
01:02:00,761 --> 01:02:02,134
I don't know.

776
01:02:24,266 --> 01:02:25,976
You didn't understand.

777
01:02:29,266 --> 01:02:30,726
See? You're slow.

778
01:02:33,273 --> 01:02:36,809
But that's what I like about you.

779
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:47,517
More than losing my hearing,
I was afraid to be disliked by you.

780
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:53,267
I'm sorry.

781
01:02:55,309 --> 01:02:59,266
But I'm glad I was able to tell you.

782
01:03:04,434 --> 01:03:05,684
Thank you...

783
01:03:07,809 --> 01:03:09,309
for everything.

784

Sugihara?

785
01:05:30,294 --> 01:05:31,681
You cut your hair?

786
01:05:31,681 --> 01:05:32,818
Yeah.

787
01:05:32,818 --> 01:05:35,118
- You look good.
- It's really cute.

788
01:05:36,185 --> 01:05:38,266
Oh, here. Come if you can.

Can I still join your club?

792
01:05:51,266 --> 01:05:53,599
Of course! Anytime.

793
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:54,724
Why now, though?

794
01:05:55,648 --> 01:05:59,191
I thought I should stop presuming things.

795
01:06:01,266 --> 01:06:02,431
So you can come?

796
01:06:03,421 --> 01:06:05,431

- Tomorrow.

Kohei.

Don't you despise me?

812
01:07:29,115 --> 01:07:34,865
You caught me off guard for sure.
And I didn't know what to do.

813
01:07:34,865 --> 01:07:39,530
I thought about it so hard and long,
I even forgot to eat.

But no matter how much I think,
I can't find any reason to dislike you.

Ever since the winter of 9th grade,
my inner season hadn't changed.

I remember being extremely lonely...

824
01:08:26,530 --> 01:08:28,282
until I heard that warm voice,

825
01:08:29,115 --> 01:08:31,531
like a place in the sun.
