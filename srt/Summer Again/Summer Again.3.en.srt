There's nothing you can do, Tong Xi.

What a shame.

124
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,070
Now,

125

Sure.

prove your worthiness.

00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,870
do guys like?

157

Hey.

158
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,830
It's not a special occasion.

159
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,630
What's that for?

160
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,950
Cut the nonsense.

161
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,150
Answer me.

162
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,150
Let me tell you.

163
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,260
I'm eyeing on a basketball hoop.

164
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,270
It shines brightly

165
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,550
at night.

166
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,390
I mean guys in general,

167
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,470
not a particular someone.

168
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,110
Can he call himself a guy

169
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,500
if he doesn't like basketball?

170
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,590
Forget it. What a waste of time.

171
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,270
I know.

172
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,100
Shirts.

173
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,590
Shoes.

174
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,470
And such.

175
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,390

351
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,500
Fine, I'll do it.

352
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,910
Let's toast, Senior.

353
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,670
Come on.

354
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,310
Cheers.

355
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,830
Here we go.

356
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,110
Happy birthday, Senior.

357
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,030
I thought you'd wish me
immense blessings.

358
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:07,510
[Blue Elephant]

359
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,310
Why is that?

360
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:08,500
Come here.

361
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,150
Come here.

362
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,829
You seemed to enjoy yourself.

363
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,869
You didn't give him the squid, did you?

364
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,030
Don't talk to me.

365
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,030
I'm in a bad mood.

366
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,070
He didn't want it?

367
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,630
I told you,

368
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,590
squid doesn't make a nice birthday gift.

369
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,230
Fine. Shut up.

370
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,990
I'll throw it away now.

371
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,590
No, don't waste it.

372
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,550
Did you burn yourself?

373
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,870
Seriously, what are you

374
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:50,590
even good at?

375
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,430
What are you doing?

376
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,590
I'll eat it.

377
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,830
What's your problem, Xu Ao?

378
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,750
It's her goodwill that matters.

379
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,380
Why are you so mad?

380
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,870
Stop eating. It's cold.

381
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,990
Still edible, though.

382
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,950
I'm starving

383
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:11,870
after the match.

384
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,630
But I think

385
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,270
it tastes nice.

386
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,470
Good cooking skills.

387
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,990
The contour

388
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,510
is much nicer than mine.

389
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,830
Amazing.

390
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,790
Compared to the cartoonist that you like,

391
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,870
Qing He, right?

392
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,140
Who is better?

393
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,950
You think you can

394
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,660
match him?

395
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,030
I mean, there's nothing to compare.

396
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,310
Look.

397
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,830
He's my prince charming.

398
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,550
And you're my saviour.

399
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,190
I can't compare you two,

400
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,750
can I?

401
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,100
Prince charming? Seriously?

402
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,030
I glanced through his comic.

403
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,150
It's about

404
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,270
a mischievous boy who
troubles his mum every day.

405
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,710
Who'd read such a story?

406
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,190
Guru Qing He's comics

407
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,830
express the characters' emotions

408
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,350
and their souls.

409
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,790
Take Early Summer as example.

410
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,870
The funny comic

411
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,590
is warming as well as
sentimental at the same time.

412
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:30,830
I think

413
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,030
he must be a happy person,

414
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,590
or a person who's pursuing happiness.

415
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,750
Every time I read Early Summer,

416
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,630
I feel like

417
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,590
he's confiding something.

418
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,150
Do you think...

419
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,870
Why are you smiling?

420
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,230
Nothing.

421
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,750
I think

422
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,470
you know so much about him.

423
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,230
Looks like you're a big fan.

424
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,030
Yeah.

425
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,270
I like him a lot.

426
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,270
I like him the most in the world.

427
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,790
Then,

428
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,550
you ever talked to him?

429
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,350
Of course.

430
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,790
We chat every day,

431
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,750
from day to night.

432
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,670
Qing He talked to you?

433
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:23,870
What is it?

434
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,310
One-sided texting can
be considered chatting too.

435
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,790
Besides,

436
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,950
maybe he read every message I sent

437
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:30,790
carefully,

438
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,430
without replying me.

439
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,870
Stand further.

440
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:36,510
Move.

441
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:37,910
Why?

442
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,230
Stand further away.

443
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,790
Further.

444
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,790
Not bad, Lin Nan Yi.

445
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,910
You're really something.

446
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,430
You

447
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,350
won't be dead tomorrow.

448
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:01,350
Do you think

449
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,870
our board poster can make it through?

450
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,070
I think

451
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,230
it should be alright.

452
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,070
This is the first time

453
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,220
I draw a board poster
with water-based paint.

454
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,630
It's the first

455
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,670
in our school.

456
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,390
I didn't expect

457
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,030
you to be this good at drawing now.

458
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,310
Do you plan to go to art college?

459
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,150
Art college?

460
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,470
Art college.

461
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,070
College that teaches arts,

462
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,030
like Chinese painting, oil painting
and mural painting.

463
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,510
Normally, you need to

464
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,310
take specific exams to get enrolled.

465
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,710
It suits people like you. Talented,

466
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,830
but doesn't

467
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,350
seem good academically.

468
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,830
Can I get in with over 500 points?

469
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,590
You?

470
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:46,860
Over 500 points?

471
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,550
Over 500 points...

472
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,550
You can get into any college you like.

473
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,190
Forget what I said.

474
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,790
You haven't changed a bit.

475
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,150
The concept

476
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,150
of our board poster is very simple.

477
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,260
It focuses on nature, relaxation

478
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,230
and eco-friendliness.

479
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,630
The concept of environmental protection

480
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,870
is highlighted through the use of
chalkboard paint instead of chalks.

481
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,550
It can be easily cleaned without dust,

482
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,550
and the result is more stunning.

483
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,070
We moved the most
beautiful scenery of Xi Hai Town

484
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,070
to the classroom,

485
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,710
so that we can look at it

486
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,110
with just a turn when tired.

487
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,590
The faraway mountains, flying birds,

488
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,230
as well as drifting leaves

489
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,790
act as a reminder to the students

490
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,030
to protect

491
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,350
our environment.

492
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,430
Nice.

493
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,070
As expected from the White Swan.

494
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,070
Chalkboard paint is indeed cool.

495
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,230
Yeah.

496
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,030
Amazing!

497
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,540
Yeah. That's great.

498
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,070
So, guys,

499
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,500
no matter what the result is,

500
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,590
I announce

501
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,110
that Tong Xi is the
contributing star of our class.

502
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,630
Nice!

503
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,870
We should learn from Tong Xi.

504
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,110
Innovative,

505
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,630
and determined.

506
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,590
I believe everyone in this room

507
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,990
is equally excellent.

508
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,630
Understood?

509
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:49,790
Understood.

510
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,070
Idiot.

511
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,430
That's not just any leaf.

512
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,470
That's mint leaf.

513
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,270
Thanks for helping with the board poster.

514
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,550
Is that it?

515
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,790
How insincere.

516
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,110
As far as I know,

517
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,110
you're not

518
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,950
that heartless.

519
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,990
What do you want now?

520
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,270
Be my underling.

521
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,310
Do whatever I say

522
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,950
as long as it's reasonable.

523
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,070
How about that?

524
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,870
Lin Nan Yi, you...

525
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,150
If people learned

526
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,070
that White Swan didn't draw the poster,

527
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,790
then...

528
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:35,830
One day.

529
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:36,950
Half a year.

530
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:37,710
Two days.

531
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,190
One month.

532
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,470
Five days, that's the most I can take.

533
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,110
One week, that's the least I can take.

534
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,870
I gladly accept your gratitude.

535
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,430

538

What a surprise.

539
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,150
Our class

540
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,460
actually beats Class 5.

541

542
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,470
Tong Xi, you're too modest.

548

White Swan is excellent in drawing.

549

Don't you want to compete with her?

Of course I have to.

551
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,670
But my drawings can't tell stories,

552
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,950
have no emotions,

553
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,310
and I can't create unique characters.

554
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,190
I would be embarrassing myself then.

555
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:35,510
That's true.

559

Tao Zi,

562
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,310
you don't look good.

563
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,030
Well,

564
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,510
it's not about her look.

565
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,150
It's about her mood.

566
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,910
What happened, Tao Zi?

567
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,270
Why is she not happy?

568
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,350
Let me tell you.

569
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,270
Last night,

570
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,390
she joined Xu Ao's birthday party.

571
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,110
Guess what she brought him.

572
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,870
I guess you couldn't.

573
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,030
Anyone with brain couldn't guess it.

574
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,030
She gave him

575
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,190
a grilled squid.

576
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,710
Grilled squid, mind you.

577
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,630
Hey...

578
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,430
Nan Yi, Wang Yi Ming.

579
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,310
Come and help me move something.

580
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:40,510
No.

581
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,500
I... I haven't finished.

582
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,990
Hey, do you know that?

583
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,830
She even burned her hand.

584
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:48,660
Listen.

585
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,030
I know. Move things, right?

586
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,710
Tao Zi, Wang Yi Ming is like that.

587
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,390
He meant no harm.

588
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,020
I know.

589
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,660
After all,

590
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,630
he finished the squid last night.

591
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,830
You really gave Xu Ao grilled squid?

592
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,790
Then, the wound on your hand...

593
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:15,990
Tong Xi,

594
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,190
I'm really stupid, ain't I?

595
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,470
I'm not pretty,

596
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,390
my grades are poor,

597
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,470
and I'm not bright.

598
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,820
I even gave Senior Xu Ao

599
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,950
a weird gift on his birthday.

600
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,910
No wonder he's so cold to me.

601
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,470
If only I can be

602
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,940
as perfect as you.

603
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,190
Maybe

604
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,590
Senior Xu Ao will look my way.

605
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:48,910
Actually, I...

606
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,590
I finished all of it

607
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,750
to cheer her up.

608
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,910
You were a sweet guy yesterday.

609
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,260
And a stupid guy today.

610
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,030
To be honest, I had experienced

611
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,470
all those.

612
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,190
Sister Mi Ya.

613
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,430
How did you solve it back then?

614

615

625

I told you to cater to his pleasure,

626
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,190
not to give him squid, alright?

00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:05,550
Of course.

699
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,150
One-sided texting can
be considered chatting too.

700
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,190
We chat every day,

701
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,630
from day to night.

702
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:17,470
She did send messages every day.

703
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,310
I'm really mad today.

704
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,830
I've been thinking if I should report you.

705
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,270
My heart is broken.

706
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,510
Guru.

707
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,950
Don't you know poaching
is against the law?

708
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,350
Why did you do that?

709
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,550
You have stolen

710
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,780
my heart.

711
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,550
No way.

712
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,510
This is so not Tong Xi.

713
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,390
Given her personality...

714
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:48,670
No way.

715
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,830
Why hasn't there any news

716
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,030
on Guru Qing He's new comic?

717
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,500
I'm so eager to find it out.

718
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,630
Yeah, I've repeated many times.

719
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,710
Me, too.

720
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:17,990
Morning.

721
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,750
Morning.

722
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,470
Hey, Tong Xi.

723
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,470
I have something to tell you.

724
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:27,630
What is it?

725
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,670
You and Lin Nan Yi

726
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,830
are very close lately, right?

727
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,390
Not really.

728
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:37,580
Maybe we know each other as kids.

729
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,030
That's why we get close faster.

730
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:39,790
That's it?

731
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:40,990
Nothing else?

732
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,590
Yeah.

733
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,750
Okay. I was worried dead.

734
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,550
I think

735
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,790
you shouldn't get so close with him.

736
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:50,870
Keep your distance.

737
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,350
Otherwise,

738
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:54,860
someone might set you

739
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,790
as Special Follow.

740
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,310
Someone?

741
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,390
Special Follow?

742
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:02,870
Me?

743
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,710
The class monitor's back.

744
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,070
Hi, monitor.

745
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,470
Monitor.

746
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,310
You're finally back, Xiao Wan.

747
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:25,780
Lu Ting.

748
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,670
I'll leave my mint to you.

749
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,430
It's been with me for a long time.

750
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,260
Take good care of it.
