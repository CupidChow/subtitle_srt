Where else can I go?

3
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:30,990
What are you doing here this late?

4
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,350
Do you know how dangerous it is?

5
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,470
Doesn't your leg hurt anymore?

6
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,270
What's with this attitude?

7
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,030
It's so dark inside your house

8
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:38,950
and full of mosquitoes too.

9
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,470
I don't even know when you're coming back.

10
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,270
What should I do?

11
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:48,990
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:50,670
I...

13
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,270
I was too hasty just now.

14
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,150
Alright.

15
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,060
Sorry for troubling you.

16
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,110
Where is Tong Tong?

17
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,110
Her leg...

18
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:11,630
Lie down first.

19
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:12,870
Do you still feel dizzy?

20
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,270
Look at you.

21
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,070
You're sharp-tongued but soft-hearted.

22
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,310
When Tong Tong injured her leg,

23
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,789
you're obviously worried sick,

24
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,230
but you just had to put on a stern face.

25
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,110
You scolded her
instead of showing concern.

26
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,670
I'll say no more.

27
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,590
Get some rest now.

28
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:35,550
Let Tong Xi calm down first.

29
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,190
Thank you.

Let's go.

33
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,950
Aren't we going to look for Tong Xi?

34
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:52,030
[Adapted from Huo He's comic, "Mint Love"]

35
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,030
Found her.

36
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,710
She's with Lin Nan Yi now.

37
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,350
Right after you told me
Tong Xi went missing,

38
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,670
I came straight away
before answering nature's call.

39
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,070
Right now, I feel...

40
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:01,950
Clogged.

41
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,390
I've informed your father.

42
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,470
Once you've totally calmed down,

43
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,630
I'll send you home.

44
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,470
I'm not going home.

45
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,590
I want to watch the sunrise here.

46
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,670
Judging by this weather,

47
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,710
it's hard to say if we'll see anything.

48
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,710
Why is my life so miserable?

49
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,390
I lost my dancing shoes.

50
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,670
I did ballet although I didn't like it

51
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,790
and even injured my leg.

52
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,910
Now I can't even watch the sunrise
because it's cloudy.

53
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,470
Why is my life so miserable?

Lin Nan Yi.

55
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,430
Since I ran away from home,

56
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,310
do you think my mother
will worry about me?

57
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,670
Forget it.

58
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,350
Even if she does,

59
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,630
it won't be about me,

60
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,350
but my leg injury and ballet.

61
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,310
After this incident,

62
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,350
do you think her mother will
stop forcing her to dance?

63
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,110
It's hard to say.

64
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,990
She has to continue her mother's legacy
as the White Swan.

65
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,790
But the story

66
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,110
between Tong Xi and her mother

67
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,829
is indeed mind-blowing.

68
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,470
In terms of complexity of characters'
background and storyline,

69
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,150
Lin and she suffer the same faith.

70
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,630
Suffer the same fate.

71
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,390
Same fate.

72
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,710
Why is this related to Lin?

73
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,270
Don't you think Lin is also weird?

74
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,030
Think about it.

75
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,750
At such a young age,

76
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,950
he moved out to live on his own

77
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,510
and has to work for a living.

78
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,430
Isn't that weird?

79
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,470
Didn't he say he once lived
with his grandfather?

80
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,590
He only moved out

81
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,829
after his grandfather passed away.

82
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,950
How is that weird?

83
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:00,390
You're right.

84
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,230
His grandfather did pass away.

85
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,470
But what about his parents?

86
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,780
Did you ever hear him
talk about his parents?

87
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,470
I don't think you do.

88
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,670
He didn't just come out from nowhere.

89
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:10,870
In conclusion,

90
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,790
I think there must be

91
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,790
a bigger story behind this.

Share it with Tong Tong
when she comes back.

98
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,310
The doctor said you have low blood sugar.

99
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,470
You must eat well.

100
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,030
Thank you.

101
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,030
You're welcome.

102
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:49,020
How did the writing for your book go?

103
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,310
I've read some of your works.

104
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,230
Now, I can write better than before.

105
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,950
But it's not really a big deal.

106
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,430
Right now, I don't really care
if I succeed or fail.

107
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,430
At least I'm still passionate.

108
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,110
Writing everyday makes me happy.

109
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,470
That's good.

110
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,830
I'm not sure if Tong Tong is happy.

111
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,190
Xiao Hui, actually Tong Tong is...

112
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,470
That's enough.

113
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,260
Let me think about it.

114
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,110
Thank you.

115
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,310
Tong Tong.

116
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,670
Mother.

117
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,070
Do you feel better now?

118
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,510
Tong Tong. I'm...

119
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,070
Mother. I don't want to do ballet anymore.

120
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,070
I'm not throwing a tantrum.

121
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,990
I'm serious about this decision.

122
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,540
I know you won't like it.

123
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,870
But this time,

124
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,310
I'm going to listen to my heart.

125
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,150
My summer break is coming to an end.

126
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,910
I want to spend my time freely

127
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,950
just like other children.

128
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,190
So,

129
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,190
I'll stay at father's place
until school starts.

130
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,030
Take good care of yourself at home.

131
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,350
Tong Tong.

132
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,909
Your leg...

133
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,590
It will recover.

134
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,510
Hello, Junior?

135
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,350
Tong Xi won't be attending her class
for a few days.

136
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,550
Do you have any free time?

137
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,630
I have something to discuss with you.

138
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,190
Father. Why didn't you wake me up earlier?

139
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,350
I've slept way past noon.

140
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,340
Your break will be ending soon.

141
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,070
It's okay to just sleep in.

142
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,670
We can have breakfast anytime

143
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,790
after you wake up.

144
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,909
Eat up.

145
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,070
Have some meat.

146
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,630
No, I can't take meat.

147
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,390
I'm on diet.

148
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,980
You're still growing.

149
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,180
You should eat vegetables
and also meat for protein.

150
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,510
Don't worry. Just eat it.

151
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,750
[That's right.]

152
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,540
[Starting from today,]

153
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,190
[I don't have to stay fit anymore.]

154
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,550
[I don't have to dance anymore.]

[I'm free from those inhibitions.]

156
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,830
How is it?

157
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:34,669
Take a look at this.

158
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,909
This person called Xiao Bei

159
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,419
imitates your drawings and
posts them on Tieba.

160
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,429
The drawing is good.

161
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,309
I'm eager to know

162
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,870
if she's a cute lass

163
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,190
or a domineering lady.

164
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,660
Maybe he's a middle-aged man.

165
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,030
You really think
you have fans from all ages?

166
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,230
To be honest,

167
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,110
this is my first time seeing you
eating ice cream.

168
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,710
Don't make a fuss over it.

169
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,350
Ever since I moved to my father's place,

170
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,390
I've been eating ice cream everyday.

171
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,230
I'll eat as much ice creams
as I didn't get to have

172
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,350
for all these years.

173
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,270
Tong Xi told me to invite you over
to her father's place

174
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,950
for seafood dinner this weekend.

175
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,310
A dinner gathering?

176
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,390
That's how it should be.

177
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,310
We should have a gathering
before our holiday ends.

178
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,350
Prawns, crabs

179
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,870
and some beer too.

180
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:21,750
Wang Yi Ming.

181
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,310
You drink?

182
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,430
Where did you learn that from?

183
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,550
Do you want to come over to
my father's place during this weekend?

184
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,350
I invited Tao Zhu and Wang Yi Ming

185
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,230
for seafood dinner.

186
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,310
Ice creams and seafood dinner.

187
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,390
You seemed to be letting your hair down.

188
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,940
That's none of your business.

189
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,990
Take this.

190
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,310
Have you heard about it?

191
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,980
Tong Xi doesn't go to
her dance classes anymore.

192
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,740
Is that true?

193
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,710
Her mother is strong-willed.

194
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,750
She wouldn't have agreed.

195
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,390
That's why she moved out
to her father's place.

196
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,830
I guess things didn't go well
between her and her mother.

197
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,780
[Office]

198
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,830
Senior.

199
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,310
I'm free now. Can we talk?

200
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,510
Okay.

201
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,390
Let's talk somewhere else.

202
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,710
Senior. I'm sorry.

203
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:30,910
I've been busy recently.

204
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,070
I only have time today.

205
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,710
It's okay. I know you're busy.

206
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,140
I wanted to meet you

207
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,270
mainly to discuss about Tong Xi.

208
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,070
That night during the Arts Festival,

209
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,180
we had a big argument.

210
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,670
She doesn't want to dance anymore.

211
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,950
I...

212
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,550
Actually, when you called me the other day

213
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,710
to suspend her class,

214
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,030
I knew something was wrong.

215
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,900
Regarding this matter,

216
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,310
I'm prepared.

217
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,150
It's bound to happen one day.

218
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,670
You knew this would happen too?

219
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,590
To be honest,

220
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,350
in the beginning,

221
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,670
she had already told me that

222
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,430
she didn't want to participate
in the Arts Festival.

223
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,070
Later on, when we had a chat
during break time,

224
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,750
she told me that you moved back
to Xi Hai because of her.

225
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,550
She also saw the present
that you gave her.

226
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,830
Since then, she never had
any complaints anymore

227
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,550
during her dance practices.

228
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,790
Moreover,

229
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,230
she really pushed herself
through the tough trainings

230
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,470
to prepare for the Arts Festival.

231
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,270
At the end of the day,

232
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,230
she never liked dancing

233
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,190
in the very first place.

234
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,750
She only did it because of me.

235
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,670
Senior.

236
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,660
I understand you wanted
to cultivate talents.

237
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,390
But we know well that

238
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,470
passion for dancing

239
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,310
cannot be forced.

240
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,550
Take me as an example.

241
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,790
I used to dance clumsily

242
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,230
until the day

243
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,950
I discovered my passion for dancing.

244
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,790
That's why I took this path.

245
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,110
As for you,

246
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,510
from the very beginning

247
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,470
you were determined
about taking this path.

248
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,830
Although you can't dance anymore,

249
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,710
you still work in a related field.

250
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:19,630
Father.

251
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,510
I'm back!

252
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,070
Thank you for cooking this meal.

253
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,510
You're so cool, uncle.

254
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,590
Here you go.

255
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,700
What's that smell?

256
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,750
Start the fun without me.

257
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,830
I still need to prepare the food.

258
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,750
Father. Do you need my help?

259
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,430
Give it to me.

260
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,510
I'll help you.

261
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:38,590
Let's go.

262
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,190
Uncle, you must have prepared iced beer.

263
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,990
Iced beer? You're still underage.

264
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,310
I feel like having one.

265
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,830
-I'll go grab some cups.
-Let's go.

266
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,030
Father. Can I get some cups?

267
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,550
Here you go.

268
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,350
[We've been dancing for years.]

269
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,230
[We clearly know that]

270
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,910
[besides talent and skills,]

271
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,510
[the most important thing in dance]

272
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,430
[is the passion that comes naturally.]

273
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,590
[If Tong Xi is dancing for you]

274
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,150
[but not herself,]

275
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,670
[it will be difficult for her]

276
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,430
[to continue pursuing this path.]

277
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,550
It's too painful. I want to quit dancing.

278
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,830
You want to quit dancing?

279
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,950
What do you want?

280
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,230
I want to quit dancing!
I want to quit dancing!

281
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,270
You're the one who wants to dance,

282
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,430
not me.

283
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,310
Your birthday is the day I suffered.

284
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,870
That's why you should
work harder in dancing.

285
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,780
Don't disappoint me.

286
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,790
Mother, I don't want to do ballet anymore.

287
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,630
I'm not throwing a tantrum.

288
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,630
I'm serious in making this decision.

289
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,070
Lin Nan Yi? Seriously?

290
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,430
His gut was as small as a sesame seed
when he was little.

291
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,470
When I took him to climb trees,

292
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,510
he was so afraid that he wet himself.

293
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,390
Lin, is that true?

294
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,150
Are you serious?

295
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:14,910
That's enough.

296
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,870
You speak as if you were
proud of your childhood.

297
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,310
Wang Yi Ming, stop laughing.

298
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,390
Lin was timid when he was little.

299
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,550
But you were stupid.

300
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,470
You know what?

301
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,870
When he was little, he sucked a pen

302
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,790
with his mouth.

303
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,470
The ink didn't fade off for a few days.

304
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,630
He was like a Smurf.

305
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,270
Stop it.

306
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,070
You carry on talking.

307
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,310
I'll check on the fire in the kitchen.

308
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,820
Alright, uncle. Please go ahead.

309
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:40,870
Still laughing? You were no better.

310
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,510
Watching CCTV when you're a kid,

311
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,270
did you do a hand salute

312
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,270
when you heard the opening song?

313
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,670
You did that right?

314
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,590
Tao Zhu, is that true?

315
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,580
You ask for it.

316
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,870
I don't remember.

317
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,390
If you don't watch what you say,

318
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,510
I'll punch you.

319
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,310
Did you see that?

320
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,070
She's always like this.

321
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,550
Forcing her way with her fist.

322
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,430
I don't believe she is capable though.

323
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,500
That wasn't a hand salute, you know.

324
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:11,700
[Tong Tong. I've made up my mind.]

325
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:14,430
[If you really don't want
to do ballet anymore,]

326
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:15,950
[then don't do it.]

327
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,390
[Your happiness matters the most.]

328
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,470
[I'll respect your decision.]

329
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:21,710
[I'll wait for you to come home.]

330
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:23,950
What does this mean?

331
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,069
That means Tong Xi's mother

332
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,590
is allowing her to quit ballet.

333
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,510
Is that true?

334
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:31,950
That means

335
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,310
I've won this battle?

336
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,230
Congratulations.

337
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,950
Congratulations to Tong Xi

338
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,150
for winning this battle!

339
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:38,950
Thank you.

340
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,790
Cheers!

341
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,670
You don't have to send us off, uncle.

342
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,950
Thank you, uncle.
Thank you, Tong Xi.

343
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,070
We'll leave now.

344
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,750
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

345
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,390
Goodnight.

346
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:49,910
Goodbye.

347
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,820
Tong Tong.

348
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,510
Did your mother text you just now?

349
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,660
Father. How did you know?

350
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,430
I saw you're really having fun just now.

351
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,110
Tong Tong.

352
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,550
I'm very happy

353
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,590
you came to stay with me.

354
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,340
But your mother is alone.

355
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,310
She must be lonely.

356
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,630
Since she's willing to give in,

357
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,830
and also respects
your decision and feelings,

358
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,670
shouldn't you

359
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,190
give her a response?

360
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,510
A response?

361
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,470
Well,

362
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,030
I've figured it out for you.

363
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,670
If you agree,

364
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,550
bring the seafood I prepared

365
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,990
for your mother.

366
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,260
Mother, I'm home.

367
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,350
You're back?

368
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,230
Mother.

369
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,790
I've packed them up.

370
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,390
We won't keep these

371
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,750
in our house anymore.

372
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,550
Mother, where is that pair
of dancing shoes?

373
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,630
The one with wings on it?

374
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,630
I didn't throw that out.
I put them back at the same place.

375
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:35,750
That's a relief.

376
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,150
Is your leg better?

377
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,470
Mother.

378
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,510
Here are some seafood

379
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,100
father wants me to give you.

380
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,790
Eat it while it's hot.

381
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,230
Let's eat them together.

382
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,470
I've eaten dinner.

383
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,790
But I can eat a little more with you.

384
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,950
[Blue Elephant]

385
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,430
I've transferred your salary
for this month to your bank account.

386
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,950
I got it.

387
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,910
Thank you, Miss Mi Ya

388
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,630
for your punctual and
generous funding every month.

389
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:53,710
It's my pleasure.

390
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,870
But school is reopening soon.

391
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,070
Wouldn't you receive...

392
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,430
Speaking of the devil.

393
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:04,910
Aren't you going to take a look?

394
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,070
That is not the salary
I've transferred to you.

395
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,590
It's okay.

396
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,830
That must be my school fees.

397
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,750
This is for you.

398
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,510
Your foster parents
delivered it this morning.

399
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,950
Lin Nan Yi. You're really something.

400
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,950
Two school fees in a day

401
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:28,940
and one salary.

402
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,910
You're really rich.

403
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,910
Well, I've got work to do.

404
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,270
Watch the store.

405
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,310
Goodbye.

406
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,430
[Good news!]

407
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:10,190
[I reconciled with my mother last night.]

408
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,590
[Guru Qing He, you know what?]

409
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,310
[I'm so happy right now.]

410
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,230
[Congratulations.]

411
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,070
[A huge problem is resolved.]

412
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,110
[Moreover,]

413
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,030
[she won't force me to do ballet anymore.]

414
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,950
[I'm free to do anything I like.]

415
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,430
[Anyhow, although
I don't do ballet anymore,]

416
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,510
[I'll still have to find]

417
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,340
[my real goal and dream]

418
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,350
[and strive hard to achieve them.]

419
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,830
Tong Tong, what do you want
for dinner tonight?

420
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,710
I want your handmade dumplings.

421
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,630
Okay.

422
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:50,870
Oh right.

423
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,350
Give your father a call.

424
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,590
Ask him to join us.

425
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,390
Sure.

426
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,470
[What is your dream?]

427
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,750
My dream...

428
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,230
I'll have to think hard about it.

429
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:33,120
[Chapter 25:
Distance between Me and My Dreams]

430
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,590
[Tong Xi, can you give me]

431
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,910
[Lin Nan Yi's contact number?]

432
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,070
Senior Wei Ze?

433
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,990
Why does he need Lin Nan Yi's contact?

434
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,310
Have you noticed
this person called Xiao Bei

435
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,990
on Tieba?

436
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,550
I have.

437
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,710
Isn't he always imitating
Guru Qing He's drawings?

438
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,110
His drawings looked silly

439
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,430
but quite interesting.

440
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,500
Wang Yi Ming.

441
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,750
Don't you read before copying the answers?

442
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:09,950
I did.

443
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,990
I read them in one glance.

444
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,550
The purpose of wage reform

445
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,790
in the eighties of the 20th century.

446
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,470
Isn't this question asking about

447
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,190
earth rotation and revolution
as well as the ecliptic obliquity?

448
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:28,510
You're replying Geography questions
with answers for History.

449
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,710
What a genius.

450
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,470
You're in sophomore year.
Why are you still copying homework?

451
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:33,550
Do it yourself.

452
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,430
Oh right, Tong Xi.

453
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,910
We'll have to choose our streams
when school reopens.

454
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,310
Are you planning to choose
art stream or science stream?

455
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,030
Probably art stream.

456
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:43,990
I haven't really made up my mind.

457
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,510
After all, I'm still clueless
about my future pursues.

458
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,670
Don't worry.

459
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,510
You still have time.

460
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,390
Take your time to think about it.

461
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,510
I've thought about it.

462
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,230
There's no point in rushing.

463
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,430
Moreover, not everyone at our age

464
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,110
knows exactly what they wish to pursue
in the future.

465
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,310
I'll just live in the moment.

466
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,910
Our summer break will be over
in a few more days.

467
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,710
I need to make full use
of the remaining days

468
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,550
and make them meaningful.

469
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,860
Watch me play then.

470
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,910
There'll be a basketball match tomorrow.
It's the last match before school reopens.

471
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,950
It will be meaningful.

472
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,460
Come support me if we're buddies.

473
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:31,550
Hello?

474
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,470
[Hello. Are you Lin Nan Yi?]

475
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,710
[Sorry to calling.]

476
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:35,750
[I'm Wei Ze.]

477
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,630
I'm wondering if you have
some free time lately.

478
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,390
I have a favour to ask from you.

479
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,710
It's September now.

480
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,590
Why is the weather still so hot?

481
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,830
I'm craving ice creams.

482
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,670
The one near the coastal road?

483
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:51,790
Strawberry flavour.

484
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,270
Me too. Let's go.

485
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,790
What about me?

486
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:00,950
Help!

487
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,270
My phone!

488
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,030
Catch this thief!

489
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,430
How dare a thief appear before me?

490
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:07,710
Stop there!

491
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,150
Return my phone!

492
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,230
Sun Jie Ping?

493
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,070
This is yours?

494
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,550
Thank you.

495
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,470
I just bought this phone.

496
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,910
If it weren't for you,

497
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,270
I would be doomed.

498
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,790
No worries.

499
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,590
When you smashed the ball just now,

500
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,630
you looked really cool.

501
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,390
Really?

502
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,110
Listen here. I'll give you a tip.

503
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,710
You know,

504
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,140
when a girl is alone outside,

505
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,590
it's better to walk
on the opposite sidewalk.

506
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:03,030
When you do so,
everyone will be coming towards you.

507
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:03,710
Am I right?

508
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,670
If anyone has bad intentions,

509
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,830
you'll be able to see it coming.

510
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,870
But isn't that going against traffic flow?

511
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,950
Special resolutions for special cases.

512
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,270
I'll bear that in mind.

513
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,310
Thank you.

514
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,950
I've caused you too much trouble today.

515
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,140
It's not a big deal.

516
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,630
It's time for me to blast off now.

517
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,270
Goodbye.

518
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,110
Where are we going to?

519
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:40,470
Sheng City.

520
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:41,510
Sheng City?

521
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,230
Why are we going there?

522
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,310
It's a secret.

523
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,590
There you go again.

524
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,980
You kidnapped me to
the aquarium last time.

525
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,390
Now it's Sheng City.

526
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,390
Don't you want to spend
the remaining holiday meaningfully?

527
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,510
Just follow me.

528
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,430
Are we here

529
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,790
to visit someone?

530
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,390
Do you still remember

531
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:09,830
that person who imitated my drawings

532
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,870
on Tieba?

533
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,740
Xiao Bei?

534
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,150
He's seriously ill now

535
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,790
and needs to undergo
an operation immediately.

536
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,150
He's inside this ward.

537
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,390
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

538
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,750
I could have prepared myself earlier.

539
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,550
What should I say when I enter later?

540
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,350
Relax.

541
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,870
Just go in with me

542
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,790
to give him some motivations

543
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:29,790
and confidence.

544
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:31,470
Let's go.

545
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,060
[To Xiao Bei: Good luck
and beat the disease!]

546
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,660
Thank you, Brother Qing He.

547
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,470
I'll do my best.

548
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,550
Stay warm now.

549
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,750
Can you sign on this book?

550
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:57,470
I want to give it to my mother as a gift.

551
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,790
Ever since I was ill,

552
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,950
she's been taking care of me
in the hospital.

553
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,110
It's tiring for her.

554
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:13,830
Madam.

555
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,510
Hello, madam.

556
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,710
Nice to meet you. Sit down.

557
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,910
Mother, this is for you.

558
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,590
Brother Qing He signed on it personally.

559
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,670
No matter what happens to me,

560
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,270
this comic book will always accompany you.

561
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,590
You'll think of me when you see it.

562
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,510
Thank you, my baby.

563
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,790
You'll get well soon.

564
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,870
This comic book and you

565
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,150
will both accompany me, okay?

566
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:43,870
Thank you so much.

567
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,630
It's been a long time since

568
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,030
I last saw Bei Bei this happy.

569
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,510
After being admitted to
the hospital for so many days,

570
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,100
he has nobody his age to play with him.

571
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,910
But he's not alone thanks to your comics.

572
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,670
Should we draw together?

573
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,630
Sure.

574
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,910
But my drawing is bad.

575
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,510
It's okay.

576
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,190
I'll teach you.

577
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,190
Here.

578
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,830
Draw this first.

579
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,270
Do you see it?

580
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,430
Draw this first. Then draw that.

581
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,990
That's right. Look here.

582
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,070
Brother Qing He teaches me how to draw.

583
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,070
What will you teach me?
