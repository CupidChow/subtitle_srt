00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,390
at the gate if you're so free.

177
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,590
Who?

178
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,830
Me?

179
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,740
Yeah. Why?

180
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,830
Time to meet your mother-in-law.

181
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,550
Forget it. I'll go.

182
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,110
Let me go.

183
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,790
I can tell she really likes me

184
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,710
the other day.

185
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,870
Tao Zi, what's your problem?

186
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,830
-What's your problem?
-Stop.

187
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,990
Continue working.

188
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,150
Mr. Jia, thanks.

189
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,870
How is Nan Yi doing?

190
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,070
He's great.

191
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,140
Nan Yi.

192
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,510
Nan Yi.

193
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:05,990
Nan Yi.

194
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,990
Who asks you to come?

195
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:13,820
Nan Yi.

196
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,070
Your mum

197
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,270
came to see Mr. Jia to help you transfer

198
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,830
to Nan Hai High School.

199
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,150
I already made myself clear.

200
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,590
I won't transfer!

201
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,150
Why can't you leave me alone?

202
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,110
I don't know what's happening,

203
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,270
but Nan Yi,

204
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,870
talk nicely, alright?

205
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,710
Mr. Jia, this is not his fault.

206
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,190
I'm actually here

207
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,550
to talk to you only.

208
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:36,990
But...

209
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:37,870
Talk about what?

210
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,550
Did you get my consent to see him?

211
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,270
Nan Yi, she's doing this

212
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,390
for your own good.

213
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:48,950
I told you

214
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,510
not to disturb me.

215
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,510
You abandoned me in the past.

216
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,510
Now you want me back?

217
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,270
Did I agree?

218
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,870
What do you think I am?

219
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,390
Nan Yi, I can explain.

220
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,470
Well, thanks.

221
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,300
I don't need you

222
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,230
in my life.

223
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,190
Nan Yi.

224
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,150
Nan Yi.

225
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,540
That boy...

226
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,910
How could he do this?

227
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:19,750
I'm sorry.

228
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,270
Mr. Jia.

229
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,990
I'm sorry.

230
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,710
Lin Nan Yi.

231
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,430
Wait for me. My legs hurt.

232
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,230
Go back.

233
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,470
I want to be alone.

234
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,270
What's wrong with you?

235
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,150
I'm fine.

236
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,110
Fine?

237
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,990
I've never seen you this angry.

238
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:48,990
Nan Yi.

239
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,630
You promised

240
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,990
you won't hide anything from me.

241
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,430
She's my birth mother.

242
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,710
Nan Yi.

243
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,110
It's not my place to say this.

244
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,150
But I think we should talk.

245
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,150
I kind of know

246
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,630
what happened in your family now.

247
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,630
I heard you've been

248
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,550
living alone all this while.

249
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:49,750
They just

250
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,150
couldn't find the right time

251
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:51,750
to talk to you.

252
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,350
This is also my fault.

253
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,870
I didn't do my job well.

254
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:57,990
I have no idea

255
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,830
you are living alone.

256
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,230
Mr. Jia.

257
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,190
It's okay.

258
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,590
I'm already

259
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,510
used to it.

260
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,180
Nan Yi.

261
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,470
I believe your parents came to me

262
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,830
because they're at their wits' end.

263
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,870
I know that

264
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,830
I'm in no position to tell you what to do.

265
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,990
But you must have suffered

266
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,990
all these years.

267
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,710
You know what you're doing.

268
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,340
And I'll support the choice you make.

269
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,420
But before you make one,

270
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,150
why not give them a chance?

271
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,630
It's always better

272
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,380
to make things clear.

273
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,070
Don't you think so?

274
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,790
Okay. Go back to the classroom.

275
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,970
[Blue Elephant]

276
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:05,470
What happened?

277
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,790
I came right after you called.

278
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,550
Where's Lin?

279
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,830
I'm asking.

280
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,230
Sister Mi Ya, do you know what happened

281
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,550
in his family?

282
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,470
I know a little.

283
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,070
But I can't tell.

284
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,990
Let him tell you himself.

285
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,550
I knew it.

286
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,900
He's been hiding things,

287
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,110
but he won't tell me.

288
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,910
What a buddy, huh?

289
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,830
Knock it off.

290
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,310
You don't know anything.

291
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,670
Hold your temper.

292
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,190
Sister Mi Ya.

293
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,340
You look upset.

294
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,990
Did something happen to Lin?

295
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,550
Not him,

296
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,910
but me and Andre.

297
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,510
Andre promised to visit me this month.

298
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,350
But he just called

299
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,110
and said he couldn't come
as his private jet's documents

300
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,230
have expired.

301
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,030
Private jet?

302
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,310
Expired documents?

303
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,230
Say something.

304
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,590
Look, Sister Mi Ya.

305
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,630
As the saying goes, "A duckweed
belongs to the sea in the end."

306
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,110
This is a small world.

307
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,030
His return date is unknown.

308
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,110
And the rain is pouring...

309
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,990
What an inauspicious day.

310
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,830
That's not how you comfort others.

311
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,030
You'd better keep your mouth shut.

312
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:02,910
Stop.

313
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,350
Wrong position again.

314
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,510
Tong Xi.

315
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,100
You requested this extra class.

316
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,590
Focus.

317
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,150
I'm sorry, Mr Xu.

318
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:15,590
Never mind.

319
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,070
Take a break.

320
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,830
Hi, who is this?

321
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,260
I heard you and Nan Yi are close.

322
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,910
Please do me a favour.

323
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,550
I want a better chance for him.

324
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,110
Being so talented in drawing,

325
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,630
he should be professionally trained

326
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,910
at an institute.

327
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,390
That's why I'm seeing you.

328
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,390
Please talk to him.

329
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,910
Don't let his resentment towards me

330
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,150
get in the way of his choice

331
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,750
and future.

332
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,790
Seriously, Aunt?

333
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,270
You left him since he was born,

334
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,990
and only return after so many years?

335
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,620
All this while,

336
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,270
you only stayed connected

337
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,790
through a bank card.

338
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,030
But he left the money untouched.

339
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,750
He works and sells his drawing

340
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,190
to earn his tuition fees
and other expenses.

341
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,750
How am I going to

342
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,590
talk him out of it?

343
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,310
Back then,

344
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,230
I was young.

345
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,110
Only a few years older than you now.

346
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:33,990
His dad died young.

347
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,390
I was alone and helpless.

348
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,070
It was impossible

349
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,750

and poverty.

352
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,820
But I can't have Nan Yi
go through that with me.

353
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,550
Never mind.

354
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,230
Though I had no choice,

355
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,510
that doesn't change
the fact that I've hurt him

356
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,390
and left him with pain.

357
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,790

358
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,630
living with regret,

359
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,950
and I deserve

his cold attitude.

363

I really hope

364
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,020
he puts his future first.

365
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,710
And I will

366
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,110
slowly make things up

367
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,870

368
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,190
and redeem myself.

So, Early Summer is Nan Yi's wishes.

377
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,990
Tong Tong, you're home.

378
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,740
Your teacher said that

379
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,070
I can rest assured as
you're a sensible student

380
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,350
with goals

381

383
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,460
So, can you relax now?

384
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,550
As long as you're my daughter,

385
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,980
I'll always worry about you.

386
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,230
But,

387
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,990
fortunately you get better every day.

388
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,110
I'm glad.

389
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,630
You can read the comic book.

390
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,430
But not for too long.

391
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,590
I'll make dinner.

When we were new in Da Cheng,

396
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,150
you had to take care of me alone.

397
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,380
It must be hard.

398
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,230
Not really.

399
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,910
Back then,

400
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,950
although naughty,

401
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,270
you were a good girl.

If you were younger,

403
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,550
I may not make it.

404
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,349
I'll always listen to you.

405
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,790
I promise, Mum.

406
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,869
That's enough. I need to cook.

407

I

420

have something to tell you.

421
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,590
Actually,

422
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,270
you have another mother.

423
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,990
At that time,

424
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,550
your father passed away
after you were born.

425
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,190
Your mother

426
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,270
was struggling in life.

427
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,950
So, she handed you to us.

428
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,110
Now that you're a big boy,

429
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:16,950
your mother

430
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,910

Are you and mummy leaving me?

433
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,350
That's not possible.

434
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,710
But you can live a better life

435
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,700
with your mother.

436
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,670
She is at the gate now.

437
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,390
Later,

438
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,430
you can go with her.

439
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,670
Don't go with her.

440
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,590
What should I do?

441
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,430
She abandoned you since birth

442
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,550
and has never showed interest in you.

443
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,350
Yet she wants you to go with her?

444
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,550
Can a mother do that?

445

You didn't answer my calls.

466

I was worried.

467
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,750
I dozed off,

468
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,790

what to do.

479

00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,430
Am I a dimwit?

525
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,470
You're not.

526
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,190
But your eyes were on someone else.

527
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,750
That's not true.

528
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,670
Actually,

529
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,150
hanging out with Sun Jie Ping

530
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,630
is tiring.

531
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,900
As if I'll believe.

532
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,350
I swear it is.

533
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,150
Getting to know someone

534
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,390
or being known by someone all over again

535
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,590
is very troublesome.

536
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,230
Take Lin's matter for example.

537
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,870
Talking about it with Sun Jie Ping

538
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,380
means I have to tell her

539
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,950
about me and Lin,

540
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,190
and explain

541
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,950
how close we are.

542
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,270
Yet she may not understand.

543
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,790
But you're different.

544
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:04,630
You

545
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,260
get it easily when I say it.

546
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,470
I can't believe a talker like you

547
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,630
finds it tiring to talk.

548
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,910
I don't talk a lot with anybody

549
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,990
but close friends.

550
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,030
But in order to get close,

551
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,350
you have to talk.

552
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,860
However, I have to

553
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,550
repeat the stories before talking.

554
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,310
That kills my mood.

555
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:29,990
Wang Yi Ming.

556
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,110
Hello.

557
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,270
Why didn't you text me back?

558
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,430
I want to buy some reference books.

559
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,630
Do you want to come?

560
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,950
I...

561
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,670
You talk.

562
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,990
I'll leave you alone.

563
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,060
Tao Zi.

564
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,110
Why, Wang Yi Ming?

565
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,710
You have something on?

566
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,510
No.

567
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:55,780
Let's go.

568
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,900
I've talked to him.

569
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,390
He's determined.

570
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,670
He doesn't want to leave Xi Hai

571
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,750
or reconcile with them.

572
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,750
That does sound like Lin.

573
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:18,750
Although he keeps a playful attitude,

574
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,860
he always handles problems

575
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,750
in a more matured way than any of us.

576
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,870
Is that so?

577
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,260
But it sounds more like

578
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,580
remarks made out of pique

579
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,900
to me.

580
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,070
[That's possible.]

581
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,390
[As we]

582
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,710
[can stay calm only
when it's not our problem.]

583
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:35,270
Mature or not, he's still a high schooler.

584
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,110
I can see why he acts rashly.

585
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,630
That actually makes sense.

586
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,110
Yeah.

587
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,230
But Tong Xi,

588
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,230
listen to me.

589
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,270
[No matter what Lin Nan Yi chooses,]

590
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,550
[he has his own reasons.]

591
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:49,140
Don't try to be the good Samaritan.

592
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,110
Got it?

593
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,310
Yeah. That's why I'm struggling.

594
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,550
After I talked

595
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,430
to his birth mother a few days ago,

596
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:57,710
she seems

597
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,070
like she had no choice to me.

598
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,670
It was understandable.

599
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:01,830
[I know.]

600
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,190
But I promised Lin Nan Yi

601
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,310
to side with him

602
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,710
no matter what.

603
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,260
I don't know what to do now.

604
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,390
[I have a strange feeling]

605
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,340
[when I read Early Summer now.]

606
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,990
[Next step is to filter.]

607
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,860
I forgot to filter it.

608
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,590
Tao Zi, I have something to do.

609
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,430
[Let's talk next time.]

610
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:20,990
Bye.

611
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:21,790
Okay.

612
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,830
[Help, I'm having desserts again.]

613
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,390
[Call me now]

614
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,550
[and say I need to go home]

615
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:32,710
[due to family matter.]

616
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,910
[Tao Zi.]

617
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,590
[Are you there?]

618
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,470
One, two, three.

619
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,030
[Hi. What?]

620
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,030
[I'm wanted?]

621
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,430
[Okay. I'll be there.]

622
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,070
Wang Yi Ming.

623
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,510
Can you handle your own stuff

624
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,990
and stop disturbing me?

625
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,510
[Is that Tao Zi?]

626
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,430
What a nuisance!

627
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:16,830
Tong Xi.

628
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,990
I heard that idiot and Sun Jie Ping

629
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,510
are going to the night market.

630
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,830
Shall we do homework at Blue Elephant?

631
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,030
I can't make it.

632
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,990
I need to talk with Lin Nan Yi.

633
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:33,470
Okay.

634
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:34,710
See you.

635
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:35,510
Bye.

636
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,110
Bye.

637
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,940
You're ready? Come on.

638
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,510
I don't have to work.

639
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,190
Let's have fun.

640
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:57,470
What is it?

641
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:02,950
Lin Nan Yi.

642
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:06,470
Do you want to go home?

643
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,150
What?

644
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,430
Before you make up your mind,

645
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,380
why don't you talk it out

646
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,230
with them first?

647
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,430
Can you do that?

648
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,710
I'll go with you.

649
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,390
Do you want me

650
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,310
to reconcile with her?

651
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,470
I don't know them.

652
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,550
And I'll support you

653
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,870
whichever way.

654
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,030
But...

655
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,870
I want you to stop pushing yourself.

656
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:08,990
Dad. Mum.

657
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:10,550
So?

658
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:12,670
Not bad.

659
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:13,350
What's this?

660
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:15,150
It's mint.

661
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,270
How did I do?

662
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,390
You did a good job.

663
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,750
Well done.
