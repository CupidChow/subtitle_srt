00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,710
how important you are to me?

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,190
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,470
I'm going to leave Xi Hai by tomorrow.

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,070
This time, I don't want to
leave any regrets behind.

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,790
I want you to know

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,740
what you mean to me.

10
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,790
I don't want our story to end here.

11
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,190
Do you understand me?

12
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,870
I need to thank you no matter what.

13
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,550
You provided me with the best memories
during my youth.

14
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,380
That fact will never change.

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:41,950
Thank you for caring about me.

16
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,510
Thank you for your trust
and companionship.

17
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,270
Because of you,

18
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,670
there's no regret in my youth.

19
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,390
We will see each other again soon.

By the way, is Lin Nan Yi leaving today?

Aren't you going to see him off?

But, you have a point.

34

How did you know I would come today?

00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:49,790
Based on my instinct.

57
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,740
I changed my ticket
to the next bus ticket.

58
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,030
If you didn't come for the next two hours,

59
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,350
maybe I would've left the town.

60

It's lucky that I got here in time.

Tong Xi,

62
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,910
I was pretty happy

64
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,670
You're leaving soon.

65
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,070
Only at this time, I realised

66

how important you are to me.

00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,670
Now that I think about it,

68

it seems like I didn't bid you
a proper farewell.

You can write a letter to me right now.

76
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,030
When I was young,

77
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,230
I wrote so many letters to you,

78
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,950
yet you didn't receive them at all.

79
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,550
Now, I'm sure you'll receive my letters.

You can write whatever you want.

82

I guess they're crying while
bidding farewell to each other.

97

You're crying as if
something had happened to Lin.

I'm sure he'll return here.
