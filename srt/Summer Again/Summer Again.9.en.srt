00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,710
Tao Zi suffered bad

But, Tong Xi took her away.

You've come around.

How did I end up here?

27
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,789
You fainted because of low blood sugar.

28
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:27,460
Did you not eat well
when you came back here?

29
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:29,510
Well yeah,

30

this place has nothing nice to eat.

Uhm... Sorry to have

32
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,460
troubled you, Senior.

Nah, it's the other way around.

00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,390
Thanks for coming to fetch me
even when you need to go to school.

35
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:44,950
Oh, right. I used

36
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,150
your mobile phone to

37
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,259
contact your classmate.

38
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,270
He'll be here in any minute.

So, you were the one Senior contacted?

Where's that Senior of yours?

60
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,910
He needed to handle some
student registration procedure.

He's tight on time.

65
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,950
It's just reasonable for him
to attend to important matters.

66
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,150
Are you saying a living, breathing
human that just fainted

67

Upset?

70
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,350
I'm not upset.

71
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,670
I'm just disappointed for you.

72

end up fainting in front of him.

This is bad.

I think Senior's impression of me

147
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,590

He can't despise you, can he?

152
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,909
You might not know this,

153

but Senior treats people strictly.

154

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,310
he led the choir to perform.

156
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,870
One of the girls had the
slightest wrinkle on her attire.

157
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,590
Once they're back stage,
he told her off straight.

158
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:10,630
I heard,

159
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,470
the girl ran out crying.

160
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,310
Wow, that's scary.

Stuck like glue once she's back.
Something's up for sure.

167

Just tell me what you know already.

168
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,550

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,630
I'd like to ask

173
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,190
if you're in the same class as Tong Xi?

174
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,750
There's something I need to see her for.

175
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,380
Can you take me to her?

176
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,870
Senior, I bet you're close to Tong Xi

177
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,430
back in Da Cheng?

178
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,030
Our class heard that

179
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,430
she's gotten international awards

180
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,750
and danced with mega stars

181
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,390
and starred in drama series.

182
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,510
Are those true?

183
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,030
This way.

184
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,190
Didn't you notice that Tong Xi and Tao Zhu

185
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,390
are being affected by
something weird recently?

186
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,390
Such as?

187
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,150
Both of them

188
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,870
each has a Senior.

189
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,750
I know about Tao Zhu's Senior.

190
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,630
That ugly squidhead, Xu Ao.

191
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,550
What's Tong Xi's Senior like?

192
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,910
Senior.

193
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,550
What? Where?

194
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,630
My gosh. So handsome.

195
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,390
There he is.

196
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,710
Let's go.

197
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,550
The bell has rung!

198
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,870
Where are you looking at?

199
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,310
Sir,

200
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,710
this Senior

201
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,510
switched from Da Cheng to our school.

202
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,980
He's come to look for Tong Xi.

203
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,750
Enough of the chatter.

204
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:46,910
Tong Xi,

205
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,070
go.

206
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,550
Thank you, sir.

207
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,590
He's Tong Xi's friend.

208
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,150
The White Swan and Senior,
what a matchless handsome couple!

209
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,110
Exactly!

210
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,230
What a handsome couple, I envy them.

211
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,470
Living thing.

212
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,260
Senior.

213
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,630
Enough chatter.

214
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,270
Let's resume with P.E. class.

215
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,310
For today, we're having basketball

216
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,710
one-on-one match.

217
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,790
Pick your opponent.

218
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,710
Senior, are you done
with the registration?

219
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,310
Yes. How are you feeling?

220
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,260
Are you better now?

221
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,780
Sorry to have troubled you just now.

222
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,150
Is it okay for you to wait for me?

223
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,270
I'd like to treat you
to dinner after class.

224
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,860
Okay.

225
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,990
I'll find a place to do revision.

226
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,270
The girls can practise volleyball

227
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,990
or watch the boys in their match,

228
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,270
but no running around.

229
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,030
Or else, other teacher will be

230
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,790
taking over P.E. class next time.

231
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,390
What?

232
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,790
Cut it out!

233
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,270
Begin practising. Dismiss.

234
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,310
Okay.

235
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,830
So? Is it the both of us?

236
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,150
Get your own opponent.

237
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,830
Go back to class.

238
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,790
See you later.

239
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,510
Okay.

240
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,990
Senior, want to play?

241
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,150
One-on-one.

242
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,590
There's one spot left.

243
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:22,750
Alright.

244
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,070
We have a friendly match.

245
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,590
Game at three points.

246
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,540
Ready?

247
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,390
Go! Go! Go!

248
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:57,270
Go! Go! Go!

249
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,700
I don't even know

250
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,550
who to support.

251
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,030
Gosh, Lin Nan Yi,

252
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,710
why wouldn't he compete with Senior
in piano-playing?

253
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,390
Senior, go!

254
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,190
Hey, how could you support an outsider?

255
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,700
Lin Nan Yi! Go!

256
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:19,790
Nan Yi! Go!

257
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,150
Lin, guard his right hand!

258
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:32,990
Guard his right hand!

259
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,710
Lin Nan Yi! Go!

260
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,710
Go!

261
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,230
Go! Go! Go!

262
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,340
Lin Nan Yi! Go!

263
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,950
Good one!

264
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,990
Isn't this attacking?

265
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,350
Don't talk nonsense.

266
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,060
He's broken no rules.

267
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:01,630
Okay.

268
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,430
The score's two-two now.

269
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,470
Last shot.

270
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,430
Go!

271
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,390
Go! Go! Go!

272
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,350
Lin Nan Yi! Go!

273
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,430
Lin Nan Yi! Go!

274
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,150
Lin Nan Yi! Go!

275
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,190
Lin Nan Yi! Go!

276
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,420
Go! Go! Go!

277
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,270
Lin Nan Yi wins!

278
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,190
Incredible!

279
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,910
You identified my weakness in no time.

280
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,070
Lin, you're so cool!

281
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,070
Lin Nan Yi.

282
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,590
Senior, is your hand alright?

283
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:43,830
Yeah.

284
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,790
Congratulations, Lin Nan Yi.

285
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,030
You were exceptional!

286
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:48,990
Senior's not bad too.

287
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,340
Lin Nan Yi, why are you smiling?

288
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,830
Can't you play basketball properly?

289
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,790
Must you attack others?

290
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,390
He didn't. Why did you have to blame...

291
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,230
Tong Xi,

292
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,940
he didn't break any rule.

293
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,470
But, Senior, your wrist...

294
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,460
You heard it,

295
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,430
Senior said he didn't break any rule.

296
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,030
Why do you keep biting on to it?

297
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,990
Am I?

298
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,030
Pressing down the opponent's hand
in an acceptable way is normal.

299
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,230
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

300
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,510
Thank you for the match.

301
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,830
It's a good game.

302
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,870
I'll train well,

303
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,630
you won't stand a chance the next round.

304
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,550
Well, yeah!

305
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,110
Senior wasn't ready today.

306
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,190
He didn't even have the right shoes on.

307
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,680
[Ocean of Love hawker food stall]

308
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,670
Senior, I apologize.

309
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,580
My friend's gotten arrogant today.

310
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,950
Lin Nan Yi isn't normally like that.

311
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,830
I don't know what's gotten into him.

312
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,910
So, I'm sorry for that.

313
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,990
He doesn't know you well

314
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,900
but he came up to challenge you.

315
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,510
It's fine. Come to think of it,

316
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,430
I kind of like him.

317
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,510
Don't misread it. I mean, I admire him.

318
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,990
Although it's only
my first time meeting him,

319
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,870
I can feel that he's got
the spirit of excellence.

320
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,070
I like people like this.

321
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,230
That's why I agreed to play against him.

322
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,350
Yeah?

323
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,510
Yeah. And, I'm switching to this school

324
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,590
in the next semester.

325
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,430
It's not a bad thing to get to know

326
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:22,550
some

327
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,030
excellent people.

328
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,230
Stop wiping. It's clean already.

329
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,030
Is that Senior we saw

330
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:37,950
Tong Xi's crush?

331
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,510
From what I saw,

332
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,630
Tong Xi's been supporting him

333
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,950
all the way despite being from our class.

334
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,710
She went, "Senior! Go!"

335
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,950
"Senior! Go!"

336
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,830
She didn't even care to cheer for you.

337
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,790
However, that senior does have skills.

338
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,380
No wonder he's captured
the heart of our White Swan.

339
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,110
Lin,

340
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,310
you've got to get a grip.

341
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,390
Of what?

342
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,230
What do you think?

343
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,750
It's obvious.

Just look at how you react.

350
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,070
I'm right, huh?

351
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,300
You are indeed jealous.

352
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,070
I've told you that you and
White Swan are not normal.

353
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,550
But that's normal.

Ouch, ouch, ouch. What?

Have you sorted out Tao Zi's letter?

358
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,830
I read and understood it crystal clear.

359
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,830
It's too messy between girls and boys.

This brain of mine

361
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,870
just can't get it.

362
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,350
So, better a finger off than aye wagging.

363
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,790
I shall give it a clean cut.

It's full of Fauvism.

I'll think about it and get back to you.

I apologize.

395

I didn't know you don't take seafood.

396
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,670
It's fine.
It's not that I don't eat at all.

397
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,070
I usually have them at
Izakaya restaurants.

398
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,510
[Don't judge this restaurant by its look,]

399
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,310
the food here is sublime.

400
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,430
It could just be the best restaurant

401
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,470
in Xi Hai.

402
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,110
This place may appear a little dirty,

403
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,070
but the food here is sublime.

404
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,230
It could just be the best restaurant

405

in Xi Hai.

406
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,310
I can see that it's popular.

407
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:13,940
However,

408
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,190
seafood needs to be prepared in
a much more hygienic environment.

409
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,310
Plus, I have a sensitive

410
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,990
stomach.

411
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,630
So...

412
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,270
Of course,

413
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,030
there's much space for improvement
for customer service.

414

But,

415
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,500
I bet there aren't

416
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,030
decent restaurants in Xi Hai, huh?

417
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,150
To be honest, after going to Da Cheng,

418
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,270
I didn't feel like coming back here.

419
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,390
If it wasn't because of family matters

420
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,620
that I failed to register into
the school in Da Cheng,

421
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,470
I won't be forced to come back to take
the National College Entrance Exam.

422
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,950
Did you come back here to take the
National College Entrance Exam too?

423
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,310
I'm here with my mum due to

424
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,710
her job transfer.

425
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,990
She brought you back with her

426
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,550
because of her job transfer?

427
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,910
Isn't that too hasty?

428
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,750
You could have stayed in Da Cheng

429
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,150
and continued your studies there.

430
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,030
And,

431
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,940
I bet, it's hard for you to get used

432
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,790
to the environment here, huh?

433
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:21,190
My mum raised me alone all these years.

434
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,190
The thought of leaving me alone in
Da Cheng worries her.

435
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,070
So...

436
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,830
I struggled to get used to things
here when I just came back.

437
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,870
But, after some time, things are fine now.

438
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,990
It seems like you've made friends.

439

after living in Da Cheng for so long?

442
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,910
What do you usually talk about?

443
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,350
Is it about

444
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,580
how to fish?

445
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,510
Xiao Wan,

446
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,070
when people here were your age,

447
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,910
we were skilled in fishing,
drying nets and all sorts of things.

448
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,470
But youngsters at your age now

449
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,780
don't know many of these things.

450
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:13,750
Yeah.

451
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,630
So, why don't you train
my younger brother?

452
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,270
With such results,

453
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,390
he should be learning a skill
or two as back up.

454
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,550
Forget it.

455
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,070
Your dad hopes that your younger brother
gets in university

456

You could treat me then.

Senior, you haven't eaten a lot.

480
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,270
You should be hungry, huh?

Especially you, a ballerina.

485
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,590
You need to maintain your figure.

486
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,390
So, you should be careful of what you eat.

I wanted to take a look-see around Xi Hai

00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,670
It's a lie.

511
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,510
See? Nothing!

512
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,700
It's real!

513
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,990
Haven't you heard of this fairy tale?

514
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:41,110
Hades and Menthe fell in love,

515
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,830
but, they were forced to be apart.

516
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,230
Menthe's tears fell into the sea,

517
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,670
forming blue tears.

518
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:49,830
Fairy tales like this are for
wheedling little girls.

519
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,590
How could you, a boy believe it?

520
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,870
And,

521
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,150
aren't blue tears
the fireflies in the ocean?

522
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,070
How does it represent Xi Hai?

523
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,750
Tong Xi, do you believe in miracles?

524
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,550
Senior,

525
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,870
do you believe in miracles?

526
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,870
[Blue tears]

527
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,790
[is actually a type of sea sparkle.]

528
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,390
[It lives in the ocean,]

529
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,070
[swayed by the waves.]

530
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,310
[What did Senior say?]

531
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,150
[Did he agree?]

532
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,380
Yes.

533
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,020
I plan to bring Senior
to Five Rainbow Beach.

534
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,030
There should be the most beautiful place

535
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,100
to see the blue tears.

536
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,030
[Yeah.]

537
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,150
But, I heard that the blue tears

538
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,710
hadn't appeared in a few years now.

539
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,700
The news said that
there won't be any too this year.

540
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,990
So, no one's gone there.

541
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,950
What if it doesn't appear?

542
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,550
Wouldn't that be awkward, Tong Xi?

543
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,470
That's why I said to
wait for a miracle.

544
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,820
I want Senior to see

545
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,230
a different Xi Hai.

546
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,390
A Xi Hai that's most beautiful.

547
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:56,750
Well, the Heavens

548
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,150
might be touched by my sincerity

549
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:58,870
and grant my wish.

550
00:24:59,070 --> 00:24:59,830
[Make sense.]

551
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,430
If it really appears,

552
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,390
then, at the romantic sight
of the blue tears,

553
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,310
you and Senior cozying up to each other,

554
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,670
hugging each other so tightly...

555
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,110
[Stop!]

556
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,670
[You read too many young-love comics.]

557
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,710
[Senior and I are not like that.]

558
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,030
We don't stick to each other
and do the mushy things.

559
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:18,670
Moreover, he...

560
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,470
[What about him?]

561
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,190
I don't know how to put it.

562
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,990
I just feel that

563
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,830
he's not the same as I imagined him to be.

564
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,310
Why?

565
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,110
Perhaps,

566
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,710
this is my first time

567
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,060
interacting with him up-close.

568
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,070
I realised

569
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,870
I don't know him as well as
I thought I did.

570
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,670
[He doesn't appear to be]

571
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,950
[exactly like how I imagined him.]

572
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,030
Why does it sound like

573
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,670
you're not pursuing him anymore?

574
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,790
No, no way!

575
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,510
I still adore him.

576
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:52,110
Forget it.

577
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,750
Maybe my mind is a little messed up

578
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,390
because I fainted this morning.

579
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,750
I'll just talk to Senior

580
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,950
when we go to see the blue tears

581
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,310
[tomorrow.]

582
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,100
You need to know someone

583
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,270
to really understand them.

584
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,740
But, the closer you get,

585
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,070
the more you expose your true colours.

586
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,830
Be careful not to blow
your perfect goddess cover.

587
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,190
[But, Tong Xi, have you seen]

588
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,430
the latest updated content on Mint?

589
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,590
Besides Qiu Ke,

590
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,790
the female lead
met a long-time friend as well.

591
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,350
How handsome,

592
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,270
my gosh!

593
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,630
Although the story between these two

594
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,110
has just started,

595
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,630
I'm already smelling

596
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,270
the scent of sweet suffering.

597
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,150
Hurry, go see.

598
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,110
On it!

599
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,990
[Quick, quick. Let's read together.]

600
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:46,010
[Qing He: Thanks for your support,
I look forward to our next conversation.]

601
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,470
Tao Zi,

602
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,420
can you believe it?

603
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,270
Guru Qing He sent me a message!

604
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,030
[It's obvious.]

605
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,430
[You wouldn't have challenged that Wei Ze]

606
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,510
[if it wasn't for Tong Xi.]

607
00:26:58,910 --> 00:26:59,710
[And, you had to win it.]

608
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:00,780
[Someone]

609
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,910
[is jealous.]

610
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:03,710
No way.

611
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,870
Jealous?

612
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,670
Impossible.

613
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,150
He's just a show-off Senior.

614
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,630
What's to be jealous of?

615
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,750
[Guru,]

616
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,870
[my gosh, I can't believe it!]

617
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,790
You DM-ed me!

618
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:28,350
Sorry, I was busy before this.

619
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,830
I didn't manage to go through the posts.

620
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,670
I hope to interact with
you more regularly, Guru,

621
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,190
to improve together.

622
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,230
Yeah?

623
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,030
Mint's updated. Did you see?

624
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:47,630
Do you like it?

625
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:51,670
My gosh,

626
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,230
how am I so lucky today?

627
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,870
Guru replied me in a split second!

628
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,830
I just finished reading it. I loved it!

629
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,550
And, the female lead...

630
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:09,110
And, the updated content

631
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,470
is so familiar to my school life.

632
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,430
I can feel what the female lead

633
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,230
has felt and experienced.

634
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,430
It's awesome!

635
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:21,590
Yeah?

636
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,830
You mean there happened to be

637
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,500
such an adorable girl like you

638
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,910
who met a long-time friend

639
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,030
after meeting Qiu Ke?

640
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,710
My gosh, my gosh!

641
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,070
Guru is really chatting with me!

642
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:39,950
I need to ask more questions

643
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:42,150
to get the conversation going.

644
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,110
Yes.

645
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:48,110
That girl is super adorable,

646
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:51,430
and she's reunited with
a long-time friend.

647
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,310
She loves ballet too.

648
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,470
Well,

649
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,470
I might bring you lots of inspiration.

650
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:57,910
Do you mind

651
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,630
if I share more of my life
with you from now on?

652
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:06,950
Calling yourself "that girl".

653
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,790
Narcissistic.

654
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,630
Sure.

655
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,270
You may do so.

656
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,460
[Woohoo!]

657
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,070
Go on.

658
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,950
What did you say when

659
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:32,670
he asked you whether

660
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,310
that adorable girl met

661
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,150
an old friend like Qiu Ke?

662
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,270
I said that I didn't meet
some guy named Qiu Ke

663
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,830
but I did meet an old friend.

664
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,230
I also told him

665
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,150
I have a friend who goes
to dance class with me.

666
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,940
It's the person that I met
when I was little

667
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,190
and got reacquainted again.

668
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,460
Although there were misunderstandings
when we first met,

669
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,630
when we went through
some hardships together,

670
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,430
things became good gradually.

671
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,430
You're talking about Lin Nan Yi, huh?

672
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,630
Then, why are you being
difficult with him these days?

673
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,110
It's he who can't bear the sight of
Senior and I getting on well.

674
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,900
Well, who wouldn't want to
get on well with Senior?

675
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,540
I was inspired by you yesterday,

676
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,950
I also wanted to see the blue tears

677
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,030
with the guy I adore.

678
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,820
I know it might not happen.

679
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,430
But, if it does,

680
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,780
that's a miracle from the Heavens.

681
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,470
So,

682
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,790
I've also contacted Senior Xu Ao.

683
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,870
Did Xu Ao agree to it?

684
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,270
He hasn't replied.

685
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:42,710
[Sorry.]

686
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,230
[I need to make up
for the missed classes at night.]

687
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,230
What is it?

688
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,870
The day's wait was in vain. I'm rejected.

689
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,140
Forget it.

690
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:58,630
Senior's going to be in twelfth grade
the next semester.

691
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,470
He must be busy studying.

692
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,790
Then, he's got practise too,

693
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:03,940
then, tuition.

694
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,470
He won't have time

695
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,110
for these imaginary things.

696
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,950
It's just normal.

697
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,550
I envy you.

698
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,230
Besides getting Prince Charming
to initiate contact with you,

699
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,510
you also get to go to the beach
with Senior Wei Ze.

700
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:22,910
Just look at me.

701
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,300
But, don't worry,

702
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,630
I've greeted the Emperor of the Sea.

703
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,070
Blue tears will appear.

704
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,550
Just enjoy your night.

705
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:32,510
As for me,

706
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,470
I'll go out and get some air.

707
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,660
Tong Xi.

708
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,230
Who is Senior Wei Ze to you?

709
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,510
When I bumped into Senior yesterday,

710
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,550
he told me that

711
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,550
when you were in Da Cheng,

712
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,910
you enrolled into the art club.

713
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,420
He was the interviewer.

714
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:00,060
In that case, the both of you
are really fated to meet.

715
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,190
Yeah?

716
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,190
Tong Xi, I really think

717
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,950
you and Senior Wei Ze are a perfect match.

718
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,710
You're the White Swan,

719
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,830
he's the prince.

720
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:12,380
It would be a fairy tale-come-true
if the both of you get together.

721
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,430
I sincerely wish you all the best.

722
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,590
I hope you do your best.

723
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:19,710
Thank you.

724
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,350
Go! Tong Xi!

725
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,270
Hold it.

726
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,510
All dressed up. Where are you going?

727
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,750
I have some matters to sort out.

728
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,590
What matters can a student have?

729
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,510
Going out when you're done with homework?

730
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,750
Don't forget you need to practise ballet.

731
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,510
Mum, can't I practise when I'm back?

732
00:32:59,510 --> 00:32:59,910
I've...

733
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:00,350
No!

734
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,190
I'm meeting someone.

735
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,110
Who?

736
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,310
It's...

737
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,950
Keep mum and

738
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,110
you're not stepping out this door.

739
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:10,710
Dad.

740
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,430
I'm meeting Dad.

741
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,190
Since I don't have much homework,

742
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,910
I'm going to see Dad.

743
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,750
Seriously!

744
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,270
You dad's good for nothing

745
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,830
except delaying your time.

746
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,190
I raised you with my own hands

747
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,620
and you're cozying up to your dad.

748
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:32,700
I'm off, then.

749
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,390
Come back early!

750
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,270
Let me help you.

751
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:47,750
Thanks.

752
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:54,990
You slept through English class today.

753
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,390
I'm sure you didn't get much in, huh?

754
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,470
Today's lesson is extremely important.

755
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,110
It's the past participle tense of verbs.

756
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,630
Let me help you revise later.

757
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:05,470
It's okay.

758
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,750
Then, read through this.

759
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:09,190
I know you might find me annoying.

760
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,830
This is my notes,

761
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,150
it's complete.

762
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:31,219
Oh no,

763
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,790
did Senior loathe me being late

764
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:33,830
and left?

765
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,670
Hello, Senior?

766
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:41,469
Sorry, I left home late.

767
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:43,510
[Tong Xi, I'm sorry.
There's a change of plan.]

768
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,790
[I left for the bus stop.]
