2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,990
Forget about Tao Zhu.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,390
She's pompous, stupid,

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,220
moonstruck,

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,750
and low class.

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,790
I let her come back

7
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,390
because you were angry.

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,150
Did you ask her to come back
just to piss me off?

9
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:24,190
No.

10
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:26,470
To provoke you.

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,310
See? When you heard that she was back,

12
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,470
you hurried back also.

13
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,670
If you make me mad again,

14
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,750
I will leave,

15
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,790
and if you provoke me with Tao Zhu again,

16
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,230
I won't heed you.

17
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,430
I won't.

18
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,030
Although Tao Zhu worships me,

19
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,870
I can’t always use her as a tool.

20
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,950
Come on. You gave her a role.

21
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,190
She isn't just a tool.

22
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:50,910
Look.

23
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,430
I gave you all her lines.

24
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,670
I think you may have forgotten.

25
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,910
My name is Dorothy. 
I'm going back to the Emerald City.

26
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,510
Besides, our show

27
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,750
is quite boring.

28
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,510
As the Tin Man,

29
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,830
if she can pretend to be crazy
and stupid,

30
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,150
that can be a feature

31
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,789
of our version of The Wizard of Oz.

32
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,310
Many candidates were recommended 
to me lately.

33
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,470
I don't trust them.

34
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,550
People adore you.

35
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:21,830
So do I.

36
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,550
I only trust you.

37
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,510
Xu Ao, you've gone too far.

38
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,270
Let's take a look.

39
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,110
All this time,

40
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,270
I admired and respected you
as my senior.

41
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,310
I ran errands

42
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,630
and swept floors for you.

43
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,670
How could you do this to me?

44
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,229
Tao Zi, what happened?

45
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,550
It's like this.

46
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,590
Just now our president gave me
instructions

47
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,030
about the performance.

48
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:57,070
We mentioned Tao Zi in passing,

49
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,070
and she misunderstood us.

50
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:00,830
Misunderstood?

51
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,550
Senior, is it a misunderstanding?

52
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,230
You said I'm pompous and stupid.

53
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,470
I was fooled into acting

54
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,669
as a stand in for a stooge.

55
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,110
They're the details of the show.

56
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,070
You asked me to come back 
after quarrelling

57
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,550
with Xiao Qing and you used me

58
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,870
to provoke her.

59
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,350
Now you have reconciled.

60
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:18,790
I'm no longer needed.

61
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,910
Senior, you make the best use of people.

62
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,910
I don't know about others,

63
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,110
but Tao Zi

64
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,430
worked hard for the rehearsal 
and the show.

65
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,950
You played around behind her.

66
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,190
Aren't you ashamed?

67
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,829
We said

68
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,070
this is a misunderstanding.

69
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,030
Don't go on the offensive.

70
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,340
You manipulated a girl.

71
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,430
Are you a man?

72
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,390
Enough, Xu Ao.

73
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,990
I am nice,

74
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,270
but it doesn't mean

75
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,430
you can bully me.

76
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,310
I can act as a stooge,

77
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:49,390
but it doesn’t mean I'm a joke

78
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,510
to be laughed at.

79
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,750
I've

80
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,430
been contributing to the show.

81
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,750
I don't deserve such comments.

82
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,510
From today onwards,

83
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,150
I quit the drama club.

84
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,110
Tao Zi!

85
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,630
Tao Zi!

86
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:17,670
Tao Zhu!

87
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,430
You're still in your costume.

88
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,829
Tao Zi, it's not worth getting mad

89
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:23,390
at people like him.

90
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,110
What happened?

91
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,910
Hey,

92
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,590
I ran an entire street to get water.

93
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,590
Are there 12 people in your drama club?

94
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,630
I bought two more. Just in case.

95
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,540
What drinking water? What water?

96
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,910
He doesn't deserve to drink it.

97
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,829
He doesn't!

98
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,310
I am a girl too.

99
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,750
I also have self-esteem.

100
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,070
Why does he treat me like a fool?

101
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,829
What happened?

102
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,180
I...

103
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,150
Tong Xi,

104
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,870

It's selected too.

Won't it be one actor short?

I wasn't important.

118
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,710
I only had a few lines.

I asked him to apologise to you.

134
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,230
He was too impulsive just now.

135
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,230
Sorry.

136
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,830

Okay.

I shouldn't hit you.

Only an apology?

141

00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,710
not to quarrel.

147
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,630
I want to quarrel.

148

what will happen to us.

150
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,500
Do you know how much the club

151
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,630
suffers because of you?

152
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,550
I only have ten lines

153
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,070
totalling less than 300 words.

154
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,110
Moreover,

155
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,150
I quit because you insulted me.

156
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:46,830
I...

157
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,340
I insulted you?

158
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,630
Don't slander me!

159
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,670
Since I joined the club,

160
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,630
you've used my acting future as an excuse

161
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,790
to make me do dirty and tiring work.

162
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,590
Because I'm a junior,

163
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,590
I accepted that and did as told.

164
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,830
But without letting me know first,

165
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,990
you gave me a stooge's role.

166
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,900
As the president, you laughed at me.

167

168
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,070
moonstruck, stupid,

169
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,030
and other adjectives to humiliate me.

170
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:31,870
Didn't you?

171
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:39,870
I didn't.

172
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,630
Prove it.

173
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,870

00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,190
Sit inside quickly.

347
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,030
Hello, student.

348
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,870
May I sit here?

349
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,030
These seats are for Xi Hai High School.

350
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,790
May I know if you're a parent?

351
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,990
Yes, Xi Hai High School.

352
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,590
My daughter is performing.

353
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,390
Who is your daughter?

354
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,830
Tong Xi from Class 4.

355
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,470
She is dancing solo today.

356
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,910
Do you know her?

357
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,150
Yes. I'm her class monitor.

358
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,300
Sit here please.

359
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,150
Thank you.

360
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,470
Monitor,

361
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,670
when you see her,

362
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,750
please tell her

363
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,670
I'm here.

364
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,869
She should be doing makeup backstage now.

365
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,510
I'll tell her.

366
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:19,980
Thank you so much.

367
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,750
Tong Xi, you probably haven't eaten yet.

368
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,030
Meals for performers 
were distributed outside.

369
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,830
I took porridge for you.

370
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,590
Thank you. I'm not hungry.

371
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,700
I don't want to eat.

372
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,670
There is still some time before the show.

373
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,710
Eat some.

374
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,230
Otherwise, you'll be hungry.

375
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,070
Have some.

376
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,910
No, thank you.

377
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,830
Have some.

378
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,630
I'm not hungry.

379
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,030
Eat some.

380
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,350
I...

381
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,270
I'm sorry, Tong Xi.

382
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,990
I didn't mean it.

383
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,060
Let me take care of it.

384
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,870
No need. Please leave.

385
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,630
Sorry, are you angry with me?

386
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,550
I really didn't mean it.

387
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,750
I didn't hold it steadily.

388
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,750
Please leave. I'll take care of it.

389
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:27,630
Sorry.

390
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,070
Lin, Tong Xi is next.

391
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,670
A dance is the most beautiful 
form of physical expression

392
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,470
in the world,

393
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,710
and ballet is the most elegant

394
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,470
dance.

395
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,510
Here's Tong Xi from Xi Hai High School

396
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,270
performing a ballet solo, La Bayadere.

397
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,750
-Tong Xi, Tong Xi!
-Best in the world!

398
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,710
-Tong Xi, Tong Xi!
-Best in the world!

399
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:26,870
Tong Xi! Tong Xi! Tong Xi!

400
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,030
[If I improve my performance,]

401
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,830
[will my mother be happier?]

402
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,750
[Definitely.]

403
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,510
[I can’t wear new shoes for dancing.]

404
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:41,870
[They are very hard]

405
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,790
[and have to be broken in.]

406
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,950
[Why did you wear the new shoes 
I gave you?]

407
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,110
[When I was getting ready backstage,]

408
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,030
[something happened.]

409
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,590
[She's so nervous.]

410
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,310
[This is the first time I formally]

411
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,790
[dance in front of an audience.]

412
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,430
[My mum is in the audience.]

413
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,830
[Although I don't know how to dance,]

414
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,780
[I think]

415
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,310
[it is the same as painting.]

416
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,270
[You mentally visualise the details. 
Every stroke is hard.]

417
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,230
[But if you are in sync,]

418
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,070
[it'll come to you naturally.]

419
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,750
[It turns out that on my birthday,]

420
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,630
[she prepared this birthday gift for me.]

421
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,430
[I misunderstood her.]

422
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,830
[Looks like your mother
still cares about you.]

423
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,190
[It has been her dream 
to perform on stage.]

424
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:44,990
[So, I tried my best to stand
on that stage.]

425
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:50,100
[Tong Xi, can you do it?]

426
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,990
[Yes, I can.]

427
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,470
Tong Xi, are you okay?

428
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,070
I'm fine.

429
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,190
My toes hurt.

430
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,630
What are you doing?

431
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,430
To infirmary, for you to change clothes.

432
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,750
Let me down.

433
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,630
I can walk there.

434
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,750
Shut up. You're heavy.

435
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:33,980
Wait.

436
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,830
Did you see my parents?

437
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:36,590
No.

438
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,350
First, to the infirmary.

439
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:10,950
Why don't we take a taxi?

440
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,670
This is like making an idol drama.

441
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,350
By the way, what happened to 
your ballet shoes?

442
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,190
Before the show,

443
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,430
Ni Xiao Wan brought me
a bowl of porridge

444
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,790
and asked if I wanted it.

445
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,670
I refused

446
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,430
and the porridge spilled on my shoes.

447
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,350
Such a coincidence.

448
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:33,990
But

449
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,590
fortunately, I have the new shoes
you gave me.

450
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,230
Otherwise, I won't be performing.

451
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,590
Ni Xiao Wan.

452
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,740
When I first met her,

453
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,270
she wasn't like this.

454
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,110
People change.

455
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,630
Didn't I change too?

456
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,830
Never mind. The dance is over.

457
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,910
Forget it.

458
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,470
Luckily,

459
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,790
the most important thing

460
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,270
wasn't lost.

461
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:07,990
Tong Xi,

462
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,750
actually, I have

463
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,670
always...

464
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:16,950
Always what?

465
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,590
Nothing. Phone ringing!

466
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,270
Get it for me.

467
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,350
My dad?

468
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:29,600
[Outpatient Department]

469
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:27,750
What's with the foot?

470
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:32,230
When I was doing the last move,

471
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,710
I sprained my ankle.

472
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,270
Sprained?

473
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,990
You can't even complete a simple movement.

474
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,590
But it did not affect the final outcome.

475
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,790
The dance was successful.

476
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,350
Why were you so careless?

477
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,910
The moves in La Bayadere are easy.

478
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,420
Why did you sprain your ankle?

479
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,670
Recovery takes 100 days.

480
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,470
Meanwhile, you can't dance.

481
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,950
If this keeps happening,

482
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,110
how will you dance ballet?

483
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,070
Do you want to be like me?

484
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,750
Was I wrong?

485
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,070
I haven't criticised you yet,

486
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,190
and you're already upset.

487
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,510
I'm thinking about your future,

488
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,270
Tong Xi.

489
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,190
I'm doing it for your own good.

490
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,430
What happened?

491
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,110
Tong Tong.

492
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,670
Don't stare at me. Ask your daughter.

493
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,830
She is 16 going to 17.

494
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,510
She has no plan for herself.

495
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,630
She acts impulsively.

496
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,750
She can't do anything well.

497
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,270
How can you say that to a kid?

498
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,830
What did I say?

499
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,710
I alone brought her up.

500
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,790
Can't I criticise her?

501
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,630
Should I spoil her like you?

502
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,670
Should I

503
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,630
let her be,

504
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,750
and be a failure like me,

505
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,220
or become useless like you?

506
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,990
Do you know that

507
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,350
when I received your birthday present,

508
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,150
I was really happy?

509
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,070
I thought

510
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,470
you are strict,

511
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,790
but you care about me in your heart.

512
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,710
I know now

513
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,710
that you aren't worried about me at all.

514
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,550
Since I entered the room,

515
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,470
you haven't asked me if my feet hurt

516
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,710
or if I am tired.

517
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,950
You only care about ballet.

518
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,430
You care about whether I'll dance
on the stage

519
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,550
and fulfil your dream.

520
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,990
For the whole day, I was worried

521
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,430
that I'd let you down
with my poor performance.

522
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,510
Now, I know that

523
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,790
no matter how hard I try,

524
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,470
you're never satisfied.

525
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,390
Because you never

526
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,870
treat me as your daughter.

527
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,470
In this case,

528
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,390
I don't want your love.

529
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,750
Okay?

530
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,150
Tong Tong!

531
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,310
Tong Xi!

532
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,100
Go after her.

533
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,390
Stop, Tong Xi!

534
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,230
Okay, Xiao Hui.

535
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,230
Tong Xi! Tong Xi!

536
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,820
Doctor! Doctor!

537
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,550
Hello. What's up, Uncle?

538
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,150
Don't...

539
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,630
Don't worry. Don't worry.

540
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,830
I'll go right now.

541
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:00,950
Uncle.

542
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,830
Okay.

543
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,190
Hello, Tao Zi.

544
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,790
Did Tong Xi call you?

545
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:26,790
Nothing.

546
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,390
If she contacts you,

547
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,510
please call me.

548
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:56,670
Lin Nan Yi.

549
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:03,670
Lin Nan Yi, are you in?

550
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,110
Where else can I go?

551
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,830
Xiao Hui will love this.
