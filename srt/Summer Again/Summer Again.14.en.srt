Eating, shopping and
drinking milk tea, of course.

Before the start of the next semester,

50
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,630
I'll borrow Lin's homework
to check my answers.

How can you call it copying?

55
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,220
I just need them as reference.

56
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,950
For others, it's called being lazy.

57
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,470
For me, it's called self-improvement.

58
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,950
First of all,

59
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,020
taking reference of other's
homework adequately

60
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,390
can save me a lot of unnecessary energy,

61
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,300
and provide me
more time to do greater things.

62
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,470
Second,

63
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,820
I can learn directly from other
people's learning experience,

64

use the strength to make up for weakness.

65
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,900
I can also improve
my ability to read and write,

66
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,430
improve my writing speed

67

Most importantly,

69
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,750
it can improve the relationship 
between friends.

00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,710
I'm going to beat you.

171
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,670
What time is it?

172
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,950
What time is it?

173
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,430
Do you see it clearly now?

174
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,550
You overslept every day
since the summer break started.

175
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,470
I don't know what you're doing at night.

176
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,870
All right, I'm up.

177
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,270
Hurry up.

178
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,510
Get ready in ten minutes.

179
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,580
Start your morning warm-up.

180
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,429
Report to Mr. Xu at 9 a.m. sharp.

181
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,220
Did you hear me?

182
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:35,710
I got it.

183
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,870
One, two, three, four.

184
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,910
Five, six, seven, eight.

185
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,020
Not good enough.

186
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,750
Five, six, seven, eight.

187
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,950
One, two, three, four.

188
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,780
[Here's my betrothal gift.]

189
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,710
[This is a promise.]

190
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,830
Let's use this mint leaf
as betrothal gift.

191
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,430
[Now we can preserve it forever.]

192
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,470
This mint leaf

193
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,830
can be preserved forever.

194
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,350
Lin Nan Yi,

195
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,070
this mint leaf will never wither.

196
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,710
We can use this as
betrothal gift, right?

197
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,110
Hello, are you busy?

198
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,950
Remember the story of the mint necklace

199
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,070
I told you last time?

200
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,510
I've finished the comics.

201
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,430
Do you have time to come
and see it at Blue Elephant?

202
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,190
I may not be able to go lately.

203
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,590
My schedule for ballet training is tight.

204
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,550
And I keep dancing poorly.

205
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,150
My teacher is back, talk next time.

206
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,270
Madam, don't worry.

207
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,270
Leave it to me.

208
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,470
Goodbye, Madam.

209
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,630
Nan Yi,

210
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,590
why are you here so early today?

211
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,990
Have you cleaned the poop yet?

212
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,670
Haven't.

213
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,070
Morning, Monroe.

214
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,790
Do you miss Mummy?

215
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,070
Sister Mi Ya,

216
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,460
who was that outside just now?

217
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,780
Who else could it be?

218
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,350
It was your mum, of course.

219
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,070
Those stuff on the table

220
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,190
are for you.

221
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,790
There is money and food she
made for you early in the morning.

222
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,910
It's been so long since
the summer break started.

223
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,790
Your parents really missed you.

224
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,350
Are you really not going home?

225
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,790
I get it.

226
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,870
But it's been so long.

227
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,830
You still haven't been able to

228
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,270
get over it?

229
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,230
Although they're just your foster parents,

230
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,270
they keep sending money
and food every month.

231
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,870
I can see that

232
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,390
they really love you.

233
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,230
I know.

234
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,390
Is your

235
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,710
biological mother

236
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,670
still giving you money every month?

237
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,030
She never stops.

238
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,670
I always get a text message
for that bank account,

239
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,470
but I never use that bank card.

240
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,150
-But...
-By the way, Sister Mi Ya,

241
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,180
didn't you say that Andre was visiting
the country in the first half of the year?

242
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,190
It's July now.

243
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:38,940
Is he still coming?

244
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,070
He is.

245
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,520
If he couldn't make it in
the first half of the year,

246
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,490
he'll come in the second half.

247
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,150
I mean,

248
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,870
he's so busy every day.

249
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,180
He's going to overexert himself one day.

250
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,990
Morocco today, Mexico tomorrow,

251
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,590
and Spain after that.

252
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,990
Why do I get thirstier as I eat this?

253
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,100
Where is Tong Xi? Why is she not with you?

254
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,710
Forget about it.

255
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,670
She is even busier than
when she was in school

256
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,910
since summer break started.

257
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,230
Her mum arranged numerous 
ballet classes for her.

258
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,310
I haven't seen her for days.

259
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,750
We haven't been apart this long

260
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,030
since she returned to Xi Hai.

261
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,790
Then what have you been
doing during the holiday?

262
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,950
Aren't you in the drama club?

263
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,830
The club has many activities
during the holiday, right?

264
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,230
I haven't been to the
drama club for a long time.

265
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,110
Speaking of which, Jie Ping,

266
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,670
do you have plan during the summer break?

267
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,910
If you don't have any plan,

268
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,430
let's go learn beach volleyball together.

269
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,270
Sure.

270
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,550
What do you want to
talk to me about, Senior?

271
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,590
Actually, after I ran into you
at the night market last time,

272
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,590
I've been thinking about contacting you.

273
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:01,900
How should I say this...

274
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,990
My friend is still waiting for me.

275
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,110
So there is really something going on

276
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,150
with Tao Zi and Senior.

277
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,270
I'll make it quick.

278
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,590
The annual Culture and Arts Festival

279
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,310
will be held in next month

280
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,070
in Xi Hai Town.

281
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,070
It's considered

282
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,270
as the highest standard of arts festival.

283
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,870
We're going to perform
Wizard of Oz this year,

284
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,950
which is the play you auditioned for.

285
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,470
The Wizard of Oz.

286
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,550
Are you saying that
you have a role for me?

287
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,230
No.

288
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:34,790
I knew it.

289
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,190
We've almost done rehearsing for the show,

290
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,510
but we can't keep up
with the backstage work.

291
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,270
I've been looking for someone to
take charge of the backstage work.

292
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:44,990
After thinking about it,

293
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,430
I believe you're the suitable candidate.

294
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,590
Suitable for what?

295
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,030
Suitable for sweeping the floor, Senior?

296
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,310
I'm really not interested in it.

297
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:53,110
Look for someone else.

298
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,310
No, no, not floor sweeping.

299
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,790
You can be considered as
a backstage coordinator.

300
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,780
You will be in charge for all
the work beside the performance.

301
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,030
I've been

302
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,790
getting a lot of recommendations lately,

303
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,030
but I don't trust them.

304
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,350
You're not like them.

305
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,830
You are practical, attentive,

306
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,510
and kind.

307
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,710
Everyone likes you,

308
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:14,910
including me.

309
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,470
You're the only one I trust.

310
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,990
That's what happened.

311
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,550
What do you think I should do?

312
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,870
[That depends on what's on your mind.]

313
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,030
What could be on my mind?

314
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,670
I can't think of anything right now.

315
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,070
I'm confused. My brain is like glue.

316
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,470
Tao Zi,

317
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,070
regardless of whether you're
returning to the drama club,

318
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,670
don't you think it's strange that

319
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,070
Xu Ao is looking for you this time?

320
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,630
[It's a bit strange indeed.]

321
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,460
After all, when I told him

322
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,550
I wanted to quit the drama club,

323
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,470
he just agreed indifferently.

324
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,230
He didn't even ask me to stay.

325
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,380
And he said that he trust me now.

326
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,950
So,

327
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,070
he came looking for you this time

328
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,230
must be because

329
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,990
you are useful to him.

330
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,590
[It's not because he has grown
a conscience or something like that.]

331
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,950
[After all,
according to your description,]

332
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,510
he doesn't seem to be the kind of
person who would reflect himself.

333
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,660
But people change.

334
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,350
Maybe it's because after I left this time,

335
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,150
he finally realized how good I was.

336
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,550
If he really saw your good,

337
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,310
he wouldn't ask you
back to sweep the floor.

338
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,070
No, not floor sweeping.

339
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,910
He's asking me back to be in
charge for the backstage work.

340
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,870
It's a position like

341
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,830
the head of the backstage team.

342
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,430
[Not just doing the cleaning work.]

343
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,750
[I'll need to manage a lot of things.]

344
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,670
And when he told me that,

345
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,790
I did look at his eyes carefully.

346
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,380
He was sincere.

347
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,830
He didn't look like he was lying.

348
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,020
So, I think

349
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,350
he probably really
needs my help this time.

350
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,870
He also wants to give me a chance

351
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,470
to participate in a big event.

352
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,190
After all, not everyone can participate

353
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,230
in the Xi Hai Arts Festival,

354
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:09,790
am I right?

355
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,270
Hello?

356
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:13,950
Tong Xi?

357
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,830
[You're asleep?]

358
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,870
Looks like you're really tired.

359
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,150
Good night, Tong Xi.

360
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,430
[Tong Xi's birthday is coming up.]

361
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,590
[Did she tell you how
she wants to celebrate it?]

362
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,750
Today is July 5.

363
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,790
That means her birthday
is the day after tomorrow.

364
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,590
July 7 is Tong Xi's birthday.

365
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,270
My mind has been occupied 
by Senior Xu Ao.

366
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,670
I almost forgot such an important thing.

367
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,310
What should I get her?

368
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,270
Let's call it a day.

369
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,190
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

370
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,150
I'm going home now.

371
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:34,990
Tong Xi.

372
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,830
You are not in good shape these two days.

373
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,110
Go home and work on it.

374
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:45,550
One more thing.

375
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,350
Have you chosen the
dance for the arts festival?

376
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,190
Arts festival?

377
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,270
You don't know?

378
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,670
Xi Hai Arts Festival

379
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,630
is going to be held next month.

380
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,190
Your mum said you are participating.

381
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,150
She has registered your name.

382
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,470
She has talked to me

383
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,910
and asked me to adapt
La Bayadere for you.

384
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,820
We'll start practising it next class.

385
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:01,790
Also,

386
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,270
if you're going to perform in this state,

387
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,830
frankly speaking,

388
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,350
it's not very satisfying.

389
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,030
But she didn't tell me anything about it.

390
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,190
Mr. Xu,

391
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,550
I don't want to participate in the event.

392
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,110
My mum didn't even ask me if I want to go.

393
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,190
Go home and talk to her about it.

394
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,430
Tell me what is going on with you.

395
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,670
Probably because

396
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,350
I've been having poor digestion recently.

397
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,350
I haven't been able to poop,

398
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,220
that's why...

399
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,790
Poor digestion?

400
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,910
I think you've been digesting too well.

401
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,070
How many times have I told you?

402
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,150
Keeping in shape is very important

403
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,070
for ballerinas.

404
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,980
You're preparing for your art exam now.

405
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,910
You should hold yourself

406
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,510
to the standards of

407
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,790
a professional ballerina.

408
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,630
You gained three catties in a week's time.

409
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,870
When you join a ballet company
in the future,

410
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,950
no male dancer will
be able to carry you up.

411
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,670
Why are you still standing there? 
Come here and eat.

412
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,390
Time flies.

413
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,390
Tong Tong's birthday is tomorrow.

414
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,390
She's another year older.

415
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,910
She's a big girl now.

416
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,070
Nan Yi, you really did it.

417
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,150
You managed

418
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,710
to make a cake with rice cooker.

419
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,860
I learnt it myself online.

420
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:49,790
I didn't think

421
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:50,750
it would work.

422
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,190
Very handy.

423
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,710
You got the hang of things easily.

424
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,790
For a boy like you

425
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,030
who is so brilliant,

426
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,150
I wonder which girl

427
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,270
is going to marry you in future.

428
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,550
Someone has already
given me the betrothal gift.

429
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,980
Cut back on the carb,

430
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,790
consume more protein.

431
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,270
Foods with high sugar content,

432
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,510
like cake or milk tea,

433
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,630
you mustn't touch them.

434
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,310
You hear me?

435
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:23,590
Mum.

436
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,670
I know all the things you said.

437
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,310
I'll control my weight.

438
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,630
But...

439
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,270
But what?

440
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,710
I've been practising for many days.

441
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,070
Can I take a day off?

442
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,820
I want to take a break.

443
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,470
No way.

444
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,270
But I'm exhausted.

445
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,390
My calves are swollen.

446
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:42,990
I just want to...

447
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,830
Don't think I don't know
what's on your mind.

448
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,790
You just want to go out and
have fun because your birthday

449
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,750
is coming up, don't you?

450
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,630
When you get into the dance academy,

451
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,430
you can have fun anytime you want.

452
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,150
Besides,

453
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,710
your birthday is
your mother's suffering day.

454
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,430
All the more reason
for you to dance well.

455
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,430
Don't let me down.

456
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,430
Bend forward, bend forward.

457
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,910
Place your legs back.

458
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,830
[You gained
three catties in a week's time.]

459
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:05,950
[When you join a ballet company
in the future,]

460
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,750
[no male dancer will
be able to carry you up.]

461
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:08,830
Xi Hai Arts Festival

462
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,830
is going to be held next month.

463
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,510
Your mum said you are participating.

464
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,430
She has registered your name.

465
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,470
But she didn't tell
me anything about it.

466
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,230
You don't know?

467
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,390
[She has registered your name.]

468
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,470
Is the purpose of my life

469
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,630
to not let you down?

470
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,030
Why are you talking to me like this?

471
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,590
Who am I doing this for?

472
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,590
Is it just for me?

473
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,070
If you don't practise well now,

474
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,070
when you fail the art exam,

475
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,430
you won't even have a place to cry.

476
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,910
If I want to cry,
there is a place I can go to.

477
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,590
You...

478
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,630
Looking at you being so happy,

479
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,180
it reminds me of Tong Tong.

480
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,270
She's been practising a lot lately.

481
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,230
She hasn't visited me for a long time.

482
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,750
We didn't get to talk much

483
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,190
on the phone every day.

484
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,550
She's so exhausted that
she fell asleep every time.

485
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:02,540
Why did Aunt let Tong Xi dance ballet?

486
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,620
That was her dream.

487
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,700
She was a ballerina when she was young.

488
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,710
She wanted to join a ballet company,

489
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,150
and she was accepted afterward.

490
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,830
But she got into an accident 
and injured her leg.

491
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,150
She couldn't dance anymore.

492
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,700
She was unwilling to accept it,

493
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,270
so she tried everything she could

494
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,190
to set Tong Tong on the path of ballet.

495
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,270
She wanted Tong Tong to fulfil her dream.

496
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,350
But Aunt's dream

497
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,470
isn't Tong Xi's dream, right?

498
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:35,830
Yes.

499
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,310
I remember when we were little,

500
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,750
Tong Xi seemed scared
every time she brought up dancing.

501
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,270
Aunt always scolded her a long time

502
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,030
because of dancing.

503
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,110
Yes.

504
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,470
Her mother has been too hard on her,

505
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,910
especially when it comes to ballet.

506
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,510
When she and her mum were in Da Cheng,

507
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,980
there's nothing I could do
because I couldn't see them.

508
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,390
Now that they're back in Xi Hai,

509
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,470
I still couldn't see them.

510
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,190
While other kids are
enjoying their summer break,

511
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,790
Tong Tong is spending
her summer break doing...

512
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:13,790
Mum,

513
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,430
maybe I should skip

514
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,830
the arts festival in town.

515
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,350
I've been too tired lately.

516
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,230
Mum,

517
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,710
I don't want to go to

518
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,550
the arts festival in town.

519
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,670
How could you register
my name behind my back?

520
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,030
Can you respect my choice?

521
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:28,950
Mum,

522
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,070
can I skip

523
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,630
the arts festival?

524
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,350
I think

525
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,270
my basic skills aren't solid,

526
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,670
maybe I shouldn't go out
there and embarrass myself.

527
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,150
How should I say it?

528
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,270
Hello. What do you want?

529
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,790
If you have anything to say, 
say it now, or I'll hang up.

530
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,550
Can't I just call you for nothing?

531
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,230
[A friendly reminder.]

532
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,140
I'm in a bad mood now.

533
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,830
If it's not urgent, don't call me again.

534
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,430
Or I might take it out on you.

535
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,430
If

536
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,190
you put it like that,

537
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,380
I do have something to say.

538
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,550
[What is it?]

539
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,110
You have no practise tomorrow, right?

540
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:15,870
I'll pick you up at your house.

541
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,670
And I'll take you to a place.

542
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,110
Tomorrow, I...

543
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,030
Hello?

544
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,390
Lin Nan Yi!

545
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,350
What's wrong with him?

546
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:32,750
See you tomorrow.

547
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:37,710
That's right.

548
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,350
I'll just skip the practise tomorrow.

549
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:45,150
Showing my attitude by skipping class

550
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,550
is more effective than saying it out.

551
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,390
Lin Nan Yi,

552
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,910
where are we going?

553
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,430
I can't hear you!

554
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:16,750
I said

555
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,830
where are we going?

556
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,630
This is a secret!

557
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,150
What secret?

558
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,590
You'll know when we get there.

559
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,470
Lin Nan Yi, slower.

560
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,350
There is such place in Xi Hai.

561
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,580
How come I didn't know it before?

562
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,990
I just found it when I passed by
during the summer break.

563
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,510
I've been wanting to visit it.

564
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,390
So, I thought I could come with you.

565
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,620
Tong Xi, I missed you so much!

566
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,630
I missed you a lot too.

567
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,430
What's going on with you?

568
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,350
What's the occasion?
Why are you wearing so formal?

569
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:43,750
Let me see.

570
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,710
Have you lost weight?

571
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,390
There's no way she would lose weight.

572
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,270
Not in this life.

573
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,190
If you don't know how to talk nicely,

574
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,430
just shut up and let others talk.

575
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,990
All right, let's go in.

576
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,110
Hold on.

577
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,670
All right, let's go.

578
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:58,860
Come on, let's go.

579
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,510
Let's go.

580
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,100
Don't make such disgusting noises.

581
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,550
What took you so long? I'm so thirsty.

582
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,910
Thanks, Lin.

583
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:25,780
You pay more attention
to a woman than friends.

584
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,270
You forget royalty to your
friends when you see pretty girls.

585
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,390
It's lover and loyalty.

586
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,790
You're hopeless.

587
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,230
By the way, Tong Xi,

588
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,510
you don't have dance practice today?

589
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,190
No.

590
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,430
That's great.

591
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,590
I was worried that your mum

592
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,950
would call you back for your
practice when we were having fun.

593
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,190
When you told me how
scary your mum was before,

594
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,350
I didn't believe you.

595
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,310
Turned out that

596
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,670
I was too naive.

597
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,590
Did you tell your mum

598
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,030
you came out to have fun today?

599
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,540
Hello, Senior.

600
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,110
Is Tong Xi not feeling well today?

601
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,150
I couldn't reach her by the phone
and she didn't come to class.

602
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,790
You skipped class to come out?

603
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,470
Over the past few days,

604
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,710
I got up at 7 a.m. every morning 
for my warm-up practice.

605
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,230
I went to bed at 10 p.m.

606
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,670
I've been dancing while I wasn't sleeping.

607
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,590
I had thought that

608
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,390
as long as I behaved myself,

609
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,950
my mum would at least give me a day off.

610
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,390
I didn't expect that she...

611
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,950
Did you talk to Aunt?

612
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,100
Tell her about what
you're really thinking.

613
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,670
Let her understand you more.

614
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,270
You know what kind of person my mum is.

615
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,430
No one can change what she has decided.

616
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,870
How can I make her understand me?

617
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:44,870
And I know that

618
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,390
it hasn't been easy for her

619
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,990
to take care of me
all by herself these years.

620
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,430
That's why I tried to be
as obedient as I could.

621
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,310
But it seems that

622
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,830
no matter how hard I try,

623
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,870
there is no way to satisfy her.

624
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,990
I think the surrounding here

625
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,110
is suitable for us to play a game.

626
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,150
What game?

627
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,150
Cat and mouse.

628
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:12,750
What game is that?

629
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,350
It's hide and seek.

630
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,580
I want to be a mouse this time.

631
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,750
I don't want to be a cat to catch people.

632
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,470
Seriously, Lin.

633
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,390
We're half adult now.

634
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,670
Okay, I'll play it.

635
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,990
Although we are half adults,

636
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,990
we are still half children too.

637
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:28,750
So,

638
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,150
we'll be mice.

639
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,520
You two catch us.

640
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:32,870
You guys...

641
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,470
They sure ran fast.

642
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,150
They didn't respect
the rules of the game at all.

643
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,350
We can't be like him.

644
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:43,670
Let's close our eyes.

645
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:45,470
Come on.

646
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:49,790
Ninety.

647
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,470
Eighty nine.

648
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,910
Eighty eight.

649
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,630
Eighty seven.

650
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,070
Eighty six.

651
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,550
Eighty five.

652
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,950
Eighty four.

653
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,580
Eighty three.

654
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,110
Eighty two.

655
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,590
Eighty one.

656
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,150
Eighty.
