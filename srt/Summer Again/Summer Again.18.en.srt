Alright, look at my leg.

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,990
Open your legs

4
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,350
and close your heels.

5
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:07,580
Right! Well done!

6
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,030
Well, now we learn the hands.

7
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:09,990
Hands.

8
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,870
Put them down.

[Adapted from Huo He's comic, "Mint Love"]

12
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,590
Oh, oops, how did the ball
grow legs and run away?

13
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,550
Could you help me to pick it?

14
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,350
Don't you have legs?

15
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:02,550
No.

16
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:05,710
Troublesome!

17
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,150
Hey, your ball.

18
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,910
Thank you.

19
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,270
Thanks.

20
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,230
Why did you two come over?

21
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:15,190
Oh, why?

22
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,789
Do we have to report you that we came?

23
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,870
We just got to know from the
class group chat that,

24
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,750
Wang Yi Ming has competition today.

25
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,950
So, we want to cheer with him.

26
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:26,789
You two just come to see him particularly?

27
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,950
The best vanguard of basketball club.

28
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,390
I won't let you disappoint!

29
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,750
See! Like I said.

30
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,550
Wang Yi Ming
is great in playing basketball.

31
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,190
This is the first time I see him playing.

32
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,030
Go for it!

33
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,789
Go for it, vanguard!

34
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,550
Go for it!

35
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,550
Go for it!

36
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,750
What are you thinking of?

37
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,350
Nothing.

38
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,630
I just feel little bit tired.

39
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,260
I thought you are still
thinking of the ballet.

40
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,710
How could it be?

41
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,230
How could I think of ballet?

42
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,710
Okay.

43
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,790
Well, I just feel little bit strange.

44
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,340
Today, when Xiao Bei asked me

45
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,950
about what to teach him,

46
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,829
the first thing I thought

47
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,030
was ballet.

48
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,990
At that time, I hesitated for some time.

49
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,630
But after I thought about it,

50
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,270
there is nothing

51
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,470
I could really teach him except ballet.

52
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,230
Well, you can teach him a lot of things.

53
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,790
You can teach him singing, story telling

54
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,020
or making one thousand paper cranes.//

55
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,100
But all you thought of was ballet.

56
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,910
You have been dancing ballet
through many years

57
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,070
but do you ever feel that

58
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,350
you got special feeling from ballet?

59
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:58,750
I...

60
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,550
And how do you know about
Xiao Bei's matter?

61
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,550
Did that Miss Editor of yours tell you?

62
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,710
No, not her.

63
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,550
You met that person before.

64
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,350
He is

65
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,830
Wei Ze.

66
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,190
Senior Wei Ze?

67
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,430
No wonder.

68
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,670
He even came to ask me about
your phone number.

69
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,230
Wait a second!

70
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,350
Senior Wei Ze knows that you are Qing He?

71
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,870
Correct. He met me
on that day of the signing event.

72
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,829
I see.

73
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,030
I asked him how you look like.

74
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,110
He told me that you look so friendly.

75
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,350
Then I said,

76
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,510
how could anyone describe
others as they look friendly?

77
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,670
And he told me that
he admired you before.

78
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,110
Would that be...

79
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,510
Hey! What are you thinking of?

80
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,230
Hey! When did you start
playing basketball?

81
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,030
From standard five or six.

82
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,870
Then you must have learned from
professional coach, right?

83
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,220
Otherwise, it could not
just have been four or five years

84
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,710
then you played it well!

85
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,430
No! It is about the talent.

86
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,990
I got something, I need to go first.

87
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,030
Tao Zi!

88
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,950
So, can you teach me how to play
the basketball?

89
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:12,710
Sure.

90
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,150
Let's go to eat something.

91
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,780
[You have been dancing ballet
for so many years]

92
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,950
[but do you ever feel that]

93
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,300
[you got special feeling from ballet?]

94
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,550
Tong Tong!

95
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,350
Did you sleep already?

96
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:11,990
No, not yet.

97
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,390
Your dad sent something to you.

98
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,950
The glutinous rice ball which he made.

99
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,950
For your supper.

100
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:18,950
From my dad?

101
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,030
Try it.

102
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:23,910
Tasty!

103
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,230
Tasty?

104
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,430
My dad's cooking skill got improved.

105
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,830
The semester is starting soon.

106
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,230
Have you made your decision?
Arts stream or Science stream?

107
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:33,950
Maybe Arts stream.

108
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,790
I think I am still better in arts.

109
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,190
Arts... Arts is good too.

110
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,390
You can learn whatever you want,

111
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,790
as long as you like it

112
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,510
and I will not stop you.

113
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,070
Thank you, Mum!

114
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,310
Yue Ming.

115
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,590
We did not meet and
you grew even taller

116
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,660
after the holiday.

117
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,070
Not only growing taller,

118
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,350
I gained some weight too.

119
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,260
The day of staying late at night has come.

120
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,190
Indeed!

121
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,150
It is new semester soon.

122
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,910
It's also a brand new start.

123
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:13,670
Tong Xi.

124
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,990
Oh my...

125
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,190
Isn't this the best oyster cake
from that Xi Zhao Lane?

126
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,510
It is very hard to buy it!

127
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,550
It only opens in the morning,

128
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,510
and you have to spend almost an hour
waiting at the long queue

129
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,230
before you could buy it.

130
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,550
Lin, you are so considerate.

131
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:29,990
Have a taste.

132
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,030
Well, maybe I recently ate too much Pocky

133
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,150
and I have cloyed of it.

134
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,180
Have something greasy then!
To cleanse the palate.

135
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,230
It's just the first day of the school.

136
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,790
Look! All of you!

137
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,030
Like you never wake from sleep.

138
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,750
Class streaming will start soon.

139
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:52,470
There's a common saying.

140
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,510
"Junior two and senior two
are the most important turning points."

141
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,190
Get this chance!

142
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,980
Study well and you will succeed

143
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,190
otherwise you will fail.

144
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,270
Of course.

145
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,550
I hope that every student from our class

146
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,430
will succeed.

147
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,070
Come on, be more energetic!

148
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,110
This is correct.

149
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,230
This is the true attitude that

150
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,630
a senior two student should have.

151
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,750
By the way,

152
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,230
before the class,

153
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,310
I want to mention one thing.

154
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,190
As you all saw the school's
notification that

155
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,630
this weekend

156
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,910
is our school's Community Day.

157
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,150
This is also the last activity before
the class streaming.

158
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,310
And the students who want to
apply for the poverty allowance

159
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,430
also have to attend this activity
like previous year.

160
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,190
The subsidy amount of this year

161
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,230
has increased 50% compare to last year.

162
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,830
And students who need to apply,

163
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,830
please get the application form
from class monitor tomorrow.

164
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:41,309
After filling it, send it to my office.
Okay?

165
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:43,830
Would you go

166
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,390
to dig the clams with us ?

167
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,740
That sounds interesting!

168
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,790
No, I'm not going.

169
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,030
I have extra class this weekend.

170
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,270
Furthermore, I don't need that allowance.

171
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,430
Just let it be.

172
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,070
Alright.

173
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,080
[Blue Elephant]

174
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,990
What is the "Community Day"
that the teacher said

175
00:08:59,060 --> 00:08:59,940
during the class today?

176
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,830
How come I had never heard it before?

177
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,470
It is just one of our school activities.

178
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,790
In the previous year,
we paid a visit to the orphanage

179
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,910
to see little kids

180
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,870
and played with them.

181
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,590
But this year we might go to the seaside

182
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,150
and help the fishermen
for beachcombing.

183
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,350
I heard that students who
applied for poverty allowance

184
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,230
are obligated to participate it.

185
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,780
And others simply apply as volunteers.

186
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,590
We don't apply for allowance,

187
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,790
then it has nothing to do with us.

188
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,430
Does "beachcombing" mean,
using the small shovel

189
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,900
to dig the clams at the beach?

190
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,430
Although I grew up in Xi Hai,

191
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,590
I'd never experienced that before.

192
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,510
I really wish to try it.

193
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,430
That also sounds interesting to me.

194
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,550
I would like to try it

195
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,590
even without the allowance.

196
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,630
Let's apply it together then.

197
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,110
Great!

198
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,270
If you want to go,

199
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,470
bring me too.

200
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,460
If the three of you go,

201
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,340
then I...

202
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,230
I will go with you all!

203
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:54,710
You?

204
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,940
You just go accompanying
your Sun Jie Ping.

205
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,340
Stop the nonsense!

206
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,150
She is a girl.

207
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,070
It is bad for her if you say like this.

208
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,310
I don't care.

209
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,500
I must go.

210
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,510
And don't leave me alone!

211
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,550
Fine!

212
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,990
We will apply together.

213
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,190
Otherwise, there won't be
any chance for the activities

214
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,330
after class streaming

215
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,820
When you do the multiplication,
the first one

216
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,520
multiples with the first one.
The last one multiples with the last one.

217
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,830
Isn't it easier?

218
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,670
Sister, I don't want to do it anymore.

219
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,550
I am sleepy.

220
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,310
If you don't study well,
what could you do then?

221
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,190
Like Dad? Drinking alcohol
and fishing all day?

222
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,150
But I think fishing is meaningful.

223
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,820
However, I don't like studying.

224
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,670
It's enough to have you
in our family studying.

225
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,100
Write down all these quickly!

226
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:50,710
You are back.

227
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,990
Wang Lao San isn't genuine!

228
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,110
He always bargains over the fishes' price.

229
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,710
But price was set.

230
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,350
We argued the whole day

231
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,630
just for a few cents!

232
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,830
I won't sell them to him next time.

233
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,630
You're bragging! Don't you always say
the same thing?

234
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,310
Dad, you're back!

235
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:08,670
Son!

236
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,190
Studying?

237
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,350
Study well!

238
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,990
If you get double 100%,

239
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,470
I will buy toys for you.

240
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,910
Xiao Wan, is the allowance
for needy students

241
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,980
ready to be applied?

242
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,430
How did you know that?

243
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,150
Your teacher just posted the news.

244
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,110
It's more than one thousand yuan!

245
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,070
That is 50% more than last year.

246
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,790
Last year, you didn't apply it well

247
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:34,950
and hid from us.

248
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,910
This year, you must bring the money back!

249
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,030
Understand?

250
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,670
I am recently busy
with the class streaming

251
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,340
and I don't have time for that.

252
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,630
Also, our home is not that poor.

253
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,310
How do the students judge me

254
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,550
if I apply it?

255
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,950
How does this
relate to the class streaming?

256
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,950
We are not that rich.

257
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,030
Do you know that I

258
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,870
spent the whole day argued with others

259
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,590
just for the few cents? Get it?

260
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,310
You just want that dignity, right?

261
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,190
Do I bring disgrace to you
as I am a fisherman?

262
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,470
Enough! Enough!

263
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,060
It's more than one thousand yuan!

264
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,510
Go to sleep now!

265
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,070
Isn't this a great chance?
You tell me!

266
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,110
Xiao Wan.

267
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,390
Your dad doesn't mean anything.

268
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,270
Your results are good and

269
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,110
surely you can get the allowance.

270
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,190
Furthermore, this money

271
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,430
you can keep it as
your college tuition fees.

272
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,110
Sister, let's do homework.

273
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:37,700
Do it by yourself.

274
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,230
Monitor.

275
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,710
Monitor.

276
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,950
Do we apply for that Community Day
here from you?

277
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,950
Would Wang Yi Ming go too?

278
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,910
Ask the student in charge
of general affairs for application.

279
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,470
Xiao Wan, how about we apply too?

280
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,070
We are not the needy students.
Why should we apply?

281
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,390
I agree.

282
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,630
Monitor. Do we apply
for that Community Day here from you?

283
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,460
I have said...

284
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,470
Ask the student in charge
of general affairs instead of me.

285
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,670
Sorry!

286
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,830
It's you.

287
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,790
You actually don't have to be so sorry.

288
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,710
This is nothing at all.

289
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,310

292
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,420
I won't enter with you then.

293
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,790
I am going to ask him about
the Community Day.

294
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,950
After that, I will go back.

295
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,830
Then go quickly!

296
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:22,870
Good luck!

297

299

Don't you have to call Xiao Wan too?

00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,310
Yeah.

301
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,430
Xiao Wan was in the bad mood today.

302
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,910
She didn't even join us
after class.

303

Hope that nothing's going to happen again.

304
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,780
I'm leaving then.

00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,390

Good luck!

308

So, would you still go for the
Community Day?

309

I'm going to get some comics to read.

316

what did you tell Ni Xiao Wan?

322
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,870
It's fine. Just treat it as
I've never asked.

with Sun Jie Ping?

[The new separate edition of Mint
is already printed.]

341
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,950
[The samples will arrive tomorrow.]

342
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,750
[That's great!]

343
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:58,790
[Once you get it,]

344
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,510
[you must share with me immediately!]

345
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,069
No problem!

346
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,470
[Oh, Xiao Wan.]

347
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,670
[Last time, didn't you say that]

348
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:42,270
you have a cousin who studies
in Da Cheng's key school?

349
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,910
Bring me to see him
when he comes back next time.

350
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,190
Sure!

351
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,110
[There are no such information
at our Xi Hai Town.]

352
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,100
It's my aunt who lives in Da Cheng city

353
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,230
particularly sent it to me.

354
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,070
You all may borrow from me if you need it.

355
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,350
Xiao Wan, you have relatives in
Da Cheng City!

356
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,670
She's great!

357
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:10,950
I really admire you!

358
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,990
Me too.

359
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,790
Xiao Wan.

360
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,390
Monitor, give me one too!

361
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,180
[This summer,
I think of going to the city]

362
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,270
[to attend a summer camp.]

363
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,670
[Would you like to go with me?]

364
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,390
No, I don't.

365
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,190
My father found

366
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,030
a one-to-one tutor for me
at Da Cheng City.

367
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,510
So, I need to attend the tutorial class.

368
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,670
[Okay then.]

369
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,630
[I envy you because
you can go to Da Cheng.]

370
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:30,950
[You have to go shopping]

371
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,140
[at the trendy stores there!]

372
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,510
In order to become

373
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,510
a perfect person in everyone's eyes,

374
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,270
I became a liar.

375
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,110
How could you make it up?

376
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:07,900
[Xi Hai High School's Application Form
For Needy Student]

377
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,830
[You actually don't have to be so sorry.]

378
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,710
This is nothing at all.

379
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,070
You don't know.

380
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,950
About Chekhov,

381
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,430
he didn't have any great ambition.

382
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,910
The greatest ambition of his life

383
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,190
was not to make any trouble.

384
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,750
His emotion

385
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,230
unconsciously spread around.

386
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,350
Sir.

387
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,470
My stomach doesn't feel well.

388
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,340
I need to go to the infirmary.

389
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,150
Then go quickly!
Do you need a classmate...

390
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,790
Time's up!

391
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,390
Go and get the express delivery, quick!

392
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,910
Samples, samples!

Where are you up to?

394
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,350
The reception office.

395
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,110
Don't you stop me!

396
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,030
This application must be submitted today

397
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,590
even you don't want to.

398
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,870
No! This is our school's main gate.

399
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:40,630
Could you please just stop it?

400
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,430
Could you please just go home first?

401
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,310
Don't stop me! You don't stop me!

402
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,910
I am begging you!

403
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,670
Could you please just go home first?

404
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,470
No, I won't go back! I...

405
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,630
What's wrong?

406
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:48,790
Who are you?

407
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,710
Who am I?

408
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,190
I am her father!

409
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,070
You asked me, "Who am I?"

410
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:57,710
Just leave it!

411
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,510
This is not your matter. I am fine.

412
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,550
You go back! Go!

413
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,470
You are fine! But I am not!

414
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,830
You're not willing to submit this?

415
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,230
Today, I came to school to submit this
on behalf of you.

416
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,070
What do you really want?

417
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,750
If there's anything,
can we just go home and discuss?

418
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,510
Let's go home and discuss!
Stop being disgraced here!

419
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:15,950
Go!

420
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,740
Disgrace?

421
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,150
What's wrong to let others know this?

422
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,470
I said I don't want to submit it!

423
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,110
Can you just stop forcing me?

424
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,340
Could it be that in your heart,

425
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,870
my dignity isn't worth as much
as these one thousand yuan?

426
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,070
Dignity?

427
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,830
If you need the dignity,

428
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,510
then don't use our money!

429
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,950
Today, this form,

430
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,870
I'm going to submit it!

431
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,390
Today, you saw the embarrassment again.

432
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,550
No, I didn't see anything today.

433
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:05,940
Why

434
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,430
do other people have

435
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,030
a very good and happy family

436
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,670
while my parents are like this?

437
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:20,150
Perhaps your parents have
their own opinions

438
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:20,990
and plans.

439
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,990
They never consider me

440
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,110
in their opinions and plans.

441
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,550
Lin Nan Yi.

442
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,870
I am really afraid of
losing face in front of you.

443
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,350
But

444
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,870
how coincidentally

445
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,870
I happened to meet you every time.

446
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,630
I don't want to apply

447
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,950
and attend that Community Day too.

448
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,710
Then others will know that

449
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,870
I am a needy student.

450
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,870
If you don't want to apply for
the poverty allowance,

451
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,110
but at the same time you need to
hand over money to your parents,

452
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,510
just use this money.

453
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,550
Just treat it as I lend you.

454
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,310
The card's passwords are...

455
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,230
I am very familiar with this.

456
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,870
Like when we were junior students.

457
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,780
That time, you also helped me
in this way.

458
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,550
You appeared suddenly.

459
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:24,950
Thanks.

460
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,230
But I can't take it.

461
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,510
Lin Nan Yi.

462
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,190
Please wait.

463
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,350
Just for a moment.

464
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,150
Lin Nan Yi! I want a cup of...

465
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,350
Tong Xi.

466
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:04,670
Tong Xi!

467
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,020
Tong Xi! Don't be angry!

468
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:16,220
Tong Xi.

469
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,070
That is not really what you think of.

470
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,110
Then?

471
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,350
Ni Xiao Wan, she...

472
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,380
You can't tell me. Right?

473
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,550
Tong Xi! Wait for me!

474
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:37,510
Tong Xi.

475
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,310
Wait for me!

476
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,230
Tong Xi. Are you alright?

477
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,270
Why are the boys always like that?

478
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,510
Wang Yi Ming too.

479
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,070
Since Sun Jie Ping became his good friend,

480
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,230
he didn't say anything though I asked.

481
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:07,230
He and Lin Nan Yi are really good friends.

482
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,670
But I think this must be

483
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:13,710
a misunderstanding.

484
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,790
Two days ago, he even helped you
to buy the oyster cake by waiting in line.

485
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,150
He won't change so suddenly.

486
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:17,630
Right?

487
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,380
I know

488
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,470
but I am just...

489
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,350
Really angry. I understand.

490
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,310
But anger is just anger.

491
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,230
If you are really mad at him

492
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,030
about this matter,

493
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,430
that isn't worth too. Correct?

494
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,190
[Monitor. Would you attend the
Community Day together this weekend?]

495
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,990
[Let's organize a group activity
once again before the class streaming.]

496
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,990
[Okay! Let's do it!]

497
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:43,630
Oh my goodness.

498
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,230
Doesn't Lin just give me a slap?

499
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,590
Anyway, after two days,

500
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,390
we will attend the Community Day too.

501
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,110
Or shall we see first?

502
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,590
Why should we go?

503
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,550
Just let two of them go!

504
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,270
Why should I go?

505
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:02,950
Tong Xi!

506
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,990
[Forget it. I can't explain anyway.]

507
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,830
Today, our main experience project

508
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,270
is to dig the clams.

509
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,950
Although the autumn has come,

510
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,030
the weather is still very hot.

511
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,670
So, it is good to come here
and experience it.

512
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,710
Hey, hey. Come here, come here.

513
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,790
We are going to learn something

514
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,430
which you never learn from your textbook.

515
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,870
These clams can go under the sand.

516
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,110
So, if we want to dig bigger clams,

517
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,470
we must dig deeper.

518
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,990
As you dig around 7 to 8 cm,
then you will find them.

519
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,180
Okay!

520
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,990
Okay! So everybody, let's move.

521
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:13,670
Action!

522
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,910
Everybody, please come here
and take the tools

523
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,270
then you can start your activity.

524
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,390
Alright!

525
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,950
I'm going to take the pail.

526
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:20,470
Okay!

527
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,190
Wang Yi Ming!

528
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,470
I just caught a little crab!

529
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,070
Good! Nice!

530
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:33,990
I haven't caught anything.

531
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,380
Lin Nan Yi.

532
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,430
Thank you so much.

533
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,990
This time, I troubled you again.

534
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:45,670
What is that?

535
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,750
In the group chat, you invited me to come.

536
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:49,870
Then

537
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,350
they won't consider me

538
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,340
as a needy student.

539
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,110
Maybe you paid
too much attention on this matter.

540
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,870
Many students are here as volunteers.

541
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,910
They don't even think like this.

542
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,830
It is nothing
even though it's known to all.

543
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:03,990
We are all classmates.

544
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,100
They won't have prejudice against you

545
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,310
just because of this.

546
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,990
Although they don't judge me
by their mouth,

547
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,310
they would comment on me.

548
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,390
I don't want to be everyone's topic.

549
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,030
Now, I wish class streaming comes quickly.

550
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,590
Then nobody would

551
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,630
know about my situation.

552
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,550
No more.

553
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,700
I also don't know what this is.

554
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:51,540
If there's a chance,

555
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,390
let's play basketball again.
