[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,380
All of you are going to be in
different classes starting next week.

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:06,510
Happy?

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,310
No.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,590
Whatever.

6
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,150
I'm happy, anyway.

7
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,350
I can finally get rid of you

8
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,500
little rascals.

9
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,670
Later in the afternoon,

10
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,110
we'll be taking a group photo.

11
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,270
Starting next Monday,

12
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,030
you'll go to your new class.

13
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,030
Got it?

14
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,189
Alright, alright, kiddos.

15
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,190
Stop pretending to be sentimental.

16
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,950
You've only been classmates for a year.

17
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,030
Is it that hard to get separated?

18
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,190
Teacher, how can you be so heartless?

19
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,110
This isn't heartless.

20
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,870
There's a saying,

21
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,270
"Better reunions come after separations."

22
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,420
Accepting goodbyes

23
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,830
is just part of growing up.

24
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:48,830
Moreover,

25
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,550
we're still in the same school, right?

26
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:51,950
We'll still see each other.

27
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,030
There, there.

28
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:54,990
After you've chosen your stream,

29
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,950
you'll be entering the most important time

30
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,150
of Senior High School.

31
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,620
There's no time for sulking.

32
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,310
When you enter the new class,

33
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,150
I want everyone to be serious

34
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,390
and think about the reason
you've chosen this stream.

35
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,910
Think about your future ambition,

36
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,270
and what person you'd want to be.

37
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,070
I won't be able to help you in the future.

38
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,030
So, you've got yourselves to depend on.

39
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,230
Most importantly,

40
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,220
be kind to your new class teacher.

41
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,390
Got it?

42
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,420
Yes.

43
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,430
Thank you.

44
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,510
You can do it.

45
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,789
Work hard to get into your dream school.

46
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,310
You too. Hope things go well for you.

47
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,150
Thank you, thank you.

48
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:29,830
Keep in touch.

49
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,630
Me too.

50
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:30,980
Okay.

51
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,830
Let's do our best! Keep in touch.

52
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,229
Thank you, keep in touch.

53
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,310
Tong Xi,

54
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,310
it's been a pleasure to have
been in the same class as you.

55
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:37,990
Me too.

56
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,190
I hope you do get into your dream school.

57
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:40,870
You too.

58
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:41,470
You can do it.

59
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,150
You can do it.

60
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,789
Class Monitor, can you sign
my alumni book for me?

61
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,509
Please?

62
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:00,710
Thank you, Class Monitor.

63
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,580

64
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,550

Xiao Wan.

69
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,070
Class Monitor,

70
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,830
since you and Lin Nan Yi
are standing close to each other,

71
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:11,950
do you want to take a photo together?

72
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,350
No, no, no. It's okay.

73
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,870
Look here.

74
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,860
Three, two, one. Say cheese!

75
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,670
Lin Nan Yi,

76
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:28,910
if...

77
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,270
If you didn't know Tong Xi,

78
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,470
would you have been my best friend?

79
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,350
I won't answer hypothetical questions.

80
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:41,829
But,

81
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,990
you'd find someone who

82
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,500
would make you the
lead character of a story.

83
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,230
That's weird.

84
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,030
That silly guy's no longer annoying me.

85
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,550
Shouldn't I be relieved?

86
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:07,870
And?

87
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,430
I don't know.

88
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,710
I'm feeling a little gloomy.

89
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,230
Just forget it.

90
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,310
What do they

91
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,510
have to do with me?

92
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,990
Why are you looking at me like that?

93
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,190
I'm honest.

94
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,270

Come on.

98
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,390
Is that a reason to take a photo?

99
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,230
Yeah, yeah.

100
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,150
White Swan, let's take a photo together.

101
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,870
Quit calling me that.

102
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,190
Come, come, I'll help you with the camera.

103
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,710
Sure.

104

Tong Xi.

108

Xiao Wan, you can do it.

109
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,230
You'd shine in

110
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,350
science stream.

111
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,230

With you?

114
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,550
No.

Standby.

121
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,870
Make sure your face can be seen.

122
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,510
Ready?

Don't you think the thing between
Wang Yi Ming and Sun Jie Ping

176
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,110
is kind of bizarre to talk about?

[Almost.]

190

00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,950
Of course!

196
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,550
However,

197
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,310
if you include Wang Yi Ming's story,

198
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,310
won't you be worried that
they might guess your identity?

199
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,270
Well, if it happens,

200
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,190

201

00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,470
this lad looks like our Nan Yi.

343
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,750
What do you think?

344
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,870
Oh, it really is our Nan Yi.

345
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,150
He's never told us about this.

346
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,270
Look,

347
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,620
it's something about

348
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,150
"Qing He".

349
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,150
"Qing He"?

350
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,430
It's Nan Yi in the photos.

351
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,660
I'm not the only one who recognises him.

352
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,150
Everyone recognises him.

353
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,470
The lad in the photo
does look like Nan Yi.

354
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,140
But, Nan Yi's never told us about it.

355
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,350
That's right.

356
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,510
We'll ask him later.

357
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,829
Tao Zi, be patient.

358
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,710
When Lin comes,

359
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,060
I'll beat him up till he's deformed.

360
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,670
I dare you!

361
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,190
If you touch a single hair on my idol,

362
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,190
you'll be dead as a doornail.

363
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,150
Can you go to your class

364
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,470
and just sit still?

365
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,550
I'm not going to.

366
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,540
Lin Nan Yi, get over here!

367
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,590
Get in line!

368
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,430
[Once,]

369
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,870
[Tong Xi dreamed of being
White Swan liked by others,]

370
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,710
[I dreamed of being an excellent
and perfect campus belle.]

371
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,270
But, who would have thought

372
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,030
the person who really shines

373
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,270
could have been Lin Nan Yi?

374
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,190
Who would have thought

375
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,430
that I'd need to get in line
just to see Lin one day?

376
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,110
What's this?

377
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,230
These are letters from
more than 20 fans of Qing He

378
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,110
who have entrusted me
with their love for him

379
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,950
and to get Guru Qing He's signature.

380
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,430
Hmm... I think selling Lin's draft

381
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,590
would make me rich.

382
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,070
Tong Xi, tell me,

383
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,550
did you know his identity before this?

384
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,630
Who would have thought

385
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,590
Guru Qing He,

386
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,630
my good "son",

387
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,870
appears to be him?

388
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,340
What son?

389
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,630
You used to swoon after him every second.

390
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,510
I bet things are awkward now, huh?

391
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,830
What do you know?

392
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,270
I'm a Mum Fan.

393
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,910
I care about his career.

394
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,670
It would only be awkward

395
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,660
if he had a girlfriend
who fangirls over him.

396
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:01,550
Are you guys

397
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,430
okay?

398
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,870
Yeah, yeah, I kept the secret from
the both of you.

399
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,830
I'm sorry.

400
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,740
I wanted to tell you.

401
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,630
But, I didn't know how.

402
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,750
Save it.

403
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,230
I'm indeed very sad.

404
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,500
But, I've thought about it.

405
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,470
Even if you told me at that time,

406
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,510
I wouldn't have trusted you.

407
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,790
That's right, Guru Qing He,

408
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,230
you don't need to apologise.

409
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,940
It's just that we're not

410
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,390
really used to it yet.

411
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,230
Why are you upset?

412
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,910
Don't I have some right to feel awkward?

413
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,470
I feel very

414
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,270
disturbed.

415
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,710
They're just living to the hype of things.

416
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,470
Well, it's almost National Day's holiday.

417
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,830
When we come back after that,

418
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,510
things will go back to normal.

419
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,590
Guru Qing He,

420
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,030
can I take a photo with you?

421
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,260
Guru Qing He, can I have a photo with you?

422
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,870
Sorry, sorry.

423
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,430
[Blue Elephant]

424
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,470
Something tells me that

425
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,460
on this National Day,

426
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:59,630
customer traffic at Blue Elephant
would peak.

427
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,150
Why?

428
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,870
It's because of Qing He, of course!

429
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,630
You know,

430
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,830
I've been replying

431
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,390
messages for reservations

432
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,430
all day.

433
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,630
This is unbelievable!

434
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,670
Because of Guru Qing He,

435
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,230
the never-before-heard reservations

436
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,550
at Blue Elephant are about to take place!

437
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,430
Round of applause, please!

438
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:20,540
Rest.

439
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,230
I don't feel like writing anymore.

440
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,190
Why don't we talk about

441
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,270
the plans

442
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,110
you have since the holidays are nearing?

443
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,590
Why don't we go for a trip?

444
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,390
Forget about it.

445
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,070
My holidays are spent with
tuition classes and more tuition classes.

446
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,590
As for me,

447
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,550
I eat, sleep and play basketball.

448
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:49,550
Maybe I'll have a meal
with Xiao Ping Ping.

449
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,900
"Xiao Ping Ping"? Gross.

450
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,430
As for me...

451
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,070
Hello, class teacher?

452
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,430
Now?

453
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:09,630
Sure.

454
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:10,990
I'll be there in a minute.

455
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:17,390
Our school needs me for an interview.

456
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,590
I'm off.

457
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:20,950
Besides,

458
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,950
during the October holidays,

459
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,030
I might need to go to the city

460
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,510
for some promotional events.

461
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,660
I might not have time.

462
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,070
Tong Xi,

463
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,390
sorry.

464
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,230
I'm off.

465
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,270
Go ahead, Guru.

466
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,230
All the best!

467
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,710
Bye!

468
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,070
Bye!

469
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:54,630
Tong Xi.

470
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,070
Senior?

471
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,190
Don't you have night self-learning?

472
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,150
I'm going to attend tuition classes.

473
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,390
Why do excellent students like you

474
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,350
need tuition classes?

475
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,630
Like I said,

476
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,670
the exams here

477
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,750
are different from the ones in Da Cheng.

478
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,230
I need to learn some important points,

479
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,630
so I want to go for tuition classes.

480
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,790
Gosh Senior, I salute you.

481
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,710
You're determined on things

482
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,550
you're certain of.

483
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,470
You're never lost.

484
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:18,350
What's the matter?

485
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,590
Why do you feel lost?

486
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,900
It's nothing about studies.

487
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,550
So, it must be Qing...

488
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,740
Lin Nan Yi?

489
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,310
Before I knew he is Qing He,

490
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,710
I would message him directly to chat.

491
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,270
It made me especially happy.

492
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,430
Then, after knowing his identity,

493
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,190
although I felt awkward for some time,

494
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,390
I got used to it quick.

495
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,390
I felt that his identity was

496
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,670
a little secret just between him and I.

497
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,950
Now that his identity is known,

498
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,670
you feel like your treasure
has been pirated.

499
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,230
I'm no late-night radio DJ.

500
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,550
So, I don't know much about this.

501
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,180
But, I think

502
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,630
if you care really care,

503
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,190
then, you should be open
and honest to him about it.

504
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,110
It's the most effective way.

505
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,470
My class is in ten minutes.

506
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,030
Bye.

507
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:14,380
Senior.

508
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,190
Um...

509
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,590
Do you still hate this place?

510
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,350
I'm still not used to this place.

511
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,350
But, there's only one more year left.

512
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,510
I think I could pull through.

513
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,270
When I first came,

514
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,030
I felt that I couldn't make it through
even one day.

515
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,100
But, having friends like you guys

516
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,190
make it a little bit better.

517
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:36,750
Senior,

518
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,830
follow your heart.

519
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,870
It's life.

520
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:40,790
Try to be happy

521
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,590
and happier.

522
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,750
You know better.

523
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,110
Well, you

524
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,270
already know the answer.

525
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:48,550
Bye!

526
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,390
Thank you, Senior Wei Ze!

527
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,430
Yes.

528
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,190
The person in the newspaper is me.

529
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,350
I am Qing He.

530
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,230
She...

531
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,910
I think she doesn't know.

532
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,950
Dad, I'm hanging up now.

533
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:43,550
Tong Xi.

534
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,510
Why are you here?

535
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,710
What's the matter?

536
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,270
So, I need a valid reason to see you?

537
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,990
I don't mean that.

538
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,110
I don't know what's gone into me.

539
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,310
I was aware that Qing He has many fans.

540
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:09,630
But now,

541
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,630
more and more people flock around you.

542
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,350
I feel a sense of loss.

543
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,230
It's like

544
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:16,510
we're

545
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,510
drifting away further from each other.

546
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,660
What prompted this thought?

547
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,230
It's a fact.

548
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,870
Just look at you.

549
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,350
Nowadays, you're busy

550
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,430
attending to passionate fans every day.

551
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,910
Once you have time,

552
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,110
there are all sorts of interviews.

553
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,550
Now I know what it's like

554
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,710
to be a friend of a celebrity.

555
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,390
On one hand, you'd hope
that everyone likes him.

556
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,150
On the other, you'd want to hide him away,

557
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,830
out of the attention of others.

558
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,990
I contradict myself.

559
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,710
Yes, you do.

560
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,470
But, I understand how you feel.

561
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,070
Although all of you are fans,

562
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,430
you are somewhat different from them.

563
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,630
They've never told me about

564
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,710
preparing a betrothal gift to me.

565
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,350
I'm serious!

566
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,540
Why are you talking about that?

567
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:10,950
Okay, okay, okay.

568
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,590
Their

569
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,630
curiosity for me will wear out.

570
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,750
After all, I'm just a person
who draws comic.

571
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,660
Who cares what do I look like?

572
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,030
I think, real fans

573
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,430
should care more about my work.

574
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,270
That's true.

575
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,550
Your work will only get better.

576
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,070
And so will your future.

577
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,790
But, I'm afraid.

578
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,380
I'm always worried that
I've not done my best,

579
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,630
which pulls me away from you.

580
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:39,870
After all,

581
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,190
I don't even know what
I want to be in the future.

582
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,150
Hey!

583
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,510
Since I have the time to complain,

584
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,310
I should think about

585
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,350
what I want to be in the future.

586
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,150
I shouldn't blame you for being excellent.

587
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,740
I should work hard to catch up.

588
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,710
I heard that mint repels mosquitoes.

589
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,430
You should try it.

590
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:34,630
Sure.

591
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,020
Thank you, Xiao Wan.
