68
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,750
For example, I would have

69

certain emotion towards Andre

70

Before our interview today,

102
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,590
I did some homework.

103
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,110
I went through
your two comics very seriously.

104
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,790
Early Summer and Mint.

105
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:55,950
I think they are

106
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,790
two outstanding comic works.

107
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,270
And I really want to know

108
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,030
what set you

109
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,190
on the path of comic drawing?

110
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,790
Actually, I don't consider
myself a comic artist.

111
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,029
Because this path is
something I didn't plan on.

112
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,350
When I started drawing comic,

113
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,029
I just wanted to kill some time.

114
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,709
So, I drew

115
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,710
some random four-panel comic

116
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,670
and posted them online.

117
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,830
I just wanted to share it with

118
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,630
other comic lovers.

119
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,070
Everyone knows you as Guru Qing He.

120
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,630
I believe you too,

121
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,990
have your own perspective on comic.

122
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,070
I...

123
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:39,510
I hope that through my comic,
I can express

124
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,909
some longing for the world, for emotions.

125
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,909
Take Early Summer for example,

126
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,990
its story is about a little boy

127
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,630
and his mother's
everyday life together.

128
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,750
What many netizens see in the comic

129
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,790
is the mother's concern for her son.

130
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,310
But what I also want to express

131
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,670
is the son's reliance
and care for his mother.

132
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,910
We can see that Qing He
is a very sentimental person.

00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,030
[I see.]

173
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,110
[I got it.]

174
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,030
[Thank you, Tao Zi.]

175
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,510
Hold on, hold on, Jie Ping,

176
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,510
you mustn't let him eat dairy food.

177
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,030
Otherwise,

178
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,590
he'll definitely have diarrhoea
within three minutes.

179
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:44,860
Hello?

180
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,550
Tao Zi,

181
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,470
is the new beverage in Blue Elephant

182
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,230
hundred-year-old vinegar?

183
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,950
Someone's getting really jealous.

184
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,110
Don't be absurd.

185
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,750
He's always around bugging me,

186
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,950
I'm getting sick of him.

187
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,870
Now that someone is finally
going to take him away,

188
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,270
I'm really happy about it.

189
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,990
There's no way I would get jealous.

190
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,990
You may not want to admit it,

191
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,150
but perhaps during these long years,

192
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,430
you have long developed

193
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,070
unique feelings for Wang Yi Ming.

194
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,790
So, you flipped.

195
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,790
I flipped?

196
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,350
That's impossible.

197
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,910
I'm not, I won't allow it.

198
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,700
I'm going back to work.

199
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,030
I know you like grilled seafood

200
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,030
and stinky tofu.

201
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:35,990
You...

202
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,830
You know about that?

203
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,550
But I still think

204
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,510
this is our first date.

205
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,870
I wanted to do it properly,

206
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,430
so I chose this restaurant.

207
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,110
What do you think of it?

208
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,390
It's nice, really nice.

209
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,230
I'm fine with anything.

210
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,430
As long as you like it.

211
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,550
Thanks.

212
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,830
This is smooth and bouncy.

213
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,430
What is it made of, Tao Zi?

214
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,990
Sorry, I... I mean...

215
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:17,590
It's fine.

216
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,990
Try this.

217
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,790
This is my favourite dessert.

218
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,910
It's good.

219
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:31,790
Good, right?

220
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,630
This is made with full cream milk.

221
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,980
It can be considered the
most authentic one in town.

222
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,150
I really love it.

223
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,110
What is it made of?

224
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,350
Milk.

225
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,790
Where is their restroom?

226
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,830
Thank you for your hard work today.

227
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,110
You were great.

228
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,190
Thank you.

229
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,350
I'll keep it up.

230
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,020
Look forward to seeing you again.

231
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,110
Nan Yi.

232
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,190
Wait.

233
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,750
Let go.

234
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,950
Nan Yi, can we talk?

235
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,830
Give me some time.

236
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,630
Let's have a talk, please?

237
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,710
I've read these two comics.

238
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:56,910
I didn't know

239
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,870
you were so good and so talented

240
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,870
at drawing.

241
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,750
You even had a book signing in Da Cheng.

242
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,220
I only found out about it lately.

243
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,230
Is this all you wanted to talk about?

244
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,310
No, no.

245
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:10,910
I just want to tell you that

246
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:11,870
I showed these two comics

247
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,460
to the teachers at Academy of
Fine Arts Affiliated High School.

248
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,030
They thought you're very talented.

249
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,590
If you want,

250
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,710
I can transfer you to the Academy
of Fine Arts Affiliated High School.

251
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,790
This way, if you want to
attend the Academy of Fine Arts

252
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,820
or study abroad,

253
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,950
I'll be able to help you.

254
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,510
No need.

255
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,230
Thank you.

256
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,910
Nan Yi.

257
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,030
I've been plagued by
guilt all these years.

258
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,390
Although

259
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,180
it's true that I had
some difficulties back then,

260
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,630
no matter what,

261
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,430
I shouldn't have given you away

262
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,510
when you were so little.

263
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,070
I really wanted to make it up
to you over the past years.

264
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,420
I don't need you to make up for it.

265
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,270
I just want to live my life well now.

266
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,430
It's getting late.

267
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,030
I should go back to Xi Hai now.

268
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,910
You should go home too.

269
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,190
Goodbye.

270
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,430
Nan Yi.

271
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,270
Tao Zi, are you all right?

272
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,700
I'm fine.

273
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,270
I dropped it by accident.

274
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,150
Don't use your hand.

275
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,870
Leave it, I'll clean it up.

276
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:47,670
Wait here.

277
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,150
Tong Xi, you're so attentive.

278
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,310
I wish I can be as attentive as you.

279
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:27,150
Tao Zi, during Xu Ao's birthday last time,

280
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,070
after he turned down
the fried squid you offered him,

281
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,710
you said the same thing to me

282
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,230
in the same place.

283
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:34,750
What's the matter?

284
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,230
Did you say this again because

285
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,830
you had the same feeling like last time?

286
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,950
What do you mean by that?

287
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,540
Tao Zi, although you refused to admit it,

288
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:46,190
Wang Yi Ming and Sun Jie Ping
were having a date

289
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,150
actually bothered you a lot, didn't it?

290
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:49,790
I...

291
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,390
All right.

292
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,150
You don't have to tell me, I know.

293
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,310
I just want to tell you that

294
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,670
you don't have to make it
difficult for yourself.

295
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,270
You're obviously upset,

296
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,870
yet you still gave Wang Yi Ming
and Sun Jie Ping advice

297
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,550
to teach them how to befriend each other.

298
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,220
It's getting late.

299
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:06,180
[Calling. Wang Yi Ming]

300
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,470
Go home first.

301
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,190
I'll take care of the rest.

302
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,430
What happened to you?

303
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,900
What took you so long?

304
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,430
I've been calling you.

305
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,150
Why can't I get through?

306
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,710
The moment I turned on my phone,

307
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,830
I received a call from Sun Jie Ping
crying to me that

308
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,150
you seemed unhappy.

309
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,430
I was going to confront you about it.

310
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,190
How did you get
yourself into this situation?

311
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,430
It's a long story.

312
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,470
My dad is away on business

313
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,750
while my mum is working overtime.

314
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,110
No one can take care of me.

315
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,350
When I used the toilet just now,

316
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,670
I got no one to help me.

317
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,750
My one hand was injected with drip,

318
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,670
while I held my pants with the other one,

319
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,790
I almost...

320
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,020
Do me a favour.

321
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,870
Buy me some food.

322
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,270
My colon is cleaner than face now.

323
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,030
You should've asked Sun Jie Ping
to be with you now.

324
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,070
How can I find a girl
for this kind of thing?

325
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,540
I kind of figured out now.

326
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,910
You are the most important person to me.

327
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,390
You are mankind's best friend.

328
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,070
Really.

329
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,870
I called her

330
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,150
by your name several times today,

331
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,310
it was really awkward.

332
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,350
Only you could do such a thing
like calling the wrong name.

333
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,230
Seriously, man, you're...

334
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:43,910
Forget it.

335
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,070
You want small steamed bun or stinky tofu?

336
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,300
Small steamed bun.

337
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,270
And stinky tofu.

338
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:52,950
Wait here.

339
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,190
By the way, why are you wearing shorts?

340
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,430

00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,070
[passion itself]

510
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,790
[is the greatest meaning.]

511
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,510
[I know you're been trying hard]

512
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,950
[to find your dream.]

513
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,630
[Even if something really did]

514
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,350
[bring you passion,]

515
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,070
[don't be afraid of it,]

516
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,470
[don't resist it.]

517
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,910
[Even if after you try it,]

518
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,310
[you realize that it's not right
for you, you want to give up,]

519
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,070
[that's okay too.]

520
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,350
[Because growing up]

521
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,270
[is a process of trial and error.]

522
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,990
[We will ponder about it]

523
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,950
[and we will do our best for it.]

524
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:41,150
[I'll be with you.]

525
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,310
[I'll always be with you]

526
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,590
[until you find]

527
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,350
[the passion that belongs to you.]

528
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,300
Lin Nan Yi, why are you so nice?

529
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,430
Tong Tong, you...

530
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:24,550
Mum.

531
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,390
I looked at those

532
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,870
photos and videos you shot.

533
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:31,950
They were great.

534
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,830
Also, you danced well.

535
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,510
It was really nice.

536
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,670
You were as good as how I was back then.

537
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:41,430
Mum.

538
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:42,670
What's wrong?

539
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,270
I didn't criticize you.

540
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,060
All right, that's all I wanted to say.

541
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,070
Rest early.

542
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,430
I'm going to organize these videos.

543
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:51,910
Mum.

544
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,430
Can I continue to study ballet

545
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:03,990
with Mr. Xu?

546
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,350
Yes.

547
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,110
Absolutely!

548
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,140
Absolutely!

549
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,620
[Nan Yi, no matter what,]

550
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,790
[I hope you will consider my suggestion.]

551
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:11,790
Let's be friends.
