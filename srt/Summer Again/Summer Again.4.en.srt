00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,890
Xiao Wan. Finally, you're back.

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,860
Your skirt looks nice.

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,300
Thank you.

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,500
Class monitor.
How did your competition go?

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,140
It went quite well.

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,860
Xiao Wan. You're getting prettier.

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:26,740
You look skinnier too!

11
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,420
Thank you.

12
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,220
I heard there's a
new student in our class.

13
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,660
I'll go say hi.

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,770
Okay, class monitor.

15
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,060
Come with me. I'll take you to her.

16
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,420
Xiao Wan, this is...

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:39,930
Tong Xi.

18
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,010
Hello. I'm Ni Xiao Wan.

19
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,100
Hello. Do you know me?

20
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,260
Of course I do.

21
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,220
Before I came back,

22
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,140
I've already heard that a White Swan
transferred to our school.

23
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,940
We could have met each other earlier.

24
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,860
But I was still in Beijing

25
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,210
for a literature competition.

26
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,700
So I came back a few days late.

27
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,820
From now on, we're classmates.

28
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,340
If you need any help,

29
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,340
just tell me.

30
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:02,620
Okay.

31
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,940
Nan Yi. I'm back.

32
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:08,970
It's been a while.

33
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,050
It's been a while.

34
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,580
Aren't you busy, Wang Yi Ming?

35
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,220
I...

36
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,660
I heard your leg is injured.

37
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,380
How is it? Has it recovered?

38
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,580
It's fine. I'm much better now.

39
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,979
This is for you.

40
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,130
What is this?

41
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:38,979
Just open it.

42
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:45,860
This must be very expensive.

43
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,700
It's not.

44
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,900
It's the prize I won
for the competition.

45
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:49,940
I got first prize.

46
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,259
Since it's a precious prize,

47
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,530
you should treasure it yourself.

48
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,780
Because it's precious,

49
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,820
I want you to have it.

50
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,250
It's really too expensive.
I can't accept it.

51
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,540
Your leg must hurt.

52
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,500
You shouldn't be standing.

53
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,460
Let's talk inside.

54
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,410
Let's go.

Episode 4: White Swan VS Pride of Xi Hai]

57
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,460
[Adapted from Huo He's
comic, "Mint Love".]

58
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,420
Now you know why I said

59
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,380
someone will pay you
special attention here.

60
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,060
Lin Nan Yi and Ni Xiao Wan...

61
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,420
Are they close?

62
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,090
I heard they've been friends
since middle school.

63
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,460
They've always been
in the same class too.

64
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,700
I don't know about Lin

65
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,940
but Ni Xiao Wan hates it especially

66
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,260
when people go near Lin Nan Yi.

67
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,220
Not even Wang Yi Ming too.

68
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,980
They've been friends
since middle school?

69
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,300
Lin Nan Yi is definitely closer to me.

70
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,700
I paid a dowry to make him my groom

71
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,300
when I was very young.

72
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,170
That might not be the case.

73
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,220
You two lost contact for quite some time,
didn't you?

74
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,370
Furthermore,

75
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,450
he didn't reply to all the love letters

76
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,900
you wrote to him, did he?

77
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,540
Tong Xi.

78
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,260
Tong Xi.

79
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,900
Are you listening?

80
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,220
Yes.

81
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,860
How about Lin Nan Yi?

82
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,380
What is his take on this?

83
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,300
His take?

84
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,620
I'm not sure.

85
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,940
But he has been like a gentleman.

86
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,060
Lin treats everyone like that anyways.

87
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,140
Sports day is just around the corner.

88
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,540
It's time for our class monitor

89
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,020
to claim her victory again.

90
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:07,940
Tong Xi.

91
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,220
Do you need help?

92
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,780
We can help you.

93
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,260
I'm fine. Thank you.

94
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,460
Alright then.

95
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,380
We're leaving now.

96
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,260
See you tomorrow.

97
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,060
Goodbye.

98
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,060
See you. Goodbye.

100
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,460
Let me help you.

101
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,660
You don't have to.

102
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,420
You may go. We can handle it.

103
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,700
In that case...

104
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,060
I'll see you tomorrow.

105
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,620
Did she just stare at me just now?

106
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,700
Who?

107
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:47,860
Mind your own business.

108
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,260
Where is the White Swan?

109
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,530
She is on duty.

110
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:55,260
Where is Lin?

111
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,700
He is on duty too.

112
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,220
You think something is fishy too?

113
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,820
What a coincidence.
I have that feeling too.

114
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,060

00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,260
We need to decide on
our marching formation

173
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,300
for this year.

174
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,260
Also, we need to come up
with a slogan too.

175
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,940
Do you have any suggestions?

176
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,250
Can you tell our class monitor

177
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,659
not to go for formation marching anymore?

178
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,650
It's always the same every year

179
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,020
from middle school to high school.

180
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,100
I've had enough.

181
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,260
Wang Yi Ming.

182
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,810
Do you have any good ideas?

183
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,250
Shut up if you don't have.

184
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:47,740
Just keep quiet.

185
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,980
You're wrong, class monitor.

186
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,580
I do have a good idea.

187
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,700
Listen.

188
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,140
If Tong Xi can perform ballet
during the opening ceremony

189
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,100
of our sports day,

190
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,130
the entire school will be impressed by us.

191
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,700
That's right.

192
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,740
Right?

193
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,540
That's a good suggestion.

194
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,300
Thank you for your suggestion.

195
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,820
Although Tong Xi is good in ballet,

196
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,180
but the sports day

197
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,620
is a team event.

198
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,490
The purpose is to show our class cohesion.

199
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,860
If we go along with your suggestion,

200
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,980
won't we lose the sense of participation?

201
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,860
Ke'er, what do you think?

202
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,940
I agree with our class monitor.

203
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,140
Me too.

204
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,850
Lin Nan Yi, what do you think?

205
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,700
Let's vote.

206
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,450
I'm saying that we should vote to decide.

207
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,860
If Tong Xi gets more votes,

208
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,260
we'll let her perform ballet.

209
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,060
If you get more votes,

210
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,540
we'll go with your marching in formation.

211
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,340
That'll be fair to everyone.

212
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:43,980
That's right.

213
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,700
Tong Xi.

214
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,780
What do you think?

215
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,540
[Ni Xiao Wan]

216
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,700
hates it especially when
people go near Lin Nan Yi.

217
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,900
[Not even Wang Yi Ming too.]

218
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,660
Tong Xi.

219
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,740
Tong Xi.

220
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,530
What do you think?

221
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,610
I think that voting sounds fair,

222
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
but...

223
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,250
I agree with the class monitor.

224
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,620
Let's solve this fairly.

225
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,780
That's right. White Swan is right.

226
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,740
It'll be fair if we vote.

227
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,730
Let's vote then.

228
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,340
I vote for Tong Xi.

229
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:26,780
Let's vote! Let's vote!

230
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,340
Tong Xi.

231
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,740
Tong Xi.

232
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,940
Tong Xi.

233
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,050
Tong Xi.

234
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:24,940
Tong Xi.

235
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,660
Tong Xi.

236
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,860
Ni Xiao Wan.

237
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,580
Tong Xi.

238
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:35,860
Tong Xi.

239
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,340
Tong Xi.

240
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,780
Tong Xi.

241
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,980
Tong Xi.

242
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,860
That Tong Xi...

243
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,140
She's been enjoying the limelight

244
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,620
since the newsboard design competition.

245
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,170
I didn't expect her to be the showy type.

246
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,020
After all, she's from a big city.

247
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,180
Obstentatious.

248
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,100
It's not surprising
if she likes to step on us.

249
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,210
So what if she's from a big city?

250
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,740
What's so great about that?

251
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,540
You're the top scorer.

252
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,380
Can she do that?

253
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,660
Well.

254
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,820
Before this,

255
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,500
we could always have easily
gotten landslide votes.

256
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,180
Now it's different after Tong Xi is here.

257
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,260
Our classmates are just fickle minded.

258
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,250
The six votes we get is just so...

259
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:43,900
That's enough.

260
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:46,700
Forget it.

261
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,090
If she wants to be in the limelight,

262
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,410
just let her be.

263
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,860
I'll admit defeat.

264
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,260
Hopefully she'll be able to handle it.

265
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,500
Zhu Rui Rui, Su Yu, Chen Bei Xi,

266
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,780
Zhou Kuan and I

267
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,900
definitely voted for you.

268
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,900
But I have no idea

269
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,100
about the last person who voted for you.

270
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,100
I got it!

271
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,420
It must be Lin Nan Yi.

272
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,770
As long as he voted for you,

273
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,650
the rest doesn't really matter, don't it?

274
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,340
But that handwriting...

275
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,460
What did you say?

276
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,500
Nothing.

277
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,490
Didn't I tell you?

278
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,540
She'll definitely pay
special attention to you.

279
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,860
Luckily you won in the end.

280
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,290
Tao Zhu.

281
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,490
You dislike Ni Xiao Wan?

282
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,620
It's not that I dislike her.

283
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,140
She just doesn't seem truthful.

284
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,850
But she's really amazing.

285
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,380
She has always been the first

286
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,460
from middle school to high school.

287
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,900
She's also the teachers' pet.

288
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,260
Before you came,

289
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,220
she was always the girl

290
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,300
who received the most attention
among the whole grade.

291
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,820
Not truthful indeed.

292
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,220
What's wrong, Tong Xi?

293
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,380
Nothing.

294
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,250
I was just thinking that

295
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,260
the class monitor has a point.

296
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,060
After all, it is a team event.

297
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,340
Marching in formation is
probably a better choice.

298
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,140
You might not know since you're new.

299
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,050
Marching in formation

300
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,810
is all about Ni Xiao Wan
holding a sign in her hands

301
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:26,940
as she shines in all its splendor.

302
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,540
As for us,

303
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,500
we are just the utility players
standing behind her.

304
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,740
In comparison to that,

305
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,180
we'd rather let you perform in solo.

306
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,540
When I was in Da Cheng,

307
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,020
I was also the utility player
looking up silently

308
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,060
at the great masters.

309
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,820
It's you?

310
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,020
That's weird.

311
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,140
Why did I have this dream?

312
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,300
What a creative imagination.

313
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,180
Waltz?

314
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,010
Waltz?

315
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,060
Waltz!

316
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,730
Like this.

317
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,340
Two in a group.

318
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,660
We need 12 students in total.

319
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,780
Don't worry if you know nothing
about waltz.

320
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,740
I'll teach you one by one.

321
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,940
Didn't we choose you to perform ballet?

322
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,610
What's with this trouble now?

323
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,660
I'll sign up for it.

324
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,940
Lin. Are you serious?

325
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,770
Are you sure?

326
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:11,980
Waltz?

327
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,020
Since Lin is joining,

328
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,780
I'll sign up too.

329
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,980
It's time for everyone to see

330
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,180
the true strength of Xi Hai's Aaron Kwok.

331
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,660
I'll sign up too.

332
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,940
Me too.

333
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,020
I'll sign up too.

334
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,380
It's so noisy.

335
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,660
Participate actively.

336
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,300
Thank you, everyone.

337
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,340
I'll take down your names

338
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,860
and do a selection.

339
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,740
After that, I'll announce the results.

340
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,580
I want to sign up too.

341
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,900
Tao Zhu.
Don't you want to give it a try?

342
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,970
One at a time please.

343
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,780
You raised your hands to sign up

344
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,980
right after she mentioned about dancing.

345
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,180
Don't tell me

346
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,420
you're interested in waltz.

347
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,930
I'm really interested in Waltz.

348
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,859
I can see it.

349
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,619
You like Tong Xi.

350
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,730
But,

351
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,980
why didn't Tong Xi agree immediately

352
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,569
after you volunteered yourself to sign up?

353
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,420
She didn't expect
so many students would sign up too.

354
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,100
Otherwise, she would have jumped on it.

355
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,700
Let's play ball.

356
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,220
Hello. Hui Ting?

357
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,620
Why did you call me?

358
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,500
You know what?

359
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,100
My school will be having
a sports day soon.

360

[Stop and listen to me now.]

361
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,940

362
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,100
to our art club.

363
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,210
She is so pretty.

364
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,340
She's also in her first year.

365
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,340
Our art club has always been
full of talented people.

[Wei Ze played the piano for her.]

00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,180
We have to hang up.

377
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:13,620
Goodbye.

378
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,060
Senior has gotten himself
a new White Swan.

379
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,620
Senior?

380
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,260
White Swan?

381
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,100
You're acting weird recently.

382
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,410
Why didn't you agree immediately
when I volunteered to sign up?

383
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,980
I told you I need to do a selection first.

384
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,700
But I'm the first to sign up.

385
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,250
You just ignored me.

386
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,780
Why did you do that?

387
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,860
I don't have a reason.

388
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,170
If you don't give me a good explanation,

389
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,260
I'll follow you around.

390
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,500
Didn't you injure your leg not long ago?

391
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,690
Dancing is tiring.

392
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,660
I'm being caring as your classmate.

393
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,500
That's why I didn't want you to join.

394
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,220
You don't have to thank me, classmate.

395
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,980
Just because of my leg injury?

396
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,980
Instead of asking so many questions,

397
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,570
why don't you show some care
for your goddess?

398
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,620
You gave her your vote.

399

So why are you asking me about it now?

400

Really?

401

Why are you blushing?

404

Really?

405
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,620
Maybe it's because of the hot weather.

406

Tong Xi.

407
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,740
Are we still short of female dancers?

408
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,500

409
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,620
I'm the class monitor.

410
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,500
I should take the lead.

411
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,660
Sure.

It looks like she didn't
do anything wrong.

415
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,180
Wouldn't it be bad if I reject her?

416

I'll let her in.
