00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,470
Qing He had an
unfortunate accident like you had.

170
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,350
Are you having a run of bad luck lately?

171
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,670
Why do you all get hurt so easily?

172
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,270
[Wang Yi Ming: Lin, the transfer student,
White Swan, was assigned to our class.]

173
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,990
[Why didn't you come in the first day of
new semester? Have you read my message?]

174
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,310
[I heard that she won
an international award.]

175
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,710
[And she shot a drama before.]

176
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,230
[She really is a White Swan.]

177
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,510
[Come to school early tomorrow.]

178
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,310
Nice shot, nice one.

179
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,910
Nice shot!

180
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:10,910
Good one, good one.

181
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,470
Throw it, throw it.

182
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,510
Nice shot.

183
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,870
Come on, throw it, throw it.

184
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,230
Go on.

185
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,350
Go on.

186
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,710
Nice shot.

187
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,590
That's a good one, you look so cool.

188
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,350
You're indeed the best small forward
of the basketball club.

189
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,270
What are you guys up to?
You've been acting weird today.

190
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,270
Nothing, nothing.

191
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,310
You're in form.

192
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,310
I guess I am in good form today.

193
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,710
Ming, can you do us a favour?

194
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,350
What favour?

195
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,630
It's about

196
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,830
the new student in your class,
the White Swan.

197
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,230
Can you get her
contact information for us?

198
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,580
Here, Ming. Put on a cloth.

199
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,310
So you won't catch a cold.

200
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,070
Come on.

201
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,909
Let's go.

202
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,110
Phone number, Weibo or QQ.

203
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,110
Anything.

204
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:58,909
No way.

205
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,660
They've let me scored several times.

206
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,430
Wang Yi Ming,

207
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,390
you really are something.

208
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,230
Just because they let you score,

209
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,750
you're trying to trick
the goddess for her contact?

210
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,790
Do you even know her well enough

211
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,900
to ask for her contact information?

212
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,270
I...

213
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:26,660
Do you know them?

214
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,230
They're from drama club.

215
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,870
Do you think

216
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,830
I have an secret admirer there?

217
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,510
They are looking at me.

218
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,830
How am I going to turn him down later?

219
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,020
Aren't you just in charge of
floor sweeping in drama club?

220
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,990
Why would someone admire you?

221
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,750
Tao Zhu,

222
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,070
you have a new student
in your class right?

223
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,470
Can you give me her contact information?

224
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,150
President.

225
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:02,470
President.

226
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:02,950
President.

227
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,150
Asking a girl

228
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,750
for another girl's contact information,

229
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,350
are you sure 
this is the way to talk to a girl?

230
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,150
You're right, President.

231
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:09,950
See you, President.

232
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,310
Senior Xu Ao.

233
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,990
Ignore them.

234
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,590
Want some squid?

235
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:17,950
I bought some extra sticks.

236
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,190
Thank you, Senior.

237
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,430
Afternoon, Senior.

238
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,470
Sorry again that I couldn't make it

239
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,550
to the press conference.

240
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,070
But I heard that Guru Qing He

241
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,660
was also absent due to his injury.

242
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,710
I think there should be a
new arrangement soon.

243
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,990
I hope we can go together again when
there is another book signing event.

244
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,790
I wonder if Senior Wei Ze

245
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,550
would find it interesting

246
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,910
if he knew how I am treated here.

247
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,540
Are you that pleased to be in my class?

248
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,470
You must be Tong Xi.

249
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,540
Hello, Mr. Xu.

250
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,350
Okay, let's start our class.

251
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,510
Stretch your leg.

252
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,230
Good.

253
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,510
Two, three, four, move.

254
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,190
[That was only my first day in class,]

255
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,670
[the practice was already so intense.]

256
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,390
[Isn't this]

257
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,670
[the same place I used
to go when I was a kid?]

258
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,540
[This is the mint garden left by grandpa.]

259
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,710
[It's so beautiful.]

260
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,590
[Let's hang out here
more often from now on.]

261
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:03,920
[Qing He Fans Club, group notification.]

262
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,670
[Evening, Guru.]

263
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,990
[I saw the news.]

264
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,230
[The other day I was still upset that]

265
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,190
[I would miss your
first public book signing,]

266
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,510
[I thought I was going to
regret it for the rest of my life.]

267
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,670
[I didn't expect that]

268
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,630
[you would change the date tacitly.]

269
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,830
[Don't worry,]

270
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,310
[I'll be there on time next time.]

271
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,910
[Today is my first day in the new school.]

272
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,820
[I had an extraordinary experience.]

273
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,270
[It's the first time I knew
what it was like to be noticed.]

274
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,830
[I suppose you're accustomed to it.]

275
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,670
[But for someone like me, who is ordinary]

276
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,790
[and has no idea about
what to do in the future,]

277
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,900
[it made me really nervous and excited.]

278
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,300
[I decided to view White Swan as my goal,]

279
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,590
[I'll work hard to train myself]

280
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,940
[and become a real goddess.]

281
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,870
[After all, everyone is so enthusiastic,]

282
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,630
[how could I let them down?]

283
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,270
Why is it broken? I'd better fix it.

284
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,830
Someone lives here.

285
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,070
Oh my, look at her teeth.

286
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,550
She's so pretty.

287
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,550
I want to watch her movie.

288
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,510
She's so pretty.

289
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,350
White Swan is stunning.

290
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:06,870
What are you doing?

291
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,110
That's a real goddess.

292
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,750
Her hair is so smooth.

293
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:10,870
Look.

294
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,710
[Even if we're bullying him,]

295
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,190
[is it any of your business?]

296
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,350
[Of course it is.]

297
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,270
[Everyone in the alley knows that]

298
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,230
[he's my fiance.]

299
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,430
[I'm going to marry him in the future.]

300
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,150
What do you call this?

301
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,550
A food for the eyes.

302
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,110
Food?

303
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,550
It's feast. How many times
have I corrected you on that?

304
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:46,830
Your leg hasn't recovered yet.

305
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,790
What happened to your face?

306
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,350
It's fine.

307
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,270
Based on my observation,

308
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,710
our White Swan here is

309
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,950
really friendly, despite she's a goddess.

310
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,150
Goddess, you meant her?

311
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,470
[Climb up, I'll give you a hand.]

312
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,470
[They say you can see the sea]

313
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,550
[from the highest position.]

314
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,070
[Tong Xi, come down here.]

315
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,190
[It's too dangerous.]

316
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,460
[How is it dangerous?]

317
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,470
[The ladder is so short.]

318
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,550
[It's only dangerous for those]

319
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,430
[who are smart but clumsy.]

320
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,470
[Forget it.]

321
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,310
[You're so no fun.]

322
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,550
[I'm going to keep climbing.]

323
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,430
[I'll leave you alone.]

324
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,310
[Lin Nan Yi, you're useless.]

325
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,270
[Tong Xi, why would you
want to marry this loser?]

326
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,670
[Run!]

327
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:31,750
[Stop there!]

328
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,110
[I'm going to beat you all
until you're handicapped.]

329
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,710
[Tong Xi, you can't keep doing this.]

330
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,110
[You're a girl.]

331
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,270
[You can't always
solve problems with violence.]

332
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,110
[It's not that I want to 
solve problems with violence,]

333
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,150
[but they keep picking on you,]

334
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,110
[I have to stand up for you, right?]

335
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,510
[What will happen to you
when you grow up?]

336
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,990
[If you do this when you're adult,]

337
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,590
[you'll be arrested by the police.]

338
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,310
[Well, I'll just let you]

339
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,660
[protect me when we grow up, okay?]

340
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:13,910
Where are you going?

341
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,150
I need to talk to her.

342
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,270
Sit down.

343
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,830
I get it.

344
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,510
You can't resist the temptation
to talk to White Swan.

345
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,510
But don't you think
your appearance will be

346
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,710
obtrusive in such a beautiful view?

347
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,700
[About how to become a goddess.]

348
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,110
[Find a book.]

349
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,070
[The recommendations are]

350
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,310
[Marguerite Duras, Eileen Chang, Sanmao.]

351
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,620
[In Search of Lost Time]

352
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,550
[Find a window.]

353
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,910
[Choose the best lighting time]

354
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,470
[to show your perfect backlit side face.]

355
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,270
[Your hair is important.]

356
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,430
[Keep it loose, let the
wind blow through it.]

357
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,630
[The highlight is]

358
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:58,990
[smiling a little]

359
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,830
[to show the pleasure of reading.]

360
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,150
[I've been reading for 20 minutes.]

361
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,069
[That should be enough.]

362
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:18,710
You...

363
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,270
So this seat is taken.

364
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,110
Hello there, new classmate.

365
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,870
She's a goddess?

366
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:41,830
Don't be silly.

367
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,310
I've known her since childhood.

368
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:46,030
She had beaten every boy in the alley.

369
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,310
Is she that scary?

370
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,030
Not just scary,

371
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,630
she's simply terrifying.

372
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:57,870
Look at my leg,

373
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,030
I was hurt

374
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,030
because she pushed me to the ground

375
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,270
at the station two days ago.

376
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:03,510
Scary, right?

377
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:27,990
Tong Xi,

378
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,950
were you looking at Lin Nan Yi?

379
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,270
No.

380
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,230
I have nothing to be afraid of.

381
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,910
Since I've come this far,

382
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,590
if he dares to say anything,

383
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,590
I'm going to let him

384
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,310
wait and see.

385
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,950
Lin Nan Yi?

386
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,870
Is Lin Nan Yi

387
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,860
the student who just came today?

388
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,430
What were you looking at just now?

389
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,190
I was just looking around.

390
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,630
Alas! Beautiful place
doesn't stand forever.

391
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,270
A grand banquet doesn't reappear.

392
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:12,550
The Orchid Pavilion Gathering is gone,
the Golden Valley Garden is in ruins.

393
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,350
Can anyone translate this for me?

394
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,630
Tao Zhu, I pick you.

395
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,070
You seem to be really relishing

396
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,710
the Teng Prince's Pavilion Preface.

397
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,630
Come on, translate this to our class.

398
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,710
Sir, let me do it.

399
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,220
Go ahead, Tong Xi.

400
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,500
This means that

401
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,190
a beautiful place doesn't last forever.

402
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,110
It is difficult to reunite again
even for a grand party.

403
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,980
The spectacle of Orchid Pavilion Gathering

404
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,550
has become history.

405
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,070
Even the Golden Valley Garden
has turned into a ruin.

406
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:01,910
Well done.

407
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,590
Excellent.

408
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,590
Tong Xi has obviously
prepared for the class.

409
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,470
Well done.

410
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,550
Sit.

411
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,310
Come on, others.

412
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,150
Come on, everyone,

413
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,990
I want you to write this down.

414
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,030
This poem

415
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,700
expresses the author's

416
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,070
sentimental and sensitive feelings.

417
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,470
Take it out and share it with me.

418
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,110
I...

419
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,420
Good for you.

420
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,270
You like English so much?

421
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,510
If your English teacher saw this,

422
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,630
he's going to be really happy.

423
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,660
A fresh start in the new semester.

424
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,550
Your spirit is encouraging.

425
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,630
However,

426
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,390
your next class is English class.

427
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,510
You can work hard on it later.

428
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,030
Come on, let's carry on with the class.

429
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:29,310
Thank you for helping me, Goddess.

430
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:32,230
Goddess, do you like Guru Qing He too?

431
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,780
[Are you a fan of Guru Qing He too?]

432
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,470
I don't really read comic.

433
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,310
I usually read Shakespeare

434
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,430
and Tagore's books.

435
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,030
I thought

436
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,190
you're a fan of Guru Qing He like me,

437
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,350
that's why you helped me just now.

438
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:52,990
By the way,

439
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,550
kids, listen up.

440
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,390
I just remember that

441
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,150
our blackboard bulletin contest

442
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,710
is coming up next week.

443
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,540
You all know the rules, right?

444
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,110
Anyone who is interested,

445
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,870
please come and register with me actively.

446
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:03,430
All right?

447
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,470
It's time to show your true talent.

448
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,230
It's now or never.

449
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:07,910
Okay?

450
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,110
Okay.

451
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,270
Blackboard bulletin contest?

452
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,510
Ignore him.

453
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,150
The contest is held once a month.

454
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,590
The winner is always
the student from Class 5,

455
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,070
who wants to enrol in
Central Academy of Fine Arts.

456
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,870
Everyone else who registered always
received "Thanks for Participating".

457
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,910
By the way, Goddess,

458
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,960
[Early Summer]

459
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,430
debut work of Guru Qing He,

460
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,110
a super popular new comic artist,

461
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,630
are you interested?

462
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,990
It's not about romance,

463
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:36,030
its themes are family love and warmth.

464
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,940
I guarantee that you'll fall in love
with it once you start reading.

465
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,870
Take a look at it.

466
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,790
Oh please,

467
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,870
I know every word in it, okay?

468
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,310
Sure.

469
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,790
I'll take a look when I have time.

470
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,270
Don't wait.

471
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,350
How about tonight?

472
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,790
Since we couldn't go to
Guru Qing He's book signing event,

473
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,510
we can pilgrimage at Blue Elephant.

474
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,550
Blue Elephant?

475
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,190
Sister Mi Ya,

476
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,190
since when did you keep a cat in the shop?

477
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,390
You mean Monroe, she came here yesterday.

478
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,830
Why do I feel like
I saw this cat before?

479
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,340
Young lady,

480
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,790
this is your first time here, right?

481
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,390
Hi, Sister Mi Ya.

482
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,550
I'm Tong Xi.

483
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:21,870
Hi.

484
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:24,350
You can make yourself
at home here from now on.

485
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,110
Make yourself comfortable.

486
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,990
Monroe, what a strange name.

487
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,150
I came up with it.

488
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,350
Is it not good?

489
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,550
Look,

490
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,550
it has a mole on the corner of its mouth.

491
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:38,870
Oh no,

492
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:40,950
Andre is calling me.

493
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,030
He can't find out that I'm keeping a cat.

494
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,820
Otherwise, he would misunderstand
that I don't love him anymore.

495
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,470
Knock yourself out.

496
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,070
Andre?

497
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:58,700
Andre has been Mia's boyfriend

498
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,670
from when she was studying in France.

499
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,110
She said he's some sort of

500
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,030
CEO of a multinational corporation.

501
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,750
Sister Mi Ya has been waiting for him.

502
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,350

And of course,
it's the only one in the city.

What do you think?

510
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,150
It's not bad compared
to Da Cheng, right?

511
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,110
It's nice indeed.

512
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,670
I think so too.

513
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,750
Look around first, Tong Xi.

514
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:35,710
I'll go order us some beverages.

I don't remember the exact time.

562
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,630
Around 7 p.m. or 8 p.m.

What a good date.

564
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,750

567
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,350

Xi Hai Town.

569
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,030
You were born in Xi Hai Town?

570
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,150
I transferred to Da Cheng
when I was in elementary school.

571
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,670
So we came from the same hometown.

572
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,230
Now I feel closer to you.

573

Listen,

574
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:26,790
but

575
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:27,710
where did you live?

576
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,270
Xi Hai is a small town.

577
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,430
I never saw you when I was a kid.

578
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,270
That's right.

579
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,510
I lived in Xi Zhao Alley.

When she was a kid,

581
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:40,470
she was a shy girl.

582
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,710
She rarely left home.

583
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,590
There was no way you would know her.

584
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,310
That's right, I was shy.

585
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,670
You guys knew each other
when you were kids?

586
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:01,750
Yes.

587
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,150
Then why did you

588
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,550
ask me about Lin Nan Yi's name before?

589
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,350
I thought you've never met each other.

590
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,150
I... I...

591
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,790
We barely knew each other.

592
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,510
Besides, it's been a long time.

593
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,630
I didn't even remember
her name when I saw her.

594
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,630
Lin Nan Yi.

595
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,870
Yes, he seemed familiar to me.

596
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,390
And I couldn't remember his name just now.

597
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,350
And I thought you were peeking at

598
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,220
Wang Yi Ming with the mirror last time.

599
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,430
You gave me a fright.

601
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,630
are you talking bad about me 
behind my back again?

602
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,670
No.

603
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,470
I was just thinking that

604
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,790
why would such a beautiful girl

605
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:43,990
have such a bad taste in man?

606
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,030
No, she doesn't.

607
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,590

610
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:50,990
What do you mean by that?

611
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,030
Why did you tell them that

612
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,230
we knew each other when we were kids?

613
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,630
I'm begging you.

614
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:55,780
I have a weak heart.

615
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,030
Can you please watch your mouth?

616
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,710
You hate me for knowing too much

617
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,230
and I would ruin your image
as a Goddess, right?

618
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,270
Fine.

619
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,270
But I just don't get it.

620
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,670
What's the reason with all these pretense?

621
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,430
Why can't I pose as a goddess?

622
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,470
I've been a common girl when I grew up.

623
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,670
I want to try this feeling now.

624
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,350
What's wrong about it?

625
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:15,550
Also,

626

why can't you treat me

627

628
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,830
Stop asking me so much

629
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,950
and stay out of my business.

630

Why is he working in Blue Elephant?

640
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,110

work part-time now?

641
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,070
Forget it.

642
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:15,550
What does it have to do with me?

I'll stay out of his business,

644

650

00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,030
I'm going to the supermarket.

656
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:49,870
Do you need anything?

657
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,470
I have enough space here.

658
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,190
It's fine, thank you.

659

You don't have to be 
so polite with me, Tong Xi.

660

By the way,

661
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,710
there were boys asking me

662

for your contact information today.

663
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:00,870
But I turned them down.

664
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:01,910
They are not handsome.

Thank you, Tao Zhu.

00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:08,790
You're so kind.

00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,430
I'm going now.

672
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,380
[Someone actually asked
for my contact information.]

673
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,870
This is actually happening on me.

674
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,550
I wonder if they are handsome boys.

675
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,390
Tao Zhu is so insensible.

676
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,550
I wish that ticking time bomb is not here.

677
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:40,710
What do you want?

678
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:41,870
You scared me.

679
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,710
I want to talk to you.

680
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,790
Tong Xi.

681
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:49,670
Mr. Jia.

682
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,230
I've been looking for you.

683
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,070
How may I help you?

684
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:51,670
About

685
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,140
the blackboard bulletin contest,

686
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,630
I think that since you
came back from Da Cheng City,

687
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,830
your idea, creativeness and insights

688
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:58,830
are certainly different.

689
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,510
So I figure that

690
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,910
maybe you should give it a try.

691
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,590
I'm not very good at
decorating the blackboard,

692
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:09,590
Mr. Jia.

693
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,070
No pressure.

694
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,390
The most important thing
is to participate in it.

695
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,670
Of course,

696
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,270
if you don't know how to draw at all,

697
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,310
I won't force you.

698
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:20,980
But if you think you're okay,

699
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,150
we can give it a try.

700
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,190
Right, Nan Yi?

701
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,510
Yes.

702
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,020
I believe Tong Xi can handle it.

703
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,230
It's settled then.

704
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:34,710
Good.

705
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,030
This is great.

706
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:48,030
Misfortunes never come alone.

707
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,310
High school's bag is heavier
than the junior high school's bag.

708
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,670
High school's bag is heavier than
the junior high school's bag indeed.

709
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,390
What are you trying to say?

710
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,070
I'm just talking.

711
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,580
You're still mad at me?

712
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,190
You pushed me into fire pit

713
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,270
when Mr. Jia talked about
the contest in the afternoon,

714
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,350
I'll hold onto it forever.

715
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,270
How would I know you can't draw?

716
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,670
How wouldn't you know I can't draw?

717
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,070
You did all my art work for me

718
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,950
when we were kids.

719
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,510
It's not like we're close.

720
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,300
We're just common classmates.

721
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,350
How would a common classmate know

722
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,670
you can't draw?

723
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,790
I knew it.

724
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,910
You're getting back at me, aren't you?

725
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,150
How about this?

726
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,350
Let's each take a step back.

727
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,990
Stop being so harsh on me.

728
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,550
This is who I am, a petty person.

729
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,190
And I don't need you to help me draw.

730
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,110
Draw?

731
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,190
It's so frustrating.
