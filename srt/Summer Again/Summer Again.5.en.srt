2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,190
This is the situation now.

3
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:03,790
Not much time for a tough job.

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,830
I stepped on my dance partner
and he is injured.

5
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,590
Tong Xi is very unhappy about it.

6
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,390
Nan Yi, please help me.

7
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,750
My hands are full.

8
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,510
Sorry.

9
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,140
Never mind. I thought
you signed up initially.

10
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,270
I don't understand

11
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,220
why Tong Xi is always targeting you.

12
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,630
She said you injured your leg.

13
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,270
You should be the substitute.

14
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,830
That'll make everyone happy.

15
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,310
She didn't target me.

16
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,270
But time is short.

17
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,710
I might slow her down.

18
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,030
About the substitute,

19
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,670
I'll consider it.

20
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:40,870
Nan Yi,

21
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,220
you haven't

22
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,110
mentioned Tong Xi to me before.

23
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,350
She left Xi Hai
while in elementary school.

24
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,020
You two hadn't met.

25
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,870
Why did you say this suddenly?

26
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,750
I remember

27
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,750
you helped me a lot before.

28
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,390
I was really grateful to you at that time.

29
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,629
Didn't we agree that
we won't mention it?

30
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,990
Call me my full name from now on.

31
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,750
I've something to do upstairs.

32
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,190
I'll go up first.

33
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,110
I have no money.

34
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,030
Go find a way yourself.

35
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,110
I don't know where to get 100 yuan.

36
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,789
Xiao Wan, just tell your teacher

37
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,980
you'll be a few days late.

38
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,550
Your brother just paid school fees.

39
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,910
Forget it!

40
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,950
Tell the school you are broke!

41
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,430
It can kick you out if it wishes to.

42
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,750
Ni Xiao Wan.

43
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,870
I'm fine. Leave me alone.

44
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,590
You'll be late for school. Hop on!

45
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,110
I don't want to go to school.

46
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,540
What's wrong?

47
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,550
Book expenses.

48
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,310
I'm the only one in class
who hasn't paid.

49
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,950
Here. Take my money.

50
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,940
I can't take your money.

51
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,350
Take it. Consider it a loan.

52
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:33,710
Take it.

53
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,910
What if I can't pay you back?

54
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,630
You have good grades.

55
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,670
Why don't you let me copy your homework?

56
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,380
You have excellent grades too.

57
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,510
Do you have to copy my homework?

58
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,350
I don't like doing homework.

59
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,710
Let's go. It's late.

60
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,430
Hop on!

61
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,310
Lin Nan Yi,

62
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,470
can you keep this a secret?

63
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,030
Sure. Copying homework

64
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,110
is a secret.

65
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,510
Hop on.

66
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,030
Sit tight.

74
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,540
Hello.

00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,510

00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,110
What major crisis?

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,149
[You need one more guy for the waltz.]

79
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,630
I was wondering why the class monitor

80
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,070
was so confident.

81
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,350
So, she asked you to be a dance partner.

82
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,350
[Why not consider it?]

83
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,030
Let me tell you. I was so busy

84
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,950
with the choreography I had to skip meals.

85
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,150
So, what if I need a guy?

86
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,350
[I'll find a guy in class]

87

[who can pivot turn.]

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,390
How do you feel this time?

89
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,670
Is it easier?

90
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,150
It's still so difficult.

91
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,990
Can we drop

92
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,350
the three pivot turns?

93
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,220
I really don't understand the turns.

94
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,860
I can't do it.

95
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,270
The turns are easy.

96
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,310
If you drop them
we have nothing to show.

97
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,270
We haven't learned dancing before.

98
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,270
White Swan, we can't live up

99

Tong Xi, please make it simpler.

101

Class monitor, dance with us this time.

102
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,270
We're hard press for time.

103
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,070
I don't have a dance partner.
It's so embarrassing.

104
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,790
Let's practise.

105
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,060
Mr. Jia.

106
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,350
Look, you are so young and beautiful.

107
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,590
We only have a few days more.

108
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,910
I don't have a partner yet.

109
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,270
We don't move in unison.

110
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,550
What should our class do?

111
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,870
You should've gotten a reserve earlier.

112
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,630

Mr. Jia.

115
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,190
They don't know how to dance.

116
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,630
They must train and synchronise.

117
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,550
This is normal.

118
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,790
Don't be too stressed out.

119
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,430
I'm sorry, Mr. Jia.

120
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,110
I wasn't thinking.

121
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,470
No big deal. I think it's fine.

122
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,230
If not, you can march in formation.

123
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,150
Ni Xiao Wan has experience in this.

124
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:50,190
Marching is boring.

125
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,310
Our class should excel.

126
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,790
We agreed from the start.

127
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,470
Nan Yi's idea is good.

128
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,230
Mr. Jia,

Alright.

133
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,270

Why is Lin Nan Yi always on her side?

139
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,350
You think so too?

140
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,270
Yes.

141
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,870
During voting,

142
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,540
he wasn't on our side.

143
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,510
Today, Tong Xi

144
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,390
almost agreed to do the marching.

145
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,550
He stepped forward and objected.

146
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,430
Xiao Wan, weren't you on good terms

147

148
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,070

00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,620
you two drift apart?

Five, da da.

155
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,070
Why don't you dance?

156
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,750
I'm tired.

What are you up to?

167
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:53,430
Come here.

168

Mr. Xu said
you were absent-minded in class.

169
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,910
You can't go on like this!

170
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,310
Our school is holding a sports meet.

171
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,700
The other classes
are marching in formation.

172

00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,030
I have been practising this recently.

174
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,190
Mum, do you want to watch?

175
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,230
Don't show me first.

176
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,310
I overestimated myself.

177
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,110
At my level, I can't motivate the class.

178
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:39,640

181

Nothing. Just exercising.

182
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,750
Is it because of Tong Xi?

183
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,270
I heard Tao Zi said

184
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,110
your class will perform a ballet
at the ceremony.

185
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,190
Tong Xi is teaching everyone the dance.

186
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,550
Did she invite you?

187
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,950
She will invite me soon.

188
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,590
You're so confident.

189
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,910
You're right.

190
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,750
You've practised in advance.

191
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,950
You look like you're on standby.

192

When Andre comes,

196
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,510
we can dance together.

197
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,110
However,

198
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,470
since you know the dance,

199
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,780
why not tell Tong Xi directly?

200
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,430
She must be devastated by now,

201
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,230
and desperately needing help.

202

It's not yet time for me to offer myself.

203
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,550
Besides, I've gotten her a reinforcement.

204
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,870
Reinforcement?

205
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,630
Do I have to get Lin Nan Yi

206
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,870
to try the new dance?

207

Yes.

Are you sure?

214

The new dance must succeed.

215
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,070

the whole room smells fresh.

321
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,500
Seeing Mentha reminds me

322
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,910

333
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,270

334

00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,030
Lately, I've been studying
plaster statues,

sketches, and so on.

341
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,710
But I still want to draw a real person.

342
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,950
Because I think

343
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,260
people share feelings with each other.

344
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,430
Like when I'm drawing now.

345
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,070
The light is good.

346
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,910
I can feel your mood.

347
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,750
That's why I can accurately express

348
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:35,910
this picture.

349
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,030
It'll appear more vivid.

350
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:39,550
By the way,

351
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,950
I told you I am good at drawing.

352
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,630
But I don't think I'm that good.

353
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,510
Tong Xi.

354
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,030
Hello.

355
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,940
[Tong Tong, Mr. Xu said
you skipped ballet class.]

356
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:11,990
[What happened?]

357
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,510
I am going.

358
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,750
Right now. Immediately.

359
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,420
Bye bye.

360
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,710
All these years,

361
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,950
how many chances did I give you?

362
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,590
You aspired to be a writer,

363
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,790
begged for my support,

364
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,430
and I agreed.

365
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:04,990
But what about you?

366
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,630
You were bent on

367
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,990
writing, year after year.

368
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,190
Now you're even more absurd.

369
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,310
For your unlikely literary dream,

370
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,670
you quit the job I found

371
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,670
for you.

372
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,670
I am sorry.

373
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,590
If you're sorry,

374
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,030
why are you fighting for
Tong Tong's custody?

375
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,950
You can't even feed yourself.

376
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,150
Do you know how much
her ballet class costs?

377
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,630
How much is her tuition class?

378
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,430
No matter what,

379
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,590
I won't give up Tong Tong.

380
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,740
What a joke!

381
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,670
What's the use of insisting?

382
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,070
You can't feed yourself.

383
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,990
I'm taking Tong Tong to Da Cheng

384
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,390
the day after tomorrow.

385
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:50,510
Lin Nan Yi, I really have to leave.

386
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:54,750
Come see me off the afternoon
after tomorrow.

387
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,630
Let's go! Stop looking!

388
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:03,510
Xiao Hui!

389
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,590
[Maybe we were too young at that time]

390
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,710
[and did not understand.]

391
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,510
[I thought]

392
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,150
[I had feelings for him.]

393
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,110
[I thought]

394
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,150
[he felt more or less the same.]

395
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,750
[But he didn't see me off that day.]

396
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,510
[He didn't write back.]

397
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,030
[I thought he was my best friend.]

398
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,990
[The one I wanted to marry.]

399
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:39,070
[But obviously he didn't think so.]

400
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:42,110
[The most precious friendship
in my childhood]

401
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,260
[was the same as the Mentha necklace.]

402
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,950
[Discarded.]

403
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,630
Forget it.

404
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,030
Forget about these things.

405
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,950
So many years have passed.

406
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,910
Refusing to see him now

407
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,430
is not a good idea.

408
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,060
But

409
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,590
why does he live alone?

410
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:11,870
Forget it.

411
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:15,150
We are just ordinary classmates.

412
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,310
I don't care about him.

413
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,710
Hope he doesn't care about me.

414
00:27:53,170 --> 00:28:00,210
[Call from Sister Jia Jia,
editor in charge of Aimei Comics.]

415
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:06,760
[Connected to Sister Jia Jia,
editor in charge of Aimei Comics.]

416
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,470
[Guru Qing He,]

417
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,070
[I saw the character you sent]

418
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,910
[and the story.]

419
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,670
[The new manga is great.]

420
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:09,070
[The characters and storyline
are very exciting.]

421
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,510
[At first glance,]

422
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,500
[my heart skipped a beat.]

423
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,190
I'm creating the detail drawings.

424
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,230
I'll work harder and faster.

425
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,670
[Great!]

426
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,630
[Meanwhile, I'll prepare to go online]

427
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,110
[and the early promotion.]

428
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,670
[By the way,
what's the new manga's title?]

429
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,590
[What is it?]

430
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:26,870
Mentha.

431
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,430
How do you feel?

432
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,270
Is it still hard?

433
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:04,980
No.

434
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,860
Lin Nan Yi.

435
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,630
This is our new substitute Lin Nan Yi.

436
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:09,710
Let's welcome him.

437
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,230
Together.

438
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:57,710
This

439
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,310
is bigger than what Tao Zi

440
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,350
has.

441
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:05,950
Take it.
