[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,670
Give me a few minutes.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,710
Let's summarise our lesson just now.

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,790
Personally, I'm quite satisfied.

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,870
All of you have done well.

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,310
Although there was
a small hiccup in the end,

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,030
we can't blame Tong Xi.

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,270
After all, it was a critical moment.

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:23,910
She did quite well.

10
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,870
Mr Jia, the senior teacher
has asked for you.

11
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:28,590
Okay.

12
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,470
Okay. That's it.

13
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:33,150
It has already passed.

14
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:35,590
Go back to your self-study.

15
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,310
The senior teacher wants to see him.

16
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,230
Looks like he's going to be fired.

17
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,790
It's Tong Xi's fault.

18
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:02,670
Tong Xi.

19
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,220
Do you have a resentment against me?

20
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,500
What do you mean?

21
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,270
I proposed for you to draw

22
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:14,789
because I think that
you are very good at drawing

23
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,430
and can earn us some points
in the open class.

24
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,300
Even if you hate me,

25
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,230
you shouldn't draw like that.

26
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,190
I didn't do it on purpose.

27
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,190
If you didn't do it on purpose,

28
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,510
why did you do that?

29
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,710
All of us know

30
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,350
how important that class to us

31
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,190
and to Mr Jia.

32
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,070
And with your drawing skills,

33
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,780
just like the blackboard poster,

34
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,270
it's impossible

35
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,229
that you would do so badly.

36
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,950
[I'm sorry, Mr Jia.]

37
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,229
[You must think that I'm so pretentious.]

38
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:51,270
[I'm glad that]

39
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,789
[you are telling me about this.]

40
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,789
[I won't call it pretentious.]

41
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,190
[I believe that in your conscious mind,]

42
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,750
[you are just trying to be better.]

43
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,550
[Your mindset is right.]

44
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,190
[But your method is wrong.]

45
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,830
[Tong Xi, if you want to become better,]

46
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,510
[you need to build your foundation first.]

47
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,139
[Improve yourself.]

48
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,310
[Not turning yourself
into another person.]

49
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,670
[If even you yourself]

50
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,670
[deny your true identity,]

51
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,350
[what's the point?]

52
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,550
[If you do that,]

53
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,190
[you'll lose even
the most basic happiness.]

54
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,230
[Do you understand?]

55
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,780
Tong Xi.

56
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:26,430
Tong Xi, say something.

57
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,190
Why did you do that?

58
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,550
You should at least
give everyone in the class

59
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,750
an explanation.

60
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:33,670
Ni Xiao Wan.

61
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,190
Tong Xi

62
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,950
didn't deliberately do that.

63
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,030
She has never said that she can draw well.

64
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,590
And she was not ready.

65
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,190
You can't just

66
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,390
blame her for everything.

67
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:45,950
That's not right.

68
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:49,990
I don't know how to draw.

69
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,150
I asked another student
to do draw the blackboard poster

70
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,030
for me.

71
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,270
I already tried my best

72
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,030
in the open class.

73
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,390
I'm apologise for

74
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,190
ruining the open class.

75
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,470
But I didn't do it on purpose.

76
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,550
And I don't resent you.

77
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,300
Why didn't you tell us about it then?

78
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,310
When our blackboard poster
got the first prize,

79
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,870
you acted like it was you who drew it.

80
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,350
You acted like
you were great in everything.

81
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,550
You were lying.

82
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,340
Tong Xi was not lying.

83
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,100
You don't call that lying?

84
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,829
We don't even know what else

85
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:32,990
she's lying about.

86
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,350
Maybe that mysterious letter

87
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,670
is written by her too.

88
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,900
That's right.

89
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,230
I'm the one who wrote
the mysterious letter.

90
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,230
It was stolen and posted on Tieba.

91
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,750
Tao Zi took the blame for me.

92
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,590
I'm not a White Swan.

93
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,590
I'm just a normal person.

94
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,350
When I just transferred here,

95
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,110
I got too carried away
by your expectations.

96
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,110
I was too vain

97
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,230
and that got me here.

98
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,550
There's no conspiracy

99
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,100
and I don't have any ill intention.

100
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,670
I regret acting like a White Swan.

101
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,670
I had to tell more lies
to make this lie plausible.

102
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,310
And I've dragged my friends into it.

103
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:16,860
I'm sorry.

104
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,430
I'll accept your critiques.

105
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:22,790
But most importantly, I want to be myself.

106
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,950
What a joke.

107
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,830
So, all this while,

108
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,110
you were just acting.

109
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,550
You want to be yourself?

110
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,870
If it wasn't because of
that drawing incident,

111
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:35,230
she'll continue to act.

112
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,540
She's the one who wrote
that mysterious letter?

113
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:39,790
Looks like I have to find it
and read it again.

114

117
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,400
[Adapted from Huo He's comic,
"Mint Love".]

118
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,270
Look. She's not even eating now.

119
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,790
Lin, think of a solution.

120
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,910
Let's take a look first.

121
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,430
Let's talk later at Blue Elephant tonight.

122
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:19,750
Don't discuss about it here.

123
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,390
What's happening now?

124
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,790
I still don't understand.

125
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,070
Stay confused then.

126
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,030
Listen.

127
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,670
Later, mind your words
in front of Tong Xi.

128
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,710
I know. I'm not a fool.

129
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:55,830
Why are you crying?

130
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,030
I'm sad.

131
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,870
The image that I've spent
so much effort on

132
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,870
is ruined just like that.

133
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,270
Look at you.

134
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,030
I asked you to find an excuse.

135
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,870
But you exposed yourself instead.

136
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,470
I've thought about it for a long time.

137
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,700
I don't want to lie anymore.

138
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,870
That's not lying!

139
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,430
Yes, Tong Xi.

140
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,630
You've always been like this

141
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,830
after coming back to Xi Hai.

142
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,190
That's lying.

143
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,910
Although I don't have any bad intention,

144
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,340
it's still a deception.

145
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,550
Besides, not only we deceived others,

146
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,750
we've deceived ourselves too.

147
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,990
I didn't deceive others.

148
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,150
I'm always like this.

149
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:37,870
Tong Xi, what's wrong with you?

150
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,790
There's nothing wrong with me.

151
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:43,150
I've just finally understood.

152
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,550
We are just normal.

153
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,070
I was too carried away
by other's expectation

154
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,030
after coming back.

155
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:52,950
And I used their misunderstandings
to act like a know-all.

156
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,750
Before this, I tried to force myself

157
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,230
to be a cute, gentle

158
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,860
and lovable White Swan.

159
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,510
But I really can't do it.

160
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,150
That's not the real me.

161
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,020
We are just normal.

162
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,390
I'm not happy at all to
chase after the persona

163
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,590
that does not belong to me.

164
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,190
So now, I'm ready

165
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,310
to accept my true self again.

166
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,670
Have you ever thought that

167
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,950
they might not like you anymore

168
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,470
after you change back to yourself?

169
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,910
Tong Xi, have you never considered that

170
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,510
after changing back to yourself,

171
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,750
we'll disappear?

172
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,590
I'm sorry.

173
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,430
But I still want to start anew.

174
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,909
No matter they like me or not,

175
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,300
at least, I am honest to myself.

176
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,750
I'll be at ease

177
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,430
and I'll be happy.

178
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,020
Besides, I believe that

179
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,310
real friends will not abandon me.

180
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,590
Up to you then.

181
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,390
I'll leave now.

182
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,430
Let's not meet each other again.

183
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:25,990
Let's not meet each other again.

184
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,299
You've given me a fright.

185
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,710
When did you come back?

186
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,270
It has been a while.

187
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,670
We didn't disturb you because
you were spacing out.

188
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,110
I was spacing out just now.

189
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,030
What day is it today?
Why are there so many dishes?

190
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,180
Tong Xi.

191
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,070
You don't have to
act tough in front of us.

192
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,790
You can talk to me.

193
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,430
Or you can just cry.

194
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,750
Don't be like this.

195
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,070
Why should I cry? I'm not upset.

196
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,990
I'm so relieved right now.

197
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,430
I don't have to act like
a White Swan anymore.

198
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,110
I can finally be myself.

199
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:13,950
Really?

200
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,150
But you are not eating anything.

201
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:16,990
Who said that I'm not eating?

202
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,940
I forgot to bring my meal card today.

203
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,310
Since you've gotten your food,

204
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,630
who can lend me your meal card?

205
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,070
I want to eat braised pork belly.

206
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,420
Where's my meal card?

207
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,990
Thank you.

208
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,750
When did you find out about
Tong Xi's real personality?

209
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:39,870
A long time ago.

210
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,500
Way earlier than you.

211
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,030
Why didn't you tell me?

212
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,870
What should I tell you?

213
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,750
I didn't think that it's an issue.

214
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,540
The people in our class have
too much time in their hands.

215
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,710
They should just spend time on
their social media

216
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,590
or watch some dramas.

217
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,350
Why are they so obsessed with this?

218
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,470
Moreover,

219
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,910
so what if Tong Xi

220
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,590
tried to create a good image of herself?

221
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,550
She brought honour

222
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,660
to the class, right?

223
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,860
She went out of her way
to help our classmates, right?

224
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,390
Say something.

225
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,630
I know that you are outraged
on behalf of your best friend.

226
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,700
But why are you hitting me?

227
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,350
Outraged?

228
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,150
You used the wrong idiom.

229
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,470
Wait.

230
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,070
I've just realised this.

231
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,150
So, the mysterious letter online

232
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,380
is not written by you.

233
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,140
You took the blame for Tong Xi, right?

234
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,230
So, the letter that I received is...

235
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,870
Don't think too much.

236
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,110
That letter is for Senior Xu Ao.

237
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,470
But I don't dare to give it to him.

238
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,830
And I accidentally
put it inside your book.

239
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,590
Alright now. You can leave first.

240
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,590
I have to go to the drama club.

241
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:34,740
Where are you going?

242
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,710
I'm going to the drama club.

243
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,470
I want to ask him about the selection.

244
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,230
Xiao Wan, you are right.

245
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,350
Tong Xi

246
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,550
was so good at everything.

247
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,870
But it was just an act.

248
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,950
Finally, she has been exposed today.

249
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,110
It feels so good.

250
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,590
But she admitted to it.

251
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,270
She even confessed about
that mysterious letter.

252
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,510
If I were her,

253
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,110
I would be so embarrassed.

254
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,710
Be patient.

255
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,470
This is not the only thing that
she is lying about it.

256
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,740
Really?

257
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,470
What else?

258
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,070
(What do you plan to tell them
after the open class?)

259
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,630
(I'll tell them the truth one by one.)

260
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,230
(I'll start with the blackboard poster.)

261
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,830
(Even if you don't tell them,
they won't know that)

262
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,030
(you are not the one
who drew the blackboard poster.)

263
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,820
(Moreover, everyone has shared the honour)

264
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,140
(of getting the first prize
for the poster.)

265
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,830
(No matter they know it or not,)

266
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,550
(I don't plan to deceive them anymore.)

267
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,630
(The blackboard poster,
mysterious letter,)

268
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,510
(and also the rumours about me)

269
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,550
(getting the international award
and dancing with the celebrities

270
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,750
(when I was in Da Cheng.)

271
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,070
(I'm going to tell them the truth.)

272
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,110
(Okay, let's go.)

273
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,390
What else?

274
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,990
Tell me, Xiao Wan.

275
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,670
Xiao Wan.

276
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,710
Where is Senior Xu Ao?

277
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,830
He's not here. I think he went out with

278
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,510
Junior Xiao Qing.

279
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,630
I won't disturb you then.

280
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,870
Don't go. I have things to ask you.

281
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,750
I heard that the White Swan
in your class has been exposed.

282
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,470
No. Stop spouting nonsense.

283
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,350
She's not.

284
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,990
The mysterious letter on Tieba

285
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,150
is written by you to Senior, right?

286
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,430
But I heard that

287
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,150
White Swan confessed to
writing that letter herself.

288
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,830
Yes. Who's the sender and
who is the receiver?

289
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,750
Why is it such a mess?

290
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,070
You are so well-informed.

291
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,670
Tao Zi, if it's not written by you,

292
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,790
you'd better explain it to Senior.

293
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,470
We were looking forward

294
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,740
to the love story between the two of you.

295
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,750
But in the end,
it's just a misunderstanding.

296
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,990
I think he's quite disappointed.

297
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,780
There's nothing to explain.

298
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,390
Continue with your rehearsal. Bye.

299
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,630
[Blue Elephant]

300
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,110
So cold.

301
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,670
Why did you drink so fast?

302
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,310
It feels good.

303
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,910
Don't tell my mum about it.

304
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,470
She'll lecture me if
she finds out that I drank this.

305
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:24,870
I got it.

306
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,020
I should write a letter now

307
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,230
and send it to Xi Hai Theatre

308
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,070
to report you for drinking
high-calorie drink.

309
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,150
There aren't many people here now.

310
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,110
No need to act anymore.

311
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:41,910
Are you really okay?

312
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,870
You've asked me so many times.

313
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,750
I'm really okay.

314
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,990
I'm feeling great now.

315
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,710
Now that this has come to an end,

316
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,950
I feel so relieved.

317
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,150
I never thought that

318
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,870
you can be so honest
in front of my classmates.

319
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,190
You told them everything that
you should say

320
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,350
and almost everything that
you shouldn't say.

321
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,270
I'm really worried about you.

322
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,230
I don't want to hide anymore.

323
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,150
This is my fault anyway.

324
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,470
Moreover,

325
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,390
even if I don't tell them,

326
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,590
someone will eventually expose me.

327
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,070
So, it's better for me to expose myself.

328
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,710
Are you talking about Ni Xiao Wan?

329
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,430
Of course. Who else?

330
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,630
Do you think I'm imagining it?

331
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,830
I feel that she's always targetting me.

332
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,670
I don't think it's simple jealousy.

333
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,950
Before you came,

334
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,630
she was the most popular girl
in the class.

335
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,910
Maybe after you came here,

336
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,590
you stole her limelight.

337
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,100
Maybe that's the reason.

338
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,510
That's the only reason?

339
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,830
What else?

340
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,190
Nothing.

341
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,710
I think you are very close to Ni Xiao Wan.

342
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,590
There are so many guys in our class.

343
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,350
But she's only close to you.

344
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,150
We are the only two from our middle school

345
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,830
who are in the same class.

346
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,350
So, we are familiar with each other.

347
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,670
But we are not close.

348
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,390
I think I'm closer to you.

349
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,510
Nonsense. I'm not close to you.

350
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,070
If you think that she's targetting you,

351
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,350
I'll talk to her now.

352
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,630
No need to do that.

353
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,470
This is between us girls.

354
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,790
You are a guy, stay out of this.

355
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,670
Jealous?

356
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,230
Impossible.

357
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,790
It's impossible that
I'll be jealous of her.

358
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,790
[Sorry for the bold guess.]

359
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,900
[It seems like you really
care about his relationship]

360
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,390
[with that girl.]

361
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,990
[No. I just don't understand]

362
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,110
[why they are so close.]

363
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,910
I just don't understand

364
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,310
why she wants to target me.

365
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,350
I think this is not that simple.

366
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,270
[Forget it, let's not talk about this.]

367
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,270
[I don't want to bring
any negativity to you.]

368
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,830
[Okay.
Let's talk about other things then.]

369
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,270
[Besides these things,]

370
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,390
[your friendship with that friend]

371
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,230
[is not affected, right?]

372
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,470
[Is there anything that
he can do to help?]

373
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,900
[He has already helped me a lot.]

374
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,790
[I don't want to trouble him anymore.]

375
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,550
[Actually, he's really a great friend.]

376
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,350
[Although when I just came back,]

377
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,710
[I used to hate him.]

378
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,270
[Hate? Why?]

379
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,710
[Actually, it's just a misunderstanding.]

380
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,150
[After I left my home town,]

381
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,190
[I wrote a lot of letters to him.]

382
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,630
[But he didn't return any of my letters.]

383
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,310
[He didn't contact me at all.]

384
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,069
[When I met him again,
he acted like nothing has happened.]

385
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,750
[I was so mad at him for that.]

386
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:16,030
[At first, I thought that
I'll feel awkward when I meet him.]

387
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,869
[After that, I found out that he moved.]

388
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:20,150
[So, I think he didn't receive my letter.]

389
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,750
Tong Xi wrote letters to me?

390
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:38,060
[Caller: Editor of Aimei Comics,
Sister Jia Jia]

391
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,270
Sister Jia Jia, what is it?

392
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,470
[I want to discuss the schedule with you.]

393
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,870
[I talked to you about]

394
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,550
[your individual signing event, right?]

395
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,030
[The publisher wants to]

396
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,350
[set the date on the fourth of May.]

397
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,750
[So, what do you think?]

398
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,030
Fourth of May?

399
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,830
So fast?

400
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,150
Mum, I'm back.

401
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,950
Why are you so late today?

402
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,990
I was tutoring Ke'er.

403
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,470
You have time to worry about others

404
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,820
but not your brother.

405
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,070
We've brought you up for nothing.

406
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,750
But I tutor him every day.

407
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,470
I've always tutored him.

408
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,150
Who allowed you to use this?

409
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,750
Why are you shouting?

410
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,710
I'm the one who let him.

411
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,790
Your brother's pen is broken.

412
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,190
I saw that you have one in your drawer.

413
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,990
So, I let him use it.

414
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,750
But that is my pen. How could you...

415
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,350
Besides, that is my prize.

416
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,390
How could you touch my thing

417
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,790
without my permission?

418
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,350
It's just a pen.

419
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,580
Do you have to be so offended?

420
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,430
It's not a big deal.

421
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,390
That's right, Xiao Wan.

422
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,590
Let your brother use it first.

423
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,110
I'll buy you another one tomorrow.

424
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,550
I'm sorry, sister.

425
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,910
I didn't know.

426
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,910
I can't use this?

427
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,070
You can.

428
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,070
Use it.

429
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,310
No one appreciates it anyway.

430
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,590
We are going to get heatstroke
in Lu Yi Ran's PE class again.

431
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,630
We'd better read comics, right?

432
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,220
You read the seventh chapter
yesterday, right?

433
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:49,590
I'm sorry.

434
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,470
Let's go. My stomach is in pain.

435
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,140
What kind of a person are you?

436
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:55,910
It's okay.

437
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,110
Let's go.

438
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:05,110
Look at Tong Xi.
Before this, she was so arrogant.

439
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,270
Now,

440
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,070
she didn't say anything
when we ran into her.

441
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,030
Do you know why?

442
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,100
Why?

443
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,070
Because no one will fawn over her now.

444
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,310
Besides Tao Zhu and
the others in our class,

445
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,270
no one else wants to hang out with her.

446
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,670
I think we shouldn't do that.

447
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,870
She has already apologised.

448
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,150
Besides, it's not like

449
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,230
she did something evil.

450
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,070
Look. She's the one who recommended

451
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,430
this sunscreen to me.

452
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,710
Why are you defending a liar?

453
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,470
Let me tell you.

454
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,230
Not only she can't draw,

455
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,630
before this, she even said that

456
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,070
she represented Da Cheng to

457
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,750
participate in
a ballet competition abroad?

458
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,310
But actually,
she was not in the list at all.

459
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,390
Besides, I think she didn't even join

460
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,630
the school's art club.

461
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,470
Moreover...

462
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,110
What's wrong? Are you okay?

463
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,660
My stomach is in pain.

464
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,310
What's wrong?

465
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,830
My period is here.

466
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,390
My pants are wet.

467
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,870
Did you bring a pad?

468
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,310
Yes. But it's in my bag.

469
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:08,180
But we have a physical test
in the next PE class.

470
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,940
What should I do?

471
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,550
I'm doomed.

472
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,470
Tong Xi.

473
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,310
This is bad, Ke'er.

474
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,710
Tong Xi was here just now.

475
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:28,950
This is my dance pants.

476
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,350
It's clean.

477
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,630
Thank you, Tong Xi.

478
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,310
Change into it first.
We have a physical test later.

479
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,270
Don't think that I'll change my mind

480
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,030
about you just because of this.

481
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,990
I still hate you.

482
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,630
This is not a huge favour anyway.
Think whatever you want.

483
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,230
I did something wrong.

484
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,590
It's only right for you to hate me.

485
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,750
But I don't care.

486
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:49,990
You can hate me all you want.

487
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,990
Look at how arrogant she is.

488
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,630
She gave you a hand. Stop saying that.

489
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,630
It's time for our class and
our physical test.

490
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,710
Are you going to wear it or not?

491
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,380
I don't need her help.

492
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:09,990
Let's start.

493
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,980
In this class, the boys
will do the 1500-metre run.

494
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,270
Passing mark is six and a half marks.

495
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,790
The girls will play volleyball.
The passing score is 35 hits.

496
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,950
I'll give you 20 minutes to get ready.

497
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,430
Quiet.

498
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,830
Boys. Go and get ready on the track.

499
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,390
For the girls, five girls in a group
and one ball each.

500
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,270
Take turns to play.

501
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,430
You are dismissed.

502
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,350
I'll group up with you.

503
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,310
Wait for me here.

504
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,230
Let me get a ball.

505
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,190
Jie Ping.

506
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,100
Are you going to use this ball?

507
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,750
If you are not using it,
can you lend it to me?

508
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,350
Tao Zi, you don't have a group?

509
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,750
How about you join us?

510
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,430
I'm grouping up with Tong Xi.

511
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,070
But we don't have a ball.

512
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,070
I'll take this then.

513
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,150
You are using it?

514
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,830
Yes. Although I'm not using it now,

515
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,390
I don't want to let a liar use it.

516
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,710
Who are you calling a liar?

517
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,030
The person you are defending.

518
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,190
Let me tell you. Stop this nonsense.

519
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,190
Enough. Let me join you.

520
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,830
We have an extra ball anyway.

521
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:26,990
Jie Ping.

522
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,710
Where are you going?

523
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,910
Aren't you coming?

524
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,230
I want to group up with Xiao Wan.

525
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,510
Let's go.

526
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,830
Tong Xi really knows
how to win other's hearts.

527
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,110
Unlike Sun Jie Ping,
she won't win me over that easily.

528
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,190
Xiao Wan, I'm on your side.

529
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,470
Don't worry. Be patient.

530
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,350
I won't let her have a good life here.

531
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,230
Thank you.

532
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,230
Mr Xu.

533
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,430
You are going to dance with this?

534
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,580
I lend my dance pants to someone.

535
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,430
Tong Xi.

536
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,150
Although you are not
standing on a stage yet,

537
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,740
as a dancer,

538
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,030
you have to

539
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,230
have respect for dancing.

540
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,350
There are a lot of things that
you can't skimp on.

541
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,310
Change your pants.

542
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:55,350
Five, six, seven, eight.

543
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,510
One, two, three, four.

544
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,430
[Marie told Marcus that]

545
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,630
[when we were young,
we wanted to be everyone]

546
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,550
[except ourselves.]

547
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,820
[I used to think that too.]

548
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,390
[But now, I think that]

549
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,830
[having the courage to be yourself]

550
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,230
[is the proudest thing you can do.]

551
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,270
Not bad.

552
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,380
You have a good energy flow today.

553
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,710
I think I'm in a good form today too.

554
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,990
The emotions of a dancer will affect

555
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,070
her dance.

556
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,550
Looks like you are in a good mood today.

557
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,390
Maybe it's because

558
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,470
I've finally found peace recently.

559
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,550
I feel relaxed today.

560
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,750
Since you are in good form,
let's continue.

561
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,630
Five, six, seven, eight.

562
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,190
One, two, three, four.

563
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,350
I know.

564
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,260
I'm on the way to the Blue Elephant now.

565
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,020
Tong Xi will still be
at school for a while, right?

566
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,350
Nothing.

567
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,350
I'm not eating anything.

568
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,030
You are so annoying, Wang Yi Ming.

569
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:03,990
I have to hang up.

570
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:15,910
Tao Zhu.

571
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,990
Why are you here?

572
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,390
I saw you when I was over there.

573
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,070
So, I came here to greet you.

574
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,220
By the way,

575
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,150
how is it going with the roles
in the drama club?

576
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:28,830
Do you have any updates?

577
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,030
We haven't decided on the roles yet.

578
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,790
But I think

579
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,740
we have no suitable role for you.

580
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:43,910
Why?

581
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,790
Didn't you tell me that

582
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,270
you have an empty role for me?

583
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,980
During planning, our story and roles

584
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,950
are constantly changing.

585
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:52,910
Besides,

586
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,060
it's not entirely up to me.

587
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,750
I have to discuss about it

588
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,830
with the other recruiters as well.

589
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:00,070
So, you have to wait.

590
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,430
Your two orders of shaved ice are ready.

591
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,470
Thank you.

592
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,550
I want two squids.

593
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,350
A normal and a spicy one.

594
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:12,950
Okay.

595
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,270
Your senior is quite different.

596
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,070
He likes someone who can sweep.

597
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,630
Senior, do you have any other things

598
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,070
that you want to explain to me?

599
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,550
What should I explain to you?

600
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,270
If that's the case,

601
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,590
I won't be going to the drama club then.

602
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,390
I don't want to continue
to sweep the floor anymore.

603
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,390
Sure. Up to you.

604
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,190
Boss, give me a piece of tissue paper.

605
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,310
Okay.

606
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,390
Happy holidays. Cheers!

607
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,910
Cheers!

608
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,270
What's wrong with all of you?

609
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,340
The holiday is just around the corner?

610
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,350
Aren't you excited?

611
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,110
Aren't you happy?
Aren't you looking forward to it?

612
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:21,710
Wait.

613
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,630
You've stolen my line.

614
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,030
But what is so happy about holiday?

615
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,390
Don't you have tuition class to attend to?

616
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,710
No.

617
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,270
Besides, I've already finished
all of my ballet lessons

618
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,190
beforehand.

619
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,310
Besides, I lied to my mum

620
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,350
about going to Da Cheng
for a ballet exhibition.

621
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,350
And she agreed.

622
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,430
I'm going to go to Da Cheng soon.

623
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,430
I'm going to meet Guru Qing He.

624
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,230
Are you really going to go there?

625
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,270
Of course. I've already booked the ticket.

626
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:45,940
Now, I just have to wait.

627
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,510
So, you are going to meet Senior Wei Ze?

628
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,190
Why did you mention that?

629
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,710
Come with me.

630
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,270
I want to go too.

631
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,230
I want to get away from
this sea of sufferings too.

632
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,710
Come with me then.

633
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,950
How about this? I'll pay

634
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,710
for your goodies,

635
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,710
posters and souvenirs.

636
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,430
What do you think?

637
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:15,710
What do you think?

638
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,790
[Guru Qing He, here I am again.]

639
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,380
[Let me tell you a good news.]

640
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,750
[I can attend your signing event now.]

641
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,630
[I'm all set.]

642
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,590
[I'll make sure that you can feel]

643
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,790
[my passion towards you.]

644
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,910
[The signing event has a tight schedule.]

645
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,140
[No need to come all the way here.]

646
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,870
No.

647
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,110
This is too obvious.

648
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:17,500
[Calling: Editor of Aimei Comics,
Sister Jia Jia]

649
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,030
[Guru Qing He.]

650
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,070
Sister Jia Jia.

651
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,190
Does this event

652
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,950
have to be a face-to-face singing event?

653
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,190
[Of course.]

654
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,190
[Your fans will be there just to see you.]

655
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:32,100
Can I don't show my face?

656
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,750
Maybe I can stay inside a black room

657
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,990
or cover my face with
a curtain or something?

658
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,990
[We are in a modern era.]

659
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,310
[Why do you want to hide your face?]

660
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:45,470
[Don't worry. It'll be in a bookshop.]

661
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,430
[The atmosphere will be relaxing]

662
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,910
[and it's not a big event.]

663
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,710
[There'll just be some booths
to make it interesting.]

664
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,950
[Don't be too nervous.]

665
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:54,750
Okay.

666
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,670

00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:09,710
Okay.

837
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,030
Thank you.

838
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:12,670
Thank you.

839
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,230
Is it nice?

840
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,150
I want to get a cup of juice.

841
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,110
Okay. I want an iced grape juice then.

842
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:24,790
Thank you.

843
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,270
Okay. You can continue to shop here.

844
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:26,870
Don't get lost.

845
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,830
Move aside. Thank you.

846
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:52,590
Move aside. Thank you.

847
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,350
Mine is bigger than you.

848
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:18,950
You hit me?

849
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,910
Mine is big too.

850
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,870
Even if you hit me to death today,
mine is still bigger!

851
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,550
Mine is bigger!
