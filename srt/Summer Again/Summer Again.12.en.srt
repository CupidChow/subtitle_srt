What are you looking at? 
Will you be more careful?

5
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,260
You...

6
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,190
Are you okay?

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:44,980
I'm okay.

Your arm is injured.

Hold on, I have plaster in my bag.

10

Let me get it for you.

I almost fell down.

An Ultraman in blue?

I injured my arm.

Are you trying to kill me?

21
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,990
Guru Qing He, are you ready?

However, how do I cover up my face?

26
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,430
Why does this drawing

27
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,270
look alike you?

28
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,710
You think so too?

29
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:00,950

Today, I'm the host of the fan meeting.

34
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,950
I'm an amateur in this.

Please tolerate with me.

Speaking about Guru Qing He,

37
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,470
you must be thinking that

38
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,270
he's mysterious and low profile, right?

39
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,790
-Yes.
-Yes.

40
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,870
This is

41
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,590
the first time he
makes appearance in public.

00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,670
All right, without further ado,

43

let's welcome

Why does he come out 
with a chicken head?

48
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,340
Guru Qing He doesn't have a good taste.

49
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,790
No doubt Guru Qing He looks weird

50
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,230
but I bet he has a nice voice.

51
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,670
Hello, everyone. I'm Qing He.

Goodness, I've lost faith.

I can't tell if Qing He 
is from northeast

00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,310
or Taipei.

55
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:50,670
Well...

64
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,230
from different channels.

65
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,150
How should I put it?

66
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,710
I'm not really good at responding.

67
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,190
Therefore, 
I have never revealed my identity.

68

69

We love Guru Qing He for who he is

00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,390
Just write

175
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,910
"Wishing you a lifetime of happiness".

176
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,270
Okay.

177
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:53,750
Guru.

178
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,670
Your hands are so good looking.

179
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:00,710
Take it.

180
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,990
Guru, I have another one.

181
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,390
I would like to give it to my friend.

182
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,900
Will you sign it?

183
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,390
Hurry up!

184
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,350
Everyone else is still waiting.

185
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,230
Everyone else is still waiting.

186
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,270
We're still waiting.

187
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,070
That's right. Hurry up.

188
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,950
Please be patient.

189
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,710
What is your friend's name?

190
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,150
His name is Lin Nan Yi.

191
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,110
It's N-a-n and Y-i.

192
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,150
Guru, just write

193
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,990
"Be Happy. It's good to have you around".

194
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,350
Guru Qing He?

195
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,390
Photographer, you may take the photo now.

196
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,070
Sure.

197
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,630
Guru, 
can I hug you while taking the photo?

198
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,350
That's not a good idea.

199
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,900
If everyone does the same,

200
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,390
Guru Qing He will be shy.

201
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,470
I want to do the same.

202
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,710
Three, two, one.

203
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,970
[Summer Again]

204
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,910
All right, the fan meeting

205
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,600
[Summer Again, Episode 12
Goodbye, Guru Qing He]

206
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,540
has come to an end.

207
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,410
[Adapted from Huo He's comic, 
"Mint Love".]

208
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,710
That's fast.

209
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,550
Time flies.

210
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,830
However, before the meeting ends,

211
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,310
Qing He has another surprise

212
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,430
for everyone.

213
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,470
During the signing,

214
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,390
he has actually left a secret number

215
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,510
on the title page.

216
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,830
Have you found out about it?

217
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,220
It's 26.

218
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,510
The coming session

219
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,950
is lucky draw.

220
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,150
Please welcome the crew.

221
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,790
In the coming session,

222
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,660
Qing He will draw a lucky number

223
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,830
from the box.

224
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,470
The lucky fan

225
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,710
can come up to the stage
to interact with Qing He.

226
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,830
Furthermore, Qing He

227
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,180
will fulfil your request.

228
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,990
You can ask for anything!

229
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,870
Is it for real?

230
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,750
So long as the request is reasonable.

231
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,350
What does that mean?

232
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,670
All right, let's begin.

233
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,070
Please let it be 26.

234
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,740
Let it be 26.

235
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:40,870
Let it be 26.

236
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,950
Who is that lucky fan?

237
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,170
[25]

238
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,910
It's 25!

239
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,750
It's 25!

240
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,110
Senior, it's you!

241
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,910
Me?

242
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,710
It's 25.

243
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,470
I think the number belongs 
to the only male fan at the scene.

244
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,470
Please come to the stage.

245
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,870
I don't have any request.

246
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,630
Since he doesn't have any request,

247
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,510
can I exchange the number with him?

248
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,390
I have a request!

249
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,830
You're not allowed to do so.

250
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,470
Since he refuses to go on the stage,
please draw another number.

251
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,460
Please draw another number.

252
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,030
Please draw another number.

253
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,710
Please do me a favour, senior.

254
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,870
Please take a look at Qing He.

255
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,150
I just have one request.

256
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,390
Even if I see his face, 
you don't get to see him.

257
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:15,830
It's okay.

258
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,830
Just take a look

259
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,900
and describe to me.

260
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,150
It doesn't matter how he looks like.

261
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,310
I will imagine his face 
based on your description.

262
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,030
Sure, come here.

263
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,470
Please come to the stage.

264
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,350
I'll ask a question 
on behalf of other fans.

265
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,470
Do you have any request?

266
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,910
I would like to take a look 
at Qing He's face.

267
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,110
What?

268
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,550
My wish is to check out Qing He's face.

269
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,030
No way.

270
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:48,470
Let him take a look!

271
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,310
It's okay, it's just him.

272
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,670
Just show him your face.

273
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,950
No way, things will go wrong.

274
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,550
No way.

275
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,500
All right.

276
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,670
All right, stop shouting.

277
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,830
It's only for him.

278
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,710
No matter how hard you shout,
you can't see Qing He's face.

279
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:04,470
All right.

280
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,190
Let's get help from the crew.

281
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,190
Don't be scared.

282
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,190
It's not me.

283
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,230
I'm just realizing my friend's wish.

284
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,750
I'm sorry.

285
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,390
All right, Qing He,

286
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,230
please remove your mask!

287
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,500
What do you think?

288
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:06,820
Have you seen his face?

289
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:08,710
I've seen his face.

290
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,340
He's seen his face.

291
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,110
All right, 
I'll ask a question for all the fans.

292
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,430
Is he handsome?

293
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,470
Yes.

294
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:17,710
He's handsome.

295
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,470
That's great.

296
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,310
Thank you for your participation.

297
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,230
All right.

298
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,070
The meeting has come to the end.

299
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,390
How was it, senior? Did you see his face?

300
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,470
[It's really come to an end.]

301
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,900
Is he really handsome?

302
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,070
How does he look?

303
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,830
He looks...

304
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,110
He looks familiar.

305
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,070
He's friendly.

306
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,230
[All right, thank you, everyone.]

307
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,110
Friendly?

308
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,830
He looks friendly?

309
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,710
What does that mean?

310
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,830
Why don't we leave from the main entrance?

311
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,190
For someone who is so experienced,

312
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,150
Qing He won't 
leave the building from the main entrance.

313
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,270
When I was running after celebrities,

314
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,580
they usually leave 
from the back door or side entrance.

315
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,630
I did some research.

316
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,710
There is only one side entrance 
in the book store.

317
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,670
Guru Qing He will leave the bookstore
from this entrance for sure.

318
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,150
I don't really fancy 
running after celebrities.

319
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,150
I think it's kind of immature.

320
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,830
However, to be honest, the fan meeting

321
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,470
gave me surprises.

322
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,470
Senior.

323
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,260
Why don't you go home first?

324
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,630
You don't have to force yourself.

325
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,950
I don't mind waiting alone.

326
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,660
It's okay. I'm already here.

327
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,710
I'll keep you company.

328
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,300
I'm sorry.

329
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,060
It's mainly because

330
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,630
it's not easy to see Guru Qing He.

331
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,790
Actually, you see him every day.

332
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,590
Senior, what did you say?

333
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,430
Nothing.

334
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,790
Let's wait for him.

335
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,070
Senior,

336
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,310
will you please hold my bag?

337
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,630
I really need to use the washroom.

338
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,350
Thank you, senior.

339
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,270
It's such a coincidence.

340
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,110
It's unnecessary.

341
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,430
I'm not a fool.

342
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,390
If it's possible,

343
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,190
please don't tell Tong Xi about it.

344
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,510
Lin Nan Yi?

345
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,100
Why are you here?

346
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,190
Thank you, senior.

347
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,750
Why do you come to Da Cheng?

348
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:08,109
Are you here to buy stuffs
for Sister Mi Ya?

349
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,670
Why didn't you tell me?

350
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,869
I was running errands.

351
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,550
I didn't have the chance to tell you.

352
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,470
Is it?

353
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,310
Why are you here?

354
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,150
Didn't you say that 
the fan meeting would be held here?

355
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,390
I was running errands nearby.

356
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,270
I'm curious how your idol looks like.

357
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,310
I went to the wrong door.

358
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,390
Yes, the driver who sent you here

359
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,390
had dropped you off at the wrong place.

360
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,110
This is the side entrance.

361
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,950
The main entrance is over there.

362
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,070
No wonder.

363
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,590
You came here by taxi?

364
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,830
Your effort has gone in vain.

365
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,310
It's ended.

366
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,270
I bet Guru Qing He has left.

367
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,070
It's so unfortunate.

368
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:55,990
You're right.

369
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,910
It's not easy to see my idol.

370
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,280
[Blue Elephant]

371
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,950
Here, pick whichever you like.

372
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,950
My goodness.

373
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,950
You got so many Qing He's merchants.

374
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,670
Splurging for Guru Qing He

375
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,670
is my duty.

376
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,350
Open it.

377
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:27,790
Sign...

378
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,430
Tong Xi!

379
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,630
You're my super best friend!

380
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,430
My goodness.

381
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,630
It's coming from Guru himself!

382
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,310
Did you sacrifice your own slot for me?

383
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:40,830
Don't worry.

384
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,990
Wei Ze gave his to me.

385
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,990
He told Guru Qing He 
to write "To Tong Xi".

386
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,030
So, everyone of us has one now.

387
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,310
I'm relieved.

388
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,310
It's a limited edition

389
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,470
signed by Guru Qing He.

390
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,790
You must keep it well.

391
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:00,590
Got it?

392
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,430
Thank you.

393
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,430
What kind of attitude is that?

394
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,030
I can't be more grateful to Guru Qing He

395
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,670
for granting me a treasure.

396
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,350
Don't forget to read it.

397
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,470
Wang Yi Ming.

398
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,510
Why didn't you take anything?

399
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:23,830
No, I...

400
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,230
Look at the keychain.
It's totally your thing!

401
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,390
Take it, put it on your bag.

402
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,790
-Take it.
-No...

403
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:29,750
Just take it.

404
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,020
Tao Zhu, pick one.

405
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,310
I like this.

406
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,420
[To Qing He's only girlfriend's 
bestfriend, Tao Zi]

407
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,410
[Wishing you a lifetime of happiness]

408
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,470
You're here to study at my place.

409
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,430
However, you ended up reading comic.

410
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,150
My mom doesn't have 
clairvoyance.

411
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,990
She can't see what am I doing here.

412
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,350
By the way, Tao Zi,

413
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,110
when "Mint" is over,

414
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,390
there will be signing event for sure.

415
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,470
Do you want to attend the event with me?

416
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,270
Let me show you

417
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,150
Guru Qing He's charisma.

418
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:03,750
Sure.

419
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,910
Let's go together.

420
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,460
Do you think Qing He 
will put on a dog head next time?

421
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,790
Is this how you perceive your idol?

422
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:12,750
Tao Zi.

423
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,790
All right.

424
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,430
I'm wrong, girlfriend.

425
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,030
Let's talk about something serious.

426
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:23,390
How was the date with Wei Ze?

427
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,110
Did you manage to find back

428
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,910
the heartfelt moments in Da Cheng?

429
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,110
You're saying

430
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,110
as if I'm a bad girl 
who falls in love with someone else.

431
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,070
No, you're overestimating yourself.

432
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,190
You're not a bad girl.

433
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,230
It takes two to tango to be a bad girl.

434
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,350
You're at most

435
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,510
a failure in one-sided love.

436
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,190
To be frank,

437
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,150
I really think that Wei Ze

438
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,630
isn't the same as I imagine.

439
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,390
He's completely different.

440
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,510
What's wrong?

441
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,790
Is he no longer perfect?

442
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,630
After the signing event,

443
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,470
we ran into Lin Nan Yi at the entrance.

444
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,910
Three of us and my other friends

445
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,510
went for dinner.

446
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,470
It's okay, I've made reservation.

447
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,470
Hurry up!

448
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,790
Don't sit here.

449
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,230
You should sit beside Wei Ze.

450
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:13,790
That's right.

451
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:14,790
It's been a while since I last saw you.

452
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,710
I want to sit beside you.

453
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,220
It's too crowded.

454
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:17,990
There's not enough space.

455
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,910
Go to the other side.

456
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,750
Go now!

457
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:21,620
Go.

458
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,070
Nan Yi.

459
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,990
You don't know us

460
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,590
but we spoke on the phone before.

461
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,750
Wei Ze.

462
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,990
When you went to Xi Hai,

463
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,500
did Tong Xi show you around?

464
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,390
I heard that Xi Hai is beautiful.

465
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,140
That's right.

466
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,310
Is Xi Hai beautiful?

467
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,670
I saw it from Tong Xi's story.

468
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,150
It's literally Little Greek.

469
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,630
Wen Zi and I 
plan to go there for a short trip.

470
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,110
That's right.

471
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:55,790
It's not bad.

472
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,910
Xi Hai is just a small town. 
It's not developed.

473
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,950
You don't have to go there on purpose.

474
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,550
Yes.

475
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,350
We don't like having 
too many tourists there.

476
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,790
Not only they will taint the place,
they will also cause inflation.

477
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,830
We're happy with the current situation.

478
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,550
What happened to your hand?

479
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,270
Why is there blood on your shirt?

480
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,470
Nothing.

481
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,630
I injured myself 
when I was running errands.

482
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:24,470
It's okay.

483
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,070
Your wound...

484
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,740
It's such a long wound.

485
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:29,710
You need to take care of it.

486
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,350
Hold on, I have plaster in my bag.

487
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,590
I ordered prawn.

488
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,550
It's really delicious.

489
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,070
Let's talk while we eat.

490
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,110
Here're the chopsticks.

491
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:53,790
Excuse me.

492
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,110
I'm too used to eating by 
the road side in Xi Hai.

493
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,590
I didn't notice that.

494
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,070
This is a restaurant. 
It's not a stall by the road side.

495
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,750
You should take note of that.

496
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,110
We're not outsiders.

497
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,310
Don't be shy.

498
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,310
We don't mind it.

499
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,510
It only took Tong Xi five seconds

500
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,980
to finish off a prawn 
with her front teeth.

501
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:11,790
You haven't seen that, have you?

502
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,470
You mentioned about the Little Greek.

503
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,550
Do you mean Maotouqian?

504
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,510
There are plenty of huts

505
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,710
with blue door, right?

506
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:21,550
Yes!

507
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,750
It's surrounded by the sea.

508
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,950
There are many trees on the island.

509
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,670
I heard that 
it's a nice place to take photos.

510
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:26,830
If you want to take photos,

511
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,700
you can consider Xianren Well
or Windmill Garden.

512
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,310
You may take artistic photos there.

513
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,660
I don't usually find him special.

514
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,070
However, in comparison,

515
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,950
Nan Yi is such a nice guy.

516
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,430
We're talking about Wei Ze.

517
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,590
Why did you mention Lin Nan Yi?

518
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,830
What is there to talk about Wei Ze?

519
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,310
To me, Wei Ze

520
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,630
is negative 100 points!

521
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:54,830
The saying is right.

522
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,470
The ancients are right, 
absence makes the heart grow fonder.

523
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,030
When the distance is gone,
the heart is gone too.

524
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,150
Both seniors are the same.

525
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,870
What happened to you and Xu Ao?

526
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,230
It's been a while since you mentioned him.

527
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,870
Nothing much.

528
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,950
I didn't get the role.

529
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,110
I won't go

530
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,790
the drama club for the time being.

531
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,110
It doesn't matter.

532
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,070
Tong Xi.

533
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:21,750
I think

534
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,630
since you've lost faith

535
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,590
in Wei Ze,

536
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,590
why don't you take your eye away from him

537
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,190
and look around?

538
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,110
You will notice a person

539
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,630
who has been staying by your side

540
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,270
all this while.

541
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,390
He's been sorting out problems for you

542
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,470
and keeping you company.

543
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,030
After going back to Xi Hai,

544
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,990
when you're happy or sad,

545
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,830
he's been there by your side.

546
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,710
It's you, right?

547
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,190
It's Lin Nan Yi.

548
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,150
It's Lin Nan Yi!

549
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,750
Aren't you two childhood friends?

550
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,150
Haven't you thought about it?

551
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,870
Wang Yi Ming and you 
are childhood friends too.

552
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:52,590
Have you thought about it?

553
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,030
Wang Yi...

554
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:03,070
Look, no childhood friend 
will do this to you.

555
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,240
[This pig looks just like you. From Wang Yi Ming]
[Go away. From Tao Zhu]

556
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,180
I've thought it through.

557
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,910
Everything in life may go wrong.

558
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,470
It's better to stick to comic.

559
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,990
I'll pay attention to 
Qing He and only Qing He.

560
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,030
I love Qing He forever.

561
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,310
However, Qing He is a living person too.

562
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,310
Don't you worry that Qing He 
will let you down too?

563
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,190
No way!

564
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,830
That's impossible.

565
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:32,100
[From The President 
of Guru Qing He's Fan Club]

566
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,430
Tao Zi, here come the photos.

567
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,390
What photo is that?

568
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,110
My goodness.

569
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,150
Qing He and I look like a couple.

570
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,590
My mom will come into my room

571
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,590
thinking that we're killing a pig.

572
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:49,110
He's so familiar.

573
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,150
He looks like Lin Nan Yi.

574
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,990
You...

575
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,190
Your eyesight is so bad 
despite your young age.

576
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,540
Even if he's slightly better than Wei Ze,

577
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,750
he's nothing compared to Guru Qing He.

578
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:05,630
Hair?

579
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,950
Guru, just write

580
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,470
"Be Happy. It's great to have you around".

581
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,430
To Lin Nan Yi.

582
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,910
Be happy.

583
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,270
It's great to have you around.

584
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:42,590
If the same thing happens again,

585
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,390
I guess I won't be able 
to hide it any longer.

586
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,390
Tong Xi.

587
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,830
Will you get angry

588
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,700
if you know the truth?

589
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,870
What are you looking at?

590
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,310
Lin.

591
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:17,950
Do you think

592
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,950
Tao Zi is unhappy lately?

593
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,830
Unhappy?

594
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,870
Based on my observation,

595
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,990
ever since the May Day holiday,

596
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,670
she doesn't smile as frequent as before.

597
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,870
This morning alone,

598
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:33,790
she laughed six times lesser than before.

599
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,310
It really bothers me.

600
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,030
I couldn't help 
but to check on her all the time.

601
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,190
I...

602
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:41,390
Lin.

603
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,500
I think something is wrong with me.

604
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:45,710
That's right.

605
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,670
Are you not going to the drama club?

606
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,180
No.

607
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,110
How about your co-curriculum?

608
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,470
Why don't you play basketball with me?

609
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,190
That's not bad of an idea.

610
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,830
In that case, I can throw a basketball

611
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,710
at you from far.

612
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,060
I don't have to do it
in a close distance anymore.

613
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,990
Regardless your aim,

614
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,150
as long as 
you're willing to play basketball,

615
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:14,630
you will enjoy the charisma

616
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:15,470
of basketball.

617
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:16,990
Let me show you how to throw a shot.

618
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,110
Stand properly.

619
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,110
Look at the hoop.

620
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,350
Lift your hand.

621
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,390
Move your wrist and jump.

622
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:27,750
Try it.

623
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,190
That's a nice shot!

624
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,550
You're good, Wang Yi Ming.

625
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,150
Isn't it simple?

626
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,150
Let me try.

627
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,070
Sure, let me get the ball.

628
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:42,350
Here.

629
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,110
That's great!

630
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,750
Wang Yi Ming, am I good?

631
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,790
This is the first time I made a shot!

632
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:55,750
If it's not worth three points,

633
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,070
it's at least a two, right?

634
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,110
What are you talking about?

635
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,910
A shot is worth three points, right?

636
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,550
If the ball doesn't go in the hoop,
it's worth one point, right?

637
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,590
I scored at least two points, right?

638
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,190
I'm such a great player.

639
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,350
Do you know

640
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,390
what line are you stepping?

641
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,230
It's a curved line.

642
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,790
For god sake, she doesn't know
what is a three point line.

643
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,510
Isn't everyone born with the knowledge?

644
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,390
Even if you don't play basketball,

645
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,350
you should have the common sense.

646
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,990
Will you stop nagging?

647
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,750
I have never played basketball.

648
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,550
Furthermore,

649
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,110
you insisted to teach me.

650
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,430
Now, you're losing patience.

651
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,430
Fine, I give up.

652
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,030
Don't.

653
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,510
I'm wrong. I'm sorry.

654
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,510
Please don't get mad.

655
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,830
You're not in a good mood lately.

656
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,430
Wang Yi Ming.

657
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,430
You're behaving weird.

658
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,950
You always talk back.

659
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,030
Now, you're so nice to me.

660
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,830
Have you wronged me?

661
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:01,830
What can I do to wrong you?

662
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,220
That's for the best.

663
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,190
Tao Zi.

664
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,150
Tao Zi.

665
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,230
How does it feel when you fall 
in love with someone?

666
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,670
You fool.

667
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,110
Have you fallen in love with someone?

668
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,070
Who is that?

669
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:20,870
Is she from our class?

670
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,670
Tell me about her.

671
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,430
Say it!

672
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,340
Tell me about her, Wang Yi Ming!

673
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,150
Hold on!

674
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,510
Guru, happy weekend.

675
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,830
I'm saying hi to you 
before my dance class.

676
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,310
I've given your signed comic 
to my friends.

677
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,870
I can't wait to read "Mint" again.

678
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,870
When it's signing event again,

679
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,710
I'll bring him together.

680
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,300
Thank you for your support.

681
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,950
You care about your friend so much,

682
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,230
he must be really happy if he knows.

683
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,510
He must be really happy if he knows?

684
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,470
Is he happy?

685
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,950
Lin Nan Yi

686
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,980
didn't express anything.

687
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:27,950
Forget it.

688
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,270
I'll ask him

689
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,430
after the class.

690
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:36,950
What are you doing?

691
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,070
Let's start the class.

692
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,390
Why is the door open?

693
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,390
Did he forget to close it when he left?

694
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:12,790
Nan Yi, it's milk tea!

695
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:58,390
Tong Xi.

696
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,660
You're Qing He?

697
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,550
Are you kidding me?

698
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,380
Yes.

699
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,020
I'm Qing He.

700
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:14,550
Tong Xi.

701
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,310
I can explain.

702
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:20,870
Stand there!

703
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,270
Do you like reading Qing He's comic too?

704
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,430
When did you come back?

705
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,270
The female lead in "Mint"

706
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,310
looks exactly the same as you.

707
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,470
Looking from the side,

708
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,950
she's exactly like you.

709
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:34,830
Guru.

710
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,550
Do you think 
we're meant to be with each other?

711
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,590
From now on,

712
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:41,590
can I share my life with you?

713
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,510
To you, is he just a good friend?

714
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,910
Perhaps he did that

715
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,950
because he has feelings for you.

716
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,430
Good evening, Guru.

717
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,030
Have you seen my identity number?

718
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,110
From today onward,

719
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:56,430
I'm Qing He's only girlfriend.

720
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,630
Guru, don't you know

721
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,150
poaching is illegal?

722
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,670
Why did you do that?

723
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:04,670
You've stolen my heart!

724
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,270
Guru.

725
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,950
You're the light in my life.

726
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:09,900
You're the living Cupid.

727
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:11,630
You shot an arrow into my heart!

728
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,510
Guru Qing He!

729
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,830
-Tong Xi!
-Don't move!
