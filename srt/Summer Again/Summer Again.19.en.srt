[Adapted from Huo He's comic, "Mint Love"]

4
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,340
Don't you think there's something
going on between them?

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:23,990
Go ask Lin.

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,740
Why would you ask me about that?

7
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,380
I know.

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,310
Know what?

9
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,630
Look,

10
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,950
the romance between Lin
and Tong Xi is blossoming.

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,790
But Class Monitor Ni is
stealing him away from her.

12
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,470
I know this plot.

13
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,710
Ever since Ni Xiao Wan
came back from Beijing,

14
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,430
the same thing has happened every day.

15
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,430
I've gotten used to it.

16
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,310
I had never seen them
hanging out together before.

17
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,910
How come things ended up like this

18
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:49,870
after Community Day?

19
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,190
Beats me.

20
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,430
Perhaps men are all the same.

21
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,230
Men are fickle and prioritize
romance over friendship.

22
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:00,990
I would never do that.

23
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,430
Oh, please.

24
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,069
You're no better than him.

25
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,150
Men are men, but I am me.

26
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,789
Even if I get into
a relationship at university,

27
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:12,590
you'll still be my top priority

28
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,350
since we're brothers who had

29
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,670
gone through thick and thin together.

30
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,590
You're right.

31
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,750
Men are men,

32
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:24,789
but you are you.

33
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,789
It's not the same.

34
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,590
Because you're not a man!

35
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,710
Clams

36
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:36,140
are usually found on the beach,

37
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,710
20m to 50m from the shore.

38
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,870
You won't find them at such a distance.

39
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,830
I'm just digging around

40
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,830
to get the feel of it.

41
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,190
What's going on?

42
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,100
I know you don't like me.

43
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,710
You're prejudiced against me

44
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,470
and you don't trust me at all.

45
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,820
You've got me wrong.

46
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,750
I'm not prejudiced against you,

47
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,780
and trust is not an issue between us.

48
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,550
We just don't get along with each other.

49
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,470
So, if you're here

50
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,670
to talk nonsense with me,

51
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,380
you can forget it.

52
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,310
You'll make things even more awkward.

53
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,270
I'm here to tell you something.

54
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,710
I don't want to cause any misunderstanding
between you and Lin Nan Yi.

55
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,230
He was just helping me out recently.

56
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,550
Helping you out?

57
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,310
What was it about?

58
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:28,620
I can't tell you.

59
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,430
It's our little secret.

60
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,829
Anyway,

61
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,950
Lin Nan Yi is just a good friend of mine.

62
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,630
I know

63
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,430
you're also his good friend.

64
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,590
But nothing says that

65
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,670
each person can only have one good friend,

66
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:46,270
right?

67
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,910
Xiao Wan, you're right.

68
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,910
One person can have many friends.

69
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,390
He's nothing

70
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,350
but one of my friends.

71
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,430
So, you don't need to tell me what's been

72
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,870
going on between you and him.

73
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:17,710
I'm heading out.

74
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:19,829
Where are you going?

75
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,590
The tide's coming in.

76
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,790
I need to draw up the net.

77
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,310
Didn't they inform you that

78
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,910
the students will be at the beach today

79
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,110
and asked you to take a day off?

80
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,470
Besides, Xiao Wan is at the beach too.

81
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,350
Don't go.

82
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,270
It's not good for her.

83
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,870
Why can't I go when she's there?

84
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,829
I'm just going to make her look good.

85
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,790
You handed the application form for her.

86
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,310
You got what you wanted.

87
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,780
So don't go.

88
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,430
Okay, I just want to draw up the net.

89
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,550
If I run into her,

90
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,990
I'll just ignore her, okay?

91
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,430
Bye.

92
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,190
Let's call it a day!

93
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,950
Okay!

94
00:03:58,950 --> 00:03:59,710
Wang Yi Ming.

95
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,020
You got a lot.

96
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,110
I couldn't get the hang of it.

97
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,910
These are all I got.

98
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,230
Come here.

99
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:14,870
Here you go.

100
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,980
I'll wait for you over there, Tong Xi.

101
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:18,589
Okay.

102
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:19,829
Come here.

103
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,950
Monitor, you did so well.

104
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,110
You're good at clam digging too.

105
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,710
She can do everything.

106
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,350
Don't you know our monitor?

107
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,070
She must have prepared in advance.

108
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,710
Tong Xi.

109
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,310
Tong Xi, let's go.

110
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,710
My mum is waiting for me
to prepare a seafood feast.

111
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,430
Tao Zi, hold this for me.

112
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,430
Where are you going, Tong Xi?

113
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,790
Uncle, let me give you a hand.

114
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,060
Thank you.

115
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,630
One, two, three.

116
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,750
Thank you so much.

117
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,230
No problem. It's the least I can do.

118
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,590
You're also the needy student
who came for clam digging, right?

119
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,830
Clam digging is good.

120
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,190
Dig for clams

121
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,310
and you can get full tuition fee waivers.

122
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,350
It's worth it!

123
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,870
Uncle, we can join the charity event

124
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,710
even if we're not needy students.

125
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,070
Do needy students get any subsidies?

126
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,470
A little.

127
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,270
How much do they get?

128
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,940
Ke'er, I'm not feeling well.
I'm going home.

129
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,110
Xiao Wan!

130
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,830
Who gives them the subsidy?

131
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,830
Uncle, will that be all right?

132
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:34,870
Yes.

133
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,150
I should leave then.

134
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,070
Okay, thank you.

135
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,550
Bye, uncle.

136
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,430
Watch your step.

137
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:38,740
Bye.

138
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,110
Bye.

139
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,310
Where's the necklace?

140
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,180
Here comes the clam.

141
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,150
Hey.

142
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,510
This is good!

143
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,540
Dad, your cooking skills are superb now.

144
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,350
Thanks to Tong Tong.

145
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,510
The clams are very fresh.

146
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,590
The food will surely taste good

147
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,670
if you use fresh ingredients.

148
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,070
Enough, stop flattering each other.

149
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,630
Let's dig in.

150
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,230
Let's eat.

151
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,030
Sure.

152
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,790
The prawn tastes good too.

153
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:45,990
Eat more.

154
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,550
You should try it too.

155
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,190
Clams are good for
controlling blood sugar.

156
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,230
Enough.

157
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,150
Come, eat more.

158
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,270
All right, enough.

159
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,950
I never heard that clams are good
for controlling blood sugar.

160
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,070
What are you laughing at?

161
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,430
I was a little bit down

162
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,430
at school today.

163
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,630
But when I came home to see my parents,

164
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,310
I have this feeling of utter bliss.

165
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,470
I want to eat with you every day.

166
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,580
Glad you're happy.

167
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,990
Eat more then.

168
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,430
You can't stop talking even while eating.

169
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,270
Yes.

170
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,070
Hello, Tao Zi. What's up?

171
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,830
[Tong Xi, take a look at the group chat.]

172
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,430
[Big news! There's big news!]

173
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:45,550
Hello?

174
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,990
[Have you seen the group chat?]

175
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,470
No, why?

176
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:51,510
[Big news! There's big news!]

177
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,470
[Monitor is exposed!]

178
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,950
[She applied for the grant aid
for needy students.]

179
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,750
[Really?]

180
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,550
[I thought her family
is running a business.]

181
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,580
[How could she possibly
be a needy student?]

182
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,270
[Her aunt is wealthy, isn't she?]

183
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,470
[Someone overheard this.]

184
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,980
[This is comparable to
the White Swan incident.]

185
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,510
[Stop that.]

186
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,670
[Tong Xi apologised.]

187
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,710
[So don't bring that up.]

188
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,670
[This thing about the monitor]

189
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,820
[is not the same thing as that.]

190
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,110
[Is not the same thing as that.]

191
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,230
[Is not the same thing as that.]

192
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,110
Ni Xiao Wan!

193
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,670
Needy student!

194
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,780
You'd done the job!

195
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,590
When will you receive the subsidy?

196
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,870
Say something!

197
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,429
When will you receive the subsidy?

198
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,350
I'm asking you.

199
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,430
Why are you pushing me?

200
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:48,910
Open the door!

201
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,030
When will you receive the subsidy?

202
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,350
Open the door!

203
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,510
Have you lost your tongue?

204
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,030
Say something!

205
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,910
If you don't want it,

206
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,950
I'll go get it for you.

207
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,190
Jie Ping,

208
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,510
I think of her as my best friend.

209
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,780
How could she lie to me?

210
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,950
Perhaps she's afraid

211
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,180
of people looking down on her.

212
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,470
I'm not looking down on her.

213
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,990
I just feel

214
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:38,990
shocked.

215
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,910
She'd always insinuated that

216
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,270
she came from a wealthy family

217
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,420
and I spread the word for her.

218
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,910
But now,

219
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,820
I'm getting a slap in the face too.

220
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,470
Indeed.

221
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,470
Why can't she just be honest?

222
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:53,630
I know, right?

223
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,670
Good morning,

224
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,590
everybody.

225
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,550
Morning.

226
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,190
Ke'er.

227
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,870
Isn't it normal to apply for grant aid?

228
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,550
Why is everyone making a fuss

229
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,510
over Ni Xiao Wan?

230
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,270
It is normal to apply for grant aid.

231
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,990
But Ni Xiao Wan

232
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,910
has always been the goddess in our class.

233
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,670
You see,

234
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,910
she's smart

235
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,870
and pretty.

236
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,510
I heard her brother is
studying at the top university

237
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,950
and her aunt is running
a business in Da Cheng.

238
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,670
Who would have thought that

239
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,790
a rich and perfect goddess like her

240
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,230
would apply for grant aid?

241
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,110
I feel sorry for her.

242
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,710
She reminds me of my old self.

243
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,070
We put ourselves into this

244
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,430
just to feed our vanity.

245
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,590
It feels awful to be exposed.

246
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,070
I know.

247
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,270
When I think about it,

248
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,310
she was quite okay sometimes.

249
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,470
Didn't she lend us her notes before?

250
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,910
Are you done?

251
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,390
It's you, right?

252
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,030
Cut it out.

253
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,230
Didn't you meet my dad yesterday?

254
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,070
I don't know what you're talking about.

255
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,430
You didn't know that I applied

256
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,790
for grant aid?

257
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,630
So you didn't tell everyone about it?

258
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,190
I knew about it,

259
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,830
but I didn't tell them.

260
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,070
Knock it off!

261
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,270
What are you doing?

262
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,550
Didn't you know about this already?

263
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,110
Get back to class!

264
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,550
I don't know how they know about it,

265
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,990
but I don't gossip

266
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,430
about someone's personal details.

267
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,340
This has nothing to do with me.

268
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:12,910
Tong Xi,

269
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,030
you've always been loved and cherished.

270
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,870
I guess you don't know

271
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,670
how it feels when something that's

272
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,790
important to you is destroyed, right?

273
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,630
Give it back to me!

274
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,470
Give it back to me!

275
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,150
I'll go after her.

276
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:39,950
Xiao Wan.

277
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,470
Why aren't you at school?

278
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,550
You're...

279
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:48,510
Hello, auntie.

280
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,430
I'm Ni Xiao Wan's classmate.

281
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,710
My name is Lin Nan Yi.

282
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:55,740
Auntie,

283
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,590
this dress...

284
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,910
Oh, the dress?

285
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,460
I'm going to alter it

286
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,750
and turn it into a handicraft.

287
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,910
[I've got good taste, right?]

288
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,310
[Let's pack everything]

289
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,350
and share it with everyone tomorrow.

290
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,580
Lesson's over.

291
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,710
Just a few more words to you.

292
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,950
You'll be assigned to
a different class soon.

293
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,310
Whether or not

294
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,390
you're in a good relationship with

295
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,470
your classmates,

296
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,990
you're going to split up anyway.

297
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,430
Show some mercy towards your classmates.

298
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,830
Try your best

299
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,470
not to pry and gossip

300
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,870
about others' personal affairs.

301
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,030
Respect and protect others' dignity.

302
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,070
This is the highest expression

303
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,190
of sympathy.

304
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,550
Alright, study on your own now.

305
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,070
Do you think

306
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,870
Lin Nan Yi knew about this before?

307
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,790
That's why he kept it from you.

308
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,310
Lin is too kind.

309
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,110
Even though you misunderstood him,

310
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,350
he still didn't betray Ni Xiao Wan.

311
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,110
Lin Nan Yi's right.

312
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,830
We shouldn't talk about this so much.

313
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,990
It's going to rain soon.

314
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,870
When is Lin Nan Yi coming back?

315
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,110
Is there anything else

316
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,510
other than the dancing dress?

317
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,550
Will you forgive me

318
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,460
if I tell you the truth?

319
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,270
Yes,

320
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,590
I stole the dancing dress.

321
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,990
I also posted the letter that Tong Xi

322
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,070
wrote for the senior.

323
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:43,950
At the public class,

324
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,310
I knew she can't draw,

325
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,110
yet I asked her out to see her humiliated.

326
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,830
I also messed with

327
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,990
her dancing shoes
before the Arts Festival.

328
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,150
Are you happy now?

329
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,030
Why?

330
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,470
What did Tong Xi do to you

331
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,750
that made you hate her so much?

332
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,350
Ever since Tong Xi came back

333
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,180
and joined our class,

334
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,430
all eyes were on her,

335
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,310
especially you.

336
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,590
That's why I envy her.

337
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,430
This is not envy.

338
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,350
You're jealous.

339
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,470
Yes, I'm jealous of her.

340
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,790
I hate her too.

341
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,710
Everything was fine before she came back.

342
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,430
Why has everything changed

343
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,670
after she's here?

344
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,910
Tong Xi and I are the same.

345
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,510
We put on a facade

346
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,790
to satisfy our sense of vanity.

347
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,110
How is she any different from me?

348
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,510
Is it just because she has plot armour?

349
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,750
Tong Xi did make a lot of mistakes,

350
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,550
but she apologised

351
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,110
and felt really bad.

352
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,260
I don't think she's hurt anyone.

353
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,830
When Tong Xi did something wrong,

354
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,510
you would offer help

355
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,830
and find a solution for her.

356
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,230
What about me?

357
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,870
Nobody understands me.

358
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,710
Ni Xiao Wan, there's one thing

359
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,110
I must make it clear to you.

360
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,550
For me, you're just

361
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,350
a classmate who
I've known for a long time.

362
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,990
I offered you help

363
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,990
out of concern for a classmate.

364
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,270
If I ever sent you

365
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,710
the wrong message in this regard,

366
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,910
I'll apologise to you.

367
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,060
I'm sorry.

368
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,350
As for my understanding...

369
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,950
I don't think

370
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,340
that's what you need right now.

371
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,190
You should learn to be honest

372
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,310
to your mistakes instead.

373
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,310
As for the revelations of your secret,

374
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,590
you should ask your dad about it.

375
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,790
[Our Xiao Wan]

376
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,830
is a needy student.

377
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,510
She applied for grant aid.

378
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,310
Is he really Xiao Wan's dad?

379
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,110
Yes.

380
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,470
I saw someone talking about it

381
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,510
in the group chat.

382
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,900
That's odd. Isn't she a Ms. Perfect?

383
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,310
Why are you drinking so much?

384
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,030
Then do it!

385
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,590
[That's all I had to say.]

386
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,790
Give me the necklace.

387
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,430
You're right about one thing.

388
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:22,710
To me, Tong Xi

389
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,470
does have plot armour.

390
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,590
Once, people were asked
if they were happy.

391
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,950
Through their hesitation,

392
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,950
they...

393
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,230
Lin Nan Yi?

394
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,950
Why are you here?

395
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,190
It's raining.

396
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,230
What are you doing?

397
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,630
Why are you here without prior notice?

398
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,460
You didn't even carry an umbrella.

399
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,110
To drop something off to you.

400
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,190
You know what was going on now.

401
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:22,790
You're not mad anymore?

402
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,630
Ni Xiao Wan and I are just classmates.

403
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,430
I was close to her because...

404
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,100
Alright, I get it.

405
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,190
I wouldn't know

406
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,230
what to say about it either.

407
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,670
Exactly.

408
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,750
I hope that she can work it out,

409
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,670
get into a good university

410
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,350
and get out of here soon.

411
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,870
This heavy rain.

412
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:11,590
Mum.

413
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,070
What's going on?

414
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,590
He was caught in the rain,

415
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,350
so he came here for shelter.

416
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,230
Lin Nan Yi!

417
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,710
Yes, auntie.

418
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,030
It's really you!

419
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,190
You're all grown up!

420
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,830
Tong Xi's dad always talked about you.

421
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,910
He said you're tall and handsome.

422
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,070
Now that I see you,

423
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,070
he's right about that.

424
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,070
Come, sit down.

425
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,710
Stay for dinner today.

426
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,750
I'll cook for you.

427
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,950
It's been so many years.

428
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,590
Your parents are doing well, right?

429
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:58,910
Hello.

430
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,230
What?

431
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,590
What's wrong?

432
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,100
Ni Xiao Wan ran away from home again?

433
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,030
Mr. Jia

434
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,590
received a call from Ni Xiao Wan's mum.

435
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,550
She had a big fight with her dad

436
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,350
and ran away.

437
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,550
She didn't pick up the call
and they couldn't find her.

438
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,590
What about Tong Xi and Lin?

439
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:18,710
They went to search for her.

440
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,390
We should go as well.

441
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,510
Sure, let's go.

442
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,350
Wait for me!

443
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,150
Right here.

444
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,270
You go that way and I'll go this way.

445
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:35,790
Okay.

446
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,430
Ni Xiao Wan!

447
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:17,790
Hello, auntie.

448
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,860
Ni Xiao Wan's not home yet?

449
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,870
Okay, we know.

450
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,510
We've been searching around for so long.

451
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,030
It's dangerous to stay out late.

452
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,070
I know.

453
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,150
Tao Zi couldn't find her either.

454
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,030
Use your phone to call her.

455
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,750
I don't think her phone
runs out of battery.

456
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,550
She just refused to take the call.

457
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,830
If you use your phone to call her,

458
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,740
she might pick up the call.

459
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,060
I...

460
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,670
What? Hurry up!

461
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,670
It's urgent!

462
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:47,580
Quick!

463
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,230
It's ringing.

464
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,350
Hello, Ni Xiao Wan.

465
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,710
Where are you?

466
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,710
Ni Xiao Wan,

467
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:16,950
are you okay?

468
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:17,870
Don't worry.

469
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,390
People like me

470
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,550
wouldn't dare to jump into
the sea and end my life.

471
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,510
Nor would I be able to

472
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,990
run away and live the life I want.

473
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,470
Still, thank you for coming to me

474
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,430
and giving me an out.

475
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,710
Go buy some drinks for us.

476
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:38,790
Now?

477
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:50,710
He's gone.

478
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,070
Let's talk it out.

479
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,910
What is there to talk about?

480
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,630
Shall we talk about how much I hate you?

481
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:56,710
What a coincidence.

482
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,780
I don't like you either.

483
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,670
So you sent him away

484
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,590
just to pick a fight with me

485
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,750
and humiliate me, is it?

486
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,950
I'm not here to pick a fight,

487
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,030
nor do I want to humiliate you.

488
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,230
I just think that

489
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,630
it's time to straighten things out

490
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,870
with you once and for all.

491
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,230
Or do you want to keep things this way?

492
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,990
What makes you think you can resolve this?

493
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,350
Who do you think you are?

494
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,070
I'm not qualified?

495
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,430
Don't you know what you have done

496
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,390
the entire time?

497
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,790
Public class, dancing shoes

498
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,190
and other horrible stuff.

499
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,390
I don't need to remind you, right?

500
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,110
So Lin Nan Yi told you about it.

501
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,710
You think I'm so dumb that
I couldn't figure it out myself?

502
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:35,550
I just couldn't

503
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,110
be bothered to argue with you.

504
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,110
You could've argued with me.

505
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,070
Why didn't you argue with me?

506
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,310
I did all of it.

507
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,750
You're just

508
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,590
trying to act like a saint.

509
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,270
Do you really understand people like me?

510
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,910
I worked very hard too.

511
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,550
I consider myself no less than you.

512
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,950
Yet, I'm second to you in everything.

513
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,790
Are you really aware of my situation?

514
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,710
You have friends, family and Lin Nan Yi.

515
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,430
What about me?

516
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,260
I have nothing but exams.

517
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,230
So why should I pretend to

518
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,310
accept your pity?

519
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,430
You think you're the only pathetic girl?

520
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,590
I wasn't pathetic

521
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,630
when you humiliated me?

522
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,230
Let me go.

523
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,150
Let me go!

524
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,430
You pushed me!

525
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,110
My dad just slapped me on my face

526
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,310
and now you're pushing me!

527
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,430
Ni Xiao Wan!

528
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,510
Tong Xi!

529
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,830
What are you doing?

530
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,870
Why is Tong Xi taking so long?

531
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,350
Do you think they are fighting?

532
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:36,710
No.

533
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,190
They are both well mannered and educated.

534
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,270
Let go of me first.

535
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,350
You let go first.

536
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,470
I'll count to three.

537
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:47,990
One!

538
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:48,430
Two!

539
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:48,990
Three!

540
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,070
You're quite strong.

541
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,390
Every holiday I'll go fishing with my dad.

542
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,470
You princess from the city
wouldn't understand it.

543
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,620
When I was chasing

544
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,270
someone down in the street,

545
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,030
you were chilling and floating on the sea.

546
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,350
I'm not a saint,

547
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,150
and there's nothing to forgive about.

548
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,790
If you think about it,

549
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,390
I'm no different than you.

550
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,070
Back then, I told some nonsense and lies

551
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,030
to satisfy my sense of vanity.

552
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,870
I got others into trouble

553
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,110
to cover up my lies too.

554
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,110
Looking back at it,

555
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,950
I find myself ridiculous.

556
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,190
What's so ridiculous about it?

557
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,270
Come on, you have a great life.

558
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:38,830
Great life?

559
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,550
You knew I got into a huge fight

560
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,470
with my mum

561
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,550
and ran away from home.

562
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:44,630
Of course,

563
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,910
it's nothing compared to you.

564
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,310
You're more miserable.

565
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,830
Fine, I'm sorry.

566
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:50,750
I take it back.

567
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,780
What I want to say is,

568
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,230
you're better than me

569
00:25:58,670 --> 00:25:59,510
and you work harder than me.

570
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,310
You're definitely

571
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,110
the smartest one and you'll be

572
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,390
the most successful person in our class.

573
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,070
You care a lot about

574
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,540
your family, status and parents,

575
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,030
but they never overshadow
your exceptional abilities.

576
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,270
Ni Xiao Wan, I know in my heart

577
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,670
that I admire you.

578
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:22,710
Forget it,

579
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,470
you don't have to flatter me.

580
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,590
I'm not like you.

581
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,670
You're the female lead with plot armour

582
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,270
while I'm just a supporting character.

583
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,790
You'll never understand me.

584
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,550
Who says I have plot armour?

585
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,550
Lin Nan Yi.

586
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,030
He told me this morning,

587
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,270
right over there.

588
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:39,910
Really?

589
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,350
He's not completely right.

590
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,110
Let me tell you something about dancing.

591
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,270
When I was in Da Cheng,

592
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,430
I wasn't even a bottom-tier dancer,

593
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,980
let alone a supporting character.

594
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,670
Then, I came back to Xi Hai

595
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,150
and I got to perform at the theatre.

596
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,260
So, it's not that I couldn't do it,

597
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,670
it's just that the stage
in Da Cheng wasn't mine.

598
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,150
It's the same for you, Ni Xiao Wan.

599
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,670
You're not a supporting character.

600
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,390
Perhaps you just haven't found your stage.

601
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,550
You'll find your stage at a place
that's higher, further

602
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:12,950
and better than here.

603
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,510
Can I really find

604
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,910
my own stage?

605
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:25,900
Ni Xiao Wan,

606
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,790
I'm not your competitor.

607
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,030
Nor do I want to be your competitor.

608
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,230
But we'll certainly become competitors.

609
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,790
Why?

610
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,150
Have you not heard a word I've said?

611
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,830
Because of that person.

612
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:42,710
Fair enough.

613
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,670
But I won't

614
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:45,670
budge on this.

615
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,630
Monitor, are you okay?

616
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:02,990
Oh no,

617
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,310
Tong Xi really hit you.

618
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,510
Thank you.

619
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,150
I'm going home.

620
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,230
We'll send you back.

621
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:26,550
It's okay,

622
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,390
I want to be alone.

623
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:38,870
Are you hurt?

624
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,110
Hello.

625
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,470
We found her.

626
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:04,910
Don't worry,

627
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,590
Tong Xi and Lin are following her.

628
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,630
Okay, see you in school.

629
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,590
Who is it? Qin Ke'er?

630
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,870
She asked if we'd found the monitor.

631
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,390
How great is our class monitor.

632
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,110
She was usually quiet,

633
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,750
but she took big actions
once she got into trouble.

634
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,230
She got into a fight and
almost jumped into the sea.

635
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,710
This is unbelievable.

636
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,430
Although

637
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,750
I haven't figured out

638
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,710
why she got into a fight

639
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,070
with Tong Xi

640
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,550
when she got exposed for her lies,

641
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,550
seeing that she's a wreck...

642
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,910
Makes me feel bad.

643
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:41,950
You don't want to talk?

644
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:44,990
I don't feel like riding it,

645
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:45,710
take the bicycle.

646
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,030
I'm really fine.

647
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,230
Go home.

648
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,150
You've been following me the whole day.

649
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,950
Auntie's on her way now.

650
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,470
Be good when you get home.

651
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:04,990
Don't fight with your dad.

652
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:12,870
Xiao Wan.

653
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,030
[Ocean of Love Hawker Food Stall]

654
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:14,990
Xiao Wan.

655
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,230
Xiao Wan.

656
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:16,870
Mum.

657
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:20,870
I'm glad you're alright.

658
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,230
I'm glad you're alright.

659
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,270
Let's go home.

660
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,790
Thank you.

661
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,790
Don't mention it, auntie.

662
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,350
Mum,

663
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,350
just a second.
