3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:11,910
Good morning.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,270
Morning.

5
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:29,470
Tong Xi,

6
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,950
last time
I recommended Guru Qing He to you.

7
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,030
Have you followed him?

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,510
He published a new comic
called Mint recently.

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,510
It was released yesterday.
Have you read it?

10
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,030
Of course I have.

11
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,750
I browsed a little.

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:44,590
What's the matter?

13
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,390
The female lead of Mint

14
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,310
looks exactly like you.

15
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,070
Your side profiles look exactly the same.

16
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,350
She also went back to her home town

17
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,110
and met a cool street fighter

18
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,150
named Qiu Ke.

19
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,350
If it wasn't for the different plot,

20
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,230
I would've thought he actually knows you.

21
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,190
The perfect female lead of Guru Qing He

22
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,430
is just like me!

23
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,860
I still think it seems
too much of a coincidence.

24
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,910
It is unbelievable.

25
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,430
Unbelievable?

26
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:15,390
I have to stay low. Stay low.

27
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,550
I can't be too full of myself.

28
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,270
I think it's a coincidence.

29
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,350
Look. Don't those comic characters

30
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,510
have similar face?

31
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,070
Why does Guru Qing He's new comic

32
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,990
look like Tong Xi?

33
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,590
Forget it. Let's go
and buy papers for letter after school.

34
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,229
Sure.

Let's go.

it's the annual
black cat and butterfly season again.

going to write letters

40

Girls?

42
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,830
You boys also write

43
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:52,630
a lot of mysterious letters.

44
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,110
Have you gotten your black cat papers?

45
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:57,830
It's really hard to get now.

46
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,070
Let's go and grab some after school.

47

Mysterious letter?

52
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,630
What is a mysterious letter?

53
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,870
This is an ancient legend in our school.

54

on the black cat and butterfly paper

you will get a reply.

It works like a charm.

60

This kind of legend

61
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,430
has been popular since the first grade.

62
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:26,430
It's used to trick the kids.

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,310

73

it means
that an ionic reaction has occurred.

172
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:03,870
Got it.

173
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,950
Ask me if you have any questions.

174
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:06,710
Okay.

175
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,470
Lin, you should take note.

176
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,630
We have to hand in group work after class.

177
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,870
I won't.

178
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,830
You're so focused, Tong Xi.

179
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,390
We're lucky to have you in our group.

180
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,070
[I'm not doing it for you.]

181
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,390
I'm doing it for my mum.

182
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,100
This is quite dangerous.

183
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,350
It's very likely to explode.

184
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,390
It's okay. There's not much in it.

185
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,790
Lin Nan Yi, this is for you.

186
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,230
I bought this
after waiting in a long line.

187
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,790
We have one more day left.

188
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,110
Hurry up and write your letter.

189
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,550
I'll exchange it with you tomorrow.

190
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,510
Good Lord.

191
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,550
Ni Xiao Wan is really bold.

192
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,030
Obviously,

193
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,350
she's forcing Lin to write to her.

194
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,870
What's the next class?

195
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,070
Computer class.

196
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,670
It's upstairs.

197
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,510
Did you bring your books?

198
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,870
Four of us are really something.

199
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,830
Hurry up. We'll be late.

200
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,950
Give me all your books.

201
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,510
I'll bring them upstairs.

202
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,030
Thanks.

203
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,430
Your book.

204
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,470
I'm fine. I'll do it myself.

205
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,750
Something's wrong.

206
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,460
See.

207
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,910
I told you.

208
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,030
It must be
because Ni Xiao Wan gave Lin the paper,

209
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,710
so Tong Xi is upset.

210
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,710
Something's wrong.

211
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,740
You're mad.

212
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,910
What for?

213
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,190
Because of that stupid paper?

214
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,110
How is that possible?

215
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,350
Wait.

216
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,260
My mum will come check on me
next Monday.

217
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,750
Lin Nan Yi still slacks off
and holds me back.

218
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,670
Of course I should be mad at him.

219
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,910
Yes, this is the reason why I'm mad.

220
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,430
This is it.

221
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,950
Something is off
right after the chemistry class.

222
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,070
Did I offend you again?

223
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,390
Stop flattering yourself.

224
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,270
It's like you have an impact on me.

225
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,550
One more thing.
If you want to be in my group,

226
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,110
please do your homework properly.

227
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,230
Otherwise I will be in trouble.

228
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,190
Fine. I got it.

229
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,230
White Swan,
please mind your emotion management.

230
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,240
[Computer Lab]

231
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,030
You know what?

232
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,550
My friends spent their money
on escape room.

233
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,150
They're just spending money
to prove that they're a fool.

234
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,350
Tao Zi, what a coincidence.

235
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,150
Is this your lesson now?

236
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,150
Yes, Senior.

237
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,990
What a coincidence. We meet again.

238
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:47,550
By the way,

239
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,830
have you rehearsed the script
of The Wizard of Oz

240
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,750
that I gave to you?

241
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,830
The audition for the female lead
is starting soon.

242
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,310
I look forward to your performance.

243
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,670
She's doing great.

244
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,870
She hasn't even memorised the dialogues.

245
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,830
I'm sorry, Wang Yi Ming.

246
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,550
I think I stepped on your foot.

247
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,110
I am so sorry.

248
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,430
It's okay.

249
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,660
Senior, don't worry.

250
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,390
I'm working really hard on it.

251
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,670
Keep it up.

252
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,030
Bye, Senior.

253
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,630
Bye.

254
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,470
Bye, Senior.

255
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,030
Bye.

256
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,950
Will he let a sweeping monk like you
to perform?

257
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,070
No one will watch this performance.

258
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,110
You know nothing!

259
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,190
You're a rock.

260
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,260
First of all,

261
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,270
select the words you want to hide.

262
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,230
Lin,

263
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,750
I have a question to consult you.

264
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:48,750
Fire away.

265
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,030
Someone said that I'm a rock.

266
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,220
What does that mean?

267
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,430
You're dumb.

268
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,510
What the heck!

269
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,830
Student, what are you doing?

270
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,750
Sir, I'm sorry.

271
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,110
I dropped something.

272
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,310
Managing emotion is so hard.

273
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,670
I won't trash female celebrities
on the internet any more.

274
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,430
It's Friday already.

275
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,390
I have to think properly

276
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,820
what I should write to Senior.

277
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,510
I can't write it on the paper this time,

278
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,510
otherwise...

279
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,510
What is this?

280
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,230
This is

281
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,830
a letter I wrote to Wei Ze from Da Cheng.

282
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,510
Mum, you know him, don't you?

283
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,860
He's a top five student,

284
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,180
straight-A student,

285
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,390
leader of art club,

286
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,350
and he plays the piano so well.

287
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,310
He is my role model.

288
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,990
I heard he is also from Xi Hai.

289
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,590
He will transfer to our school
in 12th Grade.

290
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,870
I just want to ask for his advice

291
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,830
regarding dancing.

292
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,750
Dancing?

293
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,790
You don't use computer or phone
to ask for his advice,

294
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,310
but these colourful papers?

295
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,270
Who are you trying to deceive?

296
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,310
You're such a liar.

297
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,350
No, mum.

298
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,630
It's not like what you think.

299
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,950
Whether or not
it's like what I think it is,

300
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,550
I will find out after meeting Mr. Jia

301
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,550
on Monday.

302
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,190
Your letter has been confiscated.

303
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,590
You'd better behave yourself.

304
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,310
Click.

306
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,710
[I should draft it on the computer]

307
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,830
[and send it by email after that.]

308
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,710
[After sending it, I'll delete it.
No traces will be left behind.]

309
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,670
[Okay. This is it.]

310
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,590

[Got it.]

As we all know,

313
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:38,030
if you press Ctrl+C twice on Word,

314
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,030
the shortcut of copy,

315
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,430
on the right hand side,

316
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,590
an edit column will show up.

Sometimes, we don't even use it.

318
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,070
So hiding it

319
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,430
is definitely a good move.

Could this be
the black cat and butterfly letter?

Who would've seen this coming?

Who would've thought that even I would...

325
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,950
Isn't this Tao Zi's handwriting?

Exactly. What is she doing?

I've searched everywhere.
I couldn't find it.

334

run away?

336

[Calm down.]

What if we go to the school
and look for it tomorrow?

338

Maybe it fell in the drawer's gap
or something.

Forget it. It's fine.

00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,590
I'll stop searching.

341
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,350
[Why don't you hurry up
and write another one?]

342
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,830
Is it too late now?

343
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,070
[Forget about it.]

344
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,470
Let me tell you something, Tong Xi.

345
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,270
Today, in the computer class,

346
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,510
Senior initiated a conversation with me.

347
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,860
[He told me to work hard]

348
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,150
[for the female lead audition.]

349
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,630
He did not receive my letter this time,

350
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,460
but he has completely changed
his attitude towards me.

351
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,830
He's totally different now.

352
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,470
I think,

353
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,590
God must've noticed my feelings for him,

354
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,870
even He's helping me now.

355
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,190
Great. Then, bye.

356
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,270
[You know what?]

357
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,590
[Dai Xiao Mi from Class 5 wrote a letter
to the most handsome guy of our batch!]

358
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,780
[I heard that after Wu Tong
from 12th Grade wrote the letter,]

359
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,790
[her wish came true.]

360
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,349
[Even a 12th Grader does this?]

361
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,829
[It is no wonder
that the papers are sold out!]

362
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,710
[Will White Swan get a lot of letters]?

363
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,030
[Do you even have to ask?]

364
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,020
[You should ask]

365
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,829
[if White Swan is writing to anyone.]

366
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,270
No.

367
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:23,710
There's no one I want to write to.

368
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,910
[I have an announcement to make.]

369
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,350
[I've received a mysterious letter.]

370
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,270
Oh, right! Senior's letter!

371
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,670
I haven't edited it in the computer class.

372
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,990
Let's edit the font first.

373
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,990
Make it look nicer.

374
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:49,630
No.

375
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,030
I can't always copy

376
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,470
the messages I sent to Guru Qing He.

377
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,670
I have to add something.

378
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:01,910
You are the light of my life.

379
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:12,220
If I want Senior to answer,

380
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,830
my letter shouldn't be close to the bone.

381
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,470
The more normal the letter is,

382
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,470
the higher the chance of getting a reply.

383
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,750
"You are the light of my life."

384
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,870
No, no. That's too desperate.

385
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,190
He won't be able to take it.

386
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,670
Delete it.

387
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,550
[Is White Swan
really not writing to anyone?]

388
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,910
[No.]

389
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,470
[But I saw you asking for black cat paper]

390
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,990
[from other student in the supermarket.]

391
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,790
Ni Xiao Wan and you
should just write to each other.

392
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,110
Why do you even care about me?

393
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,950
You didn't tell anyone, did you?

394
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,270
[Not yet.]

395
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,670
[You're writing to your senior]

396
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,910
[in Da Cheng, aren't you?]

397
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,790
[His name is Wei Ze.]

398
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,550
[Are you going to confess to him?]

399
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,830
Am I such a simple-minded
and shallow person?

400
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,910
Confess?

401
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,430
A simple confession

402
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,470
is never my style.

403
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,030
My mysterious letter

404
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,030
will be the collection of my literacy

405
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,070
over the past 16 years.

406
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,150
It's an essay,

407
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,060
a work of art.

408
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,270
It's a masterpiece

409
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,350
which a layperson like you will
never figure out for your entire life.

410
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,630
[The letter has to be sent out tomorrow.]

411
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,990
[You should act quickly.]

412
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,350
[It wasn't easy to get the paper.]

413
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,950
You shouldn't waste

414
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:56,590
Ni Xiao Wan's effort.

415
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,550
I've transferred your March salary to you.

416
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,270
You're lucky.

417
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,780
I'm in a good mood today.

418
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:31,270
I don't even bother deducting your salary

419
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,790
for coming in late or leaving early.

420
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,270
Thanks, boss.

421
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,750
However,

422
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,870
don't your parents give you money
every month?

423
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,510
I bet you won't be short of cash.

424
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:43,990
I'm not short of cash.

425
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,350
I feel more at ease

426
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,390
when I use my own money.

427
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,030
Nice one. Not bad.

428
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:51,790
I'm leaving.

429
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,150
Morning.

430
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,670
Today is Saturday.

431
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,430
What do you want to drink?

432
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,470
I don't need it.

433
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,790
I came here to give you this.

434
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,580
I'm sorry.

435
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,670
It's fine.

436
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,870
Are you waiting for Tong Xi
to write to you?

437
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,510
She won't write to you.

438
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:47,750
Hang on.

439
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,030
Take this letter too.

440
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,430
Just tear it up for me.

441
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:56,670
Class monitor, morning.

442
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,230
I took a photo

443
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:48,910
of the black cat and butterfly paper

444
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,310
and set it as the email background.

445
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,260
It will work too, right?

446
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,900
Tong Xi, hurry up!

447
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,390
You're going to be late for ballet class!

448
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,150
Coming!

449
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,670
So,

450
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,910
you just rejected Ni Xiao Wan.

451
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,270
I think so. I didn't write her anything.

452
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,070
You're really firm.
As expected from my brother.

453
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,550
Unlike me.

454
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,070
It's really bothering me.

455
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,070
Listen.

456
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,430
If a girl

457
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,950
scolds you

458
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,270
then she writes you a mysterious letter.

459
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,710
What does that mean?

460
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,510
It depends on the content.

461
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,510
It's...

462
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,390
She wrote things like...

463
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,110
You're like the star,

464
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:54,950
bling bling.

465
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,910
As I look at the star,

466
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,030
I blush.

467
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,070
Star?

468
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,350
Do you mean Patrick Star?

469
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,270
Isn't she cursing you?

470
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,030
Patrick...

471
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,950
No! Not Patrick Star!

472
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,110
It is that star!

473
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,070
The star in the sky!

474
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,750
Brazing star!

475
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,430
It's the same.

476
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,950
You mean blazing star.

477
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,510
There are two possibilities.

478
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,750
First, I think she has bad taste.

479
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,070
There's the second one.

480
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,110
The second possibility is

481
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,590
she's blind. She's in love with you.

482
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,230
She's scolding you.
Scolding is equal to love.

483
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,830
I knew it!

484
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:34,670
Keep it down.

485
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,910
I knew she has a crush on me.

486
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:41,790
It's tricky now.

487
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,670
It's tricky.

488
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,070
Lin, Lin.

489
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:54,830
What's happening?

490
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,390
"You're the light of my life."

491
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,590
"You're a cupid on earth."

492
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,590
"You can always
hit my heart with an arrow."

493
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,070
If Tong Xi really wrote this,

494
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,990
that's really shocking.

495
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,030
Sister Mi Ya, something came up.
I have to take a day off.

496
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,190
Wait. Why...

497
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,190
Five, six, seven, eight.

498
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,990
Five, six, seven, rest.

499
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,670
You have to stand firm after you stop.

500
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,950
Then, stretch out your arm.

501
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,830
Yes, graceful, get it?

502
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,790
Got it. Thanks, Mr. Xu.

503
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:34,070
Alright. Take a break first.

504
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:34,750
Okay.

505
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,870
Lin Nan Yi, what are you doing here?

506
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,310
What the heck?

507
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,150
Oh, God!

508
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,590
Did you write that letter?

509
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,150
I edited that letter.

510
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,430
I deleted some of the words.

511
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,350
Why would it be posted on Tieba?

512
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,270
I'm doomed.

513
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,270
Now everyone has seen it.

514
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,950
Those who haven't
will see it soon or later.

515
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,630
Will our teacher see it too?

516
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,230
I'm done.

517
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,390
My mum is meeting Mr. Jia next Monday.

518
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,590
If she finds out,

519
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,430
that will be the end of me.

520
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,940
If even Jia knows about it,

521
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,630
that will be difficult indeed.

522
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,630
It's difficult
even if our classmates see it.

523
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,190
When my mum comes to the school,

524
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,470
she will notice
that everyone is talking about me

525
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,150
and this matter,

526
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,270
I'll be in a lot of trouble.

527
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,230
Besides...

528
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,190
What is it?

529
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,510
Besides,

530
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,830
if everyone learns more about my flaws

531
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,310
with this letter,

532
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,990
they will be disappointed.

533
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,990
I make them trust me and like me

534
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,710
with this method.

535
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,670
If my cover is blown,

536
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,830
I don't even know how to face them.

537
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,430
What is this?

538
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,150
Tao Zi, it's great that you're here.

539
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,510
Come. Have you seen this post?

540
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,460
Listen. This post is the...

541
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,340
Have you seen Tong Xi?

542
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,190
Did she come here?

543
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,420
I went to her house, but no one was in.

544
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,550
I couldn't get through her phone.

545
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,350
Lin is also looking for her.

546
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,390
Wait. Listen.

547
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,390
Tong Xi always seems

548
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,510
so gentle and elegant,

549
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,660
I didn't know that deep down,
she's so passionate!

550
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,110
Gossiper, big mouth!

551
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,390
Don't go.

552
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,270
Well, Lin is looking for her.

553
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,230
If he finds her, he will bring her here.

554
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,460
Take a seat first. Take a seat.

555
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,510
Look.

556
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:50,670
Actually, after what happened to Tong Xi,

557
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,270
I realised,

558
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,830
you girls

559
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:58,310
might appear to be shy,

560
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,870
but there are boiling waves inside of you.

561
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,950
It's just like the way you feel about me.

562
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,750
What are you talking about?

563
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,870
In the beginning,

564
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,390
my intention

565
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,070
was making people like me even more.

566
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,990
That's not what I want either.

567
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,670
Everyone thinks I'm White Swan.

568
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,550
They're very nice to me.

569
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,900
They get the door for me
and take care of me.

570
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,830
I'm obsessed with this feeling.

571
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,350
Little did I know, it became my image.

572
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,390
Don't you think
that even if you're not White Swan,

573
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,990
people still adore you?

574
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:47,980
It's impossible.

575
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,150
Back in Da Cheng,

576
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,470
I used to have many friends too,

577
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,700
but they never treated me like this.

578
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,430
Not only the boys treated me like
I'm their brother,

579
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,750
even the girls were also the same.

580
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,390
Now that I finally have this opportunity,

581
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,620
I just want to enjoy it.

582
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:09,790
I know that I'm quite vain.

583
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,990
But I think, with this image,

584
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,430
the teachers, classmates

585
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,700
and Wei Ze

586
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,870
will be impressed.

587
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:30,150
Who knows, my image has been ruined.

588
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,830
I don't understand
why you'd have this mindset.

589
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,870
Why must you act like someone else?

590
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,510
When you were young, you were really cute.

591
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,590
I know,

592
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,750
you created this image
because it's exciting.

593
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,550
But now you know,

594
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,780
this image brought you glory,

595
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,350
but it also brought you a lot of trouble.

596
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,790
In the beginning, I also knew

597
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,350
that I can never keep pretending.

598
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,430
It will end sooner or later.

599
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,630
But I never thought
that it'd end this way.

600
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,550
Promise me.

601
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,230
After solving this problem,

602
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,750
you have to figure out how to end it all.

603
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,980
If you still refuse to act like yourself

604
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,630
and encounter this problem again,

605
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,270
I will never help you again.

606
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:36,950
Hello, Sister Jia Jia.

607
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,780
Are you familiar with Tieba?

608
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,230
I want to contact the administrator.

609
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,230
Yes.

610
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,110
Tong Xi, are you alright?

611
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,540
Tong Xi,
is the post on the internet real?

612
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,550
Of course it's fake!

613
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,500
Lin, could you take him away?

614
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,030
I need to talk to Tong Xi.

615
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,150
No! If you don't let me join...

616
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,780
No, no. Let's listen to them.

617
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,310
Let's eavesdrop.

618
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:08,940
Tao Zi,

619
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,270
regarding Tieba, I can explain...

620
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,790
You're a fan of Guru Qing He, right?

621
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:16,910
How did you know that I'm his fan?

622
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,350
Cupid on earth,

623
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,590
hits my heart with an arrow.

624
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,990
God from on high,

625
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,430
hits right into the light of my soul.

626
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,710
I saw similar bombastic compliments

627
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,550
on Qing He's Tieba all the time.

628
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,590
They were all written

629
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,590
by someone
called Qing He's One and Only Girlfriend.

630
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,940
This username
is extremely popular on Tieba.

631
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,790
So I figured,

632
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,580
you must've read her stuff too.

633
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,470
It was your instinct to mimic her.

634
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:41,750
In fact, I wasn't mimicking anyone.

635
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,630
What do you mean?

636
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:51,750
I am Qing He's Only Designated Girlfriend.

637
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,230
Tong Xi,

638
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,430
you... You're really wild.

639
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:03,300
I didn't expect
Qing He's Only Designated Girlfriend

640
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,870
to be someone I know.

641
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,950
This is unbelievable.

642
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,510
Back then when I asked you,

643
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,750
you didn't admit it.

644
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,070
I was wrong. I was wrong.

645
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,790
I tried so hard to deny it,

646
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,790
it was killing me as well.

647
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,950
This is too sudden.

648
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,750
I didn't know

649
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,470
that you're not only White Swan,

650
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,910
but you're Guru Qing He's top fan!

651
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,350
I don't know
what to think of you anymore.

652
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,790
I need to calm down.

653
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,740
Screw it!

654
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:28,870
What are you doing?

655
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:32,020
See. Even I'd say this.

656
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,630
An elegant White Swan

657
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:34,510
would never say this.

658
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:35,510
Besides,

659
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,470
I've never shaved my legs.

660
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:39,590
That's not it.

661
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,910
It's not that I don't trust you,

662
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,710
I'm just...

663
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,070
I'm thrilled. I'm too excited.

664
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,390
I have so many questions for you,

665
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,830
but... But let's just forget about it now.

666
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:50,870
The important thing to do

667
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,310
is solving your issue now.

668
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,140
I have to deal with Wang Yi Ming first.

669
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,030
He has a big mouth.

670
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,070
I'm afraid he'll spread the word
and cause us more trouble.

671
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,790
And for the rest,

672
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:00,950
we'll chat over QQ tonight.

673
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,750
Why are you hiding yourself?

674
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:16,830
Are you a thief?

675
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:20,389
Even a thief is better than me now.

676
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,230
If the police arrests me,

677
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,790
I don't have to face other people, right?

678
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,030
I've contacted the administrator.

679
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:28,909
He has removed the post.

680
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,510
How is that helping me?

681
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,830
People have seen everything.

682
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:34,670
What if they've taken screenshots?

683
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,230
See. I told you!

684
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:42,590
I'm doomed.

685
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:45,670
My mum will meet Mr. Jia next Monday.

686
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,550
That will be the end of me.

687
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,190
Calm down first.

688
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,989
I'll analyse it for you.

689
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,710
First, today is weekend.

690
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,350
The teachers haven't seen it yet.

691
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:01,430
Second, this username

692
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,110
has just been registered today.

693
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,230
Have you offended anyone recently?

694
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,060
No.

695
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,190
I've just been here for less than a month.

696
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,390
I even acted like that.

697
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,390
Who could I offend?

698
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,870
Could your mailbox have been hacked?

699
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,230
That can't be.

700
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,630
I've edited the letter.

701
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,590
It was just a simple letter.

702
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:31,230
It was no longer
full of bombastic compliments.

703
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,190
These sentences...

704
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,070
Why do they seem so familiar?

705
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,430
You know what?

706
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,190
This drink is not bad.

707
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,710
I agree.

708
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,230
Right?
