00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:02,830
Senior.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,830
Senior, why do you
leave all of a sudden?

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,590
My mum called me just now.

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,540
She wanted me to hurry back

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,630
as I have an exam in two days.

7
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,230
I think it's better for me to

8
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,470
leave tonight after checking
the flight ticket.

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,510
Is that so?

10
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,460
Then the miracle...

11
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,350
Right, what is the miracle
you mentioned?

12
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,830
It's blue tears,

13
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,740
the fairy tale.

14
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,230
Hades and Menthe fell in love.

15
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,430
Tears of Menthe
dropped into the ocean

16
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,070
and became blue bioluminescent ocean.

17
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,470
I know that.

18
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:33,540
That's only a kind of

19
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,300
plankton which can glow.

20
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,150
Simply put, they are
the fireflies in the ocean.

21
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,510
It's just a fairy tale,
it's a story for the children.

22
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,230
But I'm worried about you

23
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,660
as you like this place so much.

24
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,110
You know, I spent a long time to get rid

25
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,790
of the imprint of the town.

26
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,590
I came back out of necessity, to sit for
the National College Entrance Examination.

27
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,310
I'm well aware that I don't belong here.

28
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,830
But it seems like
you don't think the same way.

29
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,430
You're well adapted and enjoy being here.

30
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,750
Tong Xi, you're good.

31
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,020
Shouldn't you work hard and
go to a better place?

32
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:05,710
I...

33
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,190
But you are different

34
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,950
from who you were in Da Cheng.

35
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,270
You were careless,

36
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,230
like a boy.

37
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,110
You've changed a lot.

38
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,590
You're more like a white swan now.

39
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:21,990
Senior.

40
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,190
Which do you think is better,

41
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,150
the old me or the new me?

42
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,190
Of course, is the new you.

43
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:31,990
But you still need to keep it up.

44
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,590
We have to get rid of
our original states.

45
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,390
So both of us need to keep it up.

46
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:37,460
I'm leaving, goodbye.

47
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,820
[Summer Again]

48
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,590
Lin Nan Yi,

49
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,650
[Summer Again.
Episode 10: The Past Me, The New Me]

50
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,590
you must pay attention
to the class when you're back.

51
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,190
[Adapted from
Huo He's comic, "Mint Love".]

52
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,630
High school is unlike junior high,

53
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,510
freshmen and sophomores don't
need to struggle like the seniors

54
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,670
but they are important too.

55
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,230
It's getting late.

56
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,150
How about this?
Let me treat you to a bite.

57
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,070
What do you want to eat?

58
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,789
No need for that.

59
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,070
I've been thinking about Tong Xi
in the last few days.

60
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,950
I wonder what she is up to.

61
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:23,829
And I sense a kind of exquisite feeling

62
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,750
between Tong Xi

63
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,270
and that senior.

64
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,630
Moreover, they must be pretty close

65
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,310
while they were in Da Cheng.

66
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,980
They came from the same town
and they're in Art Club.

67
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,710
Now that they come back
to Xi Hai together.

68
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,110
Doesn't it feel like they're

69
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,190
destined to be together?

70
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,579
And I heard that

71
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,230
they're going to watch
blue tears together.

72
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,070
It's not far from your house, right?

73
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,110
It's getting late, just go home.

74
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,750
Lin Nan Yi.

75
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,350
[Have you never thought
that people would like you]

76
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,340
[even if you're not White Swan?]

77
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,910
[Senior,]

78
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,310
[which do you think is better,]

79
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,510
[the old me or the new me?]

80
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,590
[Of course, is the new you.]

81
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,190
[We have to get rid of
our original states.]

82
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,829
Senior has finally approved of me.

83
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,020
But why am I not happy?

84
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,710
Tong Xi.

85
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,460
I don't want to eat it, you eat it.

86
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,150
I'm going home.

87
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,070
Wait, hold on.

88
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,910
I have something to tell you.

89
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,230
I'm not interested.

90
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,700
I was going to meet Senior Xu Ao today

91
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,630
to ask him about drama club.

92
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,780
But he has to make up
for the missed lesson today.

93
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,110
Your order is ready.

94
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,030
Can you stop using that senior as cover?

95
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,590
Senior, hurry up.

96
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,190
I want two skewers of squid.

97
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:40,710
Okay.

98
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,350
Senior Xu Ao, which flavour do you want?

99
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,270
Regular will do.

100
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,820
One regular, one spicy flavour.

101
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,470
Okay.

102
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,030
It smells nice.

103
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,180
Who is that girl?

104
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,750
Xiao Qing from the drama club.

105
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,830
Xiao Qing?

106
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,270
She is the junior who swept
the floor, replacing you, right?

107
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,390
Didn't you say the senior
is having a class?

108
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,270
Look at how happy he is.

109
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,230
His class is a lie.

110
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,110
Your senior is pretty special.

111
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,190
He likes someone who can sweep the floor.

112
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,310
Interesting.

113
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,110
What's wrong with you?

114
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,270
Tao Zi.

115
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,830
Wait for me.

116
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,030
So, this is the second time
you got ditched?

117
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,230
Senior Wei Ze has exams in Da Cheng.

118
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,820
He has to go back
after settling the admission procedure.

119
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,510
He doesn't have time to
hang out with me on the beach.

120
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,990
Right.

121
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:47,350
He has time to play basketball with me

122
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,110
but doesn't have time
to watch the ocean with you.

123
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,990
Seems like I'm more important

124
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:53,580
than you are to him.

125
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,710
Lin Nan Yi, why hadn't I realised that

126
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,670
you're such a narcissist?

127
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,390
I hadn't realised
you're this slow-witted too.

128
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,310
You got ditched twice

129
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,110
but still have fantasy about him.

130
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:08,980
How is it?

131
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,670
Is he satisfied with your performance?

132
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,150
How about you? Are you happy?

133
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,870
I've told you.

134
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,710
A lasting relationship depends on

135
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,870
the mutual trust between people,

136
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,230
the attraction of the nature.

137
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,070
Don't talk like you know everything.

138
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,070
You just act tough.

139
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,870
I can tell that

140
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,430
you're not happy

141
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,190
to act like this, aren't you?

142
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,790
I might not be able to be

143
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:50,190
as perfect as Senior
no matter how hard I try.

144
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,630
Why do you want to pursue perfection?

145
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,190
Tong Xi, didn't we say it before?

146
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,670
People who know you

147
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,270
will like the way you are.

148
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,870
Just like this ocean.

149
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,830
People will like it

150
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,110
even if it doesn't perform blue tears.

151
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,630
How do you know I'm here
to watch blue tears?

152
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,230
I guess.

153
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,870
Lin Nan Yi,

154
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,990
are you spying on me these days?

155
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,670
You're waiting to have
a good laugh at me, right?

156
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,230
Who would spy on you?

157
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,110
Why do you have a more

158
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,750
despicable mind than a villain?

159
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,630
Did I judge a noble person?

160
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,510
You did.

161
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,830
Are you a noble man?

162
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,630
I am.

163
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:34,990
Stop there!

164
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,950
Don't try to run!

165
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:43,870
Didn't they say

166
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,590
there's no blue tears this year?

167
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,070
So

168
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,270
this is a miracle.

169
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,230
Actually,

170
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,630
I was relieved when Senior said

171
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,910
that he can't watch
the blue tears with me

172
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,510
as he had to go back.

173
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,230
I was stressed

174
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,990
when I was hanging out with him.

175
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,710
One thing is that

176
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,070
I feel like it's not my true self

177
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,390
in front of Senior.

178
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,790
The other thing is,

179
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,310
aren't becoming better

180
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,430
and more perfect

181
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,230
the quest for everyone?

182
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,910
The quest for everyone.

183
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,310
Let me tell you.

184
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,790
The first step to be
a better version of oneself

185
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,630
is to develop self-awareness.

186
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,030
You're the one to set the standard,

187
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,670
not the other.

188
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,950
Even Tao Zhu knows your true self.

189
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,230
But doesn't she

190
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,750
still stick with you every day?

191
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,670
Tong Xi.

192
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,190
You are who you are.

193
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,310
People will like

194
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,870
just the way you are.

195
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,660
Then,

196
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,230
I'll show my true self

197
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,300
to everyone tomorrow.

198
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,310
Lin Nan Yi?

199
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,590
Why are you guys here?

200
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,180
Just the two of you?

201
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,030
Why are you guys here then?

202
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,870
I'll take photos and
send them to Xiao Wan.

203
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,470
Look at the time.

204
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,270
Why isn't Xiao Wan back yet?

205
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,670
How could she let
her brother do the housework?

206
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,430
Tell her to get back here and work!

207
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:41,910
Hello.

208
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,430
[Xiao Wan, have you seen the photo?]

209
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,470
What happened?

210
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,630
[That's what I want to ask you.]

211
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,070
[Didn't Lin Nan Yi self-study]

212
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,190
[with you tonight?]

213
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,030
[Why is he with her?]

214
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,630
[Rest assured,
I'll keep an eye on him for you.]

215
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,430
Senior Xu Ao told me that
he had to make up a missed class

216
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,270
and I actually believed in him.

217
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,070
Actually, you don't have to be like this.

218
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,350
What am I like?

219
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,070
I'll just cut to the chase.

220
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,030
Sorry.

221
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,230
I can't give you an exact answer.

222
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,030
I know

223
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,830
I'm charming

224
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,830
and I know

225
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,420
that you must have formed
some great resolution

226
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,430
to confess your feelings.

227
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,310
I know that

228
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,590
you always talk about your senior

229
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,020
just to make me jealous.

230
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,390
But

231
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:48,470
love cannot be forced.

232
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,990
What are you talking about, Wang Yi Ming?

233
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:59,030
I read the letter you gave me.

234
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,990
You said I'm your star.

235
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,870
Secret letter.

236
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,390
The one you put into
my computer textbook, page 26,

237
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,350
the chapter on hidden text.

238
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,110
You said you got my secret letter?

239
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,190
You don't have to deny hurriedly.

240
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,790
I understand that

241
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,710
we grew up together as childhood friends.

242
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,830
It's awkward to face this problem.

243
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,110
Awkward, my foot!

244
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,030
That letter is for Senior Xu Ao!

245
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,230
I have no idea

246
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,030
how you got it.

247
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,990
You believed that
I have a crush on you

248
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,630
for the past days or

249
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,910
are you having a crush on me?

250
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:32,710
That's impossible.

251
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,310
Charming?
Are you even close to this word?

252
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,630
I have a crush on you?

253
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,070
I...

254
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,710
You're crazy!

255
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,710
This is a personal attack!

256
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,350
My brilliant

257
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,110
reputation is ruined.

258
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,540
You... Wait for me!

259
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,030
I don't dare to go back alone!

260
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,110
[That's how everything goes.]

261
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,630
[I'm able to find my true self]

262
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,390
[thanks to my childhood friend.]

263
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,110
[Thanks for hearing me out.]

264
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:04,990
[It sounds like]

265
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,230
[you've deepened the relationship]

266
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,230
[with that childhood friend of yours]

267
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,950
[after going through this matter.]

268
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,310
[I think so.]

269
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,230
[Compare to my senior,]

270
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,350
[he has more respect for my true self.]

271
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,190
[This might be what a best friend for.]

272
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,510
[To encourage one to be
brave to be oneself,]

273
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,310
[to live a life that one likes.]

274
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,150
[Is he just a best friend to you?]

275
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,390
[Perhaps he does this]

276
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,430
[because he has feelings for you.]

277
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,030
[By reading your story,]

278
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,900
[I'm wondering]

279
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,670
[if you have the same feeling with him.]

280
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,830
How could I send her this kind of thing?

281
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,590
How do I recall the message?

282
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,390
[It's not what you think.]

283
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,070
[We are just best friends.]

284
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,110
[The best friends.]

285
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,470
[Really? Maybe I got it wrong.]

286
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,190
[By reading your story,]

287
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,190
[I think he must care a lot about you.]

288
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,510
[A boy won't care much
about a girl whom he sees]

289
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,350
[as a friend.]

290
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,510
[Whether he's helping you,
caring about you]

291
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,020
[or hoping that you're happy,]

292
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,630
[all of this points to an explanation,]

293
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,790
[you're very important to him.]

294
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:39,950
[Of course.]

295
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,830
[This is just my guess.]

296
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,630
[You might not care about him]

297
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,430
[so don't worry about it.]

298
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,350
[No!]

299
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,590
[This friend is very important to me.]

300
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,310
[I care about him.]

301
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,030
[I've decided to give him a gift
to express my gratitude.]

302
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,030
Something is

303
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,950
feeling off.

304
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,510
[What are you going to give him?]

305
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,300
[I have an idea.]

306
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,830
[Nothing is better than your piece.]

307
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,070
[You're going to hold
an autograph session.]

308
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,390
[I'll give the Early Summer
with your autograph]

309
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,150
[on it to him.]

310
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,350
[What do you think?]

311
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,910
I want to eat meat.

312
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,630
Keep your body fit.

313
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:56,550
You...

314
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,830
I'm leaving.

315
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,550
Good morning, Zhu.

316
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,710
Good morning, Xi.

317
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,990
You look energetic today.

318
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,670
Have you changed your style?

319
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,350
I only used five seconds
to get my hair done in this morning.

320
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,750
It felt great.

321
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,030
Right, Guru Qing He

322
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,910
replied my message last night.

323
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,470
Really?

324
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,270
Do you want to try sending him one?

325
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,230
He might reply you too.

326
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,590
No, I'm a fan who treats him as a son.

327
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,710
What is this bun? It smells nice.

328
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,350
Let me have one.

329
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,110
Are you crazy? What if someone sees this?

330
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,390
Just let them see.

331
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,070
It's not

332
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,310
a wicked crime to eat a bun.

333
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,620
I'm going to show my true self

334
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,550
to everyone today.

335
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,670
Let's go.

336
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,230
Or I'll go with you and ask

337
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,990
what the matter is with senior Xu Ao.

338
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,470
Forget it.

339
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,390
We'll talk about it
after the open class finishes.

340
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:55,660
You, too, knew

341
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,910
how important this class is to Mr. Jia.

342
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:00,870
How about you?

343
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,350
Didn't you say

344
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,310
you want to show
your true self to everyone?

345
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,910
When are you going to say it?

346
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,869
I'll wait after the open class finishes

347
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,589
and explain to the classmates
in front of everybody.

348
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:11,940
Tao Zi.

349
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:13,430
White Swan.

350
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,540
Forget it, stop thinking about it.

351
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,510
Class is about to begin.
Let's go to the washroom.

352
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,270
Let's go.

353
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,270
Don't you think

354
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,790
Tong Xi looks a bit strange?

355
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,540
Ke'er, you go ahead.

356
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,670
I have to use the washroom.

357
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,300
Okay, I'll go first.

358
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,070
Bye bye.

359
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:48,830
Xiao Wan,

360
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,870
your painting of
a wild crane with fisherman

361
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,630
is better than
the illustration in this book.

362
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,430
Why can't I stop thinking about
Xu Ao and the drama club?

363
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,470
Right,

364
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,670
Guru Qing He is going to
organize an autograph session.

365
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,270
Do you want to go with me?

366
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,510
Can I take a photo
with Guru Qing He?

367
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,180
It shouldn't be a problem.

368
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:19,790
Forget it.

369
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,230
Didn't you want to go with Senior Wei Ze?

370
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,470
I refuse to be

371
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,710
the third wheel.

372
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,310
Right.

373
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,870
I have to go there with Senior Wei Ze.

374
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,670
It'll be better if you could go with me.

375
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,910
I guess

376
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,590
I can only spend the whole

377
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,750
Labour Day with that narcissist.

378
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,430
What's wrong with you guys?

379
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:49,860
Nothing.

380
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,750
I just think that people
who flatter themself

381
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,190
are very annoying.

382
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,190
What happened?

383
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,780
Are you going to attend
Qing He's autograph session?

384
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:09,750
Yes.

385
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,300
By then, not only that
I can see him in real life,

386
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,190
I can also get the signed Mint and

387
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,470
its special peripheral merchandise.

388
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,750
How is it? Are you interested?

389
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,830
Do you want me to give you a free one?

390
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,470
The special peripheral merchandise
are already launched on Tieba.

391
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,430
You're outdated.

392
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,230
How did you know these?

393
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,750
Did you follow on Qing He secretly?

394
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,550
How is it possible?

395
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,820
Tong Xi, are you going to meet Qing He?

396
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,470
Yes.

397
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,270
During the reorganized-autograph session.

398
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,590
Why? You're going too?

399
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,190
She is abnormal.

400
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,670
Guys.

401
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,990
Has everyone prepared Fisherman

402
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,950
for Mr. Jia's next open class?

403
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,740
I hope that you guys
don't ever talk about something

404
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,870
that is irrelevant to
the academic in the classroom.

405
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,140
Especially Wang Yi Ming.

406
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,950
Please don't affect
other students' studies.

407
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,070
Class monitor, I noticed that you...

408
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,310
I'm sure I don't have to tell you

409
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,780
the importance of this open class.

410
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,540
Rest assured, sir.

411
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,860
I'll do my job for sure,

412
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,590
and try not to embarrass Xi Zhong.

413
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,230
That's all?

414
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,750
The standard you set
for yourself is too low.

415
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,750
I...

416
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,510
I'll do my best and

417
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,750
try to impress the leaders,

418
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,870
to win honour for Xi Zhong.

419
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:34,990
That's right.

420
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:38,350
This is the motivation and spirit
that a young teacher

421
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,150
should have.

422
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:39,540
Yes, yes.

423
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,870
You knew it too. This open class

424
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,470
doesn't just affect the evaluation
of your position title,

425
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,630
it also represents the images

426
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,710
and abilities of young teachers
in Xi Hai's middle schools.

427
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,630
So...

428
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,790
So failure is not an option.

429
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,870
Good, this is all I'm waiting for.

430
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,820
Director, the leaders are here.

431
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:57,550
Okay, I understand.

432
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,070
Mr. Jia,

433
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,830
let's go into battle.

434
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,630
Yes, sir.

435
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,030
Director, let's go.

436
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,500
You can do it.

437
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,470
The theme of today's class

438
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,310
is the landscape mood of the ancient poem.

439
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,830
Our extensive and profound Chinese culture

440
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,500
nurtured

441
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,630
countless scholars throughout history.

442
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,870
They used their pen

443
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,750
to write their sentiment on the world.

444
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:26,270
Didn't matter it was the court and
temple or the flowers and woods.

445
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:29,150
They were the objects
the poets discussed and recited.

446
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,630
As for the landscape of our country,

447
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,990
they couldn't help but to recite it

448
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:37,390
while they were fascinated.

449
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,110
Okay, fellow students.

450
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,670
Our class is coming to an end.

451
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,350
In order to help everyone

452
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,750
to understand the artistic
conception of ancient poems

453
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,990
and to show our students' talent,

454
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,060
we've prepared a post-credits scene,

455
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,790
which is to present the understanding of

456
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,190
the landscape poetry in painting form.

457
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,710
We'll draw Fisherman in this class.

458
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,030
I present our class monitor.

459
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,150
Mr. Jia, I wish to recommend a student.

460
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,430
You want to recommend a student, right?

461
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,470
Okay, no problem.

462
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,750
Who do you want to recommend?

463
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,110
I wish to recommend

464
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,430
Tong Xi.

465
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,750
Everyone knows that

466
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,030
the our class' awarded blackboard drawing

467
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,550
is Tong Xi's artwork.

468
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,310
So, she is more appropriate for sure.

469
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,110
Yes, Tong Xi is good at drawing.

470
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,070
The blackboard drawing of our class
is her art piece too.

471
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,270
Tong Xi has good grades
and she is talented too.

472
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,630
She is a little goddess in our class.

473
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,110
Okay, then. Tong Xi,

474
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,630
come give it a try.

475
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,110
Mr. Jia, I want to draw it too.

476
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,350
I think I'll draw better than her.

477
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,190
Look, our students wish to take part

478
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,020
but we have limited time.

479
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,870
Nan Yi, you can show it to us next time.

480
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,230
Tong Xi.

481
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,590
Come on, welcome.

482
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,390
What are you doing? This is open class.

483
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,940
Why do you want to fight?

484
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:50,190
Mr. Jia, I have to draw Fisherman, right?

485
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,030
Yes, I'll recite the poem
and you'll draw it.

486
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,390
Just draw what you think.

487
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,670
Relax, take it easy.

488
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,700
Liu Zong Yuan, Fisherman.

489
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,910
By the west cliff, an old fisherman
anchors for the night.

490
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:14,950
At dawn, he dips from the clear stream
and cooks over a bamboo fire.

491
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:18,110
When the sun rises,
the mists thin, he's out of sight.

492
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,150
A creak of the oars, a drowsy spell
the green hills acquire.

493
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,270
In mid-stream, he turns
to look at his camp-site.

494
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:29,070
Where aimless clouds stroll around.
Into what do they inquire?

495
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,990
This is so funny.

496
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,470
Mr. Jia.

497
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,820
The drawing is different.

498
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,190
This is so funny.

499
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,500
Is Tong Xi doing this on purpose?

500
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,180
I knew she can't draw for sure.

501
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,470
Be herself?

502
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,910
I think she would go on pretending

503
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,070
if this didn't happen.

504
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,150
Is this really Tong Xi's drawing?

505
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:22,270
Tong Xi can't hide it anymore.

506
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,950
Look, she is exposed now.

507
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:28,470
No, I think she shouldn't be like this.

508
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:33,030
Tong Xi is called out by Mr. Jia
right after the class.

509
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,030
It can't be something serious, right?

510
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,590
Don't worry, we'll wait and see.

511
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,230
What are you guys worried about?

512
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,790
Don't you think it's strange that

513
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,910
Tong Xi draws something like this?

514
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,550
She is good at drawing.

515
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,190
How could she draw something like this?

516
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,110
Moreover, it is our open class.

517
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,030
Isn't it puzzling as Tong Xi draws

518
00:25:58,910 --> 00:25:59,910
something like this?

519
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,310
Leaders,

520
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,270
we'll summarize today's matter.

521
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,310
Take care, leaders.

522
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,030
Take care.

523
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,070
Goodbye.

524
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,150
Director.

525
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,310
It's all your fault.

526
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,870
Just finish your class nicely will do.

527
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,030
Why do you make all those stuffs
and get yourself in trouble?

528
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,790
Do you think it's a children's show?

529
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,710
You disappoint me!

530
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:35,710
I'm sorry, sir.

531
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,590
Tong Xi.

532
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,150
You left me speechless.

533
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,070
Mr. Jia, I'm sorry.

534
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:57,830
My drawing

535
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,830
has ruined your position title.

536
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,870
I'm really sorry.

537
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,310
Enough.

538
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,580
I didn't blame you.

539
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,750
Why are you crying?

540
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,310
Mr. Jia, why don't you scold me?

541
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,070
Or you can just hit me.

542
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,950
Why would I do that?

543
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:18,870
Forget it.

544
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,660
I shouldn't have put pressure on you

545
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,270
about the evaluation of my job title.

546
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,630
Just wipe your tears away.

547
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:24,950
Or else other teachers

548
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,310
would think I did something bad to you.

549
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,430
Stop crying.

550
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,310
But, Tong Xi,

551
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,030
I was wondering

552
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,150
what had happened to you as you were

553
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,550
great at drawing the blackboard drawing.

554
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,510
Sorry, Mr. Jia.

555
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,550
I was not the one

556
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,980
who drew the blackboard drawing.

557
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,060
I was faking it.

558
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,150
Do you think Mr. Jia is angry?

559
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,670
He doesn't even come to class.

560
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,350
Of course.

561
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,110
Tong Xi has ruined

562
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,430
his perfect open class.

563
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,630
He is angry for sure.

564
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,870
I would've got pissed off if I were him.

565
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,430
Xiao Wan, don't you think so?

566
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,830
I think Tong Xi

567
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,790
messed up this open class on purpose.

568
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,710
Everyone knows

569
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,950
how important today's open class

570
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,310
is to Mr. Jia.

571
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,910
That is why

572
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,380
I'm willing to give
this opportunity to Tong Xi.

573
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:37,270
Hoping that she could draw a nice drawing

574
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,590
like the blackboard drawing
to win honour for our class.

575
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,790
But I never thought she'd do that.

576
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:45,230
Right, I agree with the class monitor.

577
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,470
She did it on purpose.

578
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:47,630
Why?

579
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,630
What are you basing this on?

580
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,230
What did I say?

581
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,150
You said Tong Xi ruined
the open class on purpose.

582
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,110
Then can you explain why

583
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,070
Tong Xi would do that as she has

584
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,110
no quarrel with Mr. Jia?

585
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,790
She already did it.

586
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,030
How am I supposed to know why?

587
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,790
So, you can't explain the reason too.

588
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:19,070
You're the class monitor,
you should be discreet.

589
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,670
Stop making such an accusation.

590
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,350
Then can you tell us why Tong Xi

591
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,910
drew such an awful painting today

592
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,830
as she could draw a nice
blackboard drawing before

593
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,710
if she didn't do it on purpose?

594
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,750
Forget it, you don't
need to explain to them.

595
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,470
I got it.

596
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,470
If she didn't do it on purpose,

597
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,830
this only proves that
she can't draw at all.

598
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,590
She was not the one who drew this poster.

599
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,630
Stop talking drawing!

600
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,110
Look at you, I must have guessed it right.

601
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,420
Tong Xi is a liar!

602
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,950
You're going too far.

603
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,030
Why don't you prove that I'm wrong?

604
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,510
If you can't prove it,

605
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,390
this means that Tong Xi is a liar.

606
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,750
Tong Xi is not such kind of person!

607
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,710
What are you doing?

608
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:01,990
All of you, sit down!
