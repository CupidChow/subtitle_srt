what matters is uniformity and tidiness.

In addition to the basic Waltz movements,

you may add in some Tango, Cha Cha

00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,070
Ever since I could remember,

338
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,630
she wanted me to dance ballet.

339
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,590
Nothing could stop her.

340
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,950
However, she's forcing

341
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,020
her dream on me.

342
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,150
That's so unfair.

343
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,750
Tong Tong, what is your dream?

344
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:36,940
I'm not sure.

345
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,150
I'll listen to Mom's arrangement for now.

346
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:50,950
How about you, Dad?

347
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,470
Is writing novel still your dream?

348
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,030
Yes, I'm very sure of that.

349
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,910
It's good to have a dream.

350
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,270
However, it's a huge price to pay.

351
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,710
In order to fulfil my dream,

352
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,390
your mum has sacrificed so much.

353
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,710
I also feel that I've wronged you too.

354
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:11,630
No...

355
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,470
Don't say that.

356
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,550
Dad.

357
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,340
I support your choice.

358
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,230
I always think that

359
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,510
people who persist 
in pursuing their dreams are mighty.

360
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,500
However, dad,

361
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,430
you've been persisting for so many years

362
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,510
but you have not succeeded.

363
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,390
Don't you feel defeated?

364
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,670
Sometime, I do feel defeated.

365
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,750
However, I love writing.

366
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,910
Therefore, I'm happy most of the time.

367
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,790
Perhaps the pleasure

368
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,670
is what keeps me going.

369
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,990
Happy birthday.

370
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,510
-Why are you here?
-Why are you here?

371
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,890
[Xi Hai Theatre]

372
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,230
One, two, three, four,

373
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,630
five, six, seven and eight.

374
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,470
That's all for today.

375
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,660
Dismiss.

376
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,710
Ms. Hui, are you not leaving?

377
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,830
My daughter 
is taken care by someone today.

378
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,020
I'll take the chance to work overtime.

379
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,030
You may leave first.

380
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:12,950
We'll get going then.

381
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,100
-Bye.
-Bye.

382
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,310
Hello.

383
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,350
Is this Mr. Jia?

384
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,470
I'm Tong Xi's mum.

385
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,230
I'm occupied with settling down.

386
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,590
That's why I didn't have time 
to pay you a visit.

387
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,270
It's like this.

388
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,790
I would like to pay you a visit at school

389
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,630
to get an understanding 
of Tong Xi's performance.

390
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,990
I would like to communicate with you

391
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,310
about her future plan.

392
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,700
Sure, how about next Monday?

393
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,430
I'll see you at school.

394
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,310
Sure, goodbye.

395
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,180
You haven't told me

396
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,110
what send you here?

397
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,550
I'm here 
to pass the birthday present to your dad.

398
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,070
How about you?

399
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,070
Hold on.

400
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,510
This is my dad's place.

401
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,870
I don't need a reason to be here.

402
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,430
You make me feel like an outsider.

403
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,270
Yes, no one is outsider here.

404
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,350
Nan Yi, just make yourself at home.

405
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,990
Don't constraint yourself 
just because Tong Tong is here.

406
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,310
By the way, Nan Yi,

407
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,950
I've amended my work.

408
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,020
Please have a read when you're free.
Give me some suggestions.

409
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,070
Sure.

410
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,870
Is it the same novel I read last time?

411
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,980
I think the novel that 
I read last time is good.

412
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,070
It will be published for sure.

413
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,150
I'm embarrassed.

414
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,110
He's published a novel at a young age.

415
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,100
Are you two close to each other?

416
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:35,710
Yes.

417
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,350
Nan Yi is my reader.

418
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,830
I'm Nan Yi's

419
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:46,550
close friend despite our age gap.

420
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,230
Close friend?

421
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,470
Yes, Nan Yi

422
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,390
is quite talented

423
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,430
in drawing.

424
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,470
I'm not.

425
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,670
You're really talented in writing novel.

426
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,390
Are you still 
studying Rembrandt's drawing?

427
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,230
I prefer "Holy Family".

428
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,150
The light in the drawing was epic.

429
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,230
Dad, let me help you.

430
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,110
It's okay.

431
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,510
Dad, how did you

432
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,910
meet Lin Nan Yi?

433
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,950
I feel as if he's your real son.

434
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:24,470
Yes, Lin Nan Yi 
is closer to me than my real son.

435
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,990
We met each other

436
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,190
because of you.

437
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,470
Because of me?

438
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,150
Yes.

439
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,470
What are you looking at? Let's go.

440
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,030
Xiao Hui.

441
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,990
Can I talk to Tong Tong?

442
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,830
Tong Tong, 
I can't keep you company from now on.

443
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,110
When you're in Da Cheng,

444
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,590
you must listen to your mum.

445
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:50,020
Dad, take care of yourself.

446
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,750
If anyone dares to bully you,

447
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,790
I'll beat him up.

448
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,190
Mr. Tong.

449
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,310
Where is Tong Xi?

450
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,950
Tong Xi has gone to Da Cheng with her mum.

451
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,710
She's left?

452
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,350
Mr. Tong.

453
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:49,150
Can I stay here for a while?

454
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,150
Sure.

455
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,510
Since then,

456
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,030
Nan Yi came here very often.

457
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,110
Then, we slowly became close.

458
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:28,710
So, he actually came here that day.

459
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,830
So, my letters...

460
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,070
What letter?

461
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,070
After leaving for Da Cheng,

462
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,790
I always wrote to you, right?

463
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,430
Actually, I wrote to him too.

464
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,350
Nan Yi didn't tell me about that.

465
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:46,990
By the way,

466
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,510
not long after you left,

467
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,590
Nan Yi moved to Mint Garden.

468
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,030
Did you post the letters

469
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,030
to his old address?

470
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,910
Well...

471
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,510
You're the one who recorded the video

472
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,750
where I danced badly, right?

473
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,510
Thanks.

474
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,270
By the way,

475
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,230
I heard from my dad that

476
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:26,030
you've been tidying up the garden for him.

477
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,030
Yes.

478
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,580
Your dad thinks that

479
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,510
I'm keeping my garden well.

480
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,710
That's why he hired me 
to tidy up his garden.

481
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,270
I'm doing it to make some money.

482
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,150
Don't your parents work?

483
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,020
Why do you need to work at Blue Elephant

484
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,590
and tidy up someone else's 
garden to make money?

485
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:48,390
Is it weird to sustain my own life?

486
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,260
It's weird.

487
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,670
Ever since I knew that you stayed alone,

488
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,870
I knew that something is wrong.

489
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,910
Since I've grown up, 
I decided to live alone.

490
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,550
How old are you?

491
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,110
So, you go to school on your own

492
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,910
and cook for yourself?

493
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,550
You're working at Blue Elephant too.

494
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,430
Do you make money

495
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,670
to pay off your living expenses 
and tuition fees?

496
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,430
Every month, my parents

497
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,550
give me pocket money too.

498
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,310
However, I don't live with them.

499
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,430
If you don't want to talk about it,
just forget it.

500
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,470
I know you and my dad

501
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,870
are hiding something from me.

502
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:27,430
Is it so difficult to admit that 
I'm adorable?

503
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,470
In that case,

504
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,510
you need to address me as big brother.
