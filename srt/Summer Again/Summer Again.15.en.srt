00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,390
Why there's an arrow here?

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,950
I didn't see it on my way in.

4
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,910
That's Blue Gourami.

5
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,870
Tiny and lively,

6
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,590
it is also adaptable.

7
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,310
But because it's adaptable

8
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,510
and pretty,

9
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,310
it becomes an ornamental fish.

10
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,629
That's pity.

11
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,870
But they always seek joy amidst sorrow.

12
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,030
Ongoing hardships

13
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,870
can't stop them from
being passionate about life.

14
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,430
They swim around,

15
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:15,020
seemingly free.

16
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,630
So, you brought me here

17
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,310
to let me feel

18
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,750
the passion for life?

19
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,230
Not only that.

20
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,230
I also want to tell you,

21
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,830
not to be bounded by troubles.

22
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,470
Live like the little fish. Happy,

23
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,310
and joyful.

24
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,190
Yeah.

25
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,070
We're not free,

26
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,470
but they look really happy.

27
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,830
I understand now.

28
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,229
Thanks, Nan Yi.

29
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,509
At our age,

30
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,229
we're unable to change our parents

31
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,350
or the world,

32
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,150
but the one thing we can change

33
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,190
is the way we think.

34
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,110
When you live with positivity,

35
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,870
all problems can be solved.

36
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,229
As you'll always make the right choice.

37
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,390
Hey, we're still in the game.

38
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,110
The cat and the mouse have been talking.

39
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,630
Tao Zhu and Wang Yi Ming must be worried.

40
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,670
We should look for them.

41
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,710
Let's go.

42
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,270
Pay attention

43
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,390
if Tong Xi and him are here.

44
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,390
Forget it.

45
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,790
We've been here for 20 minutes.

46
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,670
They either went the wrong way

47
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,910
or have given up.

48
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,710
Anyway, the mice have won.

49
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,670
Maybe we're hiding too deep.

50
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,870
Why don't

51
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,630
we give them some clues?

52
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,910
I got up too early.

53
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,110
Wake me up when they're here.

54
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,150
All you know is sleep.

55
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,950
Look, Senior Xu Ao

56
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,590
is already preparing for Arts Festival.

57
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:11,860
Now look at you.

58
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,150
Useless.

59
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,470
Why bring him up again?

60
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,190
He came to me two days ago,

61
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,910
asking me to return to the drama club.

62
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,750
I said yes.

63
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,910
You just go back as he asked you to?

64
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,510
Keep your voice down.

65
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,829
No guts.

66
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,430
Don't you know Xu Ao?

67
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,310
According to Socrates,

68
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,670
no man ever steps in the same river twice.

69
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,030
Yet, you jumped in willingly,

70
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:40,950
and enjoyed that.

71
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,310
No.

72
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,420
We have gotten things straight.

73
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,070
He and Xiao Qing

74
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,500
are not what I thought they are.

75
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,790
Besides,

76
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,390
the audition of the club

77
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,829
didn't involve personal feelings.

78
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,350
I was just less competent.

79
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,630
Since things are clear now,

80
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,670
I don't want to be on the outs

81
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,830
with Senior Xu Ao anymore.

82
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:04,950
Also,

83
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,350
as far as I know,

84
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,740
Socrates didn't say that.

85
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,750
It was Plato.

86
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,390
Are you sure you're going back?

87
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,790
Don't be mad. That's scary.

88
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,630
Don't touch me!

89
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,230
You're not my friend!

90
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:21,350
Hopeless girl!

91
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,070
What a disgrace!

92
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,750
What's wrong with him?

93
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,909
Get on.

94
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:41,750
No.

95
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,190
Don't you think they

96
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:46,950
look strange?

97
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,030
When you leave two mice at one place,

98
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,630
they'll surely fight.

99
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,750
Lin Nan Yi, I'm being serious here.

100
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,909
I'm serious too.

101
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,230
Wang Yi Ming, don't push your luck.

102
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,070
This is your last chance.

103
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,790
Will you get on?

104
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,150
Can you hear them?

105
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,590
No.

106
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,870
Stop moving or get off.

107
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,380
I'm uncomfortable here.

108
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,550
You be the rider then.

109
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,190
I...

110
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,790
I can't ride!

111
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,910
Then keep your mouth shut.

112
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,350
What a trouble.

113
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,910
Stop looking. Let's go.

Episode 15: Happy Birthday, Tong Xi]

[Adapted from
Huo He's comic, "Mint Love".]

117
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,950
Where is the cake from?

118
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,830
The owner knows me well.

119
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,110
You can't buy it anywhere.

120
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,940
As it was made specially
for you by someone.

121
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,510
Okay.

122
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,190
I'll let the birthday girl off.

123
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,550
Come on, put the candle on.

124
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,350
Next,

125
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,270
it's my favourite part.

126
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,910
All singing together.

127
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,190
Ready. Go.

128
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:20,390
Happy birthday to you.

129
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:24,030
Happy birthday to you.

130
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,030
Happy birthday to you.

131
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:32,790
Happy birthday to you.

132
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,350
Thanks, guys.

-Make your wish.
-Make three wishes.

134
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,950
Say two out loud,
and keep one for yourself.

135
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,470
My first wish,

136
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,420
I hope Dad and Mum

137
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,590
will always be healthy and blessed.

138
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,380
My second wish,

139
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,190
I hope we'll be best friends forever.

140
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:53,830
My third wish.

141
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,350
Done.

142
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,150
What's your third wish?

143
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,190
I can't tell.

144
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,550
Don't ask, or it won't come true.

All these years,

147
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,790
I've never bought you gifts.

148
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,670
See if you like it.

149
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,350
Thanks, Dad.

150
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,310
I love it.

151
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,230
I'm glad then.

152
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,710
Here, keep it.

153
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,790
Happy birthday, pretty.

Here you go.

156

What's that?

160
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,790
My game account

161
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,070
and its password on all platforms.

162
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,430
She can play it when she's bored

163
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,870
to release stress.

164
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,790
Who'd want to play that?

165
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,350
It's better than giving her a ball.

166
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,780
Tong Xi.

167
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,070
Well...

Don't go for ranks.

169
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:52,950
Okay.

170
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:58,630
Where's your gift?

171
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,710
It's here, isn't it?

172
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,790
The cake.

173
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,190

00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,710
How thoughtful.

177
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,550
[Another summer,]

178
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,990
[I'm one year older.]

179
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,430
[People who care about you]

180
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,470
[don't care how mature,]

181
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,270
[independent or reliable you've become.]

182
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,030
[To them, it's better]

183
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,750
[if you stay the same and
naive after you've grown up,]

184
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,429
[as tough as the mint.]

185
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,150
[And they'll be]

186
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,150
[keeping your simple joy]

[as they see you
grow into your best self.]

188
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,110
Hey,

189
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,350
thanks for today.

190
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,910
As long as you're happy.

191
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,110
I'll go up then.

192
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,430
Tong Xi.

193
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,550
Your birthday gift.

194
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,750
Isn't the cake my gift?

195
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,220
Open it.

196
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,230
The necklace.

197
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,910
Do you remember?

198
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,830
That's the dowry

199
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,470
you gave me as a kid.

200
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,060
I thought I lost it

201
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,430
on the day I left.

202
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,030
I picked it back up.

203
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,750
It means a great deal, after all.

204
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,510
I want you

205
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,630
to keep it for me.

206
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,990
After we get into the university,

207
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,470
and go further,

208
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,670
you may give it back.

209
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,790
Give it back?

210
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,060
That's from Lin Nan Yi.

211
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,030
Here's another one.

212
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,510
From Qing He.

213
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,700
I've had the drawings ready long ago,

214
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,470
and scanned the coloured
version into the computer.

215
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,950
I hope you'll see it

216
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,620
in the coming Mint.

217
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,820
The draft is yours now.

218
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,140
I think

219
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,310
our childhood

220
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,910
is the most unforgettable time.

221
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,060
I drew it down,

222
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,230
so that it stays forever.

223
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,100
For the sake of my sincerity,

224
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,740
don't charge me for copyright.

225
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:51,830
Mum.

226
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,150
Mum, the dress was given by dad.

227
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,030
And on my birthday, Tao Zhu...

228
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,510
Where have you been?

229
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,390
Stand against the wall. Fix your position.

230
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:08,910
Your legs.

231
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,790
You're getting better at it, huh?

232
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,030
Skipping the dance class

233
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,590
and even tell lies.

234
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,830
If you have so much energy,

235
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,910
stay up all night

236
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,470
and stand here for as
long as your lesson lasts.

237
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,510
It was only for today.

238
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,750
I usually go to class on time.

239
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,470
Shut up.

240
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,350
Don't give me that after
you skipped your class.

241
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:34,980
I'd give anything up

242
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,710
for you.

243
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,350
But you?

244
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,790
How did you repay me?

245
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,590
Given how you are,

246
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,870
if you don't work hard,

247
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,030
will you be a ballerina

248
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,660
or get into a ballet academy

249
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,910
and compete with others?

250
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,790
Have you thought about that?

251
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,110
Where's your brain?

252
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:51,950
You

253
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,790
and your dad,

254
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,430
like father like daughter.

255
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,470
I'm so disappointed.

256
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,070
Think about that yourself.

257
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,110
I'm good-for-nothing.

258
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,430
I've let you down.

259
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,910
But today is my birthday.

260
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,710
You didn't even bother

261
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,590
to wish me.

262
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,670
It hurts. I don't want to dance anymore.

263
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,070
What do you want to do then?

264
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,230
Save it.

265
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,470
Do it right or
don't even think about eating.

266
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,870
Fine. I don't want to dance anyway.

267
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,590
What can you do in
the future if not dance?

268
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,110
I just don't want to dance. No.

Was she?

She isn't worried about me,

356
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,190
but me skipping the ballet class.

357
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,510

358
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,750
what happens to me.

359
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,150
Of course she will.

362
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,190

363
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,270
and brought you back to Xi Hai

364
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,750
to ask me to each you ballet,

365
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,510

She moved back to Xi Hai for your sake.

369
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,230
Earlier this year, she came

370
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,470
and asked me to teach you ballet.

371
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,590

But I've known your mum for years.

381
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,910
Although stubborn about dance,

382
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,030
she's not unreasonable.

383
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,030
I believe that with more

384
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,390

So, she sent it here.

But you were absent.

00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,430
I have chronic appendicitis lately.

518
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,950
My stomach hurts.

519
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,070
How can you perform?

520
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,180
Are you alright?

521
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,190
Tao Zi,

522
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,110
take her to the infirmary.

523
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,550
Okay.

524
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,350
The Arts Festival's audition is tomorrow.

525
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:35,390
Where can we find her replacement?

526
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,190
Hold on.

527
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,030
Zhang Kai, you take her to the infirmary.

528
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,510
Okay.

529
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,430
Tao Zi, you stay here.

530
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:43,860
Here.

531
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,310
-Be careful.
-I will.

532
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:49,110
You've been wanting to
perform on stage, right?

533
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,900
Come on, you may

534
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,190
take her place.

535
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,750
Me?

536
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,430
I'm counting on you.

537
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,070
I'm counting on you.

538
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:15,070
Xi Hai, are you ready?

539
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:33,990
What's that?

540
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,390
Tao Zi.

541
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,590
What's with your costume?

542
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,220
Relax, Tong Xi.

543
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,230
Just relax.

544
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,510
Your show has been chosen. You'll be fine.

545
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,830
Unlike us.

546
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,110
We may not get selected.

547
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,830
Anyway, just do your best.

548
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,870
Are all the shows

549
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,350
of Xi Hai Arts Festival performed here?

550
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,470
Yes, today's audition

551
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,350
is kind of a rehearsal.

552
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,470
Besides school teams,

553
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,910
other organisations are joining too.

554
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,150
Some are really good.

555
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,710
But no worries.

556
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,990
Just try your best.

557
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,820
Let's get on the big stage together.

558
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,190
All the best.

559
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,580
Bye.

560
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:26,550
[Coming up next, The Wizard of Oz
by Xi Hai High School.]

561
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,310
Perhaps you've forgotten.

562
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,030
I'm Dorothy.

563
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,910
I'm going back to Emerald City.

564
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,350
Great Oz, please take me to...

565
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:38,990
Kansas.

566
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:48,070
An empty shell

567
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,270
may be fearless.

568
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,020
But why do I feel much sorrow?

569
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,230
Because I longed to become a human

570
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,190
and have a heart.

571
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,830
If I only had a heart,

572
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,030
I'd know the meaning of love.

573
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,230
If I only had a heart,

574
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,150
I'd sing praises to the world.

575
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,630
If I only had a heart,

576
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,910
I could be with my dearest one.

577
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,830
How wonderful it would be.

578
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,350
Now,

579
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,830
I'm reluctant to say goodbye now.

580
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,830
I love you all.

581
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,870
Goodbye, Tin Man.

582
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,950
Now, I finally have a heart.

583
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,470
As it has been torn to pieces.

584
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:50,710
Dorothy, be brave, be tough.

585
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,430
I love you.

586
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:02,470
My heart aches.

587
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:07,750
Bow.

588
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:33,350
[Look. Lin Nan Yi can draw.]

589
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,270
[Tong Xi can dance.]

00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,590
[While I]

591
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,150
[am learning how to act.]

592

[I didn't join the drama club for anyone,]

593
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,350
[but my drama career.]

594
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:45,190
I want to be the nation's best warrior.

595
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,030
Let's go.

596
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,740
I'm Dorothy.

597
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,150
I'm going to Emerald City.

598
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,550
Great Oz, take me to

599
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,670
Kansas.

600
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,270
Someone gave me a pot of Mint.

601
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,070
And I've planted another pot

602
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:23,910
for you.

603
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,750
You plant it yourself?

604
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,230
Cut. Okay.

605
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,150
Cut. Okay.
