[that your idol is

[will you be happy?]

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,070
I'm so stupid.

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,550
There were so many obvious hints
in front of me,

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,870
yet, I actually didn't realise it at all.

9

[look just like you.]

13
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,550
You look exactly the same

14
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,830
as the female lead when I look at you
from this angle.

15
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,310
Your elbow is hurt.

16
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,310
I have a band-aid in my bag.

17
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,110
Let me find it for you.

18
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,990
What's with your hand?

19
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,390
Why is there blood on your shirt?

20
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,470
I hurt myself by accident
when I was buying some goods.

21
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,910
Lin Nan Yi,

22
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,190
you've spent so much effort
in order to hide this from me.

23
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,950
You still dare to say that
you didn't hide your identity on purpose?

24
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,550
I don't understand
why you have such thinking.

25
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,789
Why must you pretend to be someone else?

26
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,230
You looked adorable when you were young.

27
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,270
Tong Xi,

28
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,670
you are who you are.

29
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:18,870
The true you

30
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,350
is likeable enough.

31
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,150
You...

32
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,630
You're Qing He?

33
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:24,820
Yes.

34
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,390
I'm Qing He.

35
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,550
You told me

36
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,750
to be the real me.

37
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,630
In the end, you're not being the real you.

38
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,509
Lin Nan Yi,

39
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:48,270
I don't ever want to see you again.

40
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,550

be reminded of him again.

Let me emphasise this again.

43

The end semester exam
will come in a few weeks.

44

You guys better pull yourself together

45
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,310
and do your revisions.

[Adapted from
Huo He's comic, "Mint Love".]

This exam

52
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,310
is a placement exam for you guys

for this exam.

Understood.

Alright, class dismissed.

It's almost the end of the semester?

But, it felt like school just reopened
not long ago.

61

Tong Xi, we'll be divided according
to our subjects soon.

You've been distracted since this morning.

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,820
You didn't read the latest chapter
of Mint as well.

70
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,510
You didn't respond
when I told you about Guru Qing He.

71
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,670
Don't mention Qing He in front of me.

72
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,470
What's wrong with you?

73
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,910
You don't like Guru Qing He anymore?

74
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,790
I don't want any comics!

75

Tong Xi, can we have a chat?

79
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,190

where's Tong Xi?

84
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,430
Will she be absent today?

85
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,830
I think so.

86
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,030
I don't think so.

87
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,550
She doesn't have any ballet lessons
to attend today.

88
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,590
Let me give her a call.

89
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,110
Call her then.

90
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,709
Hello, Tong Xi?

91
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,070
All of us are at Blue Elephant right now.

How is it? Did she pick up?

98
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:30,910
How is it? Did she pick up?

99
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,270
She said she was feeling uncomfortable.

100
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,350
She's not coming.

101
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,070
Strange. She was fine this morning.

102
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,270
Why did she feel uncomfortable
all of a sudden?

103
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,510
She's not even coming to Blue Elephant.

104
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,909
Lin,

105
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,740
did you make her angry?

106
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,230
Did you make her angry?

107
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,990
There's nothing between you two, right?

108
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,470
There's nothing between you two, right?

109
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:54,909
Wait,

110
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,430
I understand now.

111
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:57,710
Lin,

112
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,630
did you fall in love with someone else?

113
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,070
Everyone's here?

114
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,110
The semester will end soon.

115
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,670
I knew you wouldn't do your revision.

116
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,830
That's why I'm here to supervise you.

117
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,190
Wang Yi Ming.

118
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,150
Do you guys want to join our revision?

119
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:26,910
This is interesting.

120
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:31,910
What drinks do you want?

121
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,950
Summer is coming.

122
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,230
Give me

123
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,470
a glass of mint lemonade.

124
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:02,030
[Yes, I'm Qing He.]

125
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,550
This is so frustrating!

126
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,940
Can't I think of anything else?

127
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,030
Yes, calm down.

128
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,470
Think about the subject I should read
after the Maths paper.

129
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,070
Do I study Physics first?

130
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,380
Or do I study Geography first?

131
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:28,940
Mum?

132
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,310
You scared me.

133
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,310
You're back already?

134
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,830
I came back to do my homework.

135
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,670
The semester will end soon.
I have plenty of homework to finish.

136
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,750
Mum, why did you return so early today?

137
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,150
I applied for leave this afternoon.

138
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,870
I went to find Mr. Xu

139
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,110
to discuss about your special training
for the coming summer.

140
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,630
What special training?

141
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,190
Special training for the coming summer.

142
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:55,390
We've agreed on a deal.

143
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,150
After your exam,

144
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,510
you'll attend ballet lessons

145
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,670
twice per day.

146
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,710
You'll practise when you're at home.

147
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,790
We'll maintain this
until you reach 11th Grade.

148
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,150
I have to spend my holiday like this?

149
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,310
Of course.

150
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,110
You'll be in 11th Grade soon.

151
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,510
You'll participate in the audition soon.

152
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,190
You have plenty of competitors
out there, you know?

153
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,790
Of course you need to prepare yourself
beforehand.

154
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,350
But...

155
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,230
No buts.

156
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,070
Not only do you need to practise
during summer,

157
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,830
when school reopens,

158
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,740
you need to attend Mr. Xu's lessons
after class,

159
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,430
until you enter a dance academy.

160
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,670
You think so too?

161
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,270
I'm sure it isn't that simple.

162
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,540
Do you think I won't notice it

163
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,630
when you're able to notice it?

164
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,990
Last time, when Tong Xi
was staying at my house,

165
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,430
whenever I talked about Lin Nan Yi,

166
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,390
I felt that there's something

167
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,510
between them

168
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,550
judging from her response.

169
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,310
I was so close to finding out the truth.

170
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,590
It's a pity that something
has to occur at the most crucial moment.

171
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,710
You see,

172
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,909
it's either Tong Xi's senior
from Da Cheng

173
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,110
or Ni Xiao Wan.

174
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,190
But, Tong Xi has confirmed this herself.

175
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,950
She only has pure admiration
for Senior Wei Ze.

176
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,070
It's not what you think.

177
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,470
If so, Ni Xiao Wan must be the problem

178
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,260
between them.

179
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,460
Here's my analysis.

180
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,870
Tong Xi thinks that Lin is a nice guy.

181
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,420
She wants to get closer to him.

182
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,300
But, at the same time,

183
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,180
Tong Xi realised

184
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,350
that Lin has a great relationship
with Ni Xiao Wan.

185
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,750
That's why she's enraged.

186
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,110
Lin thinks that he won't be able
to hide the truth any longer.

187
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,630
That's why he tried to coax Tong Xi.

188
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,110
But Tong Xi doesn't listen to him at all.

189
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,510
She's not even willing to see him.

190
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,510
At this moment,

191
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,669
Ni Xiao Wan is taking advantage
of the situation.

192
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,669
She went to Blue Elephant

193
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,230
as she tries to win Lin's heart

194
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,030
by using their revision as an excuse.

195
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,030
My logic is impeccable.

196
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,710
Call me Sherlock Wang.

197
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,470
What nonsense are you spouting?

198
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,340
Even my mother doesn't enjoy
a lousy drama plot like this.

199
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,550
So, according to your analysis,

200
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,110
Lin is a scum.

201
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,150
That's not it.

202
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,940
Lin isn't that kind of person.

203
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,630
Now that we understand what's going on,

204
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,470
we can't pretend to be ignorant anymore.

205
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,590
We need to do something about it.

206
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,860
We need to create opportunities

207
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,350
for them to have a private conversation.

208
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:10,870
Let's go.

209
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,540
Wait for me!

210
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,150
Hurry up.

211
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,710
[We're out of fresh mint leaves
at the moment.]

212
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,070
I can't make you a glass of mint lemonade.

213
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,510
I made a cup of milk tea for you instead.

214
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,510
That's fine.

215
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,700
I love milk tea as well.

216
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,750
Thank you, Nan Yi.

217
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,100
I'm sorry. I mean Lin Nan Yi.

218
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,190
Seems like you're in a bad mood.

219
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,670
Did you bicker with Tong Xi?

220
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,670
Did you two argue with each other?

221
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:54,990
No.

222
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,670
I saw that she was ignoring you today.

223
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,070
I thought there's a misunderstanding
between you two.

224
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,230
It's nothing.

225
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,580
You're overthinking it.

226
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:13,790
Lin Nan Yi,

227
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,350
actually, I've always been
curious about this.

228
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,470
You and Tong Xi have only been classmates
for half a semester.

229
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,030
Why do you have such
a great relationship with her?

230
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,870
Is it because you two knew each other
since young?

231
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,270
Maybe.

232
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,270
She's kind and friendly.

233
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,510
I feel comfortable spending time with her.

234
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:35,990
Friendly?

235
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,140
[So, that's the type of girl]

236
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,950
[you admire.]

237
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,830
Hello, Ke'er?

238
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:58,430
Do you think I give out an aggressive vibe

239
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,590
usually?

240
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,820
Am I not friendly enough?

241
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,350
[How is that possible?]

242
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,950
[You're our beloved class monitor.]

243
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,430
[You're the nicest.]

244
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,950
[Of course you're friendly.]

245
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,350
I think it's because

246
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,830
I've been trying to compete against

247
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,870
Tong Xi.

248
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,350
That's why I left a bad impression.

249
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,270
It's fine then.

250
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,030
I'll try to be friendlier

251
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,270
and more positive in the future.

252
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,070
[Tong Xi,]

253
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,750
[I've been looking for you]

254
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,470
[for the past few days]

255
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,670
[so that I can explain
the situation to you.]

256
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,030
[But, I couldn't find a suitable chance.]

257
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,830
[I can only contact you
through messaging you.]

258
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,950
[When you first came back,]

259
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,150
[I realised that you were
reading my comics.]

260
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,310
[But, I didn't know about your ID.]

261
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,510
[And I didn't tell you]

262
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,950
[that I was Qing He.]

263
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,870
[When the mysterious incident happened,]

264
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,990
[I got to know that you were that
special fan of mine]

265
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,330
[by accident.]

266
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,470
[Back then, I was pretty happy.]

267
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,790
[I wanted to]

268
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,750
[chat with you with my other persona.]

269
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,390
[But, after our chat,]

270
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,350
[I lost the courage to
tell you the truth.]

271
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,590
[During the signing event,]

272
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,790
[I wore a chicken mask]

273
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,470
[in order to hide my identity from you.]

274
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,670
[I even changed my voice.]

275
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,030
[But, back then, I realised]

276
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,060
[that I was being dishonest]

277
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,430
[when I'm telling you to
be honest to yourself.]

278
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,190
[I know I won't be able to hide this
from you forever.]

279
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,950
[It's just like a bomb]

280
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,950
[hidden between us.]

281
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,940
[It may blow up at any time.]

282
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,870
[It's my fault for
creating this situation.]

283
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,950
[I shouldn't have hidden the truth
from you since the beginning.]

284
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,550
[I hope you can give me a chance
to apologise to you,]

285
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,390
[since you're]

286
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,110
[an important friend to me.]

287
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,030
I'll block you!

288
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,510
I don't need your explanation.

289
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,590
From now on, I'll be at peace.

290
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,350
I'll focus on my future.

291
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:08,830
[By the way,]

292
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,910
[in the past,]

293
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,670
[you told me that you could provide me
with plenty of life experiences]

294
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,350
[so that I can refer them
for my chapters in Mint.]

295
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,390
[I wonder if your promise still counts?]

296
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,070
Your mother is ruthless.

297
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,670
She didn't even let you rest
during the holidays.

298
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,660
She wants you to attend dance lessons?

299
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,310
Yeah. The most beautiful time
of the year, summer,

300
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,550
has ended for me

301
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,030
before it started.

302
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,060
Sorry for interrupting.

303
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,870
This is the summary

304
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,430
I've made for the difficult questions
in our monthly tests.

305
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,230
I've included them in the note.

306
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,390
Tao Zhu, I made one copy for you as well.

307
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,670
You can take a look.

308
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,190
You can ask me

309
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,220
if you have any questions.

310
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,430
You made them especially for us?

311
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,390
It's because we're classmates.

312
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,150
We need to be united.

313
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,470
I must help out my classmates
with kindness.

314
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,550
I must be passionate

315
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,030
towards you guys.

316
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,550
Let's work hard

317
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,550
and score in the end semester exam

318
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,430
so that we can raise the average score
of our class.

319
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,070
Thank you.

320
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,270
Lin Nan Yi,

321
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,390
this is the note

322
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,830
you haven't finished reading yesterday.

323
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,310
I jot down the parts you haven't finished.

324
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,380
Remember to read it.

325
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:11,750
Thanks.

326
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,630
This is...

327
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,990
This is for Wang Yi Ming.

328
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,750
Remember to wake him up later.

329
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,110
Ask him to sleep less and study more.

330
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,950
I didn't expect

331
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,910
Ni Xiao Wan to make notes for us.

332
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,350
Although she did it out of kindness,

333
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,110
I do...

334
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,310
Feel a little bit afraid.

335
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,270
Let me emphasise this again.

336
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,190
The semester will end soon.

337
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,070
You guys should utilise your time fully
and do your revisions.

338
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,190
Don't regret it when you get a low score.

339
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,550
By then, you'll cry together
with your friends

340
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,550
and you won't be able to
enjoy your holiday.

341
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,230
Let's continue.

342
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,830
The memoir stated

343
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,700
is a reference to the memorial

344
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,950
written to the emperor by his subordinate.

345
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,980
So, why did Li Mi write this memorial

346
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,990
to the emperor?

347
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,750
It's because

348
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,510
he was Liu Shan's...

349
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,110
I'm sure everyone knows about
Liu Shan, right?

350
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,030
He's an officer under Liu Shan.

351
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,070
[If you keep writing notes to me,
I'll report it to the teacher]

352
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,350
When the Kingdom of Shu perished,

353
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,190
Li Mi became the officer of
a perished kingdom.

354
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,150
The new court wanted to persuade
the old officials to join them.

355
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,110
That's why Li Mi was enticed.

356
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,430
[If you write notes to me again,
I'll report it to the teacher.]

357
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,150
What should he do?

358
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,630
He said he needs to take care
of his grandmother.

359
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,740
He's trying to delay the appointment
of his position.

360
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,350
Because the Jin Dynasty

361
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,750
emphasises on filial piety,

362
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,110
Emperor Wu of Jin

363
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,870
can't do anything against him.

364
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,030
Because Li Mi is famous for being filial.

365
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,260
Come on, hurry up.

366
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,630
I have a stomachache.

367
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,860
Tao Zi, what's wrong?

368
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,990
Why did your tummy hurt all of a sudden?

369
00:16:58,990 --> 00:16:59,950
Let me send you to the infirmary.

370
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:00,790
No need.

371
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,870
I'll just return home and rest.

372
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,190
You should go to the infirmary.

373
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,900
It'll be bad if it's acute appendicitis.

374
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,869
I'm having my period.

375
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,990
I need to go back and rest.

376
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,150
I'll be fine after
I drink some warm water.

377
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,869
I thought you just had your period
last week?

378
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,510
I was wondering why it hurts so much.

379
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,700
So, it's endocrine dyscrasia.

380
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,069
No one can stand having two periods
in one month.

381
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,270
I'm on duty today.

382
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,550
Tong Xi, can you help me out?

383
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,390
No problem.

384
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,670
I'll send you back first.

385
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,710
I'll finish your duty later.

386
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,870
I'm worried about you.

387
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,190
No need.

388
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,020
I can return by myself.

389
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,510
Goodbye.

390
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,510
By the way, Lin,

391
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,950
I have a basketball match tonight.

392
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,230
It's very important to me.

393
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,390
Do my duty for me.

394
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,630
No objection.

395
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:48,590
See you.

396
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,750
I'll lock the backdoor for you.

397
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,150
And we're done.

398
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,390
Tong Xi, what's wrong?

399
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,710
Let me help you out.

400
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,390
No need.

401
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,230
Are you still angry at me?

402
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,790
You even changed your ID.

403
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,350
Did you see the messages

404
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,030
I sent you last night?

405
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,110
Don't mention the messages to me!

406
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,870
I...

407
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,510
I wasn't playing a trick on you.

408
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,350
And I didn't deceive you on purpose.

409
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,870
I just enjoy the process.

410
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,350
It's because I can talk to you
about anything

411
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,470
on the Internet.

412
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,310
You enjoy the process?

413
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,150
Enjoy what process?

414
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,990
You enjoy playing a trick on me?

415
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,630
It's not that.

416
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,860
After you knew that the ID belongs to me,

417
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,550
how do you feel

418
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,510
when you read the disgusting
and mushy messages

419
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,390
I had sent you?

420
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,510
And the signing event,

421
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,630
when I went to hug you
like a crazy fan girl,

422
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,550
how did you feel back then?

423
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,670
Do you feel disgusted?

424
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,870
What's going on?

425
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,470
They were doing pretty good just now.

426
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:36,950
Why are they arguing with each other?

427
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,150
Go and lock the door.

428
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,310
What's going on?

429
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:58,860
Just stop.

430
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,180
The door is locked.

431
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,270
We're stuck here.

432
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,670
Here's the key.

433
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,140
We're amazing.

434
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,670
Not only did we come up
with solid excuses,

435
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,390
we also created
an intimate environment for them.

436
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,230
I'm sure this time they can
clarify things.

437
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,350
I told you already. Lin is lucky

438
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,590
to have a buddy like me.

439
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,230
You see, you and I

440
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,750
make the perfect combo!

441
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,150
Aren't we great?

442
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,390
We're awesome!

443
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,510
What did you throw away just now?

444
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,110
The key!

445
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,070
The key.

446
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,710
Hey, where did you throw it to?

447
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,430
How should I know?

448
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,110
I think it should be here.

449
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,750
I'm speechless.

450
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,310
How should we let them out now?

451
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,830
Now, you're blaming me?

452
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,150
Would I be so excited as to throw away
the key

453
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,270
if you didn't praise me just now?

454
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,550
You're pushing the blame to me?

455
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,230
Think carefully.

456
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,230
Who else has the spare keys?

457
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,150
There are only three keys.

458
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,390
Two of them are held by
the students who are on duty.

459
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,790
There's another key.

460
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,790
Who has the last key?

461
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,820
Sun Jie Ping.

462
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,070
Where are you going?

463
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,270
To Sun Jie Ping's house.

464
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:22,150
So, is there anything else
you would like to ask?

465
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,990
Just ask me. I'll tell you everything.

466
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,790
When did you start to draw comics?

467
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,350
And, how did you become Qing He?

468
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,230
At first, I drew comics

469
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,190
to kill time.

470
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,590
Back then, I was living by myself.

471
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,910
I was bored out of my mind.

472
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,510
That's why I drew some comic strips.

473
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,950
And I posted them on Tieba.

474
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:50,070
I didn't expect them
to be so well-received.

475
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,830
After that, I turned it into a series.

476
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,710
It became Mint.

477
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,230
So, why did you draw about

478
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,350
a story of a boy and his mother?

479
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,630
It's...

480
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,710
I just think it's pretty interesting.

481
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,150
There's no other reason to it.

482
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:07,910
What's with Mint then?

483
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,750
Mint?

484
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,310
Just like what you read,

485
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,590
the female lead is you.

486
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,710
I designed the comic using you
as my archetype.

487
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,430
Initially, I wanted to draw about
the scenes of our reunion.

488
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,830
But, I was afraid that
you might recognise the scenes.

489
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,910
That's why I added some characters
into the story.

490
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,030
For example, Qiu Ke.

491
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,350
That way, it'll be hard for you
to recognise the scenes.

492
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,470
But, if you look at it closely,

493
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,350
you'll see some familiar faces.

494
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,790
Did you pay me for my portrait rights?

495
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:36,790
How dare you draw me?

496
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,950
But, I'm pretty rich.

497
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,910
How much do you want? I'll pay you.

498
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,550
Cash is fine with me.

499
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,430
My face is very expensive.

500
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,590
You won't be able to afford it.

501
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,590
You have two cards?

502
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,630
Why are you so rich?

503
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,710
That card doesn't belong to me.

504
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,310
Alright.

505
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,510
You're not angry at me anymore, right?

506
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,150
Keep your wallet.

507
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:16,190
Being angry at you is akin to
punishing me.

508
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,190
Besides,

509
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,910
it won't be worth it if I get sick

510
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:19,750
from being mad at you.

511
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,390
I just feel confused.

512
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,870
I mean, ashamed.

513
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,150
Back then, I kept talking about
Guru Qing He.

514
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,910
I even sent you all those
weird text messages.

515
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,860
I even recommended Guru Qing He to you.

516
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:35,990
But, in the end?

517
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,270
Do you feel ashamed?

518
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:45,390
I don't feel ashamed.

519
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,750
I think you're pretty cute.

520
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,270
Do you know where Sun Jie Ping
is staying at?

521
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,150
I do.

522
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,710
You should be faster then.

523
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,990
We need to send the bike back to

524
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,550
to the supermarket owner.

525
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,510
You should ride the bike then.

526
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,670
You're a man, you know?

527
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,830
Yet, you don't even know
how to ride a bike?

528
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,990
You're asking me to fetch you?

529
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,030
Don't you feel embarrassed?

530
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:06,910
Are you done?

531
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,710
You say that every time

532
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,470
whenever we're riding a bicycle.

533
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,390
You've been saying that since young.

534
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,910
I don't need you if I know how to ride it!

535
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,510
You should shut up then.

536
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:13,870
I...

537
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,310
Fine, I'll shut up.

538
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:24,030
I didn't say that you were disgusting.

539
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,750
I didn't play a trick on you on purpose.

540
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,310
I said that I enjoy the process

541
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,070
because I can talk about
everything with you.

542
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,500
Just like the times when we're young.

543
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:35,030
I can try to understand
what you're experiencing.

544
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,990
And understand your trouble.

545
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,350
You still dare to mention the past to me?

546
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,620
In the past, I treated you
as my best friend.

547
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,990
I told you all of my secrets.

548
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,110
After I came back to Xi Hai,

549
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,630
although I pretended to be White Swan,

550
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,030
I didn't hide anything from you.

551
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,310
What about you?

552
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,750
You didn't tell me anything
even though it was such a huge thing.

553
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:59,190
By the way, does anyone else
know that you're Qing He?

554
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:00,830
No.

555
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,630
Wang Yi Ming and Tao Zhu are in the dark.

556
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,500
What about Ni Xiao Wan?

557
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:07,910
She?

558
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,350
Of course she doesn't know.

559
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,910
Are you concerned about her?

560
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,870
I just think

561
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:21,390
that you two are quite close
to each other.

562
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,030
I told you already.

563
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,070
Ni Xiao Wan and I are just
junior high classmates.

564
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,310
There's nothing between us.

565
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,830
That's all.

566
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,310
What about us?

567
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,780
We were primary school classmates, right?

568
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,230
Not only that.

569
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,150
Aren't we childhood friends as well?

570
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,460
Didn't you say you want to marry me?

571
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,710
Enough. We're done here.

572
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,110
Let's think of a way to get out of here.

573
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,110
Oh yeah, we can jump out the window.

574
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,350
Lin Nan Yi,
why didn't you tell me earlier?

575
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,310
I...

576
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,310
I just remembered that not long ago.

577
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:19,750
Come on.

578
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,780
I will readjust my mental state

579
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,790
and try to get along with you again.

580
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,350
Why are you so serious?

581
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,310
Can't you be more natural?

582
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,630
How could I act natural

583
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,550
when you're Qing He?

584
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,510
You must promise me this.

585
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,270
You need to forget about

586
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,230
all those messages

587
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,110
that I had sent you before.

588
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,030
Alright.

589
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,710
Just come out already.

590
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,950
Later, I'll tell Tao Zhu and Wang Yi Ming

591
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:52,870
that they don't need to let us out.

592
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:54,150
Hurry.

593
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,750
The one who locked us up was Tao...

594
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,590
Lin Nan Yi,

595
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,830
did you know about that long ago?

596
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:00,910
You better...

597
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,110
Lin Nan Yi!

598
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,630
Hold it right there!

599
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:08,910
Why didn't I figure it out?

600
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,870
They could jump out the window.

601
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,070
I'm really worried about my intelligence.

602
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,350
There's a saying that goes like this.

603
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,910
When you're together
with beautiful people,

604
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,670
your eyes are happy.

605
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,070
When you're together with
intelligent people,

606
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:26,990
your brain is happy.

607
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,550
But, when it comes to a person like you...

608
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,870
Can you come down and talk?

609
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,070
When you're together with
someone stupid and boring,

610
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,910
you'll develop a temper.

611
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,350
Uncle Ma, is our food ready?

612
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,750
Almost.

613
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,270
President, we're here.

614
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,630
Tao Zi, is that you?

615
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:49,790
Long time no see.

616
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:56,750
Long time no see.

617
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,310
I heard from our president that
you were taking a break

618
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,110
because you were uncomfortable.

619
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,030
How are you lately? Do you feel better?

620
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:01,910
Without you,

621
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,950
the floor of our drama club
has been very dirty.

622
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,790
Li Yang, I think you...

623
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,070
Long time no see.

624
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:17,830
How have you been lately?

625
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,310
Not bad.

626
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,390
Tao Zi, the drama club needs you.

627
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,390
Yeah, Tao Zi.

628
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,590
Our president mentions you often.

629
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,830
Tao Zi, you should return to the club.

630
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,550
Yeah.

631
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,230
I will always keep your spot vacant

632
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:31,790
for you.

633
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:33,750
You can return to the club at any time.

634
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,030
We'll always welcome you.

635
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,950
Senior, what spot did you keep for me?

636
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:40,830
You mean the floor sweeper?

637
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:41,910
No thanks.

638
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,700
I've been enjoying my life lately.

639
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,020
I don't plan to go back for now.

640
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:51,550
Alright then.

641
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,910
I respect your decision.

642
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,390
When you want to return to the club,

643
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,110
you can find me anytime.

644
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,390
You pulled that off with ease.

645
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:03,790
You're a man indeed.

646
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:05,990
Strange.

647
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,670
Where's Xiao Qing? She usually

648
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,150
follows him around.

649
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:09,750
Your squid is here.

650
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:10,870
Thank you, Uncle Ma.

651
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,790
All of you are here?

652
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:12,310
Yeah.

653
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,100
[Mint]

654
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,430
[In your life,]

655
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,790
[have you even seen
adorable girls like her?]

656
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:55,110
[Is he only a good friend in your heart?]

657
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,030
[Maybe he did so]

658
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,710
[because he has other feelings for you.]

659
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:04,310
[Guys won't treat girls that well]

660
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,110
[if they treat them as friends.]

661
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,470
[No matter if it's helping you out,
caring for you,]

662
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,070
[or hoping for your happiness,]

663
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,230
[all of these point to one explanation.]

664
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,580
[To him, you're very important.]

665
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:19,670
Why is Lin Nan Yi saying all of these?

[that you can share
your life experiences with me]

that I was Qing He?

697
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,750
You didn't tell me earlier.

698
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,350
You need to treat me to breakfast today.

699
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:29,950
No problem.

700
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,830

Not bad, I guess.

You need to say it's delicious.

It's delicious.
