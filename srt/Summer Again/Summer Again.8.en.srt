00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:03,390
I've thought about it.

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:04,670
Just tell them I wrote it.

4
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,470
My life is at stake here.

5
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,950
Can you take it seriously?

6
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,550
[I'm being serious.]

he doesn't want others
to find out who he is.

[There's little chance that]

[he'll be willing to come out
or upload more evidence.]

12
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,750
[In addition, the letter itself]

13
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,230
[contains no evidence that points to you.]

14
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,270
It's a clickbait title.

15
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,670
The poster just wanted to
use your identity as White Swan

16
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,630
to stir things up.

17
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,830
[We can just sabotage the plan.]

18
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,190
That doesn't mean we can say it was you.

19
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:34,830
Why not?

20
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,350

It's okay.

23
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:40,870
I don't mind.

24
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,150
Lin, tell them I wrote it.

25
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,590
I was thinking the exact same thing.

26
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,470
They would never suspect
a thing if it were me.

27
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,910
No way, this is my fault.

28
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,230
I can't let Tao Zi take the fall.

29
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,230
Alright,

30
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,070
this is the best plan that we have.

31
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,630
Everyone is making a fuss over it

32
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,860
[because there's a huge contrast between]

33
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,510
[White Swan and the image
portrayed in the letter.]

34

If it were Tao Zhu,

35
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,390
this matter wouldn't have
received much attention.

36
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,670
No, let's think of another way.

37
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,539
Alright, stop talking.

38
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,110
I'll work on the post now.

39
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,390
Lin, tell the administrator
to top my post later.

40
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,590
No, Tao Zi...

41

[Come out and apologize, you lying thief!]

42
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,030
I've posted it, Lin.

43
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,550
We'll control the situation now.

44
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,070
Listen, Tao Zi.

45
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,910
Create two alternate accounts first.

46
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,030
[Use one account to post the original text
and the other one to comment.]

[Adapted from Huo He's comic, "Mint Love"]

68
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,150
I'm telling you all,

69
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,790
after I'd finished writing,

70
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,460
I put the letter inside this book.

71
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,710
But unexpectedly,

72
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,270
it went missing!

73
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,310
I have no idea

74
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,230
which bad person has stolen it.

75
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,030
It must be a treacherous person!

76
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,070
Tao Zi, was it really you?

77
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:52,230
I told you,

78
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,710
there's no way White Swan

79
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,510
would write such a passionate letter.

80
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,829
Who stole the letter?

81
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,230
This person is going too far.

82
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,070
It was an alternate account.
It must have been done on purpose!

83
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,950
If Tao Zi didn't clear things up...

84
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,430
That's some fridge-horror right there.

for next Monday?

What's on your mind?

97
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,350
I was just wondering if

98
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,550
the talk between my mum
and Mr. Jia goes well.

99
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:55,829
Don't worry, I'm sure it went well.

100
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,790
Or else, she would have

101
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,030
dragged you home to teach you a lesson.

102
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,150
Fair enough.

103
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,550
It's really weird.

104
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,510
There was nothing important in the letter.

105
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,950
When they said it was me,

106
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:12,790
everyone believed it.

107
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,350
Now that Tao Zi said it was her,

108
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,350
everyone believed it as well.

109
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,910
When they thought it was me,

110
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,390
everybody was laughing at me.

111
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:21,070
Saying that they couldn't
believe that was who I was.

112
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,990
But they didn't say anything

113
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,430
when Tao Zi said she wrote it.

114
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,630
I'll tell you one thing.

115
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,070
Tell me.

116
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,750
The higher the expectation
people have of finer things,

117
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,030
the lower the tolerance they have
for their shortcomings,

118
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,180
get it?

119
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,500
What does that mean?

120
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,820
Give you an example.

121
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,070
Give me an example.

122
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,950
Do you remember you used to like

123
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,270
seeing peacocks spreading their feathers?

124
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,150
One day, it spread its feathers

125
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,150
and took a dump in front of you.

126
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:47,950
And you said

127
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,030
you would never like peacocks anymore.

128
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,230
You were disappointed at it.

129
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,070
I think I vaguely remember that.

130
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,070
Think about it.

131
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,270
I need to get to work.

132
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,630
I've signed up

133
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,030
for the audition for the female lead.

134
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:10,990
We should celebrate.

135
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,390
Let's go.

136
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,750
Let's go.

137
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,580
[Ouch]

138
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,590
Now that I know you're not a goddess,

139
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,350
I feel so relieved.

140
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,470
Can I ask you to go to the bathroom
together in the future?

141
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,900
You could've asked me before.

142
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,350
How would I dare to ask?

143
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,430
Tao Zi, the problem is resolved,

144
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,590
thanks to you.

145
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,630
If it weren't because of you,

146
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,390
I might even have to quit school.

147
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,510
Thank you so much.

148
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,150
It's nothing.

149
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:40,630
You know,

150
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,030
after this incident,

151
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,470
my popularity in school

152
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,110
has skyrocketed.

153
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,870
Everyone was rooting for me

154
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,950
when I was signing up for the audition.

155
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:50,830
I'm sorry,

156
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,070
I swear it won't happen again.

157
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,230
How about this?

158
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,270
When I go to Guru Qing He's signing event,

159
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,820
I promise I'll take a lot of

160
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,950
his pictures for you as compensation.

161
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,630
What do you say?

162
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,070
That's unnecessary.

163
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,390
You treat him like a boyfriend

164
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,510
but I treat him like my son.

165
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,230
Just bring me his picture books.

166
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,950
You treat him like a son?

167
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:11,900
What if Qing He

168
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,230
turns out to be a 50-year-old uncle?

169
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,230
What if Qing He turns out to be a minor?

00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,030
What?

339
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,990
Forget it.

340
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,550
I'm going to play basketball.

341
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,030
Hi, White Swan.

342
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,750
Didn't you say you'll
stop becoming the White Swan?

343
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,270
Why are you acting even more than before?

344
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,710
That's what I want to talk to you about.

345
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,670
What is it about?

346
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,510
Well, I've been thinking about it.

347
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,109
If I suddenly go against my image,

348
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,869
people would think it's pretty strange.

349
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,790
In order to protect my public image,

350
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,270
I think I should take it slow.

351
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,790
See, Tao Zhu knows

352
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,550
who I really am now.

353
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,550
Next, I'm going to reveal it
to Wang Yi Ming.

354
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,069
One step at a time.

355
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:24,990
Wouldn't it be better?

356
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:28,870
[Well, then promise me]

357
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,820
that you'll find a way to end this

358
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,230
once everything is resolved.

359
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,150
If you're unwilling to
be true to yourself,

360
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,870
I won't offer any help

361
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,590
if the same thing happens again.

362
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,670
That's the reason?

363
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,750
Not because your senior is coming back?

364
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,430
It does play a part in it.

365
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,630
But Senior Wei Ze is
only here for a few days.

366
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,070
I'll stop acting like this when he's gone.

367
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,620
I mean it.

368
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:55,670
I swear.

369
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:57,990
Forget it.

370
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,420
Whatever makes you happy.

371
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,030
Why is he so angry?

372
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,350
Tao Zi.

373
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,110
Come here, the president
will be here soon.

374
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,710
We were just talking about

375
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,710
your letter.

376
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,670
Why didn't you write
the president's name on the letter?

377
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,430
I'm sure he'd be happy as a clam.

378
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,550
Right, he made you the female lead

379
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,310
once he saw your mystery letter.

380
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,750
That was a smart move.

381
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,630
You don't have to be a sweeper anymore.

382
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,870
Stop that.

383
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,750
Senior told me to join the audition

384
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,550
because I performed well in

385
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,390
the group performance.

386
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,910
He saw my ability in acting.

387
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,630
You're new here?

388
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,950
I'm Xiao Qing.

389
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,830
I used to be a sweeper too.

390
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,150
I'm familiar with your task.

391
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,750
But now the senior has let me
join the audition.

392
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,070
Hang in there.

393
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,390
You'll get the chance soon enough.

394
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,190
Who will be my partner today?

395
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,790
San will be your partner.

396
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,590
He'll act as Tin Man.

397
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,990
Yes, I'm your partner.

398
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:07,630
Come on.

399
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:08,270
Okay.

400
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,390
I'll start first.

401
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,660
My name is Dorothy.

402
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,830
I need to go to the Emerald City.

403
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,070
I'd like to ask the Great...

404
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,310
Ask the Great...

405
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,070
Oreo.

406
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,550
I'll start over.

407
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,030
I have a sore throat.

408
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,750
My name is Dorothy.

409
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,660
I need to go to the Emerald City.

410
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,030
I'd like to ask the Great Oz
to send me to...

411
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,150
Send me to...

412
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,270
Kansas.

413
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:06,950
Relax.

414
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:08,670
President.

415
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,750
I'll practise the script with you.

416
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,190
I need to go to the Emerald City.

417
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,310
I'd like to ask the Great Oz

418
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:26,470
to send me to Kansas.

419
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,150
I will go with you.

420
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,270
Why?

421
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,670
Because

422
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,030
I need a heart.

423
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,430
A heart

424
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,750
can bring happiness.

425
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,070
And happiness

426
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,670
is the best thing in the world.

427
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,230
Your turn.

428
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,150
You're right.

429
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,110
One will never get lost

430
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,670
with the guidance of the heart.

431
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,310
And...

432
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,430
And...

433
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,910
What's the dialogue?

434
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:22,950
It's okay.

435
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,710
You just need more practice.

436
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,470
Lin,

437
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,270
don't you think

438
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,380
Tao Zi and Tong Xi
are acting weird lately?

439
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,750
I think you're acting weird.

440
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,790
I'm acting weird?

441
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,670
I have a reason.

442
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,070
Listen,

443
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,870
Tao Zi wrote me a mystery letter.

444
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,230
I'm not going to tell you

445
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,510
what she wrote.

446
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,070
However,

447
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,270
she wrote another letter recently
on the Internet.

448
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,790
She said it was for Xu Ao.

449
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,630
What am I supposed to do now?

450
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,350
Where do I fit in?

451
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,110
Are you sure the handwritten letter

452
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,310
was addressed to you?

453
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,630
Of course I am.

454
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,710
I know her handwriting very well.

455
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,310
I'm pretty sure she wrote it

456
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,670
and slipped it inside my book.

457
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,590
Anything else that was strange?

458
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:34,990
Yes.

459
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,390
Look,

460
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,350
she liked Guru Qing He very much.

461
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,470
She read all his comic books
again and again.

462
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,910
Now,

463
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,070
Mint has become so popular.

464
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,310
Yet, she doesn't even have time
to read it again.

465
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,590
She's been rehearsing the play every day

466
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,550
to get the part.

467
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,070
And Tong Xi,

468
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,510
she's been skipping meals.

469
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:53,950
That's so weird.

470
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,430
They have gone crazy

471
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,270
for their seniors.

472
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,870
[Tong Xi, I've arrived at Xi Hai Airport.]

473
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,910
[I'm going to take the bus.
See you later.]

474
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,430
[Let's take a look at this passage.]

475
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,110
[I guess you don't need me to tell you]

476
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,100
about Han Yu's literary achievements.

477
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,670
He's the greatest among
Eight Giants of Tang and Song prose.

478
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,990
He had high levels of achievement.

479
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,230
Just like Liu Zong Yuan,

480
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:34,820
he was a founder of
the Classical Prose Movement.

481
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,430
He's arrived.

482
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,510
Action.

483
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:51,110
Sir, Tao Zhu looks very unwell.

484
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,230
What's wrong, Tao Zhu?

485
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,030
Sir, I feel like

486
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,230
my stomach is twisted.

487
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,990
Sir, look. She's sweating.

488
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,340
Let me take her to the infirmary.

489
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,910
Okay, go quickly!

490
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:03,430
Yes, sir.

491
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,310
Stay safe.

492
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,950
She's fine. Focus on the lesson.

493
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,990
Try harder, Tong Xi.

494
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,310
I'm dying!

495
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,710
Just a little longer. We're almost done.

496
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:37,710
We're almost done.

497
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,350
I finally fit you into the dress.

498
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:54,470
How do I look?

499
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:56,630
Here.

500
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,470
Are you okay, Tong Xi?

501
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,990
Do you want to eat something first?

502
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,350
I'm fine, it's okay.

503
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,190
Tao Zi, let's go over the plan.

504
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,150
After I pick the senior up,

505
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,150
I'll treat him to a meal.

506
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,390
I'll come back after that

507
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,630
and get back to class.

508
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,510
You must lay low

509
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,430
before I get back.

510
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,470
Don't worry, Tong Xi.

511
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,270
I envy your courage and freedom.

512
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,870
Tao Zi, what happened to you?

513
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,190
What's with you all of a sudden?

514
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,420
The audition didn't go well?

515
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,750
I got so nervous every time

516
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,030
I see Senior Xu Ao.

517
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,670
I couldn't even say the line.

518
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,830
Luckily, he knew it was my first time

519
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,270
and so he gave me some time to practise.

520
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,430
After you leave,

521
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,030
I need to find a place to learn my lines.

522
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,270
Okay.

523
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,150
Hope everything goes well for both of us.

524
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:41,710
All the best!

525
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,430
Bye, I'm leaving now.

526
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,590
Good luck!

My name is Dorothy.

528
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,950
I need to go to the Emerald City.

529
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,430
I'd like to ask the Great...

530
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,270
What was the word?

531
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,110
This Friday,

532
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,430
we'll have a public session.

533
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,750
The Education Bureau and

534
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,950
municipal officials will
sit in on our class.

535
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,470
I'm going to teach you

536
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,710
classical poems about landscape.

537
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,910
This class concerns
my performance evaluation.

538
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,870
So, I hope everyone will cooperate

539
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,580
and prepare the lesson in advance.

540
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:19,230
Sir, will you buy sweets
for us if it goes well?

541
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,110
Ten sweets per person, is that enough?

542
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,750
Yes!

543
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,790
Also,

544
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,710
I want to prepare something

545
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,100
for the end of the public class.

546
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,270
I'll invite a student to come up here

547
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,150
to paint while listening to the poetry.

548
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,190
Anyone want to volunteer for it?

549
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:44,790
See,

550
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,590
you guys always turn coward
at the crucial moment.

551
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,870
Fine, I'll pick the class president.

552
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:51,830
Is that okay?

553
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,070
An Old Fisherman by Liu Zong Yuan.

554
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,670
Get ready for it.

555
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,470
No problem, sir.

556
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,990
Okay, take your seat.

557
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,870
Pull yourself together.

558
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:03,950
Let's get back to the lesson.

559
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,070
Still the same passage.

560
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,030
Discourse on Teachers.
Let's read it together.

561
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,550
"Those who wanted to learn
would seek out a teacher."

562
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,270
"A teacher passes down the doctrine,
imparts knowledge and resolves doubt."

563
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,510
Ready, go.

564
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,510
"Those who wanted to learn
would seek out a teacher."

565
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,830
Why is Tao Zi taking so long

566
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,550
to get back?

567
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,510
Is she terminally ill?

568
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,230

a fan of that Guru Qing He?

572
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,350
Tao Zi hasn't replied to my message.

573
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,390
Did she forget her phone?

574
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,350
I'll call Tong Xi and ask about her.

575
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:53,910
Don't bother.

576
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,700
I guess she doesn't want to be disturbed.

577
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:00,990
What's that supposed to mean?

Long time no see!

Yes, long time no see.

Indeed.

Wait, don't answer me right away.

Why are you upside down?

592

Because

you passed out.
