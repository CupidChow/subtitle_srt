Moreover,

00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,870
your mother left you behind

133

162

Yes.

00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,150
So I didn't have time to look for you
at uncle's house.

179
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,270
When I went there,

180
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,540
you were gone.

181
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,270
That was how you found this necklace

182
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,510
at my father's house.

183
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,150
I'm sorry.

184
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,620
I didn't know

185
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,990
you were going through that.

186
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,350
I blamed you for not seeing me off.

187
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,030
Lin Nan Yi, don't worry.

188
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:36,110
No matter what happens afterwards,

189
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,549
I will always be with you.

190
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,030
After all, we are

191
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,110
best friends.

192
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,790
What's this?

193
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,110
I bought them while waiting for you.

194
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,030
Try them.

195
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,100
Once ignited,

196
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,070
all your worries will be gone.

197
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,950
Brother, pedal!

198
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,460
Pedal!

199
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,110
How can you brake at the start?

200
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:13,830
Stupid.

201
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,070
If I don't brake, I'll fall!

202
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,910
You'll fall if you brake.

203
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,550
Okay.

204
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,870
I come, I succeed!

205
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,070
You misused an idiom again.

206
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,270
You're so uneducated.

207
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,910
Do you really think I'm uneducated?

208
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,350

Love at first sight,

211
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,670
their love is eternal.

212
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,790
Love birds in the sky,

214

Aren't you ashamed?

219
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,750
I don't know how to.

220
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,910
Xu Ao is pretending!

221
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,670
Your thoughts are more
important than the gift itself.

222
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,030
He scolded you and bullied you.

223
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,670
Only I can bully you.

224
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,990
Others cannot.

225
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,390
Welcome to Qing He's signing meeting.

226
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,630
Classmate,

228

Since small,

229
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,180
I like to see you correct my idioms.

230
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,230
I like to watch you sitting in front

231

while carrying me on a bicycle.

232
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,750
You are so cute.

335
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,430

00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,270
But I support her decision.

352
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,350
She treats us very well.

353
00:17:59,070 --> 00:17:59,990
I wish her happiness.

354
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:03,550
What about you?

355
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,630
Me?

356
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,190
You and your mother.

357
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,270
Last two days, my parents told me

358
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,670
when I was one or two years old,

359
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,500
my mother got married in Da Cheng

360
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,830
and wanted to take me from Xi Hai,

361
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,630
but my parents disagreed.

362
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,070
They couldn't let go.

363
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,230
Moreover, she remarried.

364
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:30,750
They said

365
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,470
that had they agreed,

366
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,710
I might be better off.

367
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,190
From what they said,

368
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,550
uncle and auntie love you very much.

369
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,990
Your biological mother
really cares about you.

370
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,350
Nan Yi,

371
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,110
many people love you.

372
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,070
The last two days, I thought

373
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,150
maybe she was compelled
to abandon me.

374
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,310
But every time she appeared,

375
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,430
she changed my life

376
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,150
in different ways.

377
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,230
I didn't like that.

378
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,110
I think

379
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,350
you know too little about her.

380
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,670
Do you know

381
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,030
that the lack of understanding
between people

382
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,230
creates prejudice?

383
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,470
All things aside,

384
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,030
when I just came back,

385
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,310
because of misunderstanding in childhood,

386
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,830
I was prejudiced against you.

387
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,950
But after getting to know you,

388
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,670
I discovered you're different

389
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,670
from what I thought.

390
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,870
Tong Xi,

391
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,510
you and I,

392
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,510
and she and I

393
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,430
are different matters.

394
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,230
Lin Nan Yi,

395
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,790
if I don't get close to you,

396
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,150
and get to know you,

397
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,830
we will miss the chance

398
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,620
to become good friends.

399
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,470
Correct?

400
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:01,820
Yes.

401
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,980
Back then, you gave me

402
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,110
a birthday gift here.

403
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,180
My turn to do that now.

404
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,990
I don't know if you'll like it.

405
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,670
I do.

406
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,270
Take a look first.

407
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,350
What is this?

408
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,190
What is this?

409
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,590
This is

and dyer woad leaf.

413
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,870
Why do you give me this?

414
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,350
Didn't you say

415
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,390
acrylic paint is too heavy?

416
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,230
You don't like it.

417
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,790
You don't like Chinese painting
and gouache either.

418
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,430
Stop.

419
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,270

[I want to talk to you.]

436
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,750
So,

437
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,830
after you talked,

438
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:23,990
did you find that

439
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,110
your mother is different
from what you imagined?

440
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,990
I try to accept her.

441
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,150
But it doesn't mean that
I will forgive and forget.

442
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,990
So, are you going to transfer
to another school?

443
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,830
Do you want me to?

444
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,700
Aren't you afraid we'll be apart?

445
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:02,790
Of course, I am.

446
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,150
I'd rather say goodbye

447
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,590
than see you having regrets.

448
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,590
Because when people part,

449
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:10,670
as long as they want,

450
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,260
they can still meet again.

451
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,710

452
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,150

454
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,860
live with them forever.

455
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,910
I have been thinking.

456
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,990
If we didn't meet in our childhood,

457
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,070
would we meet now?

458
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:27,950
I think we will.

459
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,510
Because we are fated

460
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,500
to meet.

is a new start.

524
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,540
Anyway, you only stop temporarily,

525
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,830
not permanently.

526
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:22,470
You...

527
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:28,590
Lin Nan Yi.

528
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:29,990
What are you doing?

529
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,830
I thought this was long and high
when I was a child.

530
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,230
Why is it so low now?

531
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,150
I still remember

532
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,390
when you were little,

533
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,550
in your first climb,

534
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,670
you got scared and cried.

535
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:43,950
You cried, not me.

536
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,940
Whatever.

537
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,390
Come down first.

538
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,390
When I slide down,

539
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,590
should I squat or sit?

540
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,910
Whatever. Come down first.

541
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:02,910
Lin Nan Yi,

542
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,270
why are you so clumsy?

543
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,710
Lin Nan Yi, why are you so stupid?

544
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,150
So clumsy.

545
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:11,990
Tong Xi.

546
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,750
Why are you so stupid?

547
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,110
You...

548
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:17,710
You just wait!

549
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,830
You just wait!

550
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,070
What's wrong?

551
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,310
What do you mean?

552
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:29,390
Lean on a railing and look far away,
and grieve over the advent of autumn.

553
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,140
Why are you reciting idioms too?

554
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,630
What's wrong?

555
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,590
You're absent-minded the whole day.

556
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:44,110
Did Sun Jie Ping look for you again?

557
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,190
You're make speculations.

558
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:47,870
Doesn't that make you

559
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,350
feel uneasy and guilty?

560
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,150
What's the matter with you?

561
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,110
Tell me.

562
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,630
Tell me.

563
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,190
If

564
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,790
Tong Xi leaves Xi Hai,

565
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:04,670
will you feel sad?

566
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,150
Are you missing Lin?

567
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,620
Actually, Tong Xi told me

568
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,470
she is afraid of parting.

569
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,270
She told me that

570
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,350
when she transferred from
Da Cheng to Xi Hai,

571
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,070
her living environment

572
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,270
and lifestyle changed,

573
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,630
and she had no friend in Xi Hai.

574
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,390
Her friends in Da Cheng

575
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,590
drifted apart

576
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,350
because of the distance.

577
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,590
Sometimes, distance is like this.

578
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,750
Distance makes you drift apart.

579
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,190
But Lin Nan Yi is different.

580
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,470
Lin Nan Yi is concerned about people

581
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,310
he cares about

582
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,510
and are important to him.

583
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,150
Being friends for years,

584
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,070
you should know.

585
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,550
Moreover,

586
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,790
he won't be away forever.

587
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,470
When he comes back,

588
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,550
you can still have barbecue together,

589
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,710
drink together,

590
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,950
and play basketball,

591
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:55,510
although

592
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,390
you're the better player.

593
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,990
Don't be sad.

594
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,150
[That day,]

595
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,750
[I got the farewell.]

596
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,590
[But we decided]

597
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,660
[to say goodbye in a happy way.]

598
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,790
Lin Nan Yi, wait for me.

599
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:10,950
Nan Yi.

600
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,310
Did you bring water?

601
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,230
No.

602
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,070
You just ate shaved ice!

603
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,350
How can you say that?

604
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,870
You ate mine.

605
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,310
I'll buy you another one.

606
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,630
Any store selling drinks here?

607
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,030
Tong Xi,

608
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,350
do you want to eat guava?

609
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:32,910
Yes.

610
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,150
I want.

611
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,070
But...

612
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,390
Let's go.

613
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,590
Someone planted this.

614
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,710
We shouldn't pick it.

615
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,310
It's okay.

616
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:47,710
Enough.

617
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,420
What are you doing?

618
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,910
See? Someone planted it!

619
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:01,750
Run quickly.

620
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,030
You stole my fruit.

621
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,270
I'll break your legs.

622
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,470
Petty tricks! I'll get you!

623
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,030
Wait and see.

624
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:09,590
My guava.

625
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,630
I dropped the fruit.

626
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:20,670
I have three more.

627
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:21,390
Two.

628
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,270
How is it?

629
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:26,510
Very sour.

630
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:30,430
Tong Xi,

631
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,790
remember when we were kids,

632
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:33,950
we stole fruit

633
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,310
and were chased.

634
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:36,590
I remember.

635
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,350
But at that time,

636
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,630
the fruit was sweet.

637
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:41,780
It might be sour,

638
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,630
but as the memory fades,

639
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,430
the fruit becomes sweet.

640
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:51,870
Tong Xi,

641
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,590
when you went to Da Cheng,

642
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,790
did you write a lot to me?

643
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,390
What did you write?

644
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,270
I was afraid you would forget me.

645
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:03,710
So, I wrote to you.

646
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,790
I wanted to say we would meet again.

647
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,190
After I leave this time,

648
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:12,429
can you keep writing to me?

649
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,389
Do you know

650
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:21,909
I recently

651
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:24,550
thought a lot about you?

652
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,270
In a stupid way?

653
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:30,620
No.

654
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:32,710
Happy.

655
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,070
Although I annoy you

656
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:36,790
and contradict you,

657
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:38,830
as long you're with me,

658
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,989
I'll feel very happy.

659
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:45,030
Why do you say this suddenly?

660
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:47,710
Tong Xi,

661
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:50,670
if I don't say it,

662
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,949
I might regret it later.

663
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,110
Tong Xi,

664
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:00,590
I...

665
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,510
I planted this myself,

666
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:27,390
mum.
