23
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:40,958
Mr. Mo.

24
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,416
If you want to see my wife again,

25
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,333
shouldn’t you tell me in advance?

26
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:49,041
I’m sorry.

27
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:50,500
But I think

28
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,333
Miss Gu can arrange

29
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:53,708
her own schedule.

30
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:56,291
After all, she’s a free girl,

31
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:57,375
isn’t she?

32
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:08,000
No, no, no. I’m not free.

33
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:10,875
First, I don’t like to be free.

34
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,525
Second, I’m married.

35
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,207
I don’t need freedom.

36
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:25,275
Xixi,

37
00:02:26,332 --> 00:02:27,950
what comic do you like?

38
00:02:28,332 --> 00:02:29,500
I can read it with you back home.

39
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,416
That’d be great.

40
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,225
Fine, then.

41
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,166
I’d better not disturb you.

42
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,125
I’ll leave you alone.

43
00:02:40,332 --> 00:02:40,916
Wait.

44
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:57,100
We’ll leave you alone.

45
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,600
By the way, Xiaoya...

46
00:03:12,457 --> 00:03:15,332
...you said Yin Sichen signed
a contract with Xixi.

47
00:03:15,707 --> 00:03:16,707
What contract is that?

48
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,416
Think about it.

49
00:03:18,707 --> 00:03:21,832
Who wants anyone else to know

50
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,082
the contract of his fake marriage?

51
00:03:23,457 --> 00:03:26,332
Yin Sichen will kill us.

52
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:27,416
They have a fake marriage?

53
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,207
Why would Xixi

54
00:03:30,207 --> 00:03:31,166
ever adore a man

55
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,832
like Yin Sichen?

56
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,000
That’s funny.

57
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:39,957
Now that they have
a contracted marriage,

58
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,000
the contract will expire
sooner or later.

59
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,125
Xixi,

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,625
I won’t miss you again.

61
00:03:58,082 --> 00:03:59,325
Gu Xixi,

62
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,332
see how I’ll deal with you.

63
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,457
Didn’t I tell you to cancel
all plans for today?

64
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,541
Alex’s assistant just sent you this.

65
00:04:11,707 --> 00:04:12,750
(INVITATION)
This month,

66
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,041
Alex will lock himself in Milan
for dress design.

67
00:04:14,707 --> 00:04:16,250
He wants to invite you and Miss Gu

68
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,800
(INVITATION)
to his private club for a short stay,

69
00:04:18,415 --> 00:04:20,400
as compensation for his absence
from your wedding.

70
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,208
Alex is indeed a savior for Gu Xixi.

71
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,333
He’s giving her such a quick chance
to make atonement.

72
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,250
Mr. Yin,

73
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:31,500
as your assistant,

74
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,458
I have to remind you.

75
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,540
This isn’t the right moment

76
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,665
to lose your temper on Miss Gu.

77
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:40,790
How do you think
I should punish Gu Xixi?

78
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,125
Since you married Miss Gu,

79
00:04:43,665 --> 00:04:45,200
looks like your childish cells

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,250
have been mobilized.

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,208
Will she turn me into an idiot, too?

82
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,875
Looks like you love that.

83
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,915
Looks like you don’t love that.

84
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:57,915
I have to remind you.

85
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,450
It seems that

86
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,665
Miss Gu isn’t ready to meet Alex yet.

87
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:04,958
Don’t worry.

88
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,165
I’ll handle that.

89
00:05:17,825 --> 00:05:18,550
I...

90
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:19,915
I’m sorry.

91
00:05:19,915 --> 00:05:20,750
I’m late.

92
00:05:21,415 --> 00:05:22,208
I was just early.

93
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,375
Let’s order first.

94
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,583
Right.

95
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:30,165
Let’s order.

96
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,025
Are...?

97
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,708
Are you done?

98
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:46,915
Yes.

99
00:05:48,165 --> 00:05:49,208
Waitress...

100
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,165
I’ll be responsible for you.

101
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,000
I said,

102
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,750
I’ll be responsible for you.

103
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,833
I heard what you said to Xiaoxin.

104
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,790
You said you would pretend
nothing had happened.

105
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,625
And...

106
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,958
...you had no feeling.

107
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:15,925
What are you thinking?

108
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,833
We were talking
about the myopia surgery.

109
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,200
The myopia surgery?

110
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,125
Or what?

111
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,000
Honestly,

112
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,583
I was quite confused some days ago.

113
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,708
I didn’t know what I should do.

114
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,583
So, I decided to keep a distance.

115
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:36,833
But after thinking about it carefully,

116
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,000
I believe I should

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
be a responsible woman.

118
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,900
So, don’t worry.

119
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,875
I’ll be responsible for you.

120
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:46,790
Isn’t it what I should say?

121
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,083
I’m sorry?

122
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,415
Before you want to be responsible,

123
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,208
did you ever have
a little bit of feeling

124
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,165
for me?

125
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,665
How will you be responsible, then?

126
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,500
I had planned

127
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,790
to be in a relationship with you.

128
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:18,750
But I don’t like

129
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,000
to make such a rash decision.

130
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:20,958
So, I think

131
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,165
we can start from being
an intern couple.

132
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,000
Of course.

133
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:26,875
You have the right to say no.

134
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,458
I’ve made a scoring system.

135
00:07:30,665 --> 00:07:31,375
We have one each.

136
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:33,915
(Love Scoring System)
When we’re in a relationship,

137
00:07:33,915 --> 00:07:35,708
we give a score to each other
within six months.

138
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,375
If we get above 80 points totally,

139
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,165
we’ll make our relationship public.

140
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,550
If we don’t,

141
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:41,333
we’ll break up.

142
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:43,250
What do you think?

143
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:45,550
Okay. I agree.

144
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,040
What are you writing?

145
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,025
You’re decisive when making a decision.

146
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,750
You have a good judgment.

147
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,000
5 points will be awarded.

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,708
All right.

149
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,500
We can order now.

150
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,525
No, no, no. Wait.

151
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,000
Will you also give a score

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,875
for what I order?

153
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:07,000
It tells how much you know about me.

154
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,250
Waitress,

155
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,375
get us all the most expensive dishes.

156
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:15,975
Come.

157
00:08:16,275 --> 00:08:16,875
Be seated.

158
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,375
Do I have to?

159
00:08:19,915 --> 00:08:20,650
Sit here.

160
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,040
I won’t bite you.

161
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:29,415
Have a look.

162
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,583
What’s this?

163
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,225
The bossy president
married Cinderella by force.

164
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,625
Her childhood sweetheart battled wisely
with the bossy president

165
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,708
and got her out of trouble.

166
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:41,950
This...

167
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:42,875
You don’t understand.

168
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,625
This is protection.

169
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,833
Protection beyond love.

170
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:49,833
You’re a vulgarian.

171
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:51,541
Vulgarian?

172
00:08:51,725 --> 00:08:52,350
Mm.

173
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,375
I’m a vulgarian?

174
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:53,916
Mm.

175
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,083
But Mo Zixin isn’t?

176
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,100
Mm.

177
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,875
Mo Zixin has such a unique taste.

178
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,500
But you know what, Gu Xixi?

179
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,625
I’m afraid you’ll have no time

180
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,333
to read such rubbish comic

181
00:09:10,025 --> 00:09:12,083
or meet your Senior Mo.

182
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:13,375
Why?

183
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,291
These are for you.

184
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,833
Alex invited us

185
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,333
to have a vacation in Milan.

186
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,083
These are some plans

187
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,050
for this vacation.

188
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:26,625
Get well prepared for that.

189
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:27,791
Vacation.

190
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,791
I get it.

191
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,166
I think I’m ready.

192
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,375
Don’t you check it first?

193
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:42,666
Wait.

194
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,083
Why do I think I’m preparing
for the college entrance exam?

195
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,225
Get up at 6:00 AM?

196
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,375
Why must I learn Italian?

197
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,416
Alex is Chinese-Italian.

198
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,458
When you speak simple Italian,

199
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,375
it’s conducive
to your communication with him.

200
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,000
He speaks Chinese, doesn’t he?

201
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,125
It’s conducive.

202
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:05,833
Italian in the morning.

203
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,000
Table manners at noon.

204
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,291
Business etiquette in the afternoon.

205
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,541
Dance class in the evening.

206
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,125
I’ll be lucky
if I can get to bed at midnight.

207
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,333
You’re lucky when you can get to bed.

208
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:15,791
Yin Sichen,

209
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:17,775
according to our contract,

210
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,041
I work eight hours a day

211
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,541
and I work overtime
for less than three hours.

212
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,583
And I have one day off every week.

213
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,375
You’re obviously abusing,

214
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:23,958
oppressing,

215
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:24,625
and exploiting me.

216
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,583
You met Mo Zixin without my permission,

217
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,000
which violated our contract.

218
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,666
So, the eight-hour working system
no longer works.

219
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,825
But I’ll have quite insufficient sleep.

220
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:34,375
I protest against it.

221
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,083
Fine.

222
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,083
If you don’t take classes,

223
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,375
you won’t be able to handle
the trip to Milan.

224
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:41,458
It doesn’t matter.

225
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,958
You can take your time to make money
for the breach of contract.

226
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,083
I have the right reason to suspect
you’re taking revenge.

227
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,166
I also have the right reason

228
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,125
to suspect that your relationship
with Mo Zixin

229
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,000
has greatly influenced

230
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,425
the implementation of our contract.

231
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:09,541
May I have fewer classes?

232
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,916
I don’t think I need

233
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:11,666
dance classes.

234
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,041
I won’t perform, anyway.

235
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:13,875
No.

236
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,000
If there’s a ball to go,

237
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,291
will you stay aside and watch

238
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,291
as my wife?

239
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:23,541
You have to take dance classes

240
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,625
and need to dance very well

241
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:25,958
so that Alex won’t

242
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,416
see you through.

243
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,208
Will you take the classes
or pay for the breach of contract?

244
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:39,791
I won’t ever pay!

245
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:40,875
I’ll take the classes.

246
00:11:41,675 --> 00:11:42,400
Very good.

247
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,225
How is it going?

248
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:52,775
Tell me.

249
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,458
What were you just taught?

250
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,208
Hai gia mangiato?

251
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,000
How to say “Have you had lunch”
in Italian?

252
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,700
Hai gia...

253
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,250
The palm or the back of your hand?

254
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:28,666
Make your choice.

255
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,208
Good afternoon.

256
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,375
Grandma.

257
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,083
- Xixi.
- Grandma!

258
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:40,750
(WHYMALL)

259
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,850
- Xixi.
- Grandma!

260
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,500
You’re bullying her again?

261
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,166
I’m not.

262
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,250
Are you hungry?

263
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,000
Mm.

264
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,150
Are you thirsty?

265
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,750
Mm.

266
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,708
Shall I ask Madam Song
to bring you some tea?

267
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:52,242
Mm.

268
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:53,166
Don’t bother, Grandma.

269
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,958
Repeat the sentence to Grandma

270
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,166
and you can take a rest.

271
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,083
Be patient.

272
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,833
Say it.

273
00:13:02,275 --> 00:13:03,125
Speak calmly.

274
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:04,250
Don’t be impatient.

275
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,250
What mangiato, Grandma?

276
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,291
What mangiato? What?

277
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,333
What is that?

278
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,708
Take your time.

279
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,500
I’ll leave you alone.

280
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,833
Grandma!

281
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,791
Hai gia mangiato.

282
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:31,875
Don’t. Don’t.

283
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:32,750
Hold your hand out!

284
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:47,375
Hello.

285
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,625
See you at the gate of our company
in half an hour.

286
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:51,583
Go, go, go.

287
00:13:53,525 --> 00:13:54,208
Mm.

288
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:54,775
All right.

289
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:57,916
I’m going out for some business.

290
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,666
Stay at home and learn carefully.

291
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:01,500
I’ll check when I’m back.

292
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,675
(WHYMALL)

293
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:26,958
Hello, Senior Mo.

294
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:35,650
Senior.

295
00:14:35,825 --> 00:14:36,583
Be seated.

296
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,666
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

297
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,375
Did you ask to see me
for the contract thing again?

298
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,150
Mm.

299
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,500
You can be as objective as you can

300
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,041
in the form of wording here.

301
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:49,541
Use more data.

302
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,500
You can draw an analogy

303
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,041
with similar projects on the market.

304
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,875
So, you really knew it?

305
00:14:56,675 --> 00:14:57,300
Mm.

306
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,458
When Lin Xiaoya was drunk,

307
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:02,791
she told me everything.

308
00:15:03,475 --> 00:15:04,541
To you,

309
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,833
that contract is indeed harsh.

310
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,000
However,

311
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:08,416
here’s some good news.

312
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,208
Your proposal

313
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,791
has passed the assessment of my company.

314
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,458
If you want it,

315
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:14,625
we can have a discussion

316
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:15,541
on opening the store.

317
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,958
When you start your business,

318
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,958
I believe you’ll be free.

319
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,625
Wait, wait.

320
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:21,250
Senior,

321
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,875
I don’t get it.

322
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,416
What do you mean?

323
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,100
The angel investment.

324
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:28,575
I’ll invest

325
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:29,291
while you run the store.

326
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,333
We share the profits.

327
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,125
I get this.

328
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:33,375
I wonder

329
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,375
what my business has to do

330
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,125
with the contract between Yin Sichen

331
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,083
and me.

332
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,333
I remember back in college,

333
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,333
you were good at project planning.

334
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,791
It’s been years.

335
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:43,875
Besides,

336
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:44,708
doing homework

337
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,708
is different from doing
marketing projects.

338
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,916
Why is Miss Gu here?

339
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,375
And,

340
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,041
why is she staying

341
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,541
with Mr. Mo from Wenye Group?

342
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:01,958
Didn’t you sign

343
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,800
a prenuptial agreement?

344
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,500
There’re also many restraints on you.

345
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,125
Gu Xixi didn’t tell you
she would be here?

346
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:09,916
Xiwei, are you free later?

347
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,166
What?

348
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:13,541
Go get changed

349
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,541
into a formal dress

350
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:15,750
and wait for me at my company.

351
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,200
I’ll be right there.

352
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,041
All right.

353
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,000
See you later.

354
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,458
See you later.

355
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,875
I heard you met
some financial embarrassment

356
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,208
because you’re restrained
by this agreement

357
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,041
and you’re even restrained
on food and clothing.

358
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,666
- He doesn’t support you in making a brand, either.
- Senior,

359
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,500
you don’t need to worry about this.

360
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,125
Yin Sichen

361
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,125
- is bad-tempered and stingy.
- Gu Xixi.

362
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:36,583
And...

363
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,666
Who do you mean is stingy?

364
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,000
Who do you mean is bad-tempered?

365
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:48,625
Sichen,

366
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,208
what a coincidence!

367
00:16:51,525 --> 00:16:52,166
Mr. Mo,

368
00:16:52,575 --> 00:16:53,333
what a coincidence!

369
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:54,541
Here we meet again.

370
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:55,725
Nice to meet you.

371
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:57,350
What?

372
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,500
Talking with my wife about comics again?

373
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,041
No, no.

374
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:01,625
No.

375
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:02,541
What are you talking about, then?

376
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,166
Why were you talking about me?

377
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,300
I accidentally knew

378
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,375
the contract between you and Miss Gu.

379
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,791
I want to help her as much as I can.

380
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:17,850
You told him about it?

381
00:17:18,825 --> 00:17:19,675
No.

382
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,500
I didn’t. Anyway,

383
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,125
it’s not the contract you think it is.

384
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,500
I can understand

385
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,166
the relationship between you.

386
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,708
Don’t feel too shy to admit it.

387
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,208
I’m Gu Xixi’s good friend

388
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,425
and her fellow townsman.

389
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:37,583
When she’s in trouble,

390
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,541
I’ll help her as much as I can.

391
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,166
This is reasonable, I guess.

392
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:42,700
Or,

393
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,708
do you have little confidence
in your love for Gu Xixi?

394
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,150
The love between us is unbreakable.

395
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,666
One can’t influence us as he wishes.

396
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,000
I’ll refuse your offer,

397
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,208
on behalf of my wife.

398
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,041
I’ll take her to a class.

399
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,083
We’ll leave you alone.

400
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,166
Again?

401
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,000
Sorry, Senior.

402
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:11,166
See you.

403
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,000
Yin Sichen, you...

404
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,166
Gu Xixi,

405
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,125
did you want
to terminate the contract long ago?

406
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,750
You’ve found your next man so soon.

407
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,500
No. It’s not what you think it is.

408
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,166
What is it, then?

409
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,208
Once Xiaoya

410
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,958
made a little slip of the tongue.

411
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,041
Then she lied wisely

412
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:35,666
and made it plausible.

413
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,375
Anyway, at last,

414
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,500
our contracts aren’t exposed.

415
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,291
You won’t be so lucky next time.

416
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,175
Mm.

417
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:43,850
Let’s go.

418
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:44,900
Go back to the company with me.

419
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,958
I’ve got a teacher of etiquette

420
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:47,750
to give you a class.

421
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,500
Learn carefully.

422
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,083
(WHYMALL)
Your teacher of etiquette is in there.

423
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,500
Isn’t this your office?

424
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:07,950
Xiwei.

425
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,625
Miss Ran is my teacher of etiquette?

426
00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:16,350
Mm.

427
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,291
I’ll take Xixi for a vacation
in a couple of days.

428
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,416
So, I want you to teach her

429
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,666
some simple social etiquette.

430
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,450
That’s why you asked me
to get changed.

431
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,050
Leave her to me without concern.

432
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,083
However,

433
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,291
I need a pair of high-heeled shoes

434
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:33,333
and an evening gown.

435
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,208
Seriously?

436
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:37,666
Fei’ang.

437
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,625
So quickly?

438
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:44,833
I’ve got everything prepared.

439
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,900
We’re always efficient.

440
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,300
Go ahead.

441
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,458
Go get changed.

442
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,958
I’ll go alone.

443
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,041
Do you know where the dressing room is?

444
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,083
Gu Xixi.

445
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:08,166
Ah?

446
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:08,791
Are you done?

447
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:09,541
No.

448
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,325
Come... come over.

449
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,350
You...

450
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:21,975
Come over.

451
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,041
What’s up?

452
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:29,583
You...

453
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,458
Help me zip it.

454
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:53,700
Are you done?

455
00:20:57,675 --> 00:21:02,850
♪I accompany myself in my dream♪

456
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:08,300
♪Wait until stars explain to me
the secret of tears♪

457
00:21:09,075 --> 00:21:12,000
♪You take unexpected action♪

458
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,350
♪Break the ice of night♪

459
00:21:14,475 --> 00:21:18,083
♪Approach me inadvertently
and thrill me♪

460
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,000
Thank you.

461
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:21,925
Let’s go.

462
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,525
(WHYMALL)

463
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:31,675
Miss Gu,

464
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,416
I’ll teach you how to walk today.

465
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,392
Okay.

466
00:21:36,925 --> 00:21:37,575
Sichen,

467
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,416
I need to show her with your help.

468
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,225
All right.

469
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,833
Take confident steps when you walk.

470
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,500
Be light on your feet.

471
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,000
Don’t swing your arms widely.

472
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,208
Do it gently.

473
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,425
Look straight ahead.

474
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:01,925
Don’t look sideways.

475
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,050
Imagine you’re a swan.

476
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:05,750
Fei’ang,

477
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,500
practice with Miss Gu.

478
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,333
Are you all right?

479
00:22:33,175 --> 00:22:33,900
Leave her to me.

480
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,375
Are you all right?

481
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:37,625
I...

482
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,541
Boss.

483
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,000
I don’t think I can walk on, Boss.

484
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,416
My leg hurts, Boss.

485
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,916
- Don’t ask me to walk.
- Playacting?

486
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:45,625
I’ll walk with you.

487
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:52,958
Walk slowly.

488
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:53,625
Step by step.

489
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,850
Step by step.

490
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,291
It’s getting late.

491
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:05,458
Shall we learn another movement?

492
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:06,325
Don’t. Don’t.

493
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,350
My foot is aching.

494
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,975
I can’t stand the pain.

495
00:23:10,225 --> 00:23:11,166
I need a rest.

496
00:23:14,225 --> 00:23:15,000
You really sprained your foot?

497
00:23:15,475 --> 00:23:16,125
How do you feel?

498
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,150
Let me check.

499
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,291
I’m okay. I’m okay.

500
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:19,700
I’m okay. I’m okay.

501
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:20,875
After taking a rest, I’ll be all right.

502
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:22,125
Does it hurt?

503
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:24,041
Let’s call it a day.

504
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,875
Thank you, Boss. My thoughtful husband.

505
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,600
Sichen,

506
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,833
do you have time later?

507
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:30,708
I want to have a word with you.

508
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:33,875
How about another day? Gu Xixi...

509
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,000
The financing plan
I showed you this morning...

510
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,125
I modified it.

511
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:37,700
I’ll send it
to my business partner tomorrow.

512
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,208
Could you review it for me?

513
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:40,750
I...

514
00:23:42,925 --> 00:23:43,775
Miss Gu,

515
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,075
your foot...

516
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:46,000
I’m all right.

517
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,958
After a little rest, I can walk.

518
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,041
Sichen and I

519
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,750
have some work to discuss.

520
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,208
May I ask Fei’ang
to drive you back home?

521
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:54,083
All right. All right.

522
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,175
I’ll leave you alone.

523
00:23:58,225 --> 00:23:58,900
Well...

524
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:00,666
My foot is aching.

525
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:01,875
I’m going home.

526
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,208
Darling, come back home early.

527
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:04,625
I gotta go.

528
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,208
I’m all right.

529
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:06,958
I am.

530
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:08,700
I won’t disturb you.

531
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,041
I’ll leave you alone.

532
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:10,750
Drive slowly.

533
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,400
Be seated.

534
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:15,100
Mm.

535
00:24:24,525 --> 00:24:25,200
What?

536
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,333
I feel that you’ve changed.

537
00:24:29,575 --> 00:24:30,583
Because of her?

538
00:24:33,225 --> 00:24:34,125
I have?

539
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,166
You’re different
from what you used to be.

540
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:39,850
You look more active

541
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:40,916
and more childish.

542
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:49,083
Is she getting me more stupid?

543
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:52,875
Maybe you can’t realize it yet.

544
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:57,708
But Miss Gu is kind of special.

545
00:24:58,208 --> 00:24:59,750
Anyway, I don’t regret knowing her.

546
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:07,800
Is your foot still aching?

547
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:09,291
(Gu Xixi)
I’ll bring some medicine to you.

548
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:11,166
I’m okay now. Thanks for your concern.

549
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:12,300
Now that you’re okay,

550
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:14,375
copy “Hai gia mangiato” 100 times.

551
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:15,625
I’ll check when I’m home.

552
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,041
Where were we?

553
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,100
Nothing.

00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:24,700

561

(Yin Sichen)
Don’t go anywhere today.

562
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:50,916
Stay at home
and recite Italian sentences.

563
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:52,708
Copy every wrong sentence 100 times.

564
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,666
Yin Sichen,

565
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:59,458

- Grandma, you’re the best to me.
- Come on.

571
00:26:12,416 --> 00:26:13,375
Be seated, Grandma.

572
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:16,000
Still copying?

573
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:19,125
Xixi,

574
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:20,500
take a break.

575
00:26:20,791 --> 00:26:22,000
Have a glass of milk

576
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,166
and have some dessert

577
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:23,884
to fill your stomach.

578
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,666
- All right?
- Grandma, you’re the best to me.

579
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:27,525
Grandma,

580
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:30,166
you speak Italian, don’t you?

581
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:31,775
Mm.

582
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:34,625
I learned some when I was young.

583
00:26:35,725 --> 00:26:36,350
Grandma,

584
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:39,541
how to say this in Italian?

585
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:42,500
Why do you ask this?

586
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:46,625
Sichen forced me to learn Italian.

587
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:48,250
But I really can’t.

588
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:49,000
I’m wondering

589
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,500
if it’ll be easier

590
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:51,666
when I learn something
I’m interested in.

591
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:53,075
So,

592
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:55,791
I want to surprise Sichen.

593
00:26:57,041 --> 00:26:58,500
Let me think.

594
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,375
I love you?

595
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,708
No, no.

596
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:09,275
It should be, I love you a lot.

597
00:27:09,575 --> 00:27:10,300
Right.

598
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:11,458
That’s it.

599
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,208
I love you a lot.

600
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:17,500
Let me write it down.

601
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:24,250
I love you a lot.

602
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:33,958

607
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,925
Mm.

608

00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:54,041
Any better?

611
00:27:54,425 --> 00:27:55,000
Much better.

612
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,750
It’s all right.

613
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:59,416
So, you can take
the dance class tomorrow, right?

614
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:03,333
Dance class?

615

691
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:30,958
All right.

692
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:31,600
Let’s start from the beginning.

693
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,333
- Come on.
- All right.

694
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:44,425
Excuse me.

695
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:45,475
Go ahead.

696
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,725
(Mo Zixin)
Do you have time today?

697
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,275
Isn’t it time to pay

698
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,958
for the afterglow you owed me years ago?

699
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,416
Okay.

700
00:33:57,458 --> 00:33:59,125
(Gu Xixi)
I should pay my debt.

701
00:33:59,525 --> 00:34:00,291
Mr. Creditor,

702
00:34:00,575 --> 00:34:01,625
where shall we meet?

703
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,550
(Mo Zixin)
Let’s play a game.

704
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,791
See if you can find the place.

705
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,375
Come before the afterglow disappears.

706
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:20,250
Senior.

707
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:26,666
Looks like

708
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,750
I’m a bit earlier
even before the afterglow.

709
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:31,833
The afterglow is late.

710
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:35,250
Senior,

711
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,041
you like to smile.

712
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:40,275
What?

713
00:34:40,725 --> 00:34:41,416
You don’t like that?

714
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:43,083
I didn’t mean that.

715
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:44,125
I like to smile, too.

716
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:45,791
Every time I see you,

717
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:46,666
you’re smiling,

718
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,833
as if you had happy things.

719
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:53,666
I wonder if you remember.

720
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:56,666
In middle school, I was always serious.

721
00:34:57,541 --> 00:34:58,700
You said I didn’t look good.

722
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:01,916
I was like this.

723
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,175
Don’t talk to me.

724
00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:10,625
Smiling makes you look better.

725
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:16,833
The afterglow is coming out.

726
00:35:16,975 --> 00:35:17,675
Mm.

727
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:18,875
So beautiful.

728
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,200
Every time it gets dark

729
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:24,541
from the clouds.

730
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,875
Light shines behind the clouds,

731
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:31,475
and outlines them.

732
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:33,416
Then we see the afterglow.

733
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:37,225
I really don’t know

734
00:35:37,791 --> 00:35:39,125
whether the clouds make the light great

735
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,916
or whether the light
makes the clouds great.

736
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:43,833
When they mix,

737
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:46,541
they look gorgeous.

738
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,000
Senior,

739
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:52,958
you shouldn’t be a boss.

740
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:56,500
With such observation power
and artistic creativity,

741
00:35:57,833 --> 00:35:58,791
you should have been an artist.

742
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,041
Then,

743
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,458
you’ll still be my art teacher.

744
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:05,541
You got that.

745
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:07,675
Sometimes,

746
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,291
I wish I could be the sunlight

747
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,500
so that I could meet a cloud

748
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:14,291
and make it the afterglow.

749
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:18,875
I drew a picture

750
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:19,708
with the pigment you gave me.

751
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:21,750
I haven’t had it mounted yet.

752
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:23,125
I came to give it to you.

753
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:33,625
You still remember that?

754
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:35,333
Of course, I do.

755
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,000
You said it was
the once-in-a-century afterglow.

756
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:39,675
When I was in the hospital,

757
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:40,750
I faintly

758
00:36:40,791 --> 00:36:42,666
saw a bit pink.

759
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:44,791
Then I kept looking for this color

760
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:46,083
based on my memories,

761
00:36:46,475 --> 00:36:47,125
until I saw

762
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:49,125
Lianka 5277.

763
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,250
I felt

764
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,791
it was the color I was looking for.

765
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:55,166
So, you looked for this color,

766
00:36:55,791 --> 00:36:56,708
to make it up for me?

767
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,700
Mm.

768
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:58,541
Yeah.

769
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:00,083
Do you like it?

770
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,125
Yes.

771
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:06,041
You’ll meet your cloud.

772
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:12,100
Watch the afterglow with me someday.

773
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:14,416
That’s all?

774
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:15,875
Sure.

775
00:37:17,525 --> 00:37:18,333
All right. No problem.

776
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,150
By then,

777
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,750
tell me the time and location.

778
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:21,708
I’ll leave you alone.

779
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:22,333
All right.

780
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,416
Bye-bye.

781
00:37:23,416 --> 00:37:24,041
See you.

782
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:27,583
Actually, there wasn’t

783
00:37:28,666 --> 00:37:29,916
the once-in-a-century afterglow.

784
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,958
I just wanted to date you.

785
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:47,125
Why did Ran Xiwei invite me?

786
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,916
Can I not go?

787
00:37:50,225 --> 00:37:50,875
Why?

788
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,166
She’s my childhood sweetheart

789
00:37:53,416 --> 00:37:54,125
and it makes you jealous?

790
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:55,833
Yes, yes.

791
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:57,708
Because she’s your childhood sweetheart,

792
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,000
whenever I see you stay together,

793
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,200
I’ll feel sad and angry.

794
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:02,333
Don’t let me go and suffer.

795
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,225
No way.

796
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:06,416
It’s such a good chance
to prove our harmonious relationship

797
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:07,625
and happy family.

798
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:09,250
I don’t want you to miss it.

799
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,875
Don’t be ungrateful.

800
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:19,958
What kind of studio does Xiwei run?

801
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,041
Fashion We Media.

802
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:29,000
I get it!

803
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:31,083
She runs a fashion official account.

804
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,958
So, she has invited fashion media

805
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:34,325
and designers.

806
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:35,166
If I go,

807
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:37,083
I’ll get to know more people

808
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:38,500
and promote my brand.

809
00:38:38,791 --> 00:38:40,000
I’ll achieve two things
at one stroke, right?

810
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:41,250
You’re at last clever.

811
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,750
Thank you.

812
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:54,650
Are you done hugging me?

813
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:09,125
I was measuring
how much cloth I need

814
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:10,375
to make a suit for you.

815
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:13,275
I’ll take care of your suit
for the party.

816
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:22,525
Fine, then.

817
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:25,000
I’ll throw caution to the wind.

818
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:50,675
Boss.

819
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:52,875
Come with me.

820
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:53,500
What for?

821
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:55,041
Be quick.

822
00:39:55,291 --> 00:39:56,541
What exactly do you want?

823
00:39:56,541 --> 00:39:57,208
Take it off.

824
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:00,050
Come on, Gu Xixi.

825
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:01,083
We...

826
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:01,775
Do it.

827
00:40:25,583 --> 00:40:26,500
What are you doing?

828
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:29,958
Didn’t you ask me to take it off?

829
00:40:33,325 --> 00:40:35,000
I mean the coat, okay?

830
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,750
Make yourself clear next time.

831
00:40:40,958 --> 00:40:41,700
Done.

832
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:45,250
What are you doing?

833
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:46,875
Measuring you.

834
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,333
Stand straight!

835
00:40:52,833 --> 00:40:54,333
Gu Xixi, you’re rude to me.

836
00:40:56,625 --> 00:40:58,250
I bent to make it convenient for you.

837
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,666
But you’re so rude to me.

838
00:41:00,275 --> 00:41:01,500
When you bent,

839
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,583
you influenced my measuring accuracy

840
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:04,750
and my judgment.
