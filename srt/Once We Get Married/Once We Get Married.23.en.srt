(Chen Fei’ang)

24
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:11,750
Hello?

25
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,050
Does Alex reply?

26
00:02:17,332 --> 00:02:17,957
They say

27
00:02:17,957 --> 00:02:19,500
Alex is busy at the jewelry show.

28
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:20,750
He can’t reply.

29
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,957
Did they receive the email?

30
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,291
We could communicate through email.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,916
They say Alex

32
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,541
is too busy to email.

33
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,750
He declines to communicate.

34
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:35,416
I’ll keep in touch with them,

35
00:02:35,707 --> 00:02:37,000
and keep you updated.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,541
Okay.

37
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,000
- Grandma.
- Grandma.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,707
- Xixi.
- Mom.

39
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,250
Here, take this.

40
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,250
Grandma, it’s a sunny day.

41
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,000
It’s not to shelter from the rain.

42
00:03:24,457 --> 00:03:27,166
It’s to shelter from bad things.

43
00:03:29,575 --> 00:03:30,291
Mom.

44
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,666
It’s not a good idea.

45
00:03:32,457 --> 00:03:33,041
Xixi,

46
00:03:34,675 --> 00:03:35,500
take this.

47
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,375
If bad guys harass you,

48
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:38,957
hit them with this.

49
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,041
Mom is right.

50
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,900
In case I’m not with you.

51
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,525
Hey,

52
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,416
don’t go to the store.

53
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,125
Stay at home.

54
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:54,750
Xixi can work online.

55
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,582
Good idea.

56
00:03:57,075 --> 00:03:57,707
Right,

57
00:03:57,957 --> 00:03:59,457
I have a friend
who happens to do e-commerce.

58
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,650
I’ll call him now.

59
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,200
Okay.

60
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,875
Mom,

61
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:02,957
don’t bother.

62
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,357
CICI is her dream,

63
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:07,775
and CICI will enter Why Mall.

64
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,625
It’s time to bring in customers.

65
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,332
Do whatever you want.

66
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,083
I’ll back you up.

67
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:17,833
Sichen,

68
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:19,250
thank…

69
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,375
Don’t say thanks.

70
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,000
Just do it.

71
00:04:22,915 --> 00:04:23,790
Do what?

72
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,790
Grandma and Mom know, don’t you?

73
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,450
Close your eyes.

74
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:40,800
Got it?

75
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,208
Got it.

76
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:43,915
No, you didn’t.

77
00:04:43,915 --> 00:04:45,583
I’ll make you better get it.

78
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,290
I do get it.

79
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,250
Then you’d better go,

80
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,665
or I won’t let you go.

81
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,333
Let’s go.

82
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,350
(Pay back the money!
Pay back the money!)

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Look what they’ve done!

84
00:05:23,225 --> 00:05:25,040
At least they’ve got a good photo.

85
00:05:25,915 --> 00:05:26,625
Look at the eyes,

86
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,275
full of love.

87
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,958
Devil couple,

88
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,665
stock killers.

89
00:05:37,675 --> 00:05:38,600
Do you enjoy it?

90
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,875
Shall I put it on the wall
above the bed?

91
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:44,540
You remind me.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,665
I’ll have them take our wedding photos.

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,665
No way!

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,350
I don’t want my wedding photos

95
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,290
full of curses.

96
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,000
It’s so…

97
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,915
Sichen, go to work.

98
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,250
I can manage here.

99
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,540
Stay in the store, and don’t come out.

100
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,325
- Fei’ang will deliver your lunch.
- Okay. Okay…

101
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,250
Wait in the store.
I’ll pick you up in the afternoon.

102
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,325
Okay.

103
00:06:12,325 --> 00:06:13,165
Okay…

104
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:13,915
As usual,

105
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,333
tell me you’re safe every 30 minutes.

106
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,790
Am I in love with a punch-card machine?

107
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,250
Mr. Yin,

108
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:23,833
it’s time to go back to the company.

109
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,875
If anything happens, call me at once.

110
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:29,250
Don’t hide anything.

111
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,625
You talk too much.

112
00:06:31,665 --> 00:06:33,208
Is it too late to return “the goods”?

113
00:06:34,665 --> 00:06:36,250
The sale is final.

114
00:06:37,165 --> 00:06:38,665
You have to take it.

115
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,700
The rest of this

116
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,750
will be paid at home.

117
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,200
Okay.

118
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,540
Get home and ask for it.

119
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,125
Not working? What’re you doing?

120
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:16,708
Boss,

121
00:07:17,025 --> 00:07:18,300
have you seen the trending topic?

122
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,458
Mr. Yin is suspended.

123
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,540
The board will make the final decision

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,750
(President Yin of WHY-MALL Is Suspended)
at the shareholders’ meeting.

125
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:28,000
Mr. Yin

126
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,500
created Why Mall.

127
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,250
They can’t dismiss Mr. Yin, right?

128
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,125
Why Mall has five directors.

129
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:38,958
They can’t unless more than

130
00:07:39,165 --> 00:07:40,000
three of them agree.

131
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:42,415
It’s Gu Xixi’s fault.

132
00:07:42,915 --> 00:07:44,333
She ruined Mr. Yin.

133
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,333
He should have thought of that

134
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,083
when he chose Gu Xixi.

135
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:49,375
Also…

136
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:49,915
Yes?

137
00:07:49,915 --> 00:07:51,208
Is Mrs. Chen’s dress edition

138
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:52,375
ready?

139
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:53,625
Almost.

140
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:54,833
You’ll have it tomorrow.

141
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:55,625
Right,

142
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,708
isn’t Mrs. Chen’s husband

143
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,125
one of the directors of Why Mall?

144
00:08:00,925 --> 00:08:01,583
Boss,

145
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,875
are you trying to help Mr. Yin again?

146
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:08,625
Back to work.

147
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,165
Okay.

148
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:16,225
(Mrs. Chen)

149
00:08:31,415 --> 00:08:32,833
I’ve got this from the Secretariat.

150
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,833
The board directors’ agenda.

151
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:36,833
Isn’t Mr. Shang with you?

152
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,958
He went to deal with the PR crisis.

153
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,291
We have 15 days to go.

154
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,958
Before the shareholders’ meeting,

155
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,166
we have to get
three directors’ endorsements.

156
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,083
I think I have one from Director Yang.

157
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,875
He’s Why Mall’s first shareholder.

158
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,208
At the last shareholders’ meeting,

159
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,291
he didn’t say a word.

160
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,583
Everything is possible.

161
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,000
Director Chen…

162
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,625
In addition to me, Director Chen

163
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,041
is Why Mall’s largest shareholder.

164
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,916
Director Sun is close to him,

165
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,833
and will listen to him.

166
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,583
Anyway,

167
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,166
I must persuade Director Chen.

168
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,458
Director Chen’s wife’s birthday
is coming.

169
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:14,916
I got you a present.

170
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,000
We can talk with him then.

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,500
Okay.

172
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,625
I can’t go to the company for now.

173
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,291
You’ll be my eyes

174
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,000
and ears.

175
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:23,950
Sure.

176
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,333
I’m going to the company.

177
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:26,150
Okay.

178
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,625
Did they receive the email?

179
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,708
We could communicate through email.

180
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,041
They say Alex

181
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,583
is too busy to email.

182
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,833
He declines to communicate.

183
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,083
I’ll keep in touch with them,

184
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,458
and keep you updated.

185
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,025
Fei’ang, it’s you.

186
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:05,875
Where is Sichen?

187
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,000
He went to see the shareholders.

188
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,800
He told me not to let you go out,

189
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,083
in case of something bad.

190
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,208
If you need anything,

191
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:15,958
call me.

192
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,416
How is Sichen?

193
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,208
Is there anything I can do for him?

194
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,083
Don’t worry about that.

195
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,000
He’s persuading the shareholders.

196
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,041
He’ll make it.

197
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,400
Nice lunch.

198
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:41,000

Here’s the gratuity.

199
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,025
(WeChat Red Packet)

200
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,041
Mr. Yin,

201
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,708
you’ve got the free time

202
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:00,791
to play golf.

203
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,208
I came here specifically to see you.

204
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:04,333
The shareholders’ meeting…

205
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,458
Excuse me, Mr. Yin.

206
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,666
I’m a bit busy.

207
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,416
The shareholders’ meeting…

208
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,583
I’ll call you when I’m free.

209
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:12,333
Alright?

210
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:23,000
(Fei’ang)

211
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:24,916
Hello? Fei’ang.

212
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,583
Find out who has talked
with Director Yang.

213
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:28,750
- Alright.
- His attitude…

214
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,583
Please take a rest.

215
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:36,458
Sichen.

216
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,250
Not necessary.

217
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,500
I think I know what happened.

218
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:43,575
Don’t tell me

219
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,958
you happened to meet Director Yang here.

220
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,916
Director Yang is my father’s friend.

221
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,416
They have a game today.

222
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:51,875
I came with them.

223
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,666
I didn’t expect to see you here.

224
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,083
And,

225
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,041
Director Chen’s wife invited me
to her birthday party.

226
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:58,708
I said yes.

227
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,250
I just want to let you know,

228
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,125
so you’ll not feel embarrassed
to see me.

229
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,333
What do you want?

230
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,958
I want to give you another chance.

231
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,000
Leave Gu Xixi,

232
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,916
and I’ll help you persuade Director Chen
and Director Yang.

233
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,875
I don’t need a chance from you.

234
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,958
Even without Gu Xixi,

235
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,416
we couldn’t be together.

236
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,833
I never liked you.

237
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,700
I don’t understand.

238
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,900
Gu Xixi doesn’t deserve

239
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,916
what you have done for her.

240
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,875
You’re in need of help.

241
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:32,750
What can she do?

242
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,875
Cooking food?

243
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,333
Taking care of you?

244
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:37,958
Does that help?

245
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,625
You don’t understand.

246
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,250
Love by no means is a deal.

247
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:45,833
It’s never

248
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,041
an equivalent exchange.

249
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,666
Even if she does nothing,

250
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,375
even if I have to do the cooking,

251
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,375
I’d love to.

252
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,250
This is not to give,

253
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,166
or to compromise.

254
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:01,125
I love her.

255
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,083
I love to win something with her,

256
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,875
and I’m ready to lose with her.

257
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,000
That’s it.

258
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,750
Excuse me,

259
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:27,833
I need a talk with Mr. Wang.

260
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,791
Mr. Wang is not here.

261
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,208
When will he be back?

262
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,583
I’m not sure.

263
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,500
Thank you.

264
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,500
Xixi,

265
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,250

shall I take you home tonight?

266
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:07,958
No, thanks.

267
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,000
They won’t do these 24 hours a day.

268
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,208
Go home.

269
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,000
But…

270
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,666
Go.

See you, then.

274
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:18,200
Okay.

275
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,241
Tell me on WeChat when you get home.

276
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,375
Sure.

277
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,375
I’ll be fine.

278
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,400

00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,291
and sign a slavery contract.

349
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,300
Hey.

350
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,416
You said you’d feed me.

351
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,541
It turns out you’ll employ me.

352
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,458
Signing a slavery contract

353
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,666
will make sense.

354
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:36,666
You’ll be mine.

355
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:38,416
I don’t make sense.

356
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,208
I wanna make this.

357
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,291
The refreshment.

358
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,208
Maybe later.

359
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,375
Is Director Chen Why Mall’s shareholder?

360
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:02,291
Oh,

361
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,250
tomorrow is Mrs. Chen’s birthday.

362
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,041
I’ll be back pretty late.

363
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:06,916
Don’t wait for me.

364
00:18:07,525 --> 00:18:08,175
Okay.

365
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,825
(Linda’s Personal Information)

366
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,800
Xiaoya.

367
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,300
Huh?

368
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,467
You’re a model, right?

369
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,583
And your good friend.

370
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,625
Did you just

371
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:30,708
get your memory back?

372
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:31,916
Do you remember you owe me money?

373
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:32,541
Repay now.

374
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:35,750
Do you know her?

375
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:37,333
(Linda’s Personal Information)
Linda.

376
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,000
(Linda’s Personal Information)
I know her.

377
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
My senior.

378
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,625
One of the first fashion icons.

379
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,375
Anyway,

380
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,583
she married a rich man

381
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,916
and doesn’t show up often.

382
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:45,625
I guess

383
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,750
few people remember her name.

384
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,166
She’s now Mrs. Chen.

385
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:52,416
Why?

386
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:53,958
Do you know her well?

387
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,541
Can I invite her to dinner

388
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,791
or show her around the store?

389
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:03,458
Do you have the mood
to admire a rich wife?

390
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,500
Listen. Forget it.

391
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,291
It is said

392
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,750
that she doesn’t have a good reputation

393
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:08,875
in the ladies’ circle.

394
00:19:10,475 --> 00:19:11,125
Why?

395
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,166
Possibly because she, as a newcomer,

396
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,625
didn’t know
the social codes of the rich.

397
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:17,166
So,

398
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,166
she unintentionally

399
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,375
offended another rich woman,

400
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:20,541
and that rich woman

401
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:21,916
spoke ill of her.

402
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,791
I don’t know the particulars.

403
00:19:23,975 --> 00:19:24,583
Anyway,

404
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,075
her husband indulges her.

405
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,166
He gives her everything she wants.

406
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,750
I’m jealous!

407
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,667
So

408
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,650
if I want to get close to Director Chen,

409
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,150
I have to get close to Linda first.

410
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,375
Sichen.

411
00:19:48,725 --> 00:19:49,625
How come you’re here?

412
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,250
Director Chen values family.

413
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,416
You can’t go

414
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,083
to Mrs. Chen’s birthday party
without me.

415
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:58,550
But you…

416
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,550
I’m smart.

417
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:02,025
I’ll improvise at the party.

418
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:03,375
Trust me.

419
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,225
I’m pretty good at blabbering.

420
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,100
Let’s go.

421
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,708
Long time no see.

422
00:20:14,075 --> 00:20:14,625
Yeah.

423
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:15,583
Director Chen.

424
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,250
Mr. Yin.

425
00:20:18,775 --> 00:20:19,916
You look great.

426
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,525
Please feel at home.

427
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:22,833
Have a good time.

428
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:26,900
Mr. Wang.

429
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,625
Hi!

430
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,000
Welcome.

431
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,208
Come on.

432
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,541
Excuse me.

433
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,458
I went to your office yesterday,

434
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:35,708
but you were not there.

435
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,625
It’s about the shareholders’ meeting.

436
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:41,500
Sichen,

437
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,350
this is a birthday party.

438
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,750
We don’t talk about work, alright?

439
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,125
I’m sorry. Excuse me.

440
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,416
Hope we

441
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,833
could do something together.

442
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:57,583
You’re so sweet.

443
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,850
- I look forward to it.
- Linda.

444
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:00,041
Xixi,

445
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,166
here you are.

446
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:01,833
I’ve been waiting for you.

447
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:02,791
I thought you’d miss it.

448
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,600
Of course not. It’s your birthday.

449
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,166
Well,

450
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,833
Mrs. Chen, do you know Miss Gu?

451
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:09,825
Yes.

452
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,975
She and I hit it off
at the first meeting.

453
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:14,833
Where’s your husband?

454
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,291
I can’t wait to see which lucky guy

455
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,708
takes you as his wife.

456
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,250
May I introduce him to you?

457
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:21,125
Great.

458
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:21,541
Come on.

459
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,000
Yeah.

460
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,875
Good relationship.

461
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,100
You can teach me.

462
00:21:25,175 --> 00:21:25,875
Sichen,

463
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,416
this is

464
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,041
Linda, my friend.

465
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,500
This is my husband, Yin Sichen.

466
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,333
Mrs. Chen, happy birthday.

467
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,083
Do you know each other?

468
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:36,875
What a coincidence!

469
00:21:37,075 --> 00:21:37,550
Come on.

470
00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:38,566
I’ll introduce my husband to you.

471
00:21:39,525 --> 00:21:40,400
Honey,

472
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:41,875
this is

473
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,166
Mrs. Yin, wife of Why Mall’s President.

474
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,750
We hit it off.

475
00:21:47,725 --> 00:21:48,333
Do you?

476
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,541
Don’t you have Why Mall’s shares?

477
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:51,791
Honey,

478
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,083
didn’t you say you wanted
to talk to Director Chen?

479
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:54,875
Did you two talk?

480
00:21:55,325 --> 00:21:56,992
Do we interrupt you?

481
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:57,675
Oh,

482
00:21:57,675 --> 00:21:58,575
business talk.

483
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,350
You may do it in the study.

484
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,083
This is a birthday party.

485
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,041
It’s not a good time to talk about work.

486
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,583
It’s fine. I can manage.

487
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,075
I’ll take care of them.

488
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:09,375
Go, go.

489
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,041
Go.

490
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,666
Well, Mr. Yin, please.

491
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,985
I went home last month,

492
00:22:18,985 --> 00:22:19,575
and had a date.

493
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,541
How come you’re a friend of Mrs. Chen?

494
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,000
I did her a big favor.

495
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,083
Linda.

496
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:31,916
Xiaoya.

497
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:34,625
It’s been so long. You look so great!

498
00:22:35,925 --> 00:22:37,250
I can’t believe that woman

499
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,650
is wearing the same dress as me!

500
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:39,958
She must have seen

501
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,583
the photo I posted online

502
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:42,541
and she bought the same dress.

503
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:43,875
Imitator!

504
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:47,000
But this dress looks best on you.

505
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,291
Hello, Linda.

506
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:49,975
Huh?

507
00:22:49,975 --> 00:22:50,791
I’m Gu Xixi.

508
00:22:52,475 --> 00:22:53,125
She is

509
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:55,375
the designer of CICI
that you appreciated.

510
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,650
It’s you.

511
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:57,583
Linda,

512
00:22:57,875 --> 00:22:58,666
I think

513
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:01,041
some adornments will make the dress

514
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,500
better fit you.

515
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,666
A little adornment?

516
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,250
Linda.

517
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,041
Linda.

518
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:11,750
I like the design of your dress.

519
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:12,700
What is the brand?

520
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,875
Will you share?

521
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:16,375
I’d say the brand is mediocre.

522
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:17,950
I didn’t want to wear it today,

523
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,833
but Xixi had it redone.

524
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:23,750
This design is not available
on the market.

525
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,675
Wow!

526
00:23:24,675 --> 00:23:25,750
Right, Xixi,

527
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,800
do you run a brand of your own?

528
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:30,666
Yes, my store is called CICI.

529
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,416
Mrs. Chen’s friends

530
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:33,700
- enjoy special discounts.
- Yes, yes.

531
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,833
Miss Gu is so sweet.

532
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:37,125
You flattered me.

533
00:23:37,425 --> 00:23:38,083
Right,

534
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,250
my birthday is coming.

535
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,375
Please come to the party.

536
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:41,750
I have some very,

537
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,666
very fastidious friends.

538
00:23:55,975 --> 00:23:56,750
Miss Gu.

539
00:23:58,775 --> 00:23:59,575
Miss Ran.

540
00:24:00,675 --> 00:24:01,708
You’re good.

541
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,625
Mrs. Chen is convinced by you

542
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,500
in such a short time.

543
00:24:06,775 --> 00:24:07,750
You’re so resourceful.

544
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:09,375
I don’t have resources.

545
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,458
I just happened

546
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:13,875
to be Linda’s friend,

547
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:16,541
and give Sichen a little help.

548
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:17,550
Good.

549
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:18,958
Good luck.

550
00:25:00,675 --> 00:25:01,250
Ouch!

551
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,625
You step on my shadow.

552
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,083
It hurts!

553
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:06,025
I claim compensation.

554
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:09,250
Mr. Yin, you’re blackmailing me.

555
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:11,916
How was it? What did Director Chen say?

556
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,708
I give up.

557
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,075
It’s fine, Sichen.

558
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,875
Mrs. Chen and I are good friends.

559
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:24,541
We’ll try another way.

560
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,300
We still have the chance, don’t we?

561
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:28,583
Don’t be upset.

562
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:32,800
Director Chen is now on my side!

563
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:35,125
Put me down!

564
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:39,291
My wife did me a big favor.

565
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:40,708
How should I reward her?

566
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:54,666
I have a piece of bad news and a…

567
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:55,666
The bad news.

568
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:57,916
Director Chen is now on our side.

569
00:25:57,916 --> 00:26:00,125
We’ve got two votes from the board.

570
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,583
But according to my knowledge,

571
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:03,875
the other board members,
including Director Yang,

572
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:06,416
are not happy with your performance.

573
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:08,291
I suppose they’d hardly

574
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:10,375
vote for you.

575
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:13,400
And the good news?

576
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:15,250
There is no good news.

577
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,625
I was saying a piece of bad news

578
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:19,650
and a piece of worse news.

579
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:20,925
Hey,

580
00:26:21,475 --> 00:26:22,458
listen to me

581
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:23,875
and you’ll know I’m right.

582
00:26:25,075 --> 00:26:30,708
We do have the last chance.

583
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:34,541
Alex.

584
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:36,083
Yes.

585
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:38,791
We traded with him with

586
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:39,958
ten percent of equity.

587
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:41,708
If Alex is on my side,

588
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,458
we may win it back.

589
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:46,708
How is he now?

590
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,416
Did he reply?

591
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:49,291
That’s why I said “worse”.

592
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:51,083
The board members are against you

593
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:52,525
because Alex

594
00:26:52,675 --> 00:26:54,050
has not taken a stand.

595
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:00,209
I must win Alex’s support.

596
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,300
He’s our only hope.

597
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,750
Alex created Marry Me

598
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:14,875
to commemorate his wife.

599
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:16,875
He might forgive us

600
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:19,375
for lying to him about other things,

601
00:27:19,925 --> 00:27:20,625
but in the beginning,

602
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:22,416
we lied to him about our relationship.

603
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:23,850
I think it’s hard

604
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,041
to ask for his forgiveness.

605
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:27,250
I’ll fly to Milan and say sorry

606
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:29,416
to him face-to-face.

607
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,625
I’ll beg for his forgiveness.

608
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:33,250
I’ll go with you.

609
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:35,791
It won’t be easy.

610
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:38,083
You stay at home and wait for my news.

611
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:40,458
We’ve made

612
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,250
the mistake together,

613
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:44,550
and we’ll make it up

614
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,500
together.

615
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:49,950
And you need me

616
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:50,875
to get close to Alex.

617
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:57,708
Alright.

618
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,900
Buy the tickets.

619
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,625
You’ve planned it.

620
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:15,625
No.

621
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:18,208
Just in case

622
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,583
something unexpected happens

623
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,875
between us.

624
00:28:23,425 --> 00:28:24,775
Something unexpected?

625
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:25,875
Such as

626
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:27,166
we have a fight

627
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:29,041
and I run away from home.

628
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,291
If I have to pack up things,

629
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,541
it’d be awkward.

630
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:33,750
So I’ve got everything ready.

631
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:35,166
If we fight, I can leave right away.

632
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:36,875
Isn’t it sweet?

633
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,667
Yes.

634
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:39,075
Sweet.

635
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:41,625
So sweet.

636
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:42,250
Yes.

637
00:28:42,666 --> 00:28:44,625
So sweet that you deserve a reward.

638
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:46,500
No, no, no!

639
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,583
You flattered me.

640
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,083
I did what I should.

641
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:55,700
Don’t ever think of running

642
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,000
away from home!

643
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:58,200
Yield! Yield!

644
00:28:58,458 --> 00:28:59,416
I yield!

645
00:28:59,666 --> 00:29:01,041
Please forgive me!

646
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,208
I’ll not forgive you.

647
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:13,300
(Milan, Italy)

648
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,050
Sichen.

649
00:29:15,475 --> 00:29:16,075
Huh?

650
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:19,000
We did do something bad,

651
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,375
but we fell in love with each other

652
00:29:20,416 --> 00:29:22,000
because of Marry Me.

653
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:23,875
I guess nobody else knows

654
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:25,291
what Marry Me means than we do.

655
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,541
If Alex gives us one more chance,

656
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,125
we’ll put our feelings

657
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,875
into Marry Me’s design

658
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:37,583
and carry on

659
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:38,750
Alex’s ideas.

660
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:40,583
Great.

661
00:29:41,075 --> 00:29:42,666
When you meet Alex,

662
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:44,416
have a good talk with him.

663
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:44,958
I will.

664
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:46,708
Trust me.

665
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:48,708
Everything will be fine.

666
00:29:48,975 --> 00:29:49,575
Yes.

667
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:58,350
Why?

668
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:00,875
Alex wouldn’t like to see

669
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:01,916
a long face.

670
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,166
Excuse me, I need a talk with Alex.

671
00:30:19,291 --> 00:30:20,791
Sorry, you can’t see Alex

672
00:30:20,791 --> 00:30:21,833
without an appointment.

673
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:23,175
I’ll make an appointment now.

674
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,791
Please put it

675
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:25,750
on Alex’s schedule.

676
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:26,625
We can wait.

677
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:28,083
He’s not in the studio.

678
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,416
Where is he?

679
00:30:31,525 --> 00:30:33,666
I can tell you Alex’s whereabouts.

680
00:30:35,025 --> 00:30:36,000
When will he be back?

681
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:38,041
I don’t know.

682
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:40,291
You may sit down and take a rest.

683
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,291
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

684
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:48,875
Boss,

685
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:52,500
I lost the drawing

686
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:53,750
you’ve approved.

687
00:30:55,025 --> 00:30:55,708
I can fix this.

688
00:30:56,925 --> 00:30:57,583
Hello,

689
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:01,250
do you remember me? We’ve met.

690
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:07,916
- Sure.
- Wait for the mail.

691
00:31:07,975 --> 00:31:08,600
Okay.

692
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:10,041
Thank you.

693
00:31:11,475 --> 00:31:13,225
I’ll send you a message when I get back.

694
00:31:13,225 --> 00:31:13,700
Okay.

695
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,375
- Alright?
