Gu Xixi.

00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,075
Um.

25
00:01:52,975 --> 00:01:57,058
You don’t need to get so worked up
every time when it comes to money.

26
00:01:58,225 --> 00:01:59,958
Sorry, sorry.

27
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,666
Sorry.

28
00:02:15,325 --> 00:02:17,625
I haven’t measured your waist.

29
00:02:47,707 --> 00:02:48,750
Okay, I’m done.

30
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,000
Don’t worry.

31
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,066
I will give you a look you like.

32
00:03:01,675 --> 00:03:04,100
(Guangwu Center)

33
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,666
Long time no see.
You are getting more beautiful.

34
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:08,916
Not bad.

35
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,450
He said it every time.

36
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,250
Well,

37
00:03:16,707 --> 00:03:18,625
doesn’t it feel good to be Mrs. Yin?

38
00:03:19,082 --> 00:03:19,916
Narcissist.

39
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,325
You are shrewd.

40
00:03:25,525 --> 00:03:26,509
How can I compare with you?

41
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,541
Xiwei.

42
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,332
Sichen.

43
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,368
Mr. Wang has been waiting for you
for a while.

44
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,650
Do you wanna say hi to him?

45
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,700
I’ll take you there next time.

46
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,750
Sorry, Xixi.

47
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,750
I need to borrow your husband.

48
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,250
Okay.

49
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,125
Just remember to bring him back.

50
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,575
Where should we pass it to?

51
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:43,875
Sichen, let’s go.

52
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,000
Wait for me here.

53
00:03:47,457 --> 00:03:48,332
I’ll be back in a while.

54
00:03:49,025 --> 00:03:49,625
Um.

55
00:03:52,075 --> 00:03:53,041
- Mr. Wang.
- Yes.

56
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,575
Long time no see.

57
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,582
They are over there.

58
00:03:56,775 --> 00:03:57,707
Go ahead by yourself.

59
00:03:57,707 --> 00:03:58,957
I don’t like this kind of occasion.

60
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,707
- Go ahead.
- Well,

61
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:01,457
- I’m leaving.
- Um.

62
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,816
The wine is not bad.

63
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:06,800
Compared with what my husband
brought back, it’s...

64
00:04:12,475 --> 00:04:13,666
Gu Xixi?

65
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,125
You look familiar.

66
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,083
I’m Mu Ruona. We met at the wedding.

67
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,875
I remember you.

68
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,250
Just call me Xixi.

69
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,665
By the way, where’s Yin Sichen?

70
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,458
He is socializing over there.

71
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,275
Here you are.

72
00:04:31,225 --> 00:04:33,000
Do you also think it’s boring here?

73
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,800
Um.

74
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,875
It’s quite boring.

75
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,750
I don’t like
this kind of social event anyway.

76
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,125
I was dragged here
after getting off work.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,915
So boring.

78
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,083
Same here.

79
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,040
I was off work

80
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,290
and still dragged here to work overtime.

81
00:04:45,725 --> 00:04:47,250
Seems that we are the same.

82
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,290
Cheers.

83
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,040
Sorry, sorry.

84
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,458
Are you all right?

85
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,250
Let me clean it for you.

86
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,040
It’s okay.

87
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,700
- It’s okay.
- It’s dirty.

88
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,350
Sorry.

89
00:04:56,775 --> 00:04:58,375
It gives me a reason to leave now.

90
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,083
You are a delicate girl.

91
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,375
Your clothes can’t be dirty.

92
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,540
I know what to do. Come with me.

93
00:05:05,675 --> 00:05:06,790
Come with me.

94
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,375
Give me your silk scarf.

95
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,665
I don’t think you can clean it
with a silk scarf.

96
00:05:19,415 --> 00:05:20,833
I’m not going to clean it.

97
00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:35,915
I can only cover it like this.

98
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,833
I didn’t know you are so adroit.

99
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,790
I’m a designer.

100
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:43,875
It looks great.

101
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:45,540
Thank you.

102
00:05:45,915 --> 00:05:46,665
You are welcome.

103
00:05:46,665 --> 00:05:47,458
Let’s go.

104
00:05:51,025 --> 00:05:52,100
We haven’t met for a long time.

105
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,083
Gu Xixi, you are good at making friends.

106
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:00,708
You don’t need me
to introduce her, right?

107
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:02,665
It’s my wife, Gu Xixi.

108
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,083
My clothes got dirty just now

109
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,540
and Xixi fixed it for me.

110
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,625
Yin Sichen, your wife is great.

111
00:06:08,665 --> 00:06:10,000
Why didn’t you introduce her
to me before?

112
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,540
She is too frank.

113
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,415
Sometimes she can be straightforward.

114
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,083
I’m worried
that she would say something wrong

115
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,583
and make you angry.

116
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,125
We are quite alike in this regard.

117
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:23,590
By the way,

118
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,208
if Yin Sichen doesn’t treat you well,

119
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,375
just tell me. I’ll kick his ass for you.

120
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:28,333
Yeah?

121
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,375
You can have a try.

122
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,040
We are going there.

123
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,775
Bye.

124
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:32,550
Bye-bye.

125
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,083
I’m glad you are here tonight

126
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,165
for my opening ceremony.

127
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,083
I’m also very lucky.

128
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,415
Thanks to your support,

129
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,958
I’m able to establish V. Studio.

130
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:48,415
But the person

131
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,500
I want to thank the most now

132
00:06:50,915 --> 00:06:52,833
is my best friend.

133
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,540
There would be no V. Studio

134
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,040
without him.

135
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,665
He is Yin Sichen.

136
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,125
Next, I’d like to invite him to come up
and say a few words.

137
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,375
Me?

138
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,600
Um.

139
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,625
Thanks.

140
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:12,833
First, I’m very happy

141
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,375
for Xiwei that her studio opens today.

142
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,875
After all, it’s hard for us

143
00:07:17,915 --> 00:07:20,040
to find a job

144
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,165
we love and we are good at.

145
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,290
I’ve never really understood fashion,

146
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,333
but tonight, many friends

147
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,708
asked me about

148
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,415
the designer of the suit I’m wearing.

149
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:30,875
Now I’ll introduce

150
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,665
this designer to you.

151
00:07:34,175 --> 00:07:36,375
My wife, Gu Xixi.

152
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,790
What we are wearing tonight

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,208
are both designed by her.

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,125
It is also her upcoming

155
00:07:42,165 --> 00:07:43,915
personal clothing brand, CICI.

156
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,833
I hope she can have your support.

157
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,458
Thanks.

158
00:07:53,915 --> 00:07:55,500
Sichen just

159
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,625
mentioned Miss Gu’s new store.

160
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,083
I believe you haven’t heard of it.

161
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,575
I hope Miss Gu

162
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,665
can come up to share her experience,

163
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,415
so that juniors like us
can learn from her.

164
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,665
Miss Gu.

165
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:13,100
You don’t need to go up
if you don’t want.

166
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:27,040
Hi, I’m Gu Xixi.

167
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:30,290
Miss Ran was overpraising me.

168
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,791
I’m just a rookie designer.

169
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,541
I can’t give you any guidance

170
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,791
and I don’t have any experience
to share with you,

171
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,375
but I’m happy

172
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,083
to share my thoughts with you.

173
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,000
First,

174
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,166
I have to say

175
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,791
the PL’s haute couture

176
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,000
that Miss Ran is wearing today

177
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,875
is gorgeous and exquisite,

178
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,125
just like herself. It’s perfect.

179
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,425
But what I want to say

180
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,541
is that fashion
is not just about luxury.

181
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,708
We should have the courage
to break the rules

182
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,541
and show our uniqueness.

183
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,833
Even if you are not wearing couture

184
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,875
or a luxurious brand,

185
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,500
you can still
break the limit they set for you

186
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,833
and show the best of yourself.

187
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,541
As for my store, CICI,

188
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,583
it hasn’t opened yet.

189
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I hope we can have your support

190
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,666
when it opens.

191
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:21,750
Thank you.

192
00:09:29,075 --> 00:09:31,041
Many thanks to Miss Gu’s speech.

193
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,083
Hope we can have
in-depth cooperation later.

194
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,000
Well, please

195
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,666
have a good time tonight.

196
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,791
You handled it with calm, Gu Xixi.

197
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:42,916
But I was super nervous.

198
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:43,958
You deserve it.

199
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,375
Thanks to your support.

200
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,958
Have you packed your luggage?

201
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,500
Madam Song is packing it for me.

202
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,600
Oh.

203
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,541
See you tomorrow.

204
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:10,750
Rest early.

205
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,000
Um.

206
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,700
(Milan, Italy)

207
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,333
We are going to Alex’s studio

208
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,500
to meet him

209
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:35,250
at 7:00 PM tonight.

210
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,541
Let’s go to the hotel and rest first.

211
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,416
Look, Yin Sichen.

212
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:38,666
It’s so beautiful.

213
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,291
Can’t you stop

214
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,458
acting like a country bumpkin?

215
00:10:44,975 --> 00:10:47,000
Can you show some interest in life?

216
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,375
Not everyone
only cares about money like you do.

217
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,958
So,

218
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,416
you know life well?

219
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,833
I know it better than you do.

220
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:58,291
By the way,

221
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,208
there is an outdoor fashion show today.

222
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,208
Can I go there?

223
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,375
Don’t think about it.

224
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,333
You must stay in the hotel

225
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,041
to prepare for

226
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,125
the dinner tonight.

227
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,083
But that show is only for today.

228
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,625
By the way, let me remind you.

229
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,625
In the next few days,

230
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,833
you must make full use of

231
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,708
what you’ve been taught
in front of Alex.

232
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,625
Act more like

233
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,750
Mrs. Yin.

234
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,333
I know.

235
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:33,000
Darling.

236
00:11:42,475 --> 00:11:43,125
This way.

237
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,250
Please.

238
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:46,958
Okay.

239
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,875
Where is mine?

240
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,000
What are you thinking?

241
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,916
Of course you will sleep with me.

242
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,333
If Alex finds out
we sleep in separate rooms,

243
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:56,541
how should we explain it?

244
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:01,208
It’s a suite, right?

245
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,250
Or what?

246
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:05,875
Well,

247
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,166
do you want
to sleep in the same room with me?

248
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,625
Who wants that?

249
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,416
I’m just thinking
if you will put that room

250
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,458
on my payroll.

251
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,166
That’s not necessary.

252
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,958
But you must report to me every day
when you go out.

253
00:12:17,225 --> 00:12:18,225
The time and the place.

254
00:12:18,225 --> 00:12:19,416
The people you met.

255
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,750
It’s best to write it down.

256
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,083
Besides,

257
00:12:23,925 --> 00:12:25,083
curfew is 8:00 PM.

258
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,416
You are stricter than my mom.

259
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,041
It’s 1:00 PM.

260
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,833
You are free now.

261
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,175
We will have dinner with Alex at 6:00 PM

262
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,750
so we’ll leave at 5:30 PM sharp.

263
00:12:53,925 --> 00:12:54,791
Boss.

264
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,000
Boss, I’m here to report to you.

265
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,291
Boss, are you taking a shower?

266
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:07,625
Well.

267
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,500
(I’m out. Be back before 5:00 PM. Gu Xixi)
Don’t blame me. I’ve reported to you.

268
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,100
Wow.

269
00:13:28,325 --> 00:13:29,416
It has run of battery.

270
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,166
Gu Xixi.

271
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,208
Hello, Fei’ang.

272
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,583
What?

273
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,541
Alex changed the meeting to 4:00 PM?

274
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:52,916
Okay, I see.

275
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:53,916
I’ll tell Gu Xixi that.

276
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,791
(Sorry.)

277
00:13:56,833 --> 00:14:00,000
(The number you dialed
cannot be connected for the moment.)

278
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,416
(Please redial again later.)

279
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,575
(Chen. I’m out.
Be back before 5:00 PM. Gu Xixi)

280
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:18,625
Hello, Fei’ang.

281
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,875
Gu Xixi went out by herself.

282
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,000
I can’t reach her.

283
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:23,708
Go to Alex’s place

284
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:24,500
and stall him first.

285
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:25,625
I’ll go to find her.

286
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:51,125
Why does the show
have to be held in the woods?

287
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,083
There is no one here.

288
00:15:38,025 --> 00:15:38,791
Are you all right?

289
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:47,500
Are you all right?

290
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,708
Gu Xixi, where did you go?

291
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,009
Do you know how much I worry about you?

292
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,416
Yin Sichen.

293
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:03,541
No.

294
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,791
I want to see a show.

295
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:06,625
That show

296
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,208
is somehow held in the woods.

297
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,000
I came here but I couldn’t find it.

298
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,583
There is no road sign
and my phone ran out of battery.

299
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,333
I’ve been going around here.

300
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,416
I’m so scared.

301
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,500
Luckily, you are here.

302
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:22,916
Are you angry?

303
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:23,708
You think?

304
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:26,833
We’ll talk about this when we get back.

305
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,500
Alex moved the meeting forward.

306
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,083
Let’s go.

307
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:40,375
Sorry.

308
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,583
I’ll explain to Alex

309
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,875
and apologize to him
when I see him later.

310
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,125
I didn’t know it would be like this.

311
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,583
Have you ever thought about the result
if you get hurt?

312
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,166
Have you ever thought about me?

313
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,458
Are you worried about me?

314
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,433
I mean how I should face Alex.

315
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:08,325
Oh.

316
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:16,375
You...

317
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,250
When did you get hurt?

318
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:19,166
It’s okay.

319
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,250
Just a scratch.

320
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,291
You are bleeding.

321
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:24,375
It’s okay.

322
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,000
It’s just...

323
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,000
I’m not worried about your scratch.

324
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,500
It’s just that your sleeve is torn.

325
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,916
I’m worried that Alex will see it.

326
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,333
Your girlfriend is virtuous.

327
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,958
Can you speak Chinese?

328
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,958
Yes.

329
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:44,916
She is my wife.

330
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,208
Of course, she is virtuous.

331
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:48,083
Okay, I see.

332
00:17:51,575 --> 00:17:52,700
Who is your wife?

333
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,958
Mr. Yin.

334
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,333
I’m so sorry, Mr. Alex.

335
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,875
This sleepyhead slept in.

336
00:18:14,075 --> 00:18:15,166
Mr. Alex.

337
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,083
Ciao.

338
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,459
Ciao?

339
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,216
Um.

340
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:21,541
I didn’t know you can speak Italian.

341
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,083
Yin Sichen taught me that.

342
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,291
Only happy people sleep in.

343
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,666
Looks like you are

344
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:28,791
living a happy married life.

345
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,500
Since you’re here for your honeymoon,

346
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,041
you should relax yourselves.

347
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,625
Let me show you my studio.

348
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:37,333
Okay.

349
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,166
Sir, this is the new design.

350
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,083
Good.

351
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,083
Send it to the garment factory
when you have time.

352
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:46,750
Okay.

353
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,083
Please.

354
00:18:58,916 --> 00:18:59,666
Bear it.

355
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,900
Why is Gu Xixi such a troublemaker?

356
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,041
She caused me trouble at home,

357
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:11,458
and she doesn’t stop out there.

358
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,125
I have to clean her mess every time.

359
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:14,416
Am I doing charity?

360
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,875
I should put a note on her forehead.

361
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,000
Black spot. Please avoid.

362
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:22,875
Why are you laughing?

363
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,208
You used to blame others

364
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,083
no matter what happened.

365
00:19:27,275 --> 00:19:28,817
You never cared about other people.

366
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,125
Now you are more human.

367
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,791
I didn’t expect

368
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,666
to see your human side
during my lifetime.

369
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,033
You mean

370
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,583
I was impersonal before?

371
00:19:41,575 --> 00:19:42,666
I didn’t say that.

372
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,167
Gu Xixi and I signed a contract.

373
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:49,958
To put it bluntly, I’m her boss.

374
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:50,916
I have to make sure

375
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,166
she is safe during her employment.

376
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,000
If something happens to her,

377
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,375
it will affect the subsequent plans.

378
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,375
And you know what,

379
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,958
it’s a rule of employee management.

380
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:03,458
Just wait.

381
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,125
She’ll come to apologize to me later.

382
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,958
But I don’t think she will.

383
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,125
She went to bed
as soon as she came back.

384
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,041
She specially told me

385
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,791
not to ask her to eat

386
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,166
or wake her up.

387
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,541
She will meet us in the lobby tomorrow.

388
00:20:21,225 --> 00:20:22,208
Ungrateful.

389
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,250
Thanks to her,

390
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:25,666
Alex cleared

391
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,416
a whole day tomorrow

392
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,500
to have a tour of Milan with you.

393
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,166
I’ll let her take the credit.

394
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:37,541
Really?

395
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,833
We’ve passed the review of Wenye Group

396
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,333
and received the upfront payment.

397
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:42,875
That’s fast.

398
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,541
Thank you, Xiaoya.

399
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,166
By the way, you know what,

400
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,375
I rented a photo studio today.

401
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,041
The owner is willing to give us

402
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,083
a 30% discount.

403
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,333
Really? That’s great.

404
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,666
Put it on the schedule.

405
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:54,666
We will start the shooting

406
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,875
as soon as I get back.

407
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,333
By the way,

408
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,125
I saw a lot of great designer shops

409
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,541
in Milan today.

410
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,958
I’m going to take a look tomorrow.

411
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:02,958
Good. Good.

412
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,375
I’ll hang up then.

413
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,416
I’m really tired, Xiaoya.

414
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:07,416
Hold on.

415
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:11,500
Looks like you are
having an exciting honeymoon.

416
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,625
As your best friend,

417
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,541
I have to remind you

418
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,583
to stay safe.

419
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,125
Are you insane?

420
00:21:19,775 --> 00:21:20,666
I’m going to sleep.

421
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
(Yin Sichen)
Are you sleeping?

422
00:21:29,525 --> 00:21:31,916
Since I’m sleeping now,

423
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:34,541
I don’t need to text him back.

424
00:21:37,525 --> 00:21:39,450
(Best Wishes Red Packet)

425
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,625
That wicked Yin Sichen
sent me a red packet.

426
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,416
No, no.

427
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,041
Control yourself.

428
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,541
I can’t see it. I can’t see it.

429
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:51,083
(Best Wishes Red Packet)

430
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,625
Control yourself.

431
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,291
Control yourself.

432
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:56,625
I can’t control myself anymore!

433
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,675
(Yin Sichen’s Red Packet 2.33 yuan)

434
00:21:59,675 --> 00:22:00,916
2.33 yuan?

435
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,333
You are too stingy, Yin Sichen.

436
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,333
(Yin Sichen)
Come to my room if you are awake.

437
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,950
Why didn’t I control myself?

438
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:10,958
I...

439
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:18,583
Come in.

440
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,291
Boss, what’s the matter?

441
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:29,916
Gu Xixi.

442
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:31,458
I think I need

443
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,500
to reiterate my identity to you.

444
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,041
Are you going to blame me
for what happened today?

445
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,500
At this time?

446
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,958
I apologized.

447
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,083
You are my wife.

448
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,333
I got hurt today because of you.

449
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,125
You didn’t even ask about it?

450
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:46,708
If other people see it,

451
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:48,708
would they believe
that we are a couple in love?

452
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:52,583
Shouldn’t you at least
put medicine on me?

453
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,416
I’ve prepared it for you.

454
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:58,583
Come on.

455
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:18,625
It hurts?

456
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:19,916
It’s okay.

457
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,100
Do you really like that show?

458
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,400
Um.

459
00:23:36,075 --> 00:23:37,041
Well,

460
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,500
there will be a similar show
a few days later.

461
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,083
If you want to see it,

462
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,458
I can go with you.

463
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:47,708
No need.

464
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,916
I’m already satisfied

467

Fine.

It’s better.

No?

514
00:26:51,725 --> 00:26:52,625
Don’t dodge.

515
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:58,458
Try to dodge again.

516
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,500
I’m not.

517
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,375
Get up now.

518
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:13,625
Alex is waiting for us to eat.

519
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:31,625
Hope my store will have a good start.

520
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:32,975
Let the money

521
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:34,458
roll in.

522
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,750
Let me get rich

523
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:36,916
and make a fortune.

524
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:38,500
Please, please.

525
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,750
This is a wishing well,

526
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,050
not a money tree.

527
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:44,458
Maybe it will work.

528
00:27:58,925 --> 00:27:59,791
Oh, no.

529
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:01,250
What’s wrong?

530
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:02,750
I threw the wrong coin.

531
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:04,750
I don’t think I can find it.

532
00:28:05,958 --> 00:28:08,125
Is that coin important?

533
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:11,541
It’s a commemorative coin
my dad gave me when I was a kid.

534
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,583
Never mind.

535
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,825
If it’s lost, it’s lost.

536
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:15,875
I won’t be able to find it.

537
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,083
Let me take a picture for you.

538
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:21,750
Okay.

539
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,708
Come closer. Don’t be shy.

540
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:46,291
Thank you so much

541
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:47,333
for showing us around for a whole day.

542
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,416
This is what I should do.

543
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:51,500
It’s your honeymoon anyway.

544
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,041
Boss.

545
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,192
Well,

546
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:58,791
I lost the design

547
00:28:58,958 --> 00:28:59,958
you approved last time.

548
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:00,958
What?

549
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,375
Didn’t you upload it?

550
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:04,916
I haven’t had time.

551
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,291
Do you realize

552
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:09,291
it’s gonna affect
our new product launch event?

553
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,541
Maybe I can help.

554
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:21,916
Gu Xixi.

555
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,375
If you don’t mind.

556
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:28,541
I saw

557
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:29,625
that design last time.

558
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:32,416
I think I remember some of it.

559
00:29:32,725 --> 00:29:33,808
I can draw it down.

560
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:37,791
Please, thank you.

561
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:11,250
Gu Xixi.

562
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:13,000
What’s the dotted line?

563
00:30:15,475 --> 00:30:17,625
She solved the problem
bothering me for a long time.

564
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:20,208
Yeah?

565
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:21,875
Just use this.

566
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:22,833
Okay.

567
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:37,291
You eat first.

568
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:38,291
I’ll go to the restroom.

569
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,250
Um.

570
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,791
Mr. Alex.

571
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:48,791
Thank you very much

572
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:50,083
for your hospitality.

573
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:52,000
You came all the way over here.

574
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,291
I’m also honored.

575
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:55,041
But again,

576
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:56,708
it’s a wonderful fate

577
00:30:57,125 --> 00:30:58,750
to meet you two.

578
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:04,583
Maybe we are not as good as you think.

579
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:06,625
I’ve read a lot of people.

580
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:08,784
You are a kind person.

581
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:09,916
I know that.

582
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:14,916
I mean,

583
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:20,208
what if we haven’t been
totally honest with you?

584
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:21,625
In fact,

585
00:31:21,666 --> 00:31:23,208
there is no absolute frankness
between people.

586
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:25,375
We are just trying to find a balance

587
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:26,666
between truth and lies.

588
00:31:27,825 --> 00:31:28,742
Sometimes,

589
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,166
a white lie

590
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:31,416
might lead to

591
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:33,333
an unexpectedly good result.

592
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:35,916
At least

593
00:31:36,225 --> 00:31:38,166
we haven’t lost anything so far,
have we?

594
00:31:40,325 --> 00:31:40,950
Um.

595
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:52,541
What did you talk about with Alex

596
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,625
when I went to the restroom
during the dinner?

597
00:31:55,475 --> 00:31:56,416
Nothing.

598
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,083
Nothing?

599
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,500
But you were out of your mind

600
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:01,625
during the whole dinner.

601
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,458
I just feel

602
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:07,833
that Alex has been so good to us,

603
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:10,291
but we’ve been lying to him.

604
00:32:11,725 --> 00:32:13,375
I feel a little guilty.

605
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:17,041
Are there always lies and intrigues

606
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:19,125
when it’s about business?

607
00:32:19,475 --> 00:32:20,666
Whether you believe it or not,

608
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:22,625
although I use

609
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:24,500
some people’s weaknesses and preferences

610
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:26,208
for my own interest,

611
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,708
the result is always
mutually beneficial.

612
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,208
I’ve never used it

613
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,750
to hurt anyone.

614
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:34,333
But I still think

615
00:32:35,425 --> 00:32:36,666
whether it’s work,

616
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:38,125
life or love,

617
00:32:38,725 --> 00:32:40,916
it should be based on sincerity.

618
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,416
There should be no deception.

619
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:45,916
I promise you.

620
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:48,875
If it bothers you,

621
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:50,750
we will find the right time

622
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,708
to tell Alex everything.

623
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:54,416
Okay?

624
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,025
Um.

625
00:33:00,425 --> 00:33:01,967
I have another way.

626
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:04,250
It’s simple, quick and straightforward.

627
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,333
What is it?

628
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:08,875
I’ll sacrifice a little

629
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:11,500
and turn our relationship
into a real thing.

630
00:33:12,025 --> 00:33:13,625
There will be no deception then.

631
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:16,125
In your dream.

632
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,250
It’s humbug.

633
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:22,666
That’s because you can’t get one.

634
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:25,291

662
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:41,833
that the show you didn’t make it to

663
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,541
is extended for another day.

669

Hold on.

670
00:34:56,925 --> 00:34:58,291

671
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,583
Okay.

(Application)

673
00:35:07,325 --> 00:35:09,125
I wrote the time and the place.

674
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:10,208
But I don’t know

675
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,041
who I will meet,

676
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:13,000
so I left it empty.

677
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,125
I’ll fill it in when I get back.

678
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:14,750
Okay?

679
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:16,916
What happened yesterday
can’t happen again.

680
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,783
I swear

681
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:20,125
it will never

682
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:21,500
happen again.

683
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:23,166
I’ve memorized the surrounding terrain

684
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:25,041
all in my head.

685
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,000
I’m just going to look around.

686
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,375
I’ll be back when I’m done.

687
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,708
Just let me go, boss.

688
00:35:28,708 --> 00:35:29,375
Please.

689
00:35:29,583 --> 00:35:30,666
I’ll probably stop by the show

690
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:32,208
after the meeting.

691
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,041
I can go there with you.

692
00:35:34,775 --> 00:35:35,525
Really?

693
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,150
Um.

694
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,041
Okay.

695
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:38,500
It’s rare for you
to be in the mood.

696
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:39,416
It’s settled then.

697
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:40,041
I’m leaving.

698
00:35:40,275 --> 00:35:41,108
Be careful.

699
00:35:41,108 --> 00:35:41,650
Um.

700
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,833
How about the cost
of asking the organizer

701
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:50,666
to extend the show?

702
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:52,250
Take it from my private account.

703
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,500
It’s my personal business after all.

704
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:57,916
It’s not the first time
you’ve done something

705
00:35:57,916 --> 00:36:00,500
for Miss Gu with no return.

706
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:05,458
You are not having a crush on her,
are you?

707
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:07,750
No.

708
00:36:10,725 --> 00:36:12,025
I might have fallen in love with her.

709
00:36:12,275 --> 00:36:13,166
Love?

710
00:36:13,725 --> 00:36:14,708
When?

711
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,150
Maybe last night.

712
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,500
I think you’ve been acting weirdly
for a long time.

713
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,050
It’s definitely not last night.

714
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:27,833
Then when?

715
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:31,000
Could it be

716
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:33,708
when you talked to her

717
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:35,041
in the name of Girls’ Dream Lover?

718
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:38,125
According to what you said,

719
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:39,291
I fell in love with her first?

720
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:41,541
No.

721
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,392
She must fall in love with you first.

722
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:46,083
Do I need to

723
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:48,708
hold a grand confession ceremony
for you?

724
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:49,958
No, no.

725
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,708
It’s not the right time.

726
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,958
She told me

727
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:57,375
she wants her relationship

728
00:36:57,416 --> 00:36:59,166
to be built on truth and sincerity.

729
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:01,000
What we have now

730
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,750
is a contracted marriage

731
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:04,666
to deceive Alex.

732
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,875
So you want...

733
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,416
After I finish

734
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:10,041
the merger with Alex,

735
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:13,250
I’ll find a chance to terminate
the contract with Gu Xixi.

736
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:15,250
I want her to accept me

737
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,375
as a free person.

738
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,333
Come on, let’s go to see Alex.

739
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,458
I believe you have
personally experienced

740
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,541
the benefits and reputation brought by

741
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:44,000
the previous cooperation
between Why Mall and Marry Me.

742
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:45,208
I know you’ve been

743
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:47,000
looking for a partner for Enjoy.

744
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:48,833
I want to try it.

745
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:50,750
Don’t you think

746
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:53,000
it’s too much to ask?

747
00:37:57,416 --> 00:37:58,875
Since I’ve brought it up,

748
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,375
it means I’m confident.

749
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:03,541
It’s a win-win situation

750
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,708
to let Why Mall take over Enjoy.

751
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:11,833
Actually, that’s why

752
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,750
I asked you to come.

753
00:38:16,916 --> 00:38:18,000
But I have one condition.

754
00:38:18,775 --> 00:38:19,983
I want Mrs. Yin

755
00:38:20,075 --> 00:38:21,416
to take charge of Enjoy.

756
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:26,833
Why do you choose her to run Enjoy?

757
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:28,666
She has a keen sensibility

758
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:30,375
to art and aesthetics.

759
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:31,375
More importantly,

760
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:34,416
she has a firm passion for life.

761
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:36,041
Actually, it’s exactly

762
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:37,625
the same attitude I had

763
00:38:37,666 --> 00:38:38,666
when I founded Enjoy.

764
00:38:39,416 --> 00:38:40,416
If she runs it,

765
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:43,250
I believe this brand
will be full of passion

766
00:38:43,675 --> 00:38:45,508
and it will exude its unique charm.

767
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:47,416
As long as Mrs. Yin agrees,

768
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:50,083
we will be able to work together sooner.

769
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,083
I believe she will be really honored

770
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,416
when she hears it.

771
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,416
I’ll wait for your good news.

772
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:14,041
Why are you everywhere?

773
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,834
You are pervasive.

774
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:21,041
Actually,

775
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:22,708
he looks pretty handsome.

776
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:28,250
Gu Xixi, what are you thinking about?

777
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,050
He is ugly.
