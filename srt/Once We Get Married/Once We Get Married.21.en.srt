Where’s Gu Xixi?

24
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:56,958
She’s already on the plane.

25
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,166
Why are you looking at me?

26
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,208
She’s not here.

27
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:06,875
Gu Xixi.

28
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:09,666
Come out.

29
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:12,666
Gu Xixi.

30
00:02:15,832 --> 00:02:16,541
I give up.

31
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:18,791
I give up.

32
00:02:24,832 --> 00:02:26,416
She just went to study.

33
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:27,875
It’s not like she won’t come back.

34
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:34,875
She really left?

35
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,425
Yes.

36
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:44,666
Come on.

37
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,750
Yin Sichen came to look for you
early in the morning.

38
00:02:52,582 --> 00:02:53,750
Really?

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,250
I left him a message

40
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,250
saying I was leaving.

41
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,332
By the way, Xiaoya,

42
00:02:57,707 --> 00:02:59,825
I just registered.

43
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,875
Now I’m going to the homestay.

44
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:02,450
Xixi.

45
00:03:04,957 --> 00:03:06,000
Zixin?

46
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,125
I’ve got to go. I’m hanging up now.

47
00:03:09,832 --> 00:03:11,416
Zixin, why are you here?

48
00:03:12,457 --> 00:03:14,041
I came here for business two days ago.

49
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,875
Xiaoya told me you came today.

50
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:16,916
So I dropped by.

51
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,832
What a coincidence!

52
00:03:19,457 --> 00:03:21,041
You’re going to the hotel?
Let me drive you there.

53
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:21,975
No.

54
00:03:22,957 --> 00:03:24,041
Thank you, Zixin.

55
00:03:24,207 --> 00:03:24,707
You’re welcome.

56
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,332
Let’s go.

57
00:03:25,332 --> 00:03:25,791
OK.

58
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:30,166
Where is the hotel?

59
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,832
I didn’t book a hotel this time.

60
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:32,791
Drive me to

61
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,082
the Xinxing Homestay.

62
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:34,957
Thank you.

63
00:03:34,957 --> 00:03:36,750
Homestay? Not a hotel?

64
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:37,575
Yes.

65
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:38,750
But you’re

66
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,666
on a business trip for CICI.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,707
You should enjoy travel benefits.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,125
No, thanks.

69
00:03:45,457 --> 00:03:46,916
It’s a nice homestay.

70
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:47,750
I’ve already booked it.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,082
It’s close to our school and
the garment factory.

72
00:03:50,082 --> 00:03:51,916
So it will be convenient for me.

73
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,825
Generally speaking,

74
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,350
the homestays around schools are
not well-equipped.

75
00:03:57,957 --> 00:03:59,957
If Yin Sichen knows,

76
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,582
he won’t sit by and do nothing.

77
00:04:03,707 --> 00:04:04,500
It doesn’t matter.

78
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,332
Anyway, I come here to study.

79
00:04:06,582 --> 00:04:07,750
As long as I could learn something,

80
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,957
it doesn’t matter where I live.

81
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,832
The homestay can’t be that bad.

82
00:04:12,825 --> 00:04:13,375
OK.

83
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:15,125
Let’s go.

84
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:48,290
Go for it!

85
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,425
What?

86
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,025
Sorry,

87
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:53,708
I couldn’t help it.

88
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,540
You’ve been like this for a whole day.

89
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,875
Can you cheer up?

90
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:58,665
What time is it? Hurry up.

91
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,083
Two minutes to 2:00 PM.

92
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,150
Xixi has just gone for

93
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,833
eight hours and fifty-nine minutes.

94
00:05:08,415 --> 00:05:10,000
She’ll be back in two months,

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,583
29 days, 15 hours and one minute.

96
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,165
You miss Miss Gu so much.

97
00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:17,875
Just go and see her.

98
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:20,958
It hasn’t been long since she left.

99
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,665
Only eight hours.

100
00:05:23,175 --> 00:05:24,458
How can I go to look for her so soon?

101
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:25,540
If I go,

102
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,125
I’ll be totally out of character.

103
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:27,750
How will I take the initiative

104
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,875
at home later?

105
00:05:28,915 --> 00:05:29,583
So foolish.

106
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,125
56.

107
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,290
57.

108
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:34,708
58.

109
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,125
59.

110
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:38,665
2:00 PM.

111
00:05:40,325 --> 00:05:41,283
It’s already nine hours.

112
00:05:41,283 --> 00:05:41,833
Yes.

113
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,400
Book a flight ticket. Now!

114
00:05:45,925 --> 00:05:47,975
(Jiangnan)

115
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,425
The bedroom and living room

116
00:05:56,425 --> 00:05:57,500
have good orientation.

117
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,000
There is sunshine every morning.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,225
And the transportation is convenient.

119
00:06:00,415 --> 00:06:02,375
The subway and bus stop are nearby.

120
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:05,625
How about the security?

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,165
Is there a security patrol?

122
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:07,750
Sure, of course.

123
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,083
We have security staff on duty

124
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,208
round the clock.

125
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,083
One can’t get in or out of the community
without the password.

126
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,250
You can rest assured.

127
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,540
Thank you, auntie.

128
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,000
It’s a nice homestay.

129
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,750
Are you lovers?

130
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:19,675
I...

131
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:20,950
Miss, you’re so lucky.

132
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:21,915
It’s hard to find

133
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,375
such a considerate boyfriend

134
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:25,458
these days.

135
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,415
No, auntie.

136
00:06:26,415 --> 00:06:27,000
We are

137
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,958
not lovers.

138
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,958
You haven’t built a relationship?

139
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,375
Are you dating non-exclusively?

140
00:06:33,675 --> 00:06:34,500
- No.
- No.

141
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,083
You get us wrong.

142
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,208
We’re just friends.

143
00:06:36,325 --> 00:06:37,000
Yes.

144
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,250
I see.

145
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,625
Well, do you like the house?

146
00:06:40,665 --> 00:06:41,665
Yes, I do.

147
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,425
I like it very much. Thank you.

148
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,040
My pleasure.

149
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,208
Call me if you need any help.

150
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,075
I will help you as soon as possible.

151
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:48,600
- OK.
- Yes.

152
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,175
Bye-bye.

153
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:49,925
- Thank you, auntie.
- Thank you.

154
00:06:49,925 --> 00:06:50,540
Bye-bye.

155
00:06:57,415 --> 00:06:58,575
It’s a nice house.

156
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,583
Yes, much better than expected.

157
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,125
I’m familiar with the surrounding area.

158
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,025
Let me take you to buy some necessities.

159
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:14,025
OK.

160
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:15,050
Aren’t you going to take class tomorrow?

161
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:15,525
Yes.

162
00:07:15,525 --> 00:07:16,233
They should be useful.

163
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,125
Thank you.

164
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,300
I saw her.

165
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,000
Yes.

166
00:07:27,665 --> 00:07:29,040
She’s safe for now.

167
00:07:29,275 --> 00:07:30,415
But why is Mo Zixin here?

168
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:32,500
Now that you’ve seen Xixi,

169
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,875
it proves she went there to study.

170
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,583
Why are you so nervous?

171
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,375
How could she not discuss it with me?

172
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,125
Is she really willing to part with me?

173
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:40,825
Really?

174
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,250
She didn’t discuss it with you?

175
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,415
Yin Sichen, let me remind you.

176
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,000
You’d better not act rashly.

177
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,375
Since Xixi told you not to go there,

178
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,333
you’d better follow her words,

179
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,040
so as not to make her unhappy.

180
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,000
Or you’ll suffer the consequences, see?

181
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,458
What about Mo Zixin?

182
00:07:58,915 --> 00:07:59,790
He’s here now.

183
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,500
What if he swoops in?

184
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,450
So what?

185
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,415
You’re there for Xixi but not him.

186
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,775
As you said,

187
00:08:05,775 --> 00:08:06,875
she’s safe now.

188
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:08,708
OK. Forget it.

189
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:09,400
Check the contact number

190
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,040
of the college for me.

191
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,750
That’s it.

192
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,583
It isn’t fair.

193
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,708
He could only see his wife secretly.

194
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,375
I even feel unfair to him.

195
00:08:20,415 --> 00:08:21,665
He’s so aggrieved.

196
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,190
He’s aggrieved?

197
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,375
Yes, that’s right.

198
00:08:24,915 --> 00:08:26,915
Did Gu Xixi suffer less injustice
for Yin Sichen?

199
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:28,525
It’s just

200
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:30,000
giving him a taste of his own medicine.

201
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:30,833
Besides,

202
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,250
I trust Xixi.

203
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:33,750
Given her personality,

204
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,875
if she had a liking for Mo Zixin,

205
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,083
her husband

206
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,700
wouldn’t be Yin Sichen.

207
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,583
Seems you’re right.

208
00:08:41,725 --> 00:08:42,375
But

209
00:08:42,475 --> 00:08:45,000
why don’t you tell Yin directly

210
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,375
but make him so worried?

211
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,208
I want him to

212
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,916
taste the pain, too.

213
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,125
Then it’ll be fair.

214
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,300
It’s also the last test

215
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,458
from Xixi’s best friend.

216
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,291
Test?

217
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,500
You should know.

218
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,708
People can’t stand the test.

219
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,975
What if Yin Sichen and...?

220
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,791
You’re not him.

221
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,958
Why do you have so many opinions?

222
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,916
Is it because you can’t do it yourself

223
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,708
so you think Yin can’t do it?

224
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,500
No, how could I...?

225
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,291
No way. I tell you.

226
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,500
Well, I agree.

227
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,166
I agree with you.

228
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,041
I’m on your side.

229
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:19,875
I warn you that

230
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,333
if you secretly

231
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,250
inform Yin Sichen,

232
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:23,916
I’ll...

233
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:25,500
How could it be possible?

234
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,458
We two share the same mind.

235
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,000
Don’t we, my Ruona?

236
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,333
Good boy.

237
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,050
Look at that.

238
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,166
It’s quite special.

239
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,541
What’s so funny?

240
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,416
It looks really different

241
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,541
from those in our city.

242
00:09:40,725 --> 00:09:41,625
Yes, indeed.

243
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:42,458
So pretty.

244
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,175
Be quiet!

245
00:09:55,925 --> 00:09:56,875
Stop crying.

246
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,041
Zixin, let me treat you to dinner.

247
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,425
Is it a dividend?

248
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,000
No, it’s welfare.

249
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,375
Stop crying. Stop!

250
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:16,600
Zixin?

251
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:17,500
Yes.

252
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,333
After checking the courses,

253
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,625
I feel a lot of pressure.

254
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,083
Sir, may I help you?

255
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,125
No, I’ll do it myself.

256
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:25,850
You should take care of yourself.

257
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:26,517
Yes.

258
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,250
Don’t worry.

259
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,425
(Fresh Juice)
I will.

260
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,416
I’m afraid...

261
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,850
Sir, excuse me.

262
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,625
The menu is upside down.

263
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,875
I’ll stay in this city for a few days.

264
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,375
Take a note
of what you don’t understand.

265
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,050
Call me after class.

266
00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:38,875
Ah?

267
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:40,500
- A full meal.
- Er...

268
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,775
- OK, sir.
- Thanks for your help.

269
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,666
Leave the menu. I’ll check it again.

270
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,083
OK.

271
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,325
Come here.

272
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:49,916
There is a bookstore nearby.

273
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,000
Let’s go to select some books.

274
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:52,925
OK.

275
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,041
Will it take you too long?

276
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,833
Aren’t you coming for work?

277
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,916
I told you not to mind.

278
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,833
It doesn’t matter.

279
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,300
Hello, excuse me.

280
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,416
Thank you.

281
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:10,958
Excuse me?

282
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:12,775
I didn’t order the soup.

283
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:13,625
That’s right.

284
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,125
You’re the 100th man today.

285
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,375
This is for free.

286
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,225
Please enjoy!

287
00:11:18,225 --> 00:11:19,196
- Really?
- Yes.

288
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:19,950
Thank you.

289
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,500
I’ve never expected such a benefit.

290
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:22,958
I’ve never expected such a benefit.

291
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:23,625
Taste it.

292
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,750
Enjoy the surprise I prepared for you.

293
00:11:35,325 --> 00:11:35,916
Zixin?

294
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:39,416
What’s up?

295
00:11:39,975 --> 00:11:40,583
So spicy!

296
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:41,208
Spicy.

297
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:43,750
Well,

298
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:44,916
the borsch is not spicy.

299
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:45,500
Let’s exchange.

300
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,208
OK.

301
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,875
I like spicy food very much.

302
00:11:52,925 --> 00:11:53,875
Gu Xixi.

303
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,333
How could you eat his soup?

304
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,083
It tastes good.

305
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,325
You’re not scared of spicy food?

306
00:11:58,325 --> 00:12:00,225
No, I am not. The soup is good.

307
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,600
You can have the borsch.

308
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,083
It’s not spicy.

309
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:03,725
OK.

310
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,576
(President)

311
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:10,916
I came here

312
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,166
to talk with you

313
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,708
about donations.

314
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,166
I have noticed

315
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:18,833
your achievements in talent cultivation.

316
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:19,875
So I intend to

317
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,875
set up a special fund to

318
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,458
support the development of your college.

319
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:26,583
Thank you very much.

320
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,083
It’s our honor

321
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,500
to have your trust.

322
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,875
I believe it’s a successful cooperation.

323
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,875
But I don’t know much

324
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:38,916
about your college.

325
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,666
It’s said the college
recently opened a refresher course.

326
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,500
What’s the students’ level like?

327
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,000
Previously,

328
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,083
the course was only open
to our graduates.

329
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,750
It is open to the public
for the first time this year.

330
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,875
If Mr. Yin is available,

331
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,625
we’re honored to invite you

332
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,875
to be our guest lecturer

333
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,500
to share some of your experiences.

334
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:08,708
It’s a good idea.

335
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,125
Then I accept your invitation.

336
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:11,833
But I have a condition.

337
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,416
Do not reveal my personal information.

338
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,708
I want to keep a low profile.

339
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,916
Well,

340
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,041
logically,

341
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,625
there is no problem.

342
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,000
But

343
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,375
I think most people

344
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,875
have heard of you.

345
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,458
Your name will inevitably

346
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,833
be on the schedule.

347
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:35,625
That’s not a problem.

348
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:36,875
Change the name.

349
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,750
Well,

350
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:42,666
use Mr. Zorro.

351
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:44,025
(QQ mailbox)

352
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,833
Mr. Zorro.

353
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:48,458
Hello.

354
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,083
I’m Mr. Zorro, your tutor.

355
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,291
Welcome to join us.

356
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,875
During your study,

357
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,250
I’ll be responsible for

358
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,875
your courses and all matters in life.

359
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,375
Here is my contact information.

360
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,000
It’s worthy of being a famous school.

361
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,500
It hasn’t started yet.

362
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,041
But the tutor has communicated with me.

363
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,291
Thank you, Mr. Zorro.

364
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:06,875
Compared with others,

365
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,500
I have a poor foundation.

366
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,250
But I’ll try to keep up
with the schedule.

367
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,333
I’m glad to meet you.

368
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,250
Gu Xixi.

369
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,250
Why aren’t you so polite

370
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,791
when you talk to me?

371
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,083
Hello?

372
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,000
Sichen.

373
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,333
What’re you doing?

374
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,625
Reading files.

375
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,708
But it’s so late.

376
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,050
I’m busy today.

377
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:42,750
I left without telling you today.

378
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:43,958
Are you angry?

379
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:44,708
No.

380
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,875
I promised to support you.

381
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:48,125
How could I be angry?

382
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:48,650
I’m not angry.

383
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:49,833
So nice of you.

384
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,375
Do you feel depressed?

385
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:53,291
No.

386
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,666
Do you miss me?

387
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:56,425
No.

388
00:14:56,425 --> 00:14:56,958
Darn it.

389
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,500
A little.

390
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,208
What do you mean?

391
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,333
A little more than

392
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,625
your feelings for me.

393
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,083
Glib-tongued.

394
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:12,833
Well, go ahead.

395
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,041
I won’t disturb you. Go to bed early.

396
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,041
Take good care of yourself, get it?

397
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,041
Eat on time.

398
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:17,666
OK.

399
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,083
Go to bed early.

400
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:20,833
I’ll have a meeting later.

401
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,291
Aren’t you reading files?

402
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,666
I’ll have a meeting after that.

403
00:15:30,925 --> 00:15:31,625
OK.

404
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,833
Good night. I’ll hang up.

405
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,875
OK. Bye-bye.

406
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:47,850
Well.

407
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,666
That’ll be all.

408
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,000
During this semester,

409
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,541
except for the final paper,

410
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:54,833
all courses

411
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,666
adopt the form of teams.

412
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,625
Get it? Dismissed.

413
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:03,458
Excuse me?

414
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:03,925
Yes.

415
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,166
Why didn’t Mr. Zorro

416
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,375
show up?

417
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:08,958
I heard Mr. Zorro

418
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,125
is a big shot in the business.

419
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,375
He’s a guest teacher

420
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,666
and will only show up on the last day.

421
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:14,625
Before then,

422
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,250
we only need to hand in our assignments.

423
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,375
No one will see him.

424
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:18,875
Thank you.

425
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:19,375
It’s okay.

426
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,125
So mysterious.

427
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,041
Why is he just my tutor?

428
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:34,825
Hello? Xixi.

429
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,583
It’s late. You still haven’t slept?

430
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,750
Zixin?

431
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,400
I haven’t finished my assignment.

432
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:40,958
I see.

433
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,250
I’m relieved to hear it.

434
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:43,708
I had thought

435
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,625
you didn’t adapt to the study life.

436
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,458
Seems I needn’t worry about that.

437
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:50,333
I’m fine, Zixin.

438
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,041
I feel a little

439
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:52,916
uncomfortable.

440
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,458
I might need some sleep.

441
00:16:55,275 --> 00:16:57,083
Hello? Xixi.

442
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,666
Hello?

443
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,125
Doctor, how is she doing?

444
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:09,125
Don’t worry.

445
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,750
The patient fell into a coma

446
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,208
for she’s stressed out
and not acclimatized.

447
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,125
Fortunately, it’s not serious.

448
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:16,775
Just pay attention to her diet

449
00:17:17,075 --> 00:17:18,125
and make sure she gets enough sleep.

450
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,208
OK, I see.

451
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,000
Thank you, doctor.

452
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:21,900
You’re welcome.

453
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:39,325
I’m sorry.

454
00:17:42,925 --> 00:17:46,325
Mr. Mo, the Law Department called.

455
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,000
Something is wrong with the contract.

456
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,583
You need to go back to handle it
as soon as possible.

457
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,458
Don’t you see I can’t leave?

458
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,166
Can’t they solve it?

459
00:17:53,425 --> 00:17:54,083
I think

460
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,458
you’d better go back.

461
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,291
The doctor said

462
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,083
it’s not serious.

463
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,125
She can be taken care of by nurses.

464
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:05,333
It is urgent about the contract.

465
00:18:08,975 --> 00:18:09,650
OK.

466
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,300
I see.

467
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,425
Miss?

468
00:18:14,475 --> 00:18:15,075
Yes.

469
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,916
Please take care of Xixi.

470
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:19,708
If there’s any problem,

471
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,500
let me know immediately.

472
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,083
OK. Don’t worry.

473
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:23,708
Thank you.

474
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,450
If I had known that

475
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,875
being a teacher would make me so tired,

476
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,750
I would have brought Fei’ang with me.

477
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,000
Gu Xixi, you’re killing me.

478
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:01,775
(Mr. Zorro:)

479
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:03,500
(Hello, Gu Xixi took a sick leave.
She couldn’t finish the teamwork.)

480
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,700
(She’ll submit
an assignment alone later.)

481
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,291
Why are your hands so cold?

482
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:41,750
Sichen.

483
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,300
I’m here.

484
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,000
Why am I in the hospital?

485
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,666
Xixi, you’re awake.

486
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,000
Zixin?

487
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,291
How do you feel? Better?

488
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,225
You took me to the hospital.

489
00:20:58,916 --> 00:20:59,750
Thank you.

490
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,250
You’re welcome.

491
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,166
After all, it’s my suggestion
to study here.

492
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,541
I have to be responsible.

493
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:08,791
Luckily, nothing serious happened.

494
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:09,925
Or

495
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,833
I don’t know how to face you

496
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,791
and auntie in the future.

497
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,050
I don’t know what’s wrong with me.

498
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,750
When I was busy in the store,

499
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,166
nothing happened and
I didn’t feel uncomfortable

500
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:20,875
even if I ate nothing.

501
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,125
Why do I feel so uncomfortable
after coming here?

502
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,875
I’m probably not accustomed
to the climate here.

503
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,500
I’ll pay more attention.

504
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,875
It won’t happen again.

505
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:31,791
Are you hungry?

506
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:32,625
Do you want something to eat?

507
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,333
I’ll buy it for you.

508
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,458
Isn’t the breakfast...?

509
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,583
It’s not bought by you.

510
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,375
The hospital is really considerate.

511
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,583
How did they know I like
fried dough sticks and soybean milk?

512
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:58,833
Mr. Mo.

513
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,375
Won’t you invite Miss Gu

514
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:01,541
to dinner?

515
00:22:03,925 --> 00:22:04,625
No need.

516
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,025
Didn’t you

517
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:08,050
pick the chefs up

518
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:09,916
from Jiangbei

519
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,250
for Miss Gu?

520
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,250
They’re ready at the hotel.

521
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,625
If you cancel it now,

522
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:17,500
won’t it be a pity?

523
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,333
Now that he has come,

524
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,750
let him do it.

525
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,625
Him?

526
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,250
But I can also lend them a hand.

527
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,583
Yunong.

528
00:22:33,825 --> 00:22:34,375
Yes?

529
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,041
Prepare the dinner.

530
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,041
Yes, Mr. Mo.

531
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,225
Xixi?

532
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:06,950
Zixin?

533
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:08,791
Why are you here?

534
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,333
I remember you went to the factory
this morning.

535
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:11,975
Does everything go well?

536
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,333
It really opened my eyes.

537
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:16,583
Glad you can benefit from it.

538
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,750
How about dinner together?

539
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,550
OK.

540
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:20,541
Let’s go.

541
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:22,833
Thank you.

542
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:23,458
Come on.

543
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,200
Zixin, which restaurant will we go to?

544
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,166
The Bay Restaurant.

545
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:33,791
OK.

546
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,789
I heard your case

547
00:23:42,975 --> 00:23:43,925
had been submitted.

548
00:23:43,925 --> 00:23:44,500
Right.

549
00:23:44,775 --> 00:23:46,458
The hometown dishes are so delicious.

550
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,916
I feel much more comfortable now.

551
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,850
Not only you,

552
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,458
but I can’t stand it, either.

553
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,475
(Mr. Zorro)
How about an extra dish?

554
00:24:00,475 --> 00:24:01,025
(Mr. Zorro)
OK.

555
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:01,650
(Mr. Zorro)
OK.

556
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,550
(Gu Xixi, I have to see you now!)
Waitress!

557
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,925
(Come to the office now! It’s urgent!)

558
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,250
Show me the menu!

559
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,525
What’s up?

560
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:14,958
Mr. Zorro asked me to go to his office

561
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:16,583
for something urgent.

562
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:17,775
Mr. Zorro.

563
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,625
He’s my tutor.

564
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,825
It’s said he is a big shot
in the business.

565
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:26,166
But no one knows him.

566
00:24:26,225 --> 00:24:27,600
I feel it’s weird.

567
00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:29,791
He’s good.

568
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,300
What?

569
00:24:32,025 --> 00:24:32,791
Nothing.

570
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:35,333
I mean,
since your tutor asked you to go,

571
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:36,583
then go quickly.

572
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,166
It’s more important.

573
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,500
Well, I’m off.

574
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,025
OK.

575
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:42,750
Take another bite.

576
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,833
Thank you.

577
00:24:45,841 --> 00:24:46,541
It’s delicious.

578
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:47,025
I’m off.

579
00:24:47,025 --> 00:24:47,525
OK.

580
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:48,125
This one is good.

581
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:48,650
OK.

582
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:57,975
(Jiang A·E6675)

583
00:24:57,975 --> 00:24:59,300
That’s all I can help you with.

584
00:25:08,325 --> 00:25:09,175
Who are you?

585
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,025
Wait.

586
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,425
Hey. Hey!

587
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:18,875
Hello.

588
00:25:20,025 --> 00:25:21,916
Are you Mr. Zorro?

589
00:25:22,075 --> 00:25:22,659
Tell her.

590
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:23,458
I am.

591
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:24,750
It’s him.

592
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:27,416
What?

593
00:25:27,475 --> 00:25:28,050
Ah?

594
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,333
No.

595
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:33,166
I mean, it’s me.

596
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,800
Nice to meet you.

597
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I’m Gu Xixi.

598
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:38,708
What can I do for you?

599
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:41,750
You were ill.

600
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,125
Do you feel better now?

601
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,333
Thank you.

602
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:46,500
I felt uncomfortable days ago.

603
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,325
But I’m fine now.

604
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,708
Because of my sick leave,
I handed in my assignment late.

605
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,083
I’m sorry.

606
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:54,000
It doesn’t matter. Take good care.

607
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:55,900
Yes.

608
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:59,000
By the way, since you’re available,

609
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:00,291
could you explain

610
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:01,833
the competition and cooperation

611
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:04,000
relationship in the case

612
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:06,666
we discussed before?

613
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:07,825
I’m still a little confused.

614
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:12,833
Well, in short,

615
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:16,125
both parties could continue to maintain…

616
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:20,791
…the competition during the cooperation,

617
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,675
to greatly stimulate

618
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,875
their vitality.

619
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:27,708
On the other hand,

620
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,475
selecting the right partner
is very important.

621
00:26:31,475 --> 00:26:32,000
Oh.

622
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,416
Take your spouse for example.

623
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:36,208
To find a husband,

624
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,525
you have to...

625
00:26:37,525 --> 00:26:38,025
Ah?

626
00:26:38,025 --> 00:26:39,225
…open your eyes.

627
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:44,083
Don’t be fooled by the sugarcoat.

628
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,250
Excuse me?

629
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,458
Aren’t we talking about cooperation?

630
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:53,666
Marriage is also a kind of cooperation.

631
00:26:54,475 --> 00:26:55,416
Right?

632
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:57,625
Take your husband for example.

633
00:26:57,833 --> 00:27:00,541
He’s handsome, successful,

634
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:04,125
mature and steady.

635
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:05,450
He’s a young talent.

636
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,083
You must keep him around you

637
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:11,250
and stay away from those
who have ulterior motives.

638
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:17,291
Don’t go out for hamburgers
when you have steak at home.

639
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,833
What hamburgers and steak?

640
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:21,791
Do repeat my words.

641
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:26,041
The earphone and suit

642
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:28,666
are Yin Sichen’s.

643
00:27:31,541 --> 00:27:33,000
Do you know Yin Sichen?

644
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:36,833
I met him once.

645
00:27:37,075 --> 00:27:37,650
Oh.

646
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:38,875
You must’ve learned that

647
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:40,575
something happened to Why Mall days ago.

648
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:43,833
Thanks to

649
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:45,125
your strong relationship

650
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:48,750
and your visit to Alex in Milan,

651
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,083
Why Mall’s situation was saved.

652
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:53,833
This also proves what I said before.

653
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,750
I remember what you said today.

654
00:27:58,791 --> 00:27:59,416
Thank you.

655
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:00,708
I’m leaving.

656
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:02,250
Leave?

657
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,333
Thank you.

658
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,675
Well,

659
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:14,333
you two quarreled?

660
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,134
Yes.

661
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:22,916
In fact, women are very simple.

662
00:28:22,916 --> 00:28:25,666
It’s men who sometimes
complicate things.

663
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:26,708
Admit your mistake to her

664
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:29,000
and humor her. It’ll be over.

665
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:32,875
But I didn’t do anything wrong.

666
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:34,125
How can I admit my mistake?

667
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:34,958
Well,

668
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:37,666
didn’t you lie to her just now?

669
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:38,700
That’s because...

670
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:40,583
I don’t know what to say.

671
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:42,458
Forget it. It’s complicated.

672
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:44,375
I’ve been there.

673
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:45,583
You don’t know.

674
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:48,125
Women are very smart.

675
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:50,625
She knows every lie

676
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:52,375
you told.

677
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,666
In fact, she’s giving you a chance

678
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:56,650
so you can admit your fault.

679
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:58,500
If you fail to do so,

680
00:28:58,958 --> 00:29:00,375
it’ll get worse.

681
00:29:00,666 --> 00:29:01,666
Something serious will happen.

682
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:02,416
Got it?

683
00:29:05,575 --> 00:29:06,208
By the way,

684
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:08,750
here you are.

685
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,666
If you need any help, come to me.

686
00:29:13,175 --> 00:29:13,875
- OK.
- Bye-bye.

687
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,791
I have kept it from her for so long,

688
00:29:31,725 --> 00:29:33,117
will she be angry?

689
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:41,916
I’d better tell her on the last day.

690
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,741
What if that man is right?

691
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,333
(Gu Xixi)
Hello, Mr. Zorro.

692
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,333
This is Gu Xixi.

693
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:57,708
Thank you for your help.

694
00:29:58,041 --> 00:29:58,916
Are you available tomorrow?

695
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,250
I’d like to treat you to a meal.

696
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,208
Appreciation dinner.

697
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:05,000
It’s a good idea.

698
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,666
It’s just at the right time.

699
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:12,000
OK.

700
00:30:35,025 --> 00:30:36,000
Hello?

701
00:30:36,575 --> 00:30:37,208
Hello?

702
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:39,541
I’m in the building.
Come here. Be quick!

703
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:40,208
- I...
- Hello?

704
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:42,625
Xixi?

705
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:45,050
Xixi?

706
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:49,333
Sir.

707
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:50,041
I’m in a hurry.

708
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,600
Hey! Hey!

709
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:54,500
Someone ran up without registration.

710
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:57,250
Gu Xixi.

711
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:04,041
Hello, Mr. Zorro.

712
00:31:05,025 --> 00:31:06,025
You deceived me.

713
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:09,708
We’re even now.

714
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,375
Well,

715
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:15,750
how do you know?

716
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,125
Our meeting with Alex

717
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:19,416
is not disclosed.

718
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,458
How could you tell it

719
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:22,125
to someone that you only met once?

720
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,458
Isn’t it embarrassing, Yin Sichen?

721
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,141
I’m not going
to hide my identity anyway.

722
00:31:32,275 --> 00:31:33,041
Didn’t we make a deal

723
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:34,291
when I left?

724
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:35,500
I studied hard at school

725
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:36,916
while you worked hard at home

726
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:38,291
and wouldn’t disturb me.

727
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:39,541
But I’m your husband.

728
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:41,125
So you can trail after me

729
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:42,000
and cheat me?

730
00:31:42,225 --> 00:31:42,800
No.

731
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,750
I didn’t trail after you.

732
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:46,875
I was protecting you
in case you were in danger.

733
00:31:46,916 --> 00:31:48,041
Do you know

734
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:49,000
what you did keeps me from

735
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,791
knowing my true level?

736
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,400
No.

737
00:31:54,025 --> 00:31:55,950
You know yourself.

738
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,125
You’re awesome.

739
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:00,625
Sichen.

740
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:03,166
I don’t want to be always
protected by you.

741
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:04,500
I want to grow up.

742
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:05,583
I also want to protect you

743
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,125
and stand side by side with you.

744
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:10,375
No matter you’re Mr. Zorro

745
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:11,625
or my husband,

746
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:13,875
I have to finish this semester.

747
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,125
You should go back.

748
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,083
No.

749
00:32:18,225 --> 00:32:19,916
How could you bear to not see me?

750
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:21,791
Three months. Ninety days.

751
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:23,708
How could I get through these days?

752
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:27,250
Gu Xixi, you said so
just because I love you.

753
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,041
Didn’t we make a deal?

754
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,416
Hello, miss.

755
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:36,050
There’s…

756
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,541
What’s your relationship?

757
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,500
- He’s my teacher.
- She’s my wife.

758
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,916
Gu Xixi, what are you doing?

759
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:45,416
Forget it.

760
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:46,916
Explain to the police.

761
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:47,875
No. No. Wait!

762
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,000
He’s right.

763
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,333
We’re a couple.

764
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:53,833
I’ll show you the evidence.

765
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,750
I know her favorite breakfast

766
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:01,500
is soybean milk and fried dough sticks.

767
00:33:02,775 --> 00:33:04,425
Her favorite thing is

768
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,425
drawing rough sketches.

769
00:33:10,025 --> 00:33:11,400
The person she worries about most

770
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,241
is her mom.

771
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:18,825
She’s independent

772
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,441
and doesn’t like being taken care of.

773
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,583
She always tries to take care of others.

774
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:30,791
She always makes me angry.

775
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,916
But if I can’t see her,

776
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,041
I’ll miss her very much.

777
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,433
I remember her smile

778
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:48,541
and every moment we spent together.

779
00:33:50,958 --> 00:33:52,750
I remember every word she said.

780
00:34:01,225 --> 00:34:02,475
Is this proof?

781
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:04,825
Oh.

782
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:06,375
I trust you.

783
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,666
I do. I trust you.

784
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:18,450
What’s wrong?

785
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,000
Feel shy?

786
00:34:36,225 --> 00:34:37,725
What? Open the door.

787
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,308
I’m married.

788
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:42,708
It’s not convenient for me to
drive a girl.

789
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,067
So stingy.

790
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,500
Didn’t I apologize to you?

791
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:48,875
You think it’s over?

792
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,250
Are you picking at me right now?

793
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:55,791
You can think so.

794
00:34:56,958 --> 00:34:57,500
OK.

795
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,250
I’m leaving.

796
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:07,250
I’m wrong, Xixi.

797
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:09,416
I can’t leave you.

798
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,775
Sichen.

799
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:17,333
I’m serious about

800
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:18,541
my decision.

801
00:35:19,725 --> 00:35:21,625
If we encounter greater difficulties,

802
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:23,125
should all the pressure be borne by you?

803
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:24,750
I also want to try hard

804
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:25,708
to be as strong as you are

805
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:27,125
and stand with you.

806
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,708
I want to protect you.

807
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,958
You need not protect me anymore.

808
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,958
Without you, I wouldn’t be where I am.

809
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:37,541
I know all your pressure and grievance.

810
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,583
But we have been through a lot.

811
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:41,875
You should believe me

812
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:44,083
and our love

813
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:45,879
just like that I believe

814
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:47,666
you’ll always be with me.

815
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:51,458
