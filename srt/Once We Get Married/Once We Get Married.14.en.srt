Mr. Yin told me in advance

24
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:44,166
that you’ve had a long day

25
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:47,833
and a cup of hot milk
can help you sleep.

26
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:49,666
Thanks, Madam Song,

27
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:52,666
Well,

28
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,125
since you brought me milk,

29
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,333
I’ll give you one more point.

30
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,458
You are the real number one now.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,875
Gu Xixi.

32
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,458
You are my wife.

33
00:02:03,425 --> 00:02:04,875
Do you need me to teach you

34
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,500
how to be a good Mrs. Yin?

35
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:13,957
No need!

36
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,975
Thank you, boss!

37
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,582
Grandma,

38
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,332
what is Sichen’s favorite dish?

39
00:02:21,332 --> 00:02:22,332
Let me find it for you online.

40
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,416
It’s stir-fried tomato with egg.

41
00:02:24,675 --> 00:02:25,707
I tell you what,

42
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,707
Sichen

43
00:02:26,707 --> 00:02:28,916
loves stir-fried tomato with egg.

44
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,541
When he was little,
he was home alone one time,

45
00:02:31,832 --> 00:02:33,457
and he went to the kitchen to cook

46
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,500
stir-fried tomato with egg by himself.

47
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:38,791
As a result, he almost put

48
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,375
the whole kitchen on fire.

49
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,957
Grandma.

50
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:43,675
Yeah.

51
00:02:43,675 --> 00:02:46,791
What does he dislike then?

52
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,500
Yam.

53
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,750
That’s right. Yam.

54
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,166
- Remember.
- Yam.

55
00:02:51,207 --> 00:02:52,125
No matter what you cook,

56
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,457
don’t put yam,

57
00:02:53,457 --> 00:02:54,791
bitter gourd or cilantro in it.

58
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,916
Not even for decoration.

59
00:02:58,575 --> 00:03:01,207
Oh, yam, bitter gourd and cilantro.

60
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,916
Mr. Yin, do we need to discuss

61
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,041
this matter further with them?

62
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,500
Tell them this thing
is not up for discussion.

63
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:10,707
We’ll go by the market price.

64
00:03:10,707 --> 00:03:11,332
Darling.

65
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:15,957
What are you doing here?

66
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,707
As your wife,

67
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,875
I feel sorry that I haven’t come
to your company much

68
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,957
since we got married.

69
00:03:24,582 --> 00:03:25,582
What do you want?

70
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:28,291
Yin Sichen, you asked for it yourself.

71
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,916
I called the front desk

72
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,750
and I was told that you were
very busy today,

73
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:33,791
and that you’ve been in a meeting

74
00:03:34,207 --> 00:03:35,582
and had no time for eating.

75
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:36,425
So,

76
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,957
I made dinner for you.

77
00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:40,425
Don’t you think I’m a good wife?

78
00:03:41,082 --> 00:03:42,625
Mrs. Yin is so thoughtful.

79
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,957
Then we’ll leave

80
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,957
and give you two some privacy.

81
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,332
It’s okay.

82
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,250
I won’t stay for long

83
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,207
and disturb your work.

84
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:53,500
Sichen, you’ve been busy lately,

85
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,082
so I cooked yam stewed
with bitter gourd and cilantro

86
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,375
to help you reduce the internal heat.

87
00:03:59,832 --> 00:04:01,166
Mrs. Yin is so considerate.

88
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,259
It’s my job as his wife.

89
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,082
Here, Sichen,

90
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:09,582
let me feed you. Ah...

91
00:04:15,225 --> 00:04:17,415
Maybe he doesn’t like my cooking.

92
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,750
Never mind.

93
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,957
I’ll just throw it away.

94
00:04:21,165 --> 00:04:21,790
No way.

95
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,540
I like whatever

96
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:26,675
you cook for me.

97
00:04:28,665 --> 00:04:29,625
Really?

98
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,250
Hmm.

99
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:50,300
Mr. Yin and his wife are so in love.

100
00:04:56,425 --> 00:04:57,290
Sichen,

101
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,833
is this what a good wife is supposed

102
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,665
to be like in your mind?

103
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,500
Now that I’ve brought him dinner,

104
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,790
I’ll leave and let you guys
get back to work.

105
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:10,415
Bye-bye.

106
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,540
Please leave us.

107
00:05:19,175 --> 00:05:20,375
Would you like to rinse your mouth?

108
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,375
You are not throwing it away?

109
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,875
“I changed the recipe the second time.

110
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,708
It’s not a prank.

111
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:34,915
Seriously,

112
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,165
yam is very, very tasty.

113
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,375
It’s soft, tenderly chewy
and a little sweet.

114
00:05:40,825 --> 00:05:42,000
No other vegetables are better

115
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,025
than yam except for sweet potato.

116
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:45,583
Just give it a try.

117
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,458
I assure you it’s going to be
an eye-opening experience.”

118
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:54,250
I thought you hated yam

119
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,625
for its gooey taste.

120
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,250
But the new recipe

121
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,293
makes it taste only tenderly chewy.

122
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,458
It’s not bad.

123
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,125
You may wanna give it a try.

124
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,225
I mean try the recipe.

125
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,225
It’s not cooked for you, okay?

126
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,650
Don’t touch it.

127
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,392
You asked me to play a good wife.

128
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,683
And I tried my best to make
yam taste good.

129
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,100
Did you try it?

130
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,275
I did.

131
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:41,290
It’s not bad.

132
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:42,785
Good to hear that.

133
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,960
So why are you here?

134
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:47,840
I think you made a good point today.

135
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,915
To let the employees believe

136
00:06:49,915 --> 00:06:51,550
that we have a happy marriage,

137
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,625
I want you to bring me meal

138
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,542
every day from tomorrow.

139
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,833
Every day?

140
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,375
I’ll wait for you
in my office tomorrow.

141
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,008
Yin Sichen,

142
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,485
you left me no choice now.

143
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:16,540
Boss.

144
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,625
I brought your meal.

145
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,250
You can just leave it here.

146
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,500
I certainly cannot do that.

147
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,708
You said that you wanted
the employees

148
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,000
to witness our happy marriage.

149
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,375
Alright.

150
00:07:34,675 --> 00:07:35,415
Let’s go.

151
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,790
Mrs. Yin.

152
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,392
Is she Mr. Yin’s wife?

153
00:07:44,392 --> 00:07:45,290
I think so.

154
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:47,375
- Mr. Yin, Mrs. Yin.
- Mrs. Yin.

155
00:07:48,825 --> 00:07:49,583
What’s wrong?

156
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:55,915
- Mr. Yin.
- Mr. Yin.

157
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:58,900
Is that Mr. Yin’s wife?

158
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,725
She is.

159
00:08:00,725 --> 00:08:01,540
Could you let go of my arm

160
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,750
in front of these many people?

161
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,625
Don’t chicken out, darling.

162
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,450
You…

163
00:08:15,915 --> 00:08:16,625
What?

164
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,540
If it makes you uncomfortable,

165
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,325
you can go home now.

166
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,750
Why would I be, darling?

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,125
Gu Xixi!

168
00:08:31,775 --> 00:08:32,675
Let’s eat.

169
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,458
Let me.

170
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:38,150
So envy them.

171
00:08:48,475 --> 00:08:50,625
Darling, my hands are sore.

172
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,000
I want you to feed me.

173
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:03,958
Gu Xixi.

174
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:04,583
Be nice to me.

175
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:05,583
You don’t have to show
your wifely rights anymore.

176
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,041
I’m already yours.

177
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,300
Eat it.

178
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,791
Is that really the bossy and solemn

179
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,041
Mr. Yin we know?

180
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:22,083
I also want to feed you, darling.

181
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:28,000
In front of these people,

182
00:09:28,975 --> 00:09:30,208
will you eat it or not?

183
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,950
Yin Sichen, you can’t
get rid of me now.

184
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:37,708
Oh, yeah?

185
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:39,708
Here.

186
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,833
Come on.

187
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,958
Slow down. Don’t choke on it.

188
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,041
Does it taste good?

189
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,250
Darling, I’m full.

190
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,416
Full?

191
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,200
Hmm.

192
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,458
Yin Sichen!

193
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,458
I thought you wanted

194
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,500
to enjoy this wife role to the fullest.

195
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:20,583
You…

196
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,575
Do you need more help?

197
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,525
Yin Sichen!

198
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,500
Are you drawing me in secret again?

199
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,458
I’m checking the account.

200
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,125
Your store’s turnover yesterday
was 23,000 yuan.

201
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,242
After deducting the cost,
the profit was 1,400 yuan.

202
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,416
You are so fast.

203
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,000
I’ve got used to it.

204
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,833
The turnover is good,

205
00:11:01,275 --> 00:11:02,333
but the profit

206
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,350
is too low.

207
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,291
New stores are all like this.

208
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,666
I didn’t have this problem

209
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:11,833
when I opened Why Mall.

210
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,500
You have your family to back you up.

211
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,375
What do I have?

212
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,033
You have me.

213
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,292
Boss, I’d like to hear your advice.

214
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,000
You are right.

215
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,083
Many brands fail to make money
in their early days

216
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,500
because they tend to sacrifice

217
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,875
the huge profit margin

218
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,458
for a larger market share.

219
00:11:32,975 --> 00:11:34,725
Many people think
that the customer is king,

220
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:36,591
which is not entirely true.

221
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,791
Sometimes it’s the other way around.

222
00:11:40,225 --> 00:11:42,725
Because the seller can guide
the customer’s judgment.

223
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,750
Guide the customer’s judgment?

224
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:49,500
And affect them with your brand belief.

225
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:54,800
Where are you going?

226
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,791
To find Xiaoya!

227
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,117
What brings you here?

228
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:00,458
Me?

229
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,325
I’m here to collect more points.

230
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,458
Don’t… Don’t you remember?

231
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:10,125
I was being a little bit
too frank last time,

232
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,166
and you took 20 points away from me.

233
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,208
20 points!

234
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,150
Even though you forgave me later,

235
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,025
I still lost many points.

236
00:12:19,775 --> 00:12:20,625
So?

237
00:12:21,025 --> 00:12:21,750
So, I…

238
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,000
I’m here to make it up to you.

239
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:23,958
How?

240
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,416
Your personal chef here

241
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,416
will cook you something nice.

242
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,500
Leave it to me.

243
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,416
I’m on it.

244
00:12:37,475 --> 00:12:38,541
Are you done?

245
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:39,791
Almost. Almost.

246
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,225
Taste it.

247
00:12:56,925 --> 00:12:57,958
Here.

248
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:02,750
How… How do you like it?

249
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,375
10 points, at least.

250
00:13:10,775 --> 00:13:12,359
You mean it’s good?

251
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,417
Are you sure it’ll work?

252
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,250
I’m not sure.

253
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,208
We’ve given everything we have

254
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,425
this time for a turnaround.

255
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,675
Are you sure you’ve
spread out the news?

256
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,975
I have.

257
00:14:03,975 --> 00:14:05,375
Is this CICI?

258
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,525
Yes!

259
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:08,750
This is the store.

260
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,575
This is the place?

261
00:14:10,575 --> 00:14:11,275
Yeah.

262
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,208
Please come in. Please.

263
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,000
Let’s go.

264
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,416
Welcome. Pick whatever you like.

265
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,400
Go ahead, please.

266
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:17,250
Take a look at this.

267
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:20,750
CICI is having a lottery activity.

268
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,416
Those who buy their clothes

269
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,416
are all qualified to participate.

270
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,166
The prizes are bags, accessories,

271
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,208
or cosmetics.

272
00:14:27,775 --> 00:14:29,425
She’s quite smart.

273
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:30,958
But I think it’s just a makeshift

274
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,541
type of method.

275
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,666
Offering a gift with a purchase

276
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,625
may increase short term sales,

277
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,375
but it’s not a permanent solution.

278
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,750
You are only looking at it
from the customers’ point of view,

279
00:14:41,575 --> 00:14:43,791
not from Gu Xixi’s point of view.

280
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,425
Xiaoya, our turnover…

281
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:46,791
Hold on, Xixi.

282
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:47,416
Here’s what I think.

283
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,041
Even though they all came today,

284
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,541
they were only here for the prizes.

285
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,666
Yes, our turnover increased,

286
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,083
but it’s not a permanent solution.

287
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,500
Don’t you remember the thing

288
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,125
that took me so much time
to do last night?

289
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,375
The rules for the lottery?

290
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,416
That’s right.

291
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,041
According to the rules I made,

292
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,957
you can’t get the certain gift

293
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,000
unless you buy particular items.

294
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,958
For instance,

295
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,458
if the gift is a bag,

296
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,166
you can only have it

297
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,750
when you buy particular outfits.

298
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:14,958
I see.

299
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,041
So Miss Gu is applying

300
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,291
her knowledge in clothes and fashion

301
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,000
to sales through the gifts.

302
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,041
Moreover,

303
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,066
through this method, Gu Xixi

304
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,833
can also introduce
the right dressing tips to people

305
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,925
and thus win the trust of the customers.

306
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:29,234
How did you think of that?

307
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,218
- To find a way
- To find a way

308
00:15:31,242 --> 00:15:32,709
- to make customers lose their minds.
- to make customers lose their minds.

309
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,541
Looks like I’ll need to
thank my “military advisor”.

310
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,000
“Military advisor”?

311
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,062
(Xiwei)

312
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,500
Hello. What’s up, Xiwei?

313
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,592
I still think there’s a misunderstanding
between Sichen and me.

314
00:15:47,225 --> 00:15:48,392
Could you help me to ask him out?

315
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,375
I want to talk to him in person.

316
00:15:53,075 --> 00:15:54,333
It’s really not good

317
00:15:54,675 --> 00:15:56,550
for you two if it keeps going like this.

318
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,208
If he agrees to see you,

319
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,875
please have a nice talk with him.

320
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:02,800
Hmm.

321
00:16:07,475 --> 00:16:08,375
Today won’t work.

322
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:10,416
Just a cup of coffee.

323
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,375
Is that so hard?

324
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,458
I need to attend

325
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,000
a masquerade tonight.

326
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,416
A masquerade?

327
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:16,791
I wanna go, too!

328
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:17,375
No.

329
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,625
I won’t take you this time.

330
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,625
Why not?

331
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,958
I throw this party
especially for Gu Xixi.

332
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,541
Gals before pals!

333
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,525
It’s a masquerade.
The more the merrier.

334
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:28,650
Wouldn’t it be too boring
if it’s just the two of you?

335
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,166
I can bring more people to the party.

336
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,333
If only you put all your energy

337
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,925
in your company.

338
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,750
I’ve been working hard, okay?

339
00:16:38,025 --> 00:16:39,500
You are the one who stops hanging

340
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,750
out with me after you got married.

341
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,975
I will be there tonight.

342
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,875
I’ll ask Fei’ang
about the time and place,

343
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:44,958
and I’ll take care of the costumes.

344
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,000
It’s a deal. See you.

345
00:16:46,275 --> 00:16:48,025
- Bye-bye.
- Hey!

346
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,000
Here’s the thing.

347
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,050
There’s a costume party tonight.

348
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:53,541
Hmm.

349
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:56,958
Prepare a costume in dark color

350
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,083
for Mrs. Yin,

351
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,791
i.e. Gu Xixi,

352
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,875
and prepare a costume in light color

353
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,708
for this girl, Ran Xiwei.

354
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:04,375
- Got it?
- Hmm.

355
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,041
Got it.

356
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:06,541
Good.

357
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,666
I’ll count on you.

358
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,333
Go ahead.

359
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,375
Okay, Mr. Shang.

360
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:16,816
I’m only arranging a meeting for them.

361
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,075
It shouldn’t be a big problem.

362
00:17:19,075 --> 00:17:21,475
Ran Xiwei… Gu Xixi…

363
00:17:22,525 --> 00:17:23,333
Sorry! Sorry!

364
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:23,875
It’s okay.

365
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:24,625
I’m so sorry.

366
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,250
Ran Xiwei… Gu Xixi…

367
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,666
Gu Xixi… Ran Xiwei…

368
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,125
Ran Xiwei… Gu Xixi…

369
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,333
Good evening.

370
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,541
Do you have an invitation?

371
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,125
You are Miss Gu Xixi, right?

372
00:17:49,225 --> 00:17:49,833
Hmm.

373
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:50,500
This way, please.

374
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,458
She’s arrived.

375
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,250
Get ready.

376
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,041
Xiaoxin. Xiaoxin.

377
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,958
I’ve been looking for you.

378
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,875
When you see the “black witch” later,

379
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,541
take her to the rooftop

380
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,083
and do whatever you can

381
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,225
to keep her there for one hour.

382
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,550
Let her stay there
for one hour by all means.

383
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,025
I…

384
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:08,875
I know you can do it.

385
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:09,583
Deal.

386
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:13,708
How am I supposed to do that?

387
00:18:34,825 --> 00:18:35,625
Hi,

388
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,000
Mr. Yin is waiting for you
on the rooftop.

389
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,575
He has something to talk to you about.

390
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:39,541
Please come with me.

391
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,875
Okay.

392
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:47,625
Here.

393
00:18:48,425 --> 00:18:49,075
Cheers.

394
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,166
Please.

395
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,308
Oh, thank you.

396
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,333
Welcome.

397
00:18:56,525 --> 00:18:57,166
Please come in.

398
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,950
Hey, handsome. Guess who I am.

399
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,625
I have a question.

400
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:02,708
What kind of mask is this?

401
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,783
Looks so stupid.

402
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,450
Come on, let’s go upstairs.

403
00:19:04,475 --> 00:19:05,416
Not at all.

404
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,708
It’s cute and cool.

405
00:19:06,975 --> 00:19:08,375
Oh, I have something to tell you.

406
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,583
Xiwei will also be here today.

407
00:19:12,475 --> 00:19:13,875
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

408
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,666
Would you come if I told you earlier?

409
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,833
I know there’s probably a small

410
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,375
misunderstanding between you two.

411
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,166
But,

412
00:19:24,175 --> 00:19:25,625
you’ve known each other for years.

413
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:26,500
I’m sure you can have

414
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,500
the problem solved when you meet.

415
00:19:29,225 --> 00:19:29,958
You are right.

416
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,984
I do need to talk to her in person.

417
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:33,900
Hmm.

418
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,250
- Is Gu Xixi here yet?
- I’ll go say hi.

419
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,958
Xixi has arrived.

420
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,375
She should be changing
upstairs right now.

421
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,050
It may take a little while.

422
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:42,675
Hi, there you are.

423
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:43,750
I’ll go check on her.

424
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,416
Hey, wait.

425
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,875
Sichen, don’t get me wrong,

426
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:46,958
but all you can think about

427
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,375
now is Gu Xixi.

428
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:49,833
Aren’t you able
to think about something else?

429
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,875
You’ll lose my respect at this rate.

430
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:52,916
Take a look at this first.

431
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,250
Remember.

432
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,916
Xiwei will be wearing this.

433
00:19:58,725 --> 00:19:59,500
Got it?

434
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,175
Hmm.

435
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,291
Got it.

436
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,200
Oh, she’s here!

437
00:20:39,275 --> 00:20:40,000
Come with me, please.

438
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,041
It’s a nice party, isn’t it?

439
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:45,750
It is.

440
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,958
How come there’s no signal?

441
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:16,125
Anybody there?

442
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:26,666
There’s something

443
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:27,958
I want to make it clear.

444
00:21:30,225 --> 00:21:31,500
I’ve been thinking about

445
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,833
our relationship these days.

446
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,125
For a long time,

447
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,625
I thought we knew each other

448
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,541
best in this world,

449
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,708
but later I realized that I was wrong.

450
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,416
Maybe we just got used

451
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,458
to how other people thought about us.

452
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,450
Or maybe it was just a habit.

453
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,000
We both misunderstood
our relationship.

454
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,166
I don’t know how you think about it,

455
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,625
but it may just be your illusion

456
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:10,791
that you think you like me.

457
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,625
At least it’s never

458
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,250
occurred to me that we could

459
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,833
become lovers.

460
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,875
So, please keep a distance from me

461
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,583
in the future.

462
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,666
Besides, I’m in love
with someone already.

463
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:35,333
So, from now on, I’ll also

464
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,309
keep a distance from you.

465
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:40,958
You…

466
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:02,650
I don’t know how you think about it,

467
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,125
but it may just be your illusion

468
00:23:05,825 --> 00:23:07,242
that you think you like me.

469
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:11,041
At least it’s never

470
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:13,708
occurred to me that we could

471
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,583
become lovers.

472
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,375
So, please keep a distance from me

473
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,625
in the future.

474
00:23:23,075 --> 00:23:25,491
So, from now on, I’ll also

475
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,166
keep a distance from you.

476
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:32,675
Have a drink.

477
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:35,525
Here, please.

478
00:23:35,975 --> 00:23:36,625
Thank you.

479
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,342
(Gu Xixi)
“The party tonight is truly a big surprise.

480
00:23:45,575 --> 00:23:46,833
I won’t bother you anymore.

481
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:48,541
And I’ll keep a distance from you.

482
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,083
I’ll stay with Xiaoya tonight.”

483
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,458
What’s going on?

484
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:53,958
Sorry. Sorry.

485
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:55,000
I’m sorry, Xiwei.

486
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,333
I really didn’t expect

487
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,958
things would become like this.

488
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:59,541
Anyway,

489
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:00,916
it’s all my fault.

490
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:02,400
Please forgive me.

491
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,617
It’s okay.

492
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:06,666
Where’s Sichen?

493
00:24:06,975 --> 00:24:08,583
He… He said he didn’t

494
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:09,625
see Xixi tonight,

495
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:10,625
so he went home.

496
00:24:11,975 --> 00:24:13,041
Xiwei, don’t…

497
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:14,625
Please don’t…

498
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,083
I… It’s all my fault!

499
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,083
Look, you even had a…

500
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,958
I… I’ll let the driver to take you home.

501
00:24:22,225 --> 00:24:23,166
Take a good rest.

502
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,875
We’ll figure out

503
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:26,500
something else later, okay?

504
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,550
Hmm.

505
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:54,291
Xixi, what’s wrong?

506
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:56,291
Why are you looking so blue today?

507
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:00,375
Turns out he has

508
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,125
no feelings for me at all.

509
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:06,125
I thought too much.

510
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,000
I thought after the Alex matter,

511
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:14,958
things would be different for us.

512
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,250
You are looking so sad.

513
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,300
Does it mean you are

my duties fulfilled,

he’s in love with someone already.

Is it Ran Xiwei?

546
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:50,916
Perhaps.

547
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:55,291
Come on.

548
00:26:55,541 --> 00:26:57,208
Stop thinking about that.

549
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:59,083
I always have your back
no matter what.

Don’t be sad.

551
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:01,916
You’ll meet someone better.

552
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:14,041
Miss Gu.

553
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,392
This is the woman Sichen likes.

554
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:27,666
Miss Gu?

555
00:27:30,475 --> 00:27:31,375
Miss Ran.

556
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:32,833
How may I help you?

557
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:34,375
Here’s the thing.

558
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:36,250
I want to recommend

559
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,666
a Chinese fashion designer
through my Official Account.

560
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:40,416
So I want to have an interview

561
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,666
with you.

562
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:42,600
May I

563
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,375
have the honor?

564
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:47,416
You

565
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:52,458
want to recommend me via V. Studio?

566
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:54,666
Don’t worry.

567
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:57,125
You only need to do an interview

568
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:59,250
and tell us about
your design philosophy

569
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,208
and where you got your ideas from.

570
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:03,166
What else do you need me to do?

571
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:06,708
I need you to relax.

572
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,550
An interview with CICI?

573
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,075
Hmm.

574
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,666
I thought we’d never follow suit.

575
00:28:15,958 --> 00:28:18,083
This time I’ll do
an exclusive interview, though.

576
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:19,666
These are the relevant materials.

577
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:20,625
Please go prepare for it.

578
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:22,583
Alright, I’m on it.

579
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:23,125
Hmm.

580
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:30,458
The way that Gu Xixi
talks to me today is a little weird.

581
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,750
She sounds distant.

582
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:33,333
Isn’t that normal?

583
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:37,625
Hello? Hello? Hello?

584
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:38,916
Pick up! Pick up!

585
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:39,708
Hello? Hello? Hello?

586
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:40,375
Sichen,

587
00:28:40,666 --> 00:28:41,958
something bad happened!

588
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:43,125
Is it about you

589
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:43,958
and Mu Ruona again?

590
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:45,250
I don’t have time for that right now.

591
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,275
It’s not about Ruona.

592
00:28:46,275 --> 00:28:47,875
It’s about the costume party last night.

593
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:49,250
The person you talked to

594
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,208
was not Xiwei.

595
00:28:52,325 --> 00:28:53,075
Then who was she?

596
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:54,375
Since it wasn’t Xiwei,

597
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:55,666
it could

598
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,958
only be Xixi.

599
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,625
Hey, can’t you just be
reliable for once?

600
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:03,083
You caused big trouble!

601
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,625
Sorry. The subscriber
you dialed is busy now.

602
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:15,900
Why doesn’t she answer?

603
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:18,416
Then what should we do?
I can’t leave at the moment.

604
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:19,725
Good.

605
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:21,333
- It took me a long time to find this gig.
- Put your hand here.

606
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:24,000
How did the car break down?

607
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:25,666
Is it urgent to have
the fabric delivered?

608
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:26,458
Very!

609
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:28,708
If it’s not delivered today,

610
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,500
the factory will

611
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,250
take care of the other orders first,

612
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,458
and ours will be postponed.

613
00:29:33,175 --> 00:29:34,083
Now, get ready.

614
00:29:34,475 --> 00:29:35,375
Oh, okay!

615
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,166
I have to go now.
Then what do we do?

616
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:39,500
Never mind. Just go back to work.

617
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:41,166
I’ll think of something.

618
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,791
Okay.

619
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:45,125
Now, pose like this.

620
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:46,458
Put your arms on both sides.

621
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:49,708
Go to her store.

622
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,125
But we have an
urgent meeting coming up.

623
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,041
Hey, you guys,

624
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:05,833
put the stuff in that car.

625
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,291
Hurry. Put it in that car.

626
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:09,333
Yes. That car over there.

627
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:10,083
- Hurry.
- Sir.

628
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:11,000
I’m sorry.

629
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,375
The stuff is mine.

630
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,500
I’ve called another car.

631
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:15,625
Could you wait for a little while?

632
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:18,291
But you’ve sent some people here.

633
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:19,166
They are right over there.

634
00:30:19,425 --> 00:30:20,125
What?

635
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,583
They are there.

636
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:11,083
Senior, you…

637
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:12,750
Xiaoya told me you needed help,

638
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,041
so here I am.

639
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,333
Then they are…

640
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:20,916
They are all my employees.

641
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:22,416
I asked them to lend a hand.

642
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:26,000
Actually, I’ve called another car.

643
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:27,708
You don’t have to
go through the trouble.

644
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:28,291
Xixi,

645
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,708
we are friends.

646
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:31,916
There’s no trouble at all.

647
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:33,750
Now,

648
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:35,375
let’s load the fabric first.

649
00:31:35,775 --> 00:31:36,825
We can talk later.

650
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:58,225
(Chen)

651
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,400
Mr. Mo,

652
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,333
it’s all done.

653
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:05,325
We’ll go home now.

654
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:06,583
Okay. Thank you.

655
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:07,208
Thank you.

656
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:08,041
Go home and take a rest.

657
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:08,500
Okay.

658
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:09,166
Thanks.

659
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:09,875
- Bye-bye.
- See you.

660
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:10,875
Go home.

661
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:16,500
Senior, thank you for your help.

662
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:17,833
Don’t mention it.

663
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,291
It’s getting late now.

664
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:22,208
Let me take you back.

665
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:23,208
It’s okay. Don’t bother.

666
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:25,166
I’ll ride with the delivery car

667
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:26,500
and go back to my store.

668
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,041
You are not going back home?

669
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,458
No.

670
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:34,125
You had a fight with Yin Sichen?

671
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:38,500
No.

672
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:39,875
I still have

673
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,875
a lot of work to do.

674
00:32:44,666 --> 00:32:45,416
Then I’ll keep you company.

675
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
You don’t have to, Senior.

676
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:49,666
You’ve done me a big favor today.

677
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:50,916
If you stay up late with me,

678
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:53,375
I’ll feel really, really, really…

679
00:32:53,416 --> 00:32:55,000
I don’t have anything planned anyway.

680
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:57,583
And I’ll worry about you
if you are in the store alone.

681
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:58,916
Mr. Mo.

682
00:32:59,525 --> 00:33:00,875
Please come over and sign here.

683
00:33:17,825 --> 00:33:18,583
Are you alright?

684
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:20,583
Yin Sichen.

685
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:21,550
What are you doing?

686
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:24,750
Why didn’t you answer my call?

687
00:33:26,416 --> 00:33:27,166
I didn’t see it.

688
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,500
Where’s your phone?

689
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:30,375
Why are you asking?

690
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:31,333
Give me your phone.

691
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:33,125
Why?

692
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:33,791
Give it to me.

693
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:41,625
Now, even if you put
your phone on mute,

694
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:44,666
you can still receive my texts,
phone calls and WeChat messages.

695
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:46,333
Reply me as soon
as you get my message.

696
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:46,958
Got it?

697
00:33:51,958 --> 00:33:53,000
Why did you come here this late?

698
00:33:58,675 --> 00:33:59,791
I’m going to my office for a meeting.

699
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:00,916
I’m just passing by.

700
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:03,083
This place is not on the way
to Why Mall.

701
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,291
And it’s 10:30 PM already.

702
00:34:05,825 --> 00:34:06,875
I’m a workaholic.

703
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:12,100
Actually, last night,

704
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,333
I…

705
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:20,375
What are you doing here?

706
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:22,041
As you know,

707
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:23,833
Xixi had trouble
with the fabric delivery,

708
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:24,833
so I came to help her.

709
00:34:28,958 --> 00:34:31,583
How could you let Mr. Mo
do such hard work?

710
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:33,916
Xixi,

711
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:35,375
that was rude.

712
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,083
Mr. Mo.

713
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:40,208
It’s getting late.

714
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:42,166
I’ll take that car
and go back to the store.

715
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:42,800
Okay?

716
00:34:44,325 --> 00:34:45,041
Let me give you a ride.

717
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,083
I’m worried about your safety.

718
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,500
Let go of me.

719
00:34:52,825 --> 00:34:53,541
Mr. Yin,

720
00:34:54,775 --> 00:34:55,750
let me take Xixi back.

721
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,583
That’ll make you less worried.

722
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:02,625
In fact, my biggest concern is you.

723
00:35:05,958 --> 00:35:06,958
I still have some of my men here.

724
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:09,000
After I take Xixi to her store,

725
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,083
I’ll ask someone to drive her home.

726
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,458
I need to talk to you.

727
00:35:20,075 --> 00:35:20,875
Yin Sichen,

728
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:24,000
I’m very busy.

729
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:27,416
Could you just leave me alone?

730
00:35:47,025 --> 00:35:48,950
What happened between you two?

731
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:52,625
Just a quarrel.

732
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,917
It’s normal for a couple
to have a quarrel.

733
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,458
Especially with
Yin Sichen’s personality.

734
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:10,942
He’s bossy and domineering.

735
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:12,916
The whole industry knows about that.

736
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:14,875
The problem between us

737
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:16,450
would be much easier

738
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:17,958
if it was all about personality.

739
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:20,375
But I don’t think our problem

740
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:22,416
can be solved that easily.

741
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:30,583
If you need any help,

742
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:31,675
just let me know.

743
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,458
Maybe I can help you.

744
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:36,708
It’s nothing, actually.

745
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:41,250
I think I just misunderstood him.

746
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:45,125
I was wrong about
how much I meant to him.

747
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:46,500
And I was wrong

748
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:49,750
about how he felt about me.

749
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,250
Perhaps we didn’t belong

750
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,041
to the same world to begin with,

751
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:55,958
so it’s impossible for us
to be together.

752
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,625
But it’s okay.

753
00:36:57,825 --> 00:36:58,575
I think I’ll be fine

754
00:36:58,575 --> 00:37:00,458
as long as I can let it go.

755
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:07,625
Are you fine being like this?

756
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:16,958
I am.

757
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:19,958
I think I’m really fine

758
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,625
at this very moment,

759
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,416
because Yin Sichen is not here.

760
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:32,700
Come to think of it,

761
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,541
it’s the first time we drink together.

762
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,400
I know it’s not my place

763
00:37:52,675 --> 00:37:53,916
to talk about you and Yin Sichen,

764
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,416
but I want you to know

765
00:37:58,458 --> 00:37:59,833
that whatever decision you make

766
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,250
or wherever you are,

767
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:03,583
you’ll always have me by your side.

768
00:38:05,525 --> 00:38:06,208
Senior,

769
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:10,125
please don’t be like this.

770
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:13,708
You’ve helped me a lot.

771
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,916
I’d feel guilty if you are
this nice to me.

772
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:17,916
That’s not how I see it.

773
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:20,083
Since I’m drinking your wine,

774
00:38:20,791 --> 00:38:23,291
it means you are sharing
your joy with me,

775
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:25,500
so I need to pay you back somehow.

776
00:38:26,416 --> 00:38:27,916
Oh, you like drinking wine.

777
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:30,166
Waiter, bring us…

778
00:38:34,666 --> 00:38:35,458
I’ve told you

779
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,500
that no matter what you do,

780
00:38:37,725 --> 00:38:39,000
I’ll always have your back.

781
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:41,375
So I hope

782
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:44,541
that you won’t keep things from me.

783
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:47,000
Otherwise, I’ll feel
I mean nothing to you.

784
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:50,541
You are right.

785
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:53,750
I need to be strong.

786
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:55,916
I can’t make the people
who care about me

787
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,958
sad or worried.

788
00:38:58,275 --> 00:38:59,000
Right?

789
00:39:01,225 --> 00:39:02,225
I need to be strong.

790
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,208
I want to get in the car.

791
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:11,550
I want to go home.

792
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:14,416
Go home and go to bed.

793
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:16,075
- I want to go home.
- Xixi.

794
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,666
The car will be here soon
to pick you up.

795
00:39:19,325 --> 00:39:21,325
You can sleep for a while
if you are sleepy.

796
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:28,416
I like you.

797
00:39:35,975 --> 00:39:37,725
