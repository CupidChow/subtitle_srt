(Closed today)

25
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,916
Isn’t this store
run by Gu Xixi’s family?

26
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:54,958
Why is it closed?

27
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:10,025
Aunt.

28
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:10,666
Hello.

29
00:02:10,707 --> 00:02:12,650
Sorry, we are closed today.

30
00:02:17,082 --> 00:02:17,875
It’s you.

31
00:02:18,457 --> 00:02:19,850
Aunt, do you still remember me?

32
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:21,457
Of course, I do.

33
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:22,957
You are Xixi’s good friend.

34
00:02:22,957 --> 00:02:25,000
You helped her out
at the restaurant that day.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,850
Thank you.

36
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:26,925
No problem.

37
00:02:27,957 --> 00:02:29,041
I passed by today.

38
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,041
I heard from Xixi
that you opened a laundry.

39
00:02:31,332 --> 00:02:33,166
Why is it closed suddenly?

40
00:02:35,832 --> 00:02:38,291
The old dryer is broken.

41
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,500
We don’t have enough cash

42
00:02:41,832 --> 00:02:43,541
to buy a new one.

43
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:45,457
So we closed it for now.

44
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,575
Aunt.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,625
Well,

46
00:02:47,957 --> 00:02:49,291
a manufacturer I work with

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,207
has some special dryers.

48
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,000
I’ll ask him to send one here tomorrow.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,416
No, no. I can’t take it.

50
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,750
Even if you are Xixi’s friend,

51
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,500
I can’t always trouble you.

52
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,500
Besides, if Xixi knows it,

53
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,791
she will blame me.

54
00:03:01,207 --> 00:03:02,541
I can’t let you do this.

55
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:03,625
Aunt.

56
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,250
I’m not helping you.

57
00:03:05,582 --> 00:03:06,957
Instead, I need your help.

58
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,416
How can I help you?

59
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:10,750
Well,

60
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,707
I’m running an e-commerce platform

61
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,625
and there are some manufacturers
I’m working with.

62
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,041
The brand is new.

63
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:17,800
But don’t worry.

64
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,875
The quality is one of the best.

65
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,707
I’ve been looking for laundries

66
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,000
as pilots.

67
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,457
I don’t know if you can help me.

68
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,082
Really?

69
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:26,918
Yes.

70
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,225
Okay.

71
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,916
Thank you.

72
00:03:31,457 --> 00:03:31,957
You’re welcome.

73
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:33,291
By the way,

74
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:34,791
I heard from Xixi

75
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,291
that we are from the same place, right?

76
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:36,832
Yes.

77
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,500
I’ll ask Xixi

78
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,291
to bring you

79
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,957
some hometown snacks later.

80
00:03:40,957 --> 00:03:41,550
Alright?

81
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,416
Great. Thank you, Aunt.

82
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:43,500
Look at you.

83
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,750
You don’t need to say that to me.

84
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,207
Let’s go.

85
00:03:46,207 --> 00:03:47,125
Let’s go over there to sit down

86
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,000
- and have some water.
- Okay.

87
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,832
- Okay.
- Come on.

88
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:50,850
Don’t worry.

89
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,707
With Gu Xixi’s legal knowledge,

90
00:03:52,707 --> 00:03:54,041
she won’t be aware of it at all.

91
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,825
We only need

92
00:03:55,825 --> 00:03:57,291
to ask the Law Department

93
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,832
to add a binding clause to the contract.

94
00:04:00,332 --> 00:04:01,041
In this way,

95
00:04:01,457 --> 00:04:03,041
although she is the nominal manager,

96
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,457
she doesn’t have the right
to make decisions or gain benefits.

97
00:04:06,957 --> 00:04:08,625
If she takes the power of attorney,

98
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,666
does it mean
she can’t run her own brand?

99
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,082
In theory, yes.

100
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:15,916
But we can make up to her

101
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,540
financially.

102
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,583
I don’t want to lie to her anymore.

103
00:04:21,915 --> 00:04:23,375
I need to give it further thought.

104
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,725
What’s wrong?

105
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,750
Just a cold.
I’ll be all right after some rest.

106
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,350
Well,

107
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,875
you should have a meeting
with those departments

108
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,540
and prepare for the acquisition.

109
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,225
Um.

110
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:03,550
Sichen.

111
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,415
Why are you coughing?

112
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,325
I’m not feeling well.

113
00:05:12,665 --> 00:05:13,665
Did you catch a cold?

114
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,000
Just a little cold.

115
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,208
I’ll sleep it off.

116
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,500
Where’s Chen Fei’ang?

117
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,040
He went to

118
00:05:22,165 --> 00:05:23,165
discuss with Alex’s team
about the acquisition.

119
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,875
Don’t let it get worse.

120
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,208
I’ll go to buy some medicine for you.

121
00:05:29,665 --> 00:05:31,665
Sit down. Stay with me for a while.

122
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,083
What’s this?

123
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,290
Oh, right.

124
00:05:40,915 --> 00:05:42,040
It’s your birthday today.

125
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,790
How do you know it’s my birthday today?

126
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:46,790
Did you forget that?

127
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,040
You sent me your information

128
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,665
and asked me to memorize it all.

129
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,000
You only prepared
such a small cake for my birthday?

130
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,125
I came back too late.

131
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,415
All the cake stores are closed.

132
00:05:58,665 --> 00:05:59,915
But I’m really lucky.

133
00:05:59,915 --> 00:06:01,290
I met a little boy on my way back

134
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,790
who happened to be celebrating
his birthday, too.

135
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,250
You took the cake

136
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,750
from a little boy?

137
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,400
Yes.

138
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,790
No, it’s not like I took it from him.

139
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,165
I sang him a whole birthday song.

140
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,790
Then he kindly shared a piece with me.

141
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:21,790
I also want to listen to
the birthday song.

142
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:32,583
Make a wish.

143
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,125
You sing first.

144
00:06:36,415 --> 00:06:37,540

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,000
I like it so much.

174
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,458
Thank you, my good girlfriend.

175
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,975
Love you.

176
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:37,525
All right.

177
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,083
Let me see

178
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:39,958
if you took

179
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,958
any stylish photos
of the scenery in Milan.

180
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,125
It’s not stylish,

181
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,375
but I did take some landscape photos.

182
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:47,250
Let me see.

183
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,625
Not right.

184
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,625
Something is going on here.

185
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,166
No.

186
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,041
What are you talking about?

187
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,041
Don’t be ridiculous.

188
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,325
Look at this one.

189
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,958
He looks at you affectionately

190
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,958
and you watch him affectionately.

191
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:09,583
That’s not true.

192
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:10,791
And this one.

193
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,500
He is holding you with his face red.

194
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:15,958
Doesn’t that mean anything?

195
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,725
Enough.

196
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:20,333
It’s just a normal photo.

197
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,075
Right?

198
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:22,333
It’s...

199
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,166
Impossible.

200
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,041
Check this out.

201
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,583
You can’t fake it.

202
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:27,875
Gu Xixi.

203
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,541
Tell me the truth. Is there
something going on between you two?

204
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:30,541
Do you like him?

205
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,958
How is the sample production going?

206
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,125
The sample? It’s done.

207
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:36,916
You know what,

208
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,625
it’s perfect. Take a look.

209
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,500
How is it?

210
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,708
Literally,

211
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,708
I’m a genius.

212
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:49,550
Um.

213
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,025
But,

214
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:52,208
we have just started.

215
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,541
The difficult part hasn’t come yet.

216
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,650
Um.

217
00:09:58,925 --> 00:09:59,500
Look.

218
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:00,541
See.

219
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,083
The sincere noodles.

220
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,500
The wholehearted steak.

221
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,416
And the “love of my life” wine.

222
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:07,791
You are good at this.

223
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,750
You do it a lot at home?

224
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:12,250
Occasionally.

225
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,375
For whom?

226
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:15,666
Sichen.

227
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:17,916
Are you two into this?

228
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:21,666
Well...

229
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,375
Well,

230
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,416
I think

231
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,083
it’s time for us

232
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,375
to talk about our exes.

233
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,800
Well, Ruona.

234
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,375
I know you may have heard some rumors.

235
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,750
I was young and ignorant at that time.

236
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,708
Don’t be angry.

237
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,958
We are adults.

238
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,550
It’s very normal

239
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,450
for us to have

240
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,875
a few exes and relationships.

241
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,583
You don’t need to hide it from me.

242
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:53,125
Are you sure you won’t be jealous?

243
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,500
Yes.

244
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,416
I’ll say it then.

245
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,325
Well,

246
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,625
I’ll start from my fifth grade
in elementary school.

247
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:01,550
She was my first girlfriend.

248
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,025
Next is my tenth girlfriend.

249
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:04,875
My tenth

250
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,416
relationship was beautiful

251
00:11:07,675 --> 00:11:08,625
but a little bleak.

252
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,333
It was lovely at first.

253
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,625
She is the daughter of our head teacher.

254
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,291
Then it’s my fifteenth girlfriend.

255
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,900
She is your last secretary.

256
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,625
She wasn’t my type at first.

257
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,975
She is chubby

258
00:11:19,975 --> 00:11:21,000
- Enough.
- with big eyes.

259
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,166
I didn’t feel that way about her.

260
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,791
But there was one moment
she went straight to my heart.

261
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:26,375
I...

262
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,750
Well, Ruona.

263
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:47,666
What about your boyfriends?

264
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,916
You’ve met my first boyfriend.

265
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,350
Then it’s you.

266
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,375
It’s me right after him?

267
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:54,166
Yeah.

268
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:57,166
Ruona.

269
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,791
Considering I’m so frank

270
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,791
and I’ve confessed everything since
my fifth grade in elementary school,

271
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,583
shouldn’t you give me
an extra ten points?

272
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,000
Indeed.

273
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:05,416
However,

274
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,250
your first relationship is too early
and you have too many exes,

275
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,125
so I’ll take twenty points from you.

276
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,166
Twenty?

277
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,625
Wait, you have to let me explain.

278
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,125
Didn’t you say

279
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,000
you won’t be angry?

280
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,500
Yeah?

281
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,750
Am I jealous?

282
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,250
Do you see I’m jealous?

283
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,225
Why are they here?

284
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,125
Don’t touch them.

285
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,541
This is my money-gathering place.

286
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,375
Aren’t these two little bears

287
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,208
for us?

288
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,125
I’ll share some luck with you.

289
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:51,500
Am I a good friend?

290
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,416
Your luck?

291
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,916
Don’t look down on me.

292
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,166
My store will open soon.

293
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,041
Maybe you will beg me to join Why Mall

294
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,750
when I get rich.

295
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,275
Gu Xixi.

296
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:05,791
You have to realize

297
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,125
that there is a difference between

298
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,250
writing a business plan

299
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:10,750
and running a physical store.

300
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:11,500
It doesn’t matter.

301
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,291
I’ll overcome whatever difficulties
there may be.

302
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:16,833
Are you so confident?

303
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:19,458
Of course not.

304
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,291
But I think

305
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,666
I should try my best for my dream.

306
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,500
Is your dream that important to you?

307
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,250
Of course.

308
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,583
I’ve been dreaming about

309
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,791
having my own store since I was a kid.

310
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,333
So no matter what happens,

311
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,791
I must make it happen.

312
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:00,500
Mom.

313
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,025
You’re back.

314
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,725
Come on. Sit down.

315
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,300
Mom, I brought you a present.

316
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,375
You didn’t forget me
during your honeymoon.

317
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,250
What are you talking about?

318
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,666
Why are you looking at me like that?

319
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,333
Look how happy you are.

320
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,333
You are different now.

321
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,916
Tell me, did you spend
a really sweet honeymoon

322
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,958
with Sichen in Milan?

323
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,083
What’s sweet?

324
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,833
We are just ordinary

325
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,666
husband and wife.

326
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,975
There is nothing sweet.

327
00:14:38,675 --> 00:14:39,333
Mom.

328
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,125
Where is that noisy machine?

329
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:42,916
When did you change it?

330
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,333
It’s completely broken.

331
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,125
Luckily, Mo came over that day

332
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,958
and asked his friend to send one here.

333
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,500
He said it’s a special offer
and it’s very cheap.

334
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,083
Which Mo?

335
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,175
Mo Zixin.

336
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,275
I heard from him

337
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,750
that you are neighbors now, right?

338
00:14:58,425 --> 00:14:59,041
Yeah.

339
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,041
Wait for me.

340
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,416
What’s this?

341
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:07,875
Here.

342
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,583
Mom, you don’t have
to give me something in return.

343
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:12,291
What’s this?

344
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,416
Mud snails and green dumplings?

345
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,041
Thank you, Mom. I know...

346
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,208
You greedy girl.

347
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,541
Look, these are for Mo

348
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,416
to thank him for helping me.

349
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:22,625
Remember, don’t eat it yourself.

350
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,275
Senior.

351
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,900
- You’re back.
- Um.

352
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,208
How was your trip

353
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:37,625
to Milan?

354
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,375
Not bad.

355
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:40,791
It’s for you.

356
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,875
You got a gift for me?

357
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,575
Green dumplings and mud snails?

358
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:46,650
You made it?

359
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,000
My mom made it.

360
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,333
She wants to thank you
for changing the dryer.

361
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:52,791
It’s not a problem.

362
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,583
I haven’t had green dumplings
for a long time.

363
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:56,666
Give your mom my thanks for me.

364
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:57,583
If you want to thank her,

365
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:58,583
you should say it yourself.

366
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,208
I’m not your mouthpiece.

367
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,208
But you are lucky this time.

368
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,291
The green dumplings my mom made
are really good.

369
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:06,958
Are you jealous?

370
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,500
Didn’t she make some for you?

371
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,125
I haven’t had the green dumplings

372
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,500
my mom made for a long time.

373
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:13,791
But if I want to eat,

374
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:14,958
I think she will make it for me.

375
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,416
If you don’t mind,

376
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,750
I can share some for you.

377
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,708
I don’t think it’s enough for me.

378
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:21,650
All right.

379
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:22,875
I haven’t had lunch yet.

380
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:23,791
Do you want to join me?

381
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,333
- I...
- Gu Xixi.

382
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,375
Sichen, why are you here?

383
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,333
Why are you here?

384
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,083
I...

385
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,000
I did Aunt Gu a little favor

386
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,541
and Xixi is here
to send me something for Aunt.

387
00:16:40,725 --> 00:16:41,375
Um.

388
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,375
Let’s go home.

389
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,350
Senior, I’m leaving.

390
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,400
Bye.

391
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,250
You...

392
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:01,750
What are green dumplings?

393
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,958
My mom made it herself

394
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,333
as a thank-you gift to Senior Mo.

395
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,666
I’m impressed by Mo Zixin.

396
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,875
Can you make green dumplings?

397
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:13,208
Yes.

398
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,375
I want to eat it.

399
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,300
You can buy it.

400
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,666
I want you to make it.

401
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,550
Go ahead and eat, my young master.

402
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,708
You never ate it before?

403
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,333
How is it?

404
00:17:51,175 --> 00:17:52,050
Terrible.

405
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:55,708
How come?

406
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,541
If I didn’t go there,

407
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,833
would you agree to have lunch with him?

408
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,833
Senior Mo?

409
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:07,550
Um.

410
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,075
I guess I would.

411
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:11,708
After all, I like the green dumplings

412
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,250
my mom made.

413
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,100
What?

414
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:16,900
You are not eating anymore?

415
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,041
I don’t like it anyway.

416
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,041
Then why did you ask me
to make it for you?

417
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,125
Someone ate the food
my mother-in-law made,

418
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,291
so I have to eat something you made.

419
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:27,541
You...

420
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,208
Childish.

421
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,208
It’s Alex.

422
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:42,916
Hello, Mr. Alex.

423
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,166
Long time no see.

424
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,300
I wonder if you and Miss Gu
have made your decision

425
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,208
about my proposal last time.

426
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,625
It’s hard for us
to reject your kindness.

427
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,583
But we still need some time
to deal with something.

428
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,333
I won’t keep you waiting long.

429
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:56,333
I hope my request

430
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,583
won’t put you in a difficult situation.

431
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,916
Not at all. Don’t worry.

432
00:18:59,208 --> 00:18:59,875
That’s great.

433
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,583
I’ll ask my assistant
to send you the contract.

434
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:02,958
And I’ll wait for your good news.

435
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,375
Alright, no problem.

436
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,375
Alex is coming next Wednesday.

437
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:15,083
Seems that you haven’t
discussed it with Miss Gu.

438
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,875
I haven’t told her about it yet.

439
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:18,666
She has been totally focusing on

440
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:19,875
her store these days.

441
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,416
It’s not a good time to tell her now.

442
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:23,916
You mean...

443
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,208
I’m thinking if there is

444
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,916
a perfect solution to this.

445
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,541
People are more receptive to requests

446
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,958
when their wishes are met.

447
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,958
If you want to persuade Miss Gu,

448
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,750
I suggest you use this method.

449
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,375
Wishes are met?

450
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,583
What do you know?

451
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,166
It’s Nianxi.

452
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:45,916
I worship him.

453
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,375
He is a comic book artist.

454
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:50,375
I need you to find

455
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,541
a comic book artist named Nianxi for me.

456
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,208
Better to arrange a meeting for us.

457
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:54,375
Okay.

458
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:01,166
Miss Ran.

459
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:02,791
Please.

460
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:03,850
Um.

461
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:10,750
Miss Ran?

462
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,200
Where’s Sichen?

463
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,525
Sichen is not at home today.

464
00:20:19,475 --> 00:20:20,125
By the way,

465
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:21,916
I heard that you and Sichen

466
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,916
went to Milan to see Alex.

467
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:24,833
Congratulations.

468
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,416
On what?

469
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,250
Didn’t Sichen tell you?

470
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,050
Tell me what?

471
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,916
Seems that Sichen
doesn’t tell you everything.

472
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,208
By the way,

473
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,208
I’m here today to tell you

474
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,666
that I will never

475
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,666
give up Sichen.

476
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,416
Yin Sichen is looking for you.

477
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:07,375
Why is he looking for me
all of a sudden?

478
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,625
To be more precise,
he is looking for Nianxi.

479
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,125
He found

480
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:11,916
our phone number

481
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,208
through the publisher.

482
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,650
He said he wants to see you.
The sooner the better.

483
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:19,650
Okay.

484
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:20,833
I’ll meet him.

485
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,500
Tell him I’ll meet him tonight.

486
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,125
Okay.

487
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,700
Hello, I’m Yin Sichen.

488
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:50,666
I know you.

489
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,541
What I want is simple.

490
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,725
I want to invite you to have a meal

491
00:21:56,725 --> 00:21:57,800
with me and my wife.

492
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,525
(Fujiwara Select)
She is a big fan of yours.

493
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:01,166
Of course,

494
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:03,291
feel free to tell me your terms.

495
00:22:06,475 --> 00:22:07,300
Are you sure

496
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,875
you will bring Xixi
to have a meal with me?

497
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,541
I did Aunt Gu a little favor

498
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:22,625
and Xixi is here

499
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,458
to send me something for Aunt.

500
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:25,875
Mr. Yin.

501
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:27,975
I’m honored

502
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:30,250
that I went to the same junior high
school with your wife.

503
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:31,725
We had some stories at that time.

504
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,208
I accidentally knew

505
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,708
the contract between you and Miss Gu.

506
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:37,291
I want to help her as much as I can.

507
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,041
It’s you.

508
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:59,041
You recognized me.

509
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:03,975
Mo Zixin.

510
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:05,916
You’re fooling me?

511
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:07,750
I don’t have time for that.

512
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:10,041
I am Nianxi.

513
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,083
Nianxi. Nianxi.

514
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:16,333
Miss Xixi?

515
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:17,541
Correct.

516
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:20,708
Do you still

517
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,750
want me to eat with Xixi?

518
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:24,958
Why did you agree to see me?

519
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:26,000
Because it’s fun.

520
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:27,875
I want

521
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,000
to see your look

522
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:31,458
when you find out I’m Xixi’s idol.

523
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,541
Don’t tell Xixi

524
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,750
about this.

525
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:43,458
Who are you to tell me what to do?

526
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:45,416
I know you.

527
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,625
You want to suddenly show up
in front of Xixi

528
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,708
and fulfill her wish.

529
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,583
You must be up to something.

530
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:52,833
Listen,

531
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,583
don’t do anything that will hurt Xixi.

532
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,250
It’s our business.

533
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:02,916
It’s not your concern.

534
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:06,150
(Fujiwara Select)

535
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,625
Hello, Xiaoya.

536
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:22,375
What’s wrong?

537
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:25,000
Our store will open soon.

538
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,600
Are you not nervous or excited?

539
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:30,250
If I didn’t clean it five times,

540
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,666
confirm the display eight times

541
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
and check
the water and electricity ten times,

542
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,791
I think I should be very excited now.

543
00:24:37,675 --> 00:24:38,666
Yes, yes.

544
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:41,125
You did a lot, Designer Gu.

545
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:43,475
Of course, I’m excited.

546
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,291
Do you know how long
I’ve been thinking about this?

547
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:49,083
I’ve been dreaming about

548
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:50,600
having my own store since middle school.

549
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,225
Now

550
00:24:52,541 --> 00:24:54,416
it’s finally happening.

551
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:56,125
I’m too excited to sleep now.

552
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:58,125
Is your dream

553
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,775
that important to you?

554
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,525
Of course.

555
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:04,583
I’ve been dreaming about

556
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:06,958
having my own store since I was a kid.

557
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,150
So

558
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,583
no matter what happens,

559
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:12,958
I must make it happen.

560
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:28,833
See you at the company in half an hour.

561
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,000
Ask the heads of all departments
to attend the meeting.

562
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:32,708
Let me reiterate it one last time.

563
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:35,833
Alex will arrive next Wednesday.

564
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:38,041
I need the Investment Department

565
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:40,041
to give me a detailed acquisition plan

566
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:41,175
by the end of tomorrow.

567
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:41,975
Amy.

568
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:43,958
Have those artists you found

569
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:44,725
meet me tomorrow.

570
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I want to choose in person.

571
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,850
They are all abroad tomorrow.

572
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:49,083
I’m afraid...

573
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:50,958
Book flights for them now

574
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:52,333
and get them back.

575
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:52,833
Yes.

576
00:26:01,525 --> 00:26:04,075
(Party A requires Gu Xixi
to be the brand manager.)

577
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:07,250
And I need the Purchasing Department

578
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,875
to choose five stores
in the high-end business districts.

579
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,666
Finish it tonight.

580
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:13,291
The preliminary decoration
needs to be completed next Wednesday.

581
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:14,875
By then these five stores

582
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:16,500
will be the concept stores

583
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:17,666
to show Alex.

584
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:19,208
That’s it for the meeting.

585
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:20,333
Okay.

586
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,166
That’s what it is.

587
00:26:24,275 --> 00:26:24,916
Hold on.

588
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:26,958
Let me figure it out.

589
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:30,666
Alex wants you to be in charge of Enjoy?

590
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,875
Oh my God. Oh my God.

591
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:34,333
Am I dreaming?

592
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:36,150
It’s not the point.

593
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,700
The point is

594
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:40,083
we stayed in Milan for so long,

595
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:41,250
but he didn’t tell me.

596
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:43,166
Will you agree to do it?

597
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:45,375
If I agree to do it,

598
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:47,583
I can’t run my own store.

599
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:49,000
So I can’t.

600
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,458
But I think

601
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:52,416
Yin Sichen won’t let you go.

602
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:53,958
You signed a contract to sell yourself.

603
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:55,250
There are a million ways

604
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:56,875
he can do to make you agree.

605
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,291
Maybe Yin Sichen

606
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:02,750
won’t do that.

607
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,833
What about Miss Gu?

608
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,208
I haven’t told her about it.

609
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,375
You haven’t?

610
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,791
I saw her working so hard

611
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:12,200
for her store these days.

612
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:15,083
I can’t ask her

613
00:27:16,475 --> 00:27:17,500
to give up her dream.

614
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:19,125
What about Alex?

615
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:21,850
No one can take it

616
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:23,708
if his proposal is rejected directly.

617
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:26,625
I’ll try my best

618
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:29,375
to provide some alternatives

619
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,125
and tell him the truth
after I get his approval.

620
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,483
By then, it won’t matter

621
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,583
whether Gu Xixi is in this or not.

622
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:37,208
If he insists...

623
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,083
I will let Gu Xixi

624
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:41,375
join in his brand in another way.

625
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:43,750
What if he refuses?

626
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,625
Then I’ll give up.

627
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:53,166
You didn’t give up easily before.

628
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,458
Because there is something

629
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,958
I want more

630
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:02,708
than Alex’s brand in my heart.

631
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:08,416
Never mind.

632
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:09,958
I’ll ask him about it.

633
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:11,725
Fortunately, you found the mail.

634
00:28:11,725 --> 00:28:13,333
Otherwise, you will be sold out
without knowing it.

635
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:14,875
He seems to be back.

636
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:15,750
I’ll hang up first.

637
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:18,083
Gu Xixi.

638
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:18,683
Ah?

639
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:20,000
Don’t read

640
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,291
Nianxi’s comics anymore.

641
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,833
Why?

642
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,208
Come with me.

643
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:30,458
You...

644
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:44,475
Is it

645
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:47,000
a special day today?

646
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:49,958
You’ve been busy
opening a store these days.

647
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:51,791
I guess you haven’t had a good meal.

648
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:53,916
It’s a treat for you.

649
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:55,083
A night snack.

650
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:59,041
Why did you prepare
a candlelight dinner?

651
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,125
You have too many questions.

652
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:03,800
Just eat.

653
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,125
I dare not.

654
00:29:08,541 --> 00:29:10,000
Do you want me

655
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,666
to feed you?

656
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:14,333
No, I’ll eat myself.

657
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:25,041
How are you preparing for the opening?

658
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:26,666
When does it open?

659
00:29:30,041 --> 00:29:30,975
Next Wednesday.

660
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:32,125
Next Wednesday?

661
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:34,375
What’s wrong?

662
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,550
Can you

663
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,166
postpone the opening date?

664
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:47,975
I remember it’s not written
in the contract

665
00:29:47,975 --> 00:29:49,583
that I can’t open a store.

666
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:54,775
Yes.

667
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,416
It’s not written in the contract.

668
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,208
But can you postpone it?

669
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:01,333
Can I ask why?

670
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:08,833
I have some trouble recently.

671
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:10,166
I need to fix it

672
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,583
and it takes some time.

673
00:30:12,708 --> 00:30:14,000
After I solve it,

674
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,750
I will help you with opening the store.

675
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:21,000
But I’ve selected a store

676
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,041
and paid the deposit.

677
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:22,775
I know.

678
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,166
It’s at No. 48, Liuyin Street.

679
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:28,791
The location is not good.

680
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:30,916
Although it has
large passenger flow there,

681
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:33,833
the spending power is low.

682
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,750
And the factory you chose

683
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:38,625
started out making sheets.

684
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,500
They have no experience
in high-end clothing.

685
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:42,333
Don’t worry.

686
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,458
The rent and the deposit

687
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:46,333
are on me.

688
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:58,583
You don’t want me
to open the store, do you?

689
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:00,208
I didn’t mean that.

690
00:31:00,916 --> 00:31:02,458
I just don’t want it to be now.

691
00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:03,708
Isn’t it the same?

692
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:04,416
There is a difference.

693
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:07,458
I support you to open a store,

694
00:31:08,916 --> 00:31:10,458
but it’s not a good time now.

695
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,458
I see.

696
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:19,166
You’ve made your choice.

697
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:24,291
What do you mean?

698
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:26,791
In order to acquire Enjoy,

699
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:29,416
you decided to give up my dream, right?

700
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:34,416
You knew it?

701
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,075
Um.

702
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:38,541
I saw it by accident.

703
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,583
But you’ve

704
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:45,666
made the decision for me.

705
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:48,041
Why are you hiding it from me?

706
00:31:51,925 --> 00:31:53,166
I just think

707
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:54,416
it’s not your responsibility
to take this.

708
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,125
When I knew it,

709
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,583
I didn’t plan to tell you.

710
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:01,875
I can solve it.

711
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:04,000
I just need some time, Gu Xixi.

712
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:06,583
Please trust me.

713
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:14,500
Thank you for the candlelight dinner,

714
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
but I’ll keep my store no matter what.

715
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,125
Xixi!

716
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:34,583
It must be accurate here,

717
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:35,750
and the wrinkles here

718
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:37,041
- should be dealt with meticulously.
- Okay.

719
00:32:37,075 --> 00:32:37,850
No problem.

720
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,000
Wait a minute.

721
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:42,916
Hello, Xiaoya. What’s up?

722
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,150
What?

723
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:45,833
The landlord changed his mind?

724
00:32:47,458 --> 00:32:48,150
Sir.

725
00:32:48,475 --> 00:32:49,075
What’s going on?

726
00:32:49,075 --> 00:32:50,458
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

727
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,875
Someone offered a higher price.

728
00:32:53,725 --> 00:32:54,325
But

729
00:32:54,325 --> 00:32:56,875
I’ve renovated the house

730
00:32:56,916 --> 00:32:58,666
and I’ve paid for the first month.

731
00:32:58,666 --> 00:32:59,666
I’ve paid the deposit.

732
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:01,041
Well,

733
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:01,708
I’ll pay you more

734
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,833
as the price they offered you.

735
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:04,541
It’s Why Mall Group.

736
00:33:04,541 --> 00:33:05,916
They are rich.
You can’t compete with them.

737
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:07,375
Why Mall Group?

738
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:09,541
No, it’s impossible.

739
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,400
Little girl.

740
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:11,625
There are other stores here.

741
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:12,291
Just find another one.

742
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:13,450
I’m sorry.

743
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:15,125
Okay.

744
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:19,950
Hello, Senior.

745
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,000
What’s wrong?

746
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,166
You don’t sound right.

747
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:26,958
I have a little problem here.

748
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:29,041
The landlord of the store I chose

749
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,416
suddenly changed his mind,

750
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:32,166
but I’ve renovated the house

751
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:34,208
and the furniture I ordered
will be delivered tomorrow.

752
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:35,750
I have to find

753
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:37,333
another suitable store today.

754
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:38,958
OK, I’ll hang up first.

755
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:40,083
I need to figure out a solution.

756
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:56,250
These stores
didn’t meet my expectations.

757
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,875
Are there any other options?

758
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,458
Here are some updates

759
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,625
from the agencies.

760
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:02,625
I’ve narrowed it down

761
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:03,925
to three stores that might be suitable.

762
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,000
(Pan’s Barbecue Tianyuan Food Market)
The first one is located

763
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,425
(Qinhong Community Xinsifang Food Plaza)
in a busy business district. The building

764
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:09,208
and the infrastructure are old.

765
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:11,541
The second one

766
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:12,541
has good hardware,

767
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:13,925
but the location is remote.

768
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:15,541
If it’s for commercial use,

769
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:16,625
it may affect the passenger flow.

770
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:18,583
The third one has a good location,

771
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:20,250
and the consumer group is suitable,

772
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:21,541
but the store is relatively small.

773
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:22,500
However,

774
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,041
it’s close to your neighborhood.

775
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:27,075
Okay, let’s take a look over there.

776
00:34:27,075 --> 00:34:27,875
Okay.

777
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:34,166
Hello, Senior.

778
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:35,416
Hey, Xixi.

779
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:38,291
I came to a friend of mine
this afternoon.

780
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:40,166
He has a storefront for rent.

781
00:34:40,325 --> 00:34:41,333
Do you want to come over
and take a look?

782
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:42,166
Really?

783
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:43,208
Okay.

784
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,000
I’ll be there.

785
00:34:44,675 --> 00:34:47,175
(Two days later)

786
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:01,025
Hey.

787
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:02,000
Senior.

788
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:03,916
Senior.

789
00:35:05,525 --> 00:35:08,233
Looks like you are the boss here
from now on.

790
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:10,750
Thank you for introducing this to me.

791
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:12,125
The price is good

792
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:13,125
and it’s well located.

793
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:15,416
It even comes with basic decoration

794
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:16,666
which saves me a lot of trouble.

795
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:18,291
You don’t have to say that.

796
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:20,125
It’s no big deal.

797
00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:22,791
I still need to thank you.

798
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:24,291
This is your store.

799
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,750
I’ve also invested in it,

800
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,500
only a tiny part though.

801
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:30,291
Thanks to your company’s
start-up program,

802
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:32,208
I can open my store as planned.

803
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:33,125
Therefore,

804
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:34,708
I can give you more shares.

805
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:36,600
No need.

806
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:37,916
But you have to promise me

807
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:39,791
to run this store well.

808
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:42,375
Don’t worry. I will manage it well.

809
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:44,250
Mr. Mo, sorry.

810
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,041
We should leave now.

811
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:46,208
There is a conference call later.

812
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:48,875
I’m leaving then.

813
00:35:49,325 --> 00:35:49,958
Remember

814
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,875
to ask me for help

815
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:52,916
if you have any problems.

816
00:35:54,708 --> 00:35:55,416
Bye-bye, Senior.

817
00:35:55,725 --> 00:35:56,375
Bye-bye.

818
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,791
How is the brand research

819
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:24,375
I asked you to do last time?

820
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:25,450
This is

821
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,583
the research result of new brands
in fashion.

822
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:29,500
We looked into twenty brands in total

823
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,875
and we narrowed it down to five.

824
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:32,541
There are two international brands

825
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:33,708
and three domestic brands.

826
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:34,750
Take a look.

827
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:42,416
CICI?

828
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:43,275
Yes.

829
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:44,041
This brand

830
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:45,300
was just an online store at first.

831
00:36:45,416 --> 00:36:46,725
They opened a physical store recently

832
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,442
and they are working with Wenye Group.

833
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,125
It was just officially announced.

834
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,666
And there’s a tip

835
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,200
that Alex chose Gu Xixi
to be the manager.

836
00:36:58,458 --> 00:37:00,500
Alex chose her to be the manager?

837
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:01,041
Yes.

838
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:02,833
My girlfriend is Alex’s assistant.

839
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,850
She said the news is true.

840
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:09,291
How could Alex choose her?

841
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:10,833
If Gu Xixi becomes

842
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:12,275
the manager of Enjoy,

843
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:13,975
Why Mall’s fate

844
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:16,075
will be closely related to her.

845
00:37:16,825 --> 00:37:17,625
I mean,

846
00:37:17,675 --> 00:37:19,208
this woman is good.

847
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:20,900
She actually used such a way

848
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,666
to keep Yin Sichen by her side.

849
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:29,416
Hello, Huahua.

850
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,916
Are you still working on
that social networking site?

851
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,666
I have some news here.
It’s absolutely reliable.

852
00:37:41,541 --> 00:37:42,416
Check the Weibo.

853
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,725
(Trending Topics in Jiangbei
Alex Chose Gu Xixi)

854
00:37:49,775 --> 00:37:50,400
Wait.

855
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,708
Who else knows

856
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:54,833
that Alex chose Gu Xixi

857
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,666
except you and me?

858
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,208
It’s a trade secret.

859
00:37:58,208 --> 00:37:59,083
Before it’s settled,

860
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:00,458
no one else will know it.

861
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:02,291
As for Alex,

862
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:04,000
it was just him
and his assistant that day.

863
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,000
Could it be her?

864
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,208
What is going on?

865
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:22,500
What do you mean?

866
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,041
Don’t you know what you did?

867
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:25,333
What did I do?

868
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,208
(WHY-MALL’s Acquisition of Enjoy
Faces a Crisis of Trust!)

869
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:34,083
Why Mall’s acquisition of Enjoy
faces a crisis of trust.

870
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:36,666
Gu Xixi rejects Alex
for her original brand...

871
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:37,625
All right, stop reading it.

872
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,625
I said I can solve it.

873
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,208
Just give me some time.

874
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:44,541
Why did you do it?

875
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:46,333
You released such news

876
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:48,375
so that you can open your own store.

877
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:50,416
I didn’t do it.

878
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:52,333
I’m not as despicable as you are.

879
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:53,208
I’m despicable?

880
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:54,175
Yes.

881
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:58,041
You can do anything

882
00:38:58,041 --> 00:38:59,875
to make me do what you want.

883
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,250
Thanks to you,

884
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:04,041
I’ve moved my store to a new place.

885
00:39:05,525 --> 00:39:06,291
What did you say?

886
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:08,875
A new place?

887
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:10,083
Don’t you know it?

888
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:12,250
Because you don’t want me
to open a store,

889
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:13,800
you took a cheap shot

890
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,142
to take my store from me.

891
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:16,958
I already knew it.

892
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:18,333
The landlord has told me,

893
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,800
but it’s not important now.

894
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:23,291
I had nothing to do
with the news about Alex.

895
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:24,708
I didn’t do it.

896
00:39:28,791 --> 00:39:30,250
I also want to believe
that you didn’t do it,

897
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:32,791
but I can’t think of anyone except you,

898
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:39,500
and you’re the only one
who’s benefited from this.

899
00:39:41,083 --> 00:39:42,375
Now the whole world knows it.

900
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:44,416
The talented,

901
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:46,291
independent and individual designer,

902
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:47,333
Gu Xixi

903
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:49,208
rejected Alex

904
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:50,916
and established her own brand.

905
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:55,541
Sorry

906
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:57,791
that I can’t live my life

907
00:39:57,833 --> 00:39:58,958
according to your plan.

908
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:02,208
Although I rejected Alex,

909
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:04,208
that’s not something I would do.

910
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:07,083
It’s not your business now, Gu Xixi.

911
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:09,583
