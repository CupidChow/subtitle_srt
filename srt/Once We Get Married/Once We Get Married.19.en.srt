174
00:08:30,915 --> 00:08:32,375
Ruona, let’s cut to the chase.

175
00:08:32,825 --> 00:08:34,041
I already know everything

176
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,166
about your relationship.

177
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,500
You don’t need to hide it.

178
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,166
Please take the card
and the money in it.

179
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,083
Tell me if it’s not enough.

180
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:49,916
Mrs. Shang,

181
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:51,958
are you trying to ask me

182
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,666
to stay away from Shang Ke?

183
00:08:58,708 --> 00:08:59,875
No.

184
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,625
I mean

185
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,083
the absolute opposite.

186
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:08,583
Yes, there are quite some scandals
around my son,

187
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,875
he has dozens of ex-girlfriends,

188
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,000
and he’s simple-minded and naive.

189
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,250
Except that, he’s perfect.

190
00:09:17,175 --> 00:09:20,375
I don’t expect him

191
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,166
to be as considerate as you are.

192
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,333
All I’m hoping is that he can

193
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,750
get married as soon as possible.

194
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,750
If he can marry you,

195
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,666
I’ll wake up laughing in sleep.

196
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:32,916
After marriage,

197
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,791
you can bring your parents over
to live with us.

198
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,250
We have a big house.

199
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,500
How happy it’ll be for a family

200
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,583
to live together!

201
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,583
I’m happy to even think about it.

202
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,791
Mrs. Shang, you’ve planned

203
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,166
for the future?

204
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,291
Yeah.

205
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:50,458
After you get married,

206
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:53,291
you and Shang Ke will have
a boy and a girl.

207
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,458
How happy it will be!

208
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:55,958
When they grow up,

209
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,458
the boy will take care of the business

210
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,041
and the girl will take care of the home.

211
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:00,708
Then you and Shang Ke can...

212
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:01,333
Mrs. Shang,

213
00:10:02,475 --> 00:10:03,541
I don’t

214
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,416
consider marriage for now.

215
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,791
Does what I said offend you?

216
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:11,750
No, not at all.

217
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:13,875
But

218
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,541
Mrs. Shang, I think

219
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,208
it’s between me and Shang Ke.

220
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:17,916
Mrs. Shang, please

221
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,333
let us take care of it ourselves.

222
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:23,291
Have some tea.

223
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,500
I...

224
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,375
What’s wrong with you?

225
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,833
You’re so grumpy. Is something on fire?

226
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:29,708
Did you tell your mom

227
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:30,666
about us?

228
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:33,791
No, I didn’t.

229
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,416
How dare I without your permit?

230
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,083
I swear I didn’t.

231
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,083
She offered a large sum of money

232
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,041
for me to stay by your side.

233
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:42,375
Wait a minute.

234
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,875
She gave you a large sum of money

235
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,625
and told you not to leave me?

236
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:46,541
That’s not right.

237
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,916
In TV works, a girl is paid

238
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,000
- Shang Ke, be serious.
- to leave.

239
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,583
I am serious.

240
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:53,416
I mean

241
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,625
last time when we were kissing here,

242
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:58,625
she saw it.

243
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,375
That’s how she knew.

244
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,541
I... I didn’t tell her.

245
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:21,375
Ruona,

246
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:23,750
forget about the scoring system.

247
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,250
Let’s get married.

248
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:33,750
What did you say?

249
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,791
You can’t keep a lid on it.

250
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,375
They’ll find out sooner or later.

251
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,750
Instead of letting them
tell us what to do,

252
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,708
I think we should take the initiative.

253
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
I really love you.

254
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,416
I don’t want to leave you.

255
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,333
Marry me.

256
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:09,750
Shang Ke,

257
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,416
I...

258
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,375
I don’t want to get married actually.

259
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,500
Why not?

260
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,083
I don’t trust marriage.

261
00:12:25,475 --> 00:12:26,416
When I was a little girl,

262
00:12:27,175 --> 00:12:28,500
my parents were not on good terms.

263
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:29,916
They often quarreled,

264
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,333
and even fought.

265
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,791
It wasn’t until they got divorced

266
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,500
that they both were relieved.

267
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,583
I didn’t understand

268
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,900
why a man and a woman
who didn’t get along

269
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,375
put up with each other.

270
00:12:47,275 --> 00:12:48,067
You know what?

271
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,541
My mom told me later,

272
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:52,833
before they got married,

273
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:55,791
they weren’t like that.

274
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,833
So you’re afraid of
getting married, right?

275
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,666
Mu Ruona,

276
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:11,950
I’m serious.

277
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,291
So am I.

278
00:13:17,575 --> 00:13:18,416
OK.

279
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,750
So tell me,

280
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,583
what is the scoring system for?

281
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,500
Because I know

282
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,125
you will not reach the standard.

283
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,625
Fei’ang, a cup of coffee.

284
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,000
What brings you here?

285
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,992
I can’t find Ruona.

286
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,083
What’s happened?

287
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:50,975
We had a fight.

288
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:54,034
She texted me about going on vacation.

289
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,875
Then her phone is turned off.

290
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,916
Did you

291
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,458
cheat on her

292
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:01,659
which she found out?

293
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,175
I would never do that.

294
00:14:04,225 --> 00:14:06,142
I’m like her shadow.

295
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,333
I wouldn’t have a chance to.

296
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,875
So what happened?

297
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:11,833
I proposed to her.

298
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,375
You proposed?

299
00:14:13,575 --> 00:14:14,200
Yeah.

300
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,916
How did you screw it up?

301
00:14:17,225 --> 00:14:18,416
I didn’t. It was her.

302
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,916
She has gamophobia.

303
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,541
Fear of marriage?

304
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:25,875
Then help me analyze it.

305
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:26,875
Do I still have a chance?

306
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,791
From what I know about Ruona,

307
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
you two are done for.

308
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,125
Hold on.

309
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:38,416
Where are you going?

310
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:40,791
To find her.

311
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:41,958
Sit down.

312
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,750
Can you use your brain?

313
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,125
What’s your first response
to a love obstacle?

314
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,375
Coming to you.

315
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:49,375
That’s what I’m saying.

316
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:50,916
It’s the same with Ruona.

317
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,041
Whether it’s a man or a woman,

318
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,708
when they run into an obstacle in love,

319
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,041
they’ll

320
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,000
talk to someone they trust most.

321
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,458
That’s what you’ll do.

322
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,458
So will Ruona.

323
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,500
That you can’t find her

324
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,916
doesn’t mean
her best friend can’t, either.

325
00:15:11,675 --> 00:15:12,384
I’m sorry.

326
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,000
Ruona?

327
00:15:14,425 --> 00:15:15,333
What are you doing here?

328
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,791
Do you have time

329
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,416
to have a cup of coffee with me?

330
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:21,742
Sure.

331
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,791
So you think Shang Ke
can’t meet the standard?

332
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,300
(Love Scoring System)

333
00:15:37,925 --> 00:15:40,916
He scores 61 in just a month.

334
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:41,708
At this rate,

335
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,875
Shang Ke will definitely pass it.

336
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,208
I know that too.

337
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,666
So,

338
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,541
I chose to run away.

339
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,000
What’s your plan?

340
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,708
Keep running isn’t like what you’ll do.

341
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,458
I thought about it in the last few days.

342
00:15:56,475 --> 00:15:58,791
I want to resign

343
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,750
and go somewhere tranquil.

344
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,333
You can escape

345
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,458
and go somewhere else.

346
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,458
But will the problem

347
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,416
between you and Shang Ke disappear?

348
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,625
If you think it could disappear,

349
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,250
you wouldn’t have come to me.

350
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,075
The fact that you came

351
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,333
implies that you’re not sure

352
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,416
about running away, are you?

353
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,375
You just want to get either of
the two answers from me.

354
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,166
One is the reason to stay,

355
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,625
and the other
the encouragement to leave.

356
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:27,583
Am I right?

357
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:28,708
So?

358
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,166
Are you going to give me the reason

359
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,958
or encouragement?

360
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,375
Forgive me.

361
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,125
I can’t give you either.

362
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:39,625
As your best friend,

363
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,000
I’m going to lend you a little courage.

364
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,708
Maybe that little bit of courage will be

365
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,791
the sword for you to defeat gamophobia.

366
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,125
But Xixi, I want to tell you.

367
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,208
Everyone is independent.

368
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,708
Perhaps your way of life

369
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:00,875
doesn’t work for me.

370
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,416
How can you know if you don’t try?

371
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,208
Do you have any other options now?

372
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:05,583
No.

373
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,208
Then why don’t you try my way?

374
00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:08,408
Look,

375
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,291
no rush to leave in few days.

376
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,916
I’m on call, OK?

377
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,916
What are you planning?

378
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:25,125
Sichen, is your way gonna work?

379
00:17:25,675 --> 00:17:27,133
- Would Ruona...?
- Can you sit down?

380
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,125
Sichen, you’re back.

381
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:30,458
- Can you help me...?
- Xixi.

382
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:31,458
Look, um...

383
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,541
- Ruona, she...
- Stop.

384
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,708
No worries. She’s here.

385
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,409
I guess I was right.

386
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,783
Mu Ruona has gone to you.

387
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,200
Mm-hmm.

388
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,083
Well, how is she now?

389
00:17:45,475 --> 00:17:47,100
Better than you anyway.

390
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,375
That’s good. That’s good.

391
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:53,583
But Xixi,

392
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:56,666
can you ask her out for me?

393
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,583
What are you going to do?

394
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,041
I know she and I are not possible.

395
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,916
But I have to make things clear.

396
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,500
How do you know you and she
are not possible?

397
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,833
He said it.

398
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,375
You consulted him?

399
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,291
First, he doesn’t know women.

400
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,791
Second, he has basically no knowledge

401
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,208
of human feelings.

402
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,583
That’s true.

403
00:18:19,675 --> 00:18:21,458
- Hey, don’t.
- Gu Xixi, what did you say?

404
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,958
Are you saying you have an idea?

405
00:18:25,825 --> 00:18:28,575
What’s not possible you mean?

406
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,250
To be together.

407
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,300
To be together?

408
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:34,791
Do you want to marry her?

409
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:37,916
Marriage?

410
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:39,958
I’ve been

411
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:42,416
thinking about it for the last few days.

412
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:43,833
In fact, I just simply

413
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,666
want to see her
and stay with her every day.

414
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,041
When she’s in danger,

415
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,333
I’ll be the first to protect her.

416
00:18:49,225 --> 00:18:51,291
It doesn’t matter
if we get married or not.

417
00:18:52,575 --> 00:18:54,450
If you say so, it’s possible.

418
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,333
Really?

419
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:56,208
Yeah.

420
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,875
I have a plan

421
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:58,916
that includes both of you.

422
00:18:58,916 --> 00:18:59,666
What plan?

423
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,250
This idea of mine

424
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:07,691
might make you unhappy,

425
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:09,583
or even angry.

426
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,666
Will you try it even so?

427
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,166
If it gives me courage

428
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,375
to face this problem,

429
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,208
then I’ll give it a try.

430
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,300
As for if I will get angry...

431
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,166
Never with you.

432
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,650
I was afraid I’d lose my best friend

433
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,083
after this.

434
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,208
Alright, I can’t go in with you.

435
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:35,583
Promise me.

436
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,625
No matter what happens in there,

437
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:38,416
don’t run away from it.

438
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:39,958
Trust me.

439
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,125
Mm-hmm.

440
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,666
Go ahead. Good luck.

441
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,958
Gu Xixi,

442
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,875
I have gamophobia, not wedding phobia.

443
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:36,958
What are you doing here?

444
00:20:38,175 --> 00:20:39,375
I need to talk to you.

445
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:42,750
Sichen.

446
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:43,525
Hmm?

447
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:44,791
What are you doing?

448
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:46,750
Just watching.

449
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,208
How did you get the surveillance?

450
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,666
It’s peeping.

451
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,750
I’m afraid Shang Ke would screw it.

452
00:20:58,075 --> 00:20:59,041
That’s not an excuse.

453
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,791
It’s so unethical.

454
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,500
Would you like to watch it with me?

455
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,375
Sure.

456
00:21:12,925 --> 00:21:13,791
I’m all ears.

457
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,208
Xixi told me

458
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:17,958
to come to the root of the problem.

459
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:23,333
She asked me to help you
find your courage back.

460
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:26,041
But she doesn’t know

461
00:21:26,575 --> 00:21:28,083
I don’t have any courage myself.

462
00:21:28,775 --> 00:21:29,916
When I proposed to you that day,

463
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,625
I put all my strength into it.

464
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,083
And you turned me down in the end.

465
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,416
So now I have no courage at all.

466
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:41,625
So,

467
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,666
you’re blaming me?

468
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,708
Yes, I am.

469
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,958
You didn’t want to get married.

470
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,958
But you gave me a scoring system.

471
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,375
Your affection wasn’t strong.

472
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,708
But you dated me for the so-called duty.

473
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:56,916
You could...

474
00:22:02,975 --> 00:22:04,333
Is that what you want to tell me?

475
00:22:04,475 --> 00:22:05,416
Wait. What’s going on there?

476
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,666
Why didn’t Shang Ke say
what I told him?

477
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,416
It was my idea.

478
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:11,458
Why?

479
00:22:12,575 --> 00:22:14,166
I thought you said
I didn’t know anything about love.

480
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,666
I admit it.

481
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,041
And

482
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,541
what you asked Shang Ke
to say to Mu Ruona

483
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:20,791
is very touching

484
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,600
and it can soften things off.

485
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,150
Mm-hmm.

486
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,250
But Mu Ruona is the same type as me.

487
00:22:25,425 --> 00:22:26,717
I know her better than you do.

488
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:28,333
Trust me for once.

489
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:34,291
I know you’re in love with me.

490
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:36,750
But you keep avoiding it.

491
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,166
Xixi told me

492
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,291
I scored 60 already.

493
00:22:45,225 --> 00:22:46,333
But you know what?

494
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:48,375
In my scoring system,

495
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:50,833
all you have is 10.

496
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:56,916
Why?

497
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:58,958
Why do I only have ten points?

498
00:22:58,958 --> 00:22:59,916
Your attitude.

499
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:03,875
You’re playing cat and mouse with me.

500
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,666
Ten is a lot for you already!

501
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:06,333
OK.

502
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:09,916
Good. That’s great.

503
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:12,791
In that case,

504
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,416
I can leave without hesitation.

505
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:20,750
What is he waiting for? Go after her.

506
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:21,666
He cannot do that.

507
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:23,750
Or it’d all go south.

508
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:25,875
Listen,

509
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:26,791
if for your reason,

510
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:28,000
my plan ends up a failure,

511
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,916
and my friendship with Mu Ruona

512
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:29,833
is ruined,

513
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:30,875
you’ll be very sorry.

514
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:31,833
Just hang on a little bit.

515
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,500
Look.

516
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:18,666
Well,

517
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:20,916
from now on,

518
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,250
we’ll reset the score.

519
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,708
You mean

520
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:31,375
clear the score out?

521
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,417
Yeah.

522
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,333
From now on,

523
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,541
we reset it.

524
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,250
I agree.

525
00:24:56,575 --> 00:24:57,625
But let me be clear.

526
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:00,000
Even if you score more than 80,

527
00:25:00,675 --> 00:25:03,833
I still might not marry you.

528
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:14,333
It doesn’t matter
if we get married or not.

529
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,916
What matters is

530
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,850
that the man who gives you
a sense of safety

531
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:22,225
must be me.

532
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,250
I love you.

533
00:25:34,175 --> 00:25:35,000
I win.

534
00:25:35,916 --> 00:25:37,666
It’s pure luck.

535
00:25:38,425 --> 00:25:40,217
What’s my reward for winning?

536
00:25:41,425 --> 00:25:42,541
I do

537
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:43,875
have a reward.

538
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:45,333
What is it?

539
00:25:45,975 --> 00:25:48,166
Clean up the auditorium with me.

540
00:25:48,975 --> 00:25:50,433
What kind of reward is that?

541
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:52,250
I rent the auditorium.

542
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,250
We have to clean it up

543
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,625
so that I can return it tomorrow.

544
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,700
Can’t Fei’ang have it done?

545
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,625
I got it.
You just don’t want to be with me.

546
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:01,250
Let’s go.

547
00:26:13,575 --> 00:26:15,375
Shang Ke owes me a great deal for it.

548
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:19,150
He probably has no time for you.

549
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,958
Why can he go have fun with his girl

550
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:23,791
while I’m cleaning up for him?

551
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,583
When you give someone a rose,
your hand has its fragrance.

552
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:30,083
Fragrance?

553
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:32,208
I can smell nothing

554
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:33,083
except for sweat.

555
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:35,625
Don’t you think

556
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,291
it’s full of the fragrance of happiness

557
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,541
even after they’re gone?

558
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,333
Gu Xixi, is our wedding not happy?

559
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:46,416
What do you think?

560
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:48,666
I was forced.

561
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:08,625
Would you like a dance with me?

562
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:12,833
I’m not dancing with you.

563
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:22,625
Gu Xixi,

564
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,916
is our wedding so lame for you?

565
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,166
Absolutely.

566
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:35,750
Then I’ll give you one more chance.

567
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:37,000
Will you marry

568
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
the man in front of you

569
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,833
for richer or for poorer,

570
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:44,333
in sickness and in health?

571
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,458
I will.

572
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,875
Mr. Yin Sichen,

573
00:28:26,725 --> 00:28:28,583
if you’re given another chance,

574
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:31,067
will you marry the gentle, kind,

575
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,666
and intelligent lady,

576
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:36,750
Miss Gu, as your wife?

577
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:45,166
Which Miss Gu are you referring to?

578
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:46,833
I don’t know her.

579
00:28:48,825 --> 00:28:50,075
Gu Xixi.

580
00:28:58,775 --> 00:28:59,567
Hello, Mom.

581
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,625
I’m coming back.

582
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:02,208
What?

583
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,292
You’re coming back?

584
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,000
(Intensive Italian Course)

585
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,700
(Get Started With Learning Italian)

586
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,425
What are you doing?

587
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,250
Aren’t these the books

588
00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:36,708
I gave you before we went to Milan

589
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:38,534
to meet Alex?

590
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:41,750
Why did you get them out?

591
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,817
Does your mom know about us?

592
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,683
She said she was coming back.

593
00:29:50,683 --> 00:29:51,933
Nothing else.

594
00:29:56,175 --> 00:29:57,966
What? Scared?

595
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,208
Not at all.

596
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,442
I just haven’t met her.

597
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:04,791
She’s not some kind of monster.

598
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,625
Besides,

599
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:09,583
I’ll be there for you
if anything goes wrong.

600
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:13,291
What is she like?

601
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:19,150
She was very strict with me
when I was a kid.

602
00:30:20,916 --> 00:30:22,833
No tolerance for mistakes.

603
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:25,666
She arranged everything for me

604
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:27,541
to her likings.

605
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,208
She likes to have everything in control.

606
00:30:31,925 --> 00:30:33,341
But she loves me very much.

607
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,875
So don’t worry.

608
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,433
She loves you, not me.

609
00:30:39,275 --> 00:30:40,817
I’m here.

610
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,291
I’ll always be there for you.

611
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,791
Look,

612
00:30:52,675 --> 00:30:54,675
I’ve made you like me.

613
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:57,583
So I’ll make her like me too, right?

614
00:30:57,583 --> 00:30:58,416
Definitely.

615
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:03,166
By conquering me, you’ve conquered
the whole world.

616
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:07,000
That’s gross.

617
00:31:09,825 --> 00:31:10,450
Don’t worry.

618
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:11,875
Mm-hmm.

619
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,708
Why hasn’t Xixi come down?

620
00:31:18,575 --> 00:31:19,617
I’ll go take a look.

621
00:31:19,725 --> 00:31:20,375
Mm-hmm.

622
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:21,958
If she’s occupied,

623
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:24,041
tell Madam Song to bring the breakfast

624
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:25,125
to her room.

625
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,000
OK.

626
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:32,950
So fat?

627
00:31:50,225 --> 00:31:51,750
I don’t think you’re fat at all.

628
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,041
You scared me.

629
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:57,600
I think you could
even be a little fatter.

630
00:31:58,975 --> 00:31:59,875
Listen,

631
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:00,875
there are two creatures in the world

632
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:02,250
whose abdomen you cannot grope.

633
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:03,666
One is the cat,

634
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:04,916
and the other is me.

635
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,775
Then you’re my cat.

636
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,833
Alright.

637
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,458
Come down to eat with me.

638
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,041
I’m not eating.

639
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:21,625
I had a hard time
having you eat healthily.

640
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,458
And now you’re on a diet?

641
00:32:25,725 --> 00:32:27,975
What kind of power does my mom have?

642
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,667
I can eat fat-free food.

643
00:32:32,675 --> 00:32:34,675
Come downstairs
to have breakfast with me.

644
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Don’t give Madam Song more work.

645
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,333
I’ll watch you eat it

646
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,333
until you finish the last bite.

647
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:42,041
Go.

648
00:32:58,225 --> 00:32:58,933
Um...

649
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:05,500
Did you get another wife behind my back?

650
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:06,375
She...

651
00:33:06,575 --> 00:33:08,416
Is she Gu Xixi?

652
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,833
I’m wondering about it, too.

653
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:14,708
Maybe the etiquette training
has been delayed for too long.

654
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:15,875
She hasn’t gotten out of it.

655
00:33:17,425 --> 00:33:19,083
Don’t look at me.

656
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:20,666
Help yourselves.

657
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:24,125
You...

658
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,333
Use serving chopsticks.

659
00:33:30,725 --> 00:33:32,458
Are you still Gu Xixi?

660
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,625
If not me, then who?

661
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:41,875
Then let me ask you.

662
00:33:42,975 --> 00:33:44,416
Where are my figurines?

663
00:33:44,725 --> 00:33:46,041
They’re hidden in the closet.

664
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,375
They’re not hidden.

665
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:50,500
I put them in the closet for you.

666
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:51,708
That’s all.

667
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,083
Grandma, don’t laugh at me.

668
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:56,291
Well,

669
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:58,500
I love to see you two

670
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,583
quarreling at home.

671
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:06,708
It’ll be great if you have a baby.

672
00:34:10,275 --> 00:34:11,666
Grandma, you’re so right.

673
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:13,375
But this is not something

674
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,150
I can do on my own.

675
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,208
Grandma, look at him.

676
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:19,833
Don’t take his side.

677
00:34:21,916 --> 00:34:22,833
Look at him.

678
00:34:26,425 --> 00:34:27,375
By the way, Sichen.

679
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:29,458
Can you do me a favor?

680
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:31,708
Anything for my wife.

681
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:35,583
I heard your mom likes golf.

682
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:36,750
So I’m thinking

683
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,083
if you can rent a golf course for me

684
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:39,916
so I can practice.

685
00:34:40,775 --> 00:34:41,416
Sure.

686
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,833
I’ll have Fei’ang see to it.

687
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:43,833
You can go practice at any time.

688
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:48,291
I’ve arranged the golf for you.

689
00:34:51,725 --> 00:34:53,433
Should you put

690
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,459
what Grandma said on agenda?

691
00:34:59,325 --> 00:35:01,367
Enjoy the breakfast. I’ve had enough.

692
00:35:01,525 --> 00:35:02,875
Grandma.

693
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:03,916
Go on.

694
00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:09,541
Gu Xixi,

695
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:12,583
you don’t think I’m not trying
hard enough, do you?

696
00:35:15,275 --> 00:35:16,541
I’m full too.

697
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:17,958
Grandma, wait for me.

698
00:35:18,525 --> 00:35:19,200
Hey!

699
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,150
Grandma.

700
00:35:24,525 --> 00:35:25,125
Why...?

701
00:35:25,925 --> 00:35:27,008
Why are you coming down?

702
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:29,291
To have a break.

703
00:35:31,825 --> 00:35:32,534
Allow me.

704
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:37,291
Did Ms. Yang take our offer?

705
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:37,950
No.

706
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:40,750
In my opinion,

707
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,542
we could just accept hers.

708
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,041
You never let up

709
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:47,125
for Yin Sichen.

710
00:35:47,725 --> 00:35:49,083
Why do you go soft on her?

711
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:52,250
She’s different.

712
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:53,583
Different?

713
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:54,791
Well,

714
00:35:55,666 --> 00:35:56,666
you owe her a favor?

715
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,208
How could I owe her anything?

716
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:01,833
I just want to get it over with
and go on a date with you.

717
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,708
I made a reservation

718
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:06,875
at a limited Japanese restaurant
3 weeks ago.

719
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:09,291
Their crispy eel

720
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:10,375
is unbeatable.

721
00:36:10,775 --> 00:36:13,900
Don’t you want to
spend the night with me?

722
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:15,708
Alright.

723
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,166
Ms. Yang.

724
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:22,450
Don’t say anything later.

725
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,500
I’ll take care of her.

726
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,416
Ms. Yang, you’re a real negotiator.

727
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,416
You’ve driven

728
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:34,916
our profit to the bottom.

729
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:36,541
I admire you, Miss Mu.

730
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:38,500
You convinced me in just a few words,

731
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:40,208
and I have to accept your offer.

732
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:43,166
Then let’s hope we work well together.

733
00:36:43,975 --> 00:36:46,083
Happy cooperation. Happy cooperation.

734
00:36:46,416 --> 00:36:47,375
Don’t worry, Ms. Yang.

735
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:49,166
We promise the promotion

736
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:50,750
will be fantastic.

737
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,875
Well, it’s getting late.

738
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:54,208
I’ve arranged someone to drive you back.

739
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:55,041
Let’s say goodbye here.

740
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,450
It’s been long
since the last time we met.

741
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:58,875
Don’t you want to offer me dinner?

742
00:37:00,225 --> 00:37:00,958
I...

743
00:37:02,025 --> 00:37:03,125
You know each other?

744
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,291
She was a client.

745
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,050
Not just a client.

746
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,500
Mr. Shang owes me a huge favor.

747
00:37:11,025 --> 00:37:12,025
What kind of favor?

748
00:37:12,925 --> 00:37:13,875
She and I...

749
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:15,458
It’s private.

750
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:18,375
Is it too much to ask for dinner?

751
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,416
Not at all.

752
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,666
Mr. Shang has booked
a Japanese restaurant.

753
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:23,750
It’s said their crispy eel

754
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:25,041
is delicious.

755
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:26,333
Roasted eel?

756
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:28,291
My favorite. You remember!

757
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:31,333
I... Um...

758
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,333
Sorry, this is my boyfriend.

759
00:37:34,775 --> 00:37:36,375
You like him?

760
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:37,666
I like adorkable men.

761
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:38,791
