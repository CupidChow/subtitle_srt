23
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:41,750
Senior,

24
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,125
don’t bother to help me.

25
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,175
It’ll cause you trouble.

26
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,675
Fine, then.

27
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:49,791
How about this?

28
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:50,916
I’ll go see you tomorrow.

29
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:52,000
Let’s have a discussion.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,541
Thank you.

31
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:55,333
Who were you calling?

32
00:01:58,375 --> 00:01:59,583
Senior Mo. What?

33
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:02,875
You were talking so loudly

34
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:03,958
that even I heard you out there.

35
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:06,666
What makes you so happy?

36
00:02:09,707 --> 00:02:11,275
I suddenly realize that

37
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,082
in this world,

38
00:02:13,082 --> 00:02:14,750
only you’re not sympathetic,

39
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,500
but many other guys
are warm-hearted.

40
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,125
I don’t think good guys

41
00:02:19,832 --> 00:02:21,500
can be warm-hearted without a reason.

42
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,925
Why can’t they?

43
00:02:25,082 --> 00:02:25,750
Are you jealous?

44
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,500
Why do I need to be jealous,

45
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,300
Gu Xixi?

46
00:02:33,775 --> 00:02:34,791
Come out and read to me.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,008
(The 10 Pillars of Wealth)

48
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:56,082
If you want to know all the stories,

49
00:02:56,082 --> 00:02:59,082
you can check my YouTube channel

50
00:02:59,082 --> 00:03:01,550
and check Ak...

51
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,916
Stop. Stop.

52
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,800
So many mistakes in such a short time.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Is it because my staying

54
00:03:07,707 --> 00:03:08,707
makes you nervous?

55
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:11,916
No.

56
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,166
I haven’t read this book before.

57
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:15,582
Let me ask you something.

58
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:20,541
What kind of man am I in your eyes?

59
00:03:27,325 --> 00:03:28,300
Like a durian.

60
00:03:31,707 --> 00:03:33,000
Are you saying I’m stinky?

61
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,125
Yes.

62
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,625
So, every time I see you,

63
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,000
I stay far away.

64
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,416
You have one more chance.

65
00:03:43,075 --> 00:03:44,291
Think about it. Think.

66
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:45,600
Durian,

67
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,457
in terms of price and status,

68
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,875
can be the king of fruit.

69
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,041
It’s as expensive

70
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,375
and high-born as you.

71
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:56,750
But it’s stinky.

72
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,125
And it has many thorns.

73
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,125
And then?

74
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,250
Then...

75
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,475
Look.

76
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:14,082
Once a man accepts the smell of durian,

77
00:04:14,457 --> 00:04:16,833
he’ll love it crazily.

78
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,333
So, whoever likes durian

79
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,875
is crazy about it.

80
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:26,165
Well,

81
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:27,708
do you like durian?

82
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:28,915
I do.

83
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,665
You do?

84
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,540
No, no.

85
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:37,500
Durian is too expensive.

86
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,375
I won’t enjoy it.

87
00:04:38,475 --> 00:04:40,767
I prefer bananas and apples.

88
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,525
Gu Xixi!

89
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,708
What?

90
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,290
I just can’t afford durian.

91
00:04:50,475 --> 00:04:51,750
Shall I continue to read?

92
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:52,958
I’ll move on.

93
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,458
When you want to be rich
to prove you’re not common,

94
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,375
what you need to do is...

95
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:13,875
Madam Song.

96
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:14,450
Mm.

97
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,150
Where’s Gu Xixi?

98
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,290
She went running early in the morning.

99
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,165
Running?

100
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,208
Yeah.

101
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:23,833
She stayed up late last night.

102
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,040
She even came down for food
in the middle of the night.

103
00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:27,775
Wait, Madam Song.

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,708
I want some durian.

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,540
Go buy some for me.

106
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,625
We have apples, pears, and bananas.

107
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,625
I just want some durian.

108
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,625
Fine

109
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:49,150
Senior.

110
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:53,790
What...?

111
00:05:54,415 --> 00:05:55,083
What’s wrong?

112
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:56,415
Here’s the thing.

113
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:57,665
In case Yin Sichen catches me

114
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,040
sneaking out to see you,

115
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,665
I disguised myself.

116
00:06:00,825 --> 00:06:01,375
Wait.

117
00:06:02,665 --> 00:06:03,540
Yin Sichen?

118
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,125
Why are you scared of him catching you?

119
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,250
You have no idea.

120
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,000
Yin Sichen is quite picky.

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,040
If he catches me,

122
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:09,915
he’ll say I violate the contract

123
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:11,325
and deduct my pay.

124
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,375
Violate the contract?

125
00:06:12,475 --> 00:06:13,250
Deduct my pay?

126
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,165
Did...? Did I say that?

127
00:06:22,665 --> 00:06:26,540
It’s just the romance between a couple.

128
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,083
What about the reference
you prepared for me?

129
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:34,250
I’ll go get it for you.

130
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,875
Mr. Yin, may I help you?

131
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:44,708
Have you seen

132
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,125
a young woman running?

133
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,333
No.

134
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,625
Who lives in that villa?

135
00:06:59,075 --> 00:07:00,208
He just moved in.

136
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,375
A Mr. Mo, I guess.

137
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:04,500
Thank you.

138
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,208
You’re welcome.

139
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,625
Thanks.

140
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,915
- Right?
- Go.

141
00:07:50,475 --> 00:07:51,125
Go.

142
00:07:52,425 --> 00:07:53,125
Grandma.

143
00:07:53,575 --> 00:07:54,425
Mm.

144
00:07:54,665 --> 00:07:55,458
Sichen.

145
00:07:55,665 --> 00:07:56,875
Just now in the neighborhood,

146
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,290
I met a crazy woman.

147
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,290
You did? Crazy woman?

148
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,665
What does she look like?

149
00:08:03,725 --> 00:08:04,500
Grandma.

150
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,050
Mm.

151
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,165
Be careful when you go out.

152
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,000
Mm.

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,415
You’d better take care of yourself.

154
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,583
Okay. One.

155
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:17,500
- Right.
- Again.

156
00:08:25,175 --> 00:08:26,000
Come on,

157
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,125
you’ve been pacing around
for ten minutes.

158
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,000
Xiaoya,

159
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:32,958
do you think he found out

160
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,125
that I went to Mo Zixin’s villa?

161
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,208
Is he going to let me pay for it?

162
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,166
Can I afford it before my life ends?

163
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,000
Shouldn’t you worry most

164
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,500
that Yin Sichen will be jealous?

165
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:43,625
Jealous?

166
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,291
That’s impossible, I bet.

167
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,416
First, he looked...

168
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,666
Sharp.

169
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:52,800
Mm.

170
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,125
Then, he gave

171
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,958
an evil smile.

172
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,583
Next,

173
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,458
in his eyes are ridicule,

174
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,750
coolness,

175
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,275
and unconcern.

176
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,416
He said,

177
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:09,958
“You’d better take care of yourself.”

178
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:11,708
Away he went, then.

179
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,166
He hasn’t talked to me yet.

180
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,833
Is he not going to communicate with me

181
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,500
before suing me in the court?

182
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,583
He may have found a lawyer

183
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,000
and listed how many items
I have violated

184
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,625
and how much I have to pay.

185
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:22,666
Xiaoya.

186
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,300
Goodbye, Xiaoya.

187
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,375
I’m leaving today.

188
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:29,916
Calm down.

189
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:30,791
In my opinion,

190
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,750
when you go back home today,

191
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,750
talk to him humbly.

192
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:36,541
As the saying goes,

193
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,250
people don’t slap the smiler.

194
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,000
Right?

195
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,833
Coax him, first.

196
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,625
Use your feminine charm.

197
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,833
You’ve just made a small mistake.

198
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,750
He won’t really sue you

199
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,666
or get a lawyer.

200
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,333
Or he’ll look miserly

201
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,166
and narrow-minded.

202
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,125
A president like him

203
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,175
won’t do that.

204
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,791
But will my charm

205
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,125
work on Yin Sichen?

206
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,125
It will.

207
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:02,166
What shall I do?

208
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,458
Liantai has sent the quota.

209
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,416
It’s much higher than we expected.

210
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,041
They have ambiguous intentions, too.

211
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,250
They delay signing the contract.

212
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,375
I hear Wenye Group
is also contacting them.

213
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,416
I wonder if this is why

214
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,250
they delay...

215
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,125
Wenye Group?

216
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:18,916
Mo Zixin’s company.

217
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:19,625
I get it.

218
00:10:20,775 --> 00:10:21,666
No matter how much we have to pay,

219
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:22,916
we must get the contract with Liantai.

220
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,041
But with such a quota,

221
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,708
we can’t make any profits.

222
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,375
We can’t let Mo Zixin...

223
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,666
...have Liantai’s contract.

224
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,333
Do you hate Mo Zixin?

225
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,083
Feels like you’re against him.

226
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:37,750
No.

227
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:38,541
That looks obvious.

228
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:39,375
Seriously?

229
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,333
It’s all over your face.

230
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:42,541
Humans can’t control love

231
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,416
as they wish.

232
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,375
When you like someone, you do.

233
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,625
When you don’t like someone, you don’t.

234
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,375
Looks that stupidity is contagious.

235
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,291
I nearly acted on impulse
for that stupid woman.

236
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:54,500
No way.

237
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,125
I can’t let it continue.

238
00:10:56,675 --> 00:10:57,291
Fei’ang,

239
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,041
go inform Liantai.

240
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,375
Because they have wasted my time,

241
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,791
we’ll cut 3% off

242
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:04,900
the original offer

243
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,208
as compensation for our time loss.

244
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,166
If they still want cooperation,

245
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,166
show some sincerity.

246
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,833
Otherwise, we won’t ever
cooperate with them again.

247
00:11:13,975 --> 00:11:14,625
Mm.

248
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:17,475
Without expectation,

249
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,958
I won’t be disappointed.

250
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,041
Without love, I won’t feel
the pain of losing her.

251
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:25,375
Gu Xixi is

252
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,375
only a passer-by for three months.

253
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,291
Isn’t she?

254
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,208
I’ll just use my feminine charm.

255
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,000
I won’t be scared.

256
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,458
Sichen, you’re back?

257
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,291
Let me take off your suit.

258
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:12,750
I’ll do it myself.

259
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,875
It’s what I should do.

260
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:19,208
You must be tired.

261
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,583
Take a rest.

262
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,275
Don’t you feel hot
when you’re so close to me?

263
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:36,833
Sichen,

264
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,083
if I’ve made any mistake,

265
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,458
tell me about it.

266
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,458
I’ll correct myself.

267
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,916
Gu Xixi, are you sick?

268
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:50,666
You’re...

269
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,416
Guess.

270
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,208
Sichen,

271
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:04,675
I ate a lot of durian today.

272
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,583
Now you aren’t afraid
of high blood sugar?

273
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:07,625
No, no.

274
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,333
I’ll do some running to balance it.

275
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,416
Running?

276
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,708
Don’t run to someone else’s home.

277
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,958
You think you can run?

278
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,458
I’m doomed.

279
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:18,916
He indeed saw me.

280
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:21,375
Sichen.

281
00:14:22,725 --> 00:14:23,416
Be seated.

282
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,083
You must be tired.

283
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,708
Let me massage you.

284
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:34,625
She can’t be adoring me, can she?

285
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,458
Why doesn’t he respond yet?

286
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:37,291
Can he...?

287
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:37,916
No, no.

288
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:39,083
Absolutely no.

289
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,625
We’re only married by contract.

290
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,625
When it’s over, we’ll break up.

291
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,166
Sichen,

292
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,583
if I have done

293
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,958
something wrong,

294
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,500
please forgive me.

295
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:52,416
Later,

296
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,708
I promise I won’t make any mistakes.

297
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,125
I’ll play the role
of Mrs. Yin responsibly,

298
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,125
as agreed in our contract.

299
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,833
Don’t make me pay the penalty, okay?

300
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:06,541
Gu Xixi,

301
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:08,833
your only duty is

302
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,000
to stay away from me.

303
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,250
Have a clear self-awareness

304
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,500
and don’t have any illusions.

305
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,250
If you have any idea,

306
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:20,791
stop it immediately.

307
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,875
Lin Xiaoya,

308
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,083
what a bad idea you told me!

309
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,791
It didn’t work?

310
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,250
Did you do anything wrong?

311
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:35,208
What did you do?

312
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:37,150
I just acted in pettish,

313
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,600
talked coquettishly,

314
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,083
and massaged him

315
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,375
as you told me.

316
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:44,333
I was...

317
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,333
I was using all my feminine charms.

318
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:48,833
Dude,

319
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,250
you were not using feminine charms.

320
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,333
You were seducing him.

321
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,875
All because of your bad idea!

322
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,041
When I think of

323
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,708
how I flattered him last night,

324
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,541
I think I’m an idiot!

325
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,375
You indeed look like an idiot.

326
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:05,583
However,

327
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:06,750
he was so indifferent.

328
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,291
There can be only one reason.

329
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,250
What reason?

330
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,666
If he’s straight,

331
00:16:14,225 --> 00:16:16,517
he just doesn’t like you.

332
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,041
Doesn’t like me?

333
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:19,541
Right.

334
00:16:22,675 --> 00:16:24,125
There’s nothing I’d like better.

335
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:24,958
Nothing.

336
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:27,500
Sichen,

337
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,375
help me.

338
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,583
Something big happened.

339
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,333
Help me, please.

340
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:33,791
Since Mu Ruona

341
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,916
worked in your company,

342
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,958
you’ve seldom asked me for help.

343
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:38,958
I just...

344
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,125
Have you ever been abandoned

345
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:44,250
by a girl?

346
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:44,875
Speak Chinese.

347
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,208
Here... Here’s a thing.

348
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,166
Ruona and I

349
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,541
met her ex-boyfriend in our company.

350
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,458
Her ex-boyfriend

351
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,583
invited her to his wedding.

352
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:52,375
I went there with her.

353
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,500
I misunderstood them.

354
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,125
Then I went back with Ruona.

355
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,375
Then we had...

356
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,375
She...

357
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:58,625
Get to the point.

358
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,208
I’m stuck in love.

359
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:06,250
Did you also tell her
that you’d have a meeting, walk a dog

360
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,158
or do a SPA?

361
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,583
I didn’t.

362
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,708
She said something to me.

363
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,416
She pretends that didn’t happen.

364
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,200
Can you understand?

365
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,208
Then you should think about

366
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,416
what problem you have.

367
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,150
Seriously?

368
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,666
She said she had no feeling for me.

369
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,166
Now, she’s so cold to me.

370
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,250
She said

371
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,208
nothing happened that night.

372
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,541
Isn’t that good?

373
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,291
You don’t need
to rack your brain to disappear.

374
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,958
But I don’t want to disappear this time.

375
00:17:37,775 --> 00:17:38,416
Forget it.

376
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,500
I don’t think you can help me.

377
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,375
Wait.

378
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,458
I have a question for you.

379
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,125
How can you stop a girl

380
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:47,500
from loving you?

381
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:48,791
That’s easy.

382
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,166
Be romantic with another girl.

383
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:50,875
That’ll do.

384
00:17:51,225 --> 00:17:51,875
All right.

385
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,291
Time to go.

386
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,500
You had an interview
with Miss Ran tonight.

387
00:17:58,675 --> 00:17:59,416
Go.

388
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,916
Hope you’ll realize your dream

389
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:02,833
and get back on the right path.

390
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:03,416
Go ahead.

391
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,541
Xiwei is waiting for you.

392
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:06,291
(V. STUDIO)
You’re often compared

393
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,708
to CEO Mo Zixin

394
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:08,916
of Wenye Group.

395
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,583
What do you think?

396
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:12,750
Mo Zixin?

397
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:13,875
Mm.

398
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,000
I’ve heard about it.

399
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:18,150
It’s said that the shopping website
he established

400
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,291
got the financing within only one year.

401
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,375
Some media say he’s a business talent.

402
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,708
Mo Zixin has good abilities.

403
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,833
As an emerging company,

404
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,375
Wenye Group did a great job.

405
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,708
But behind the rapid growth

406
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:35,875
are many economic bubbles.

407
00:18:36,725 --> 00:18:37,625
Different from him,

408
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,625
Why Mall is a company

409
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,958
focusing on stable development

410
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:43,666
and talks with achievements.

411
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,791
In the past three years
since it was established,

412
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,333
its achievements have increased
by 20 times.

413
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,500
According to you,

414
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,625
Mo Zixin is a business talent.

415
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,625
Then shouldn’t I be a business genius?

416
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:58,916
Right.

417
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,375
You deserve

418
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,333
this title.

419
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,041
Thank you for your time.

420
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:04,208
We’re done.

421
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:05,700
Okay.

422
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,416
My studio has just started.

423
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,916
We’re a bit inconsiderate.

424
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,333
Please understand.

425
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:13,958
You’re not.

426
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,666
The interview went smoothly.

427
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:17,958
By the way,

428
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,500
(CHANEL)
it’s a gift I bought for Granny.

429
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:21,958
There’s a gift for Xixi, too.

430
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,425
Bring the gifts to them for me.

431
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,975
Now that you decide
to start your business,

432
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:29,625
go get it.

433
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:32,275
Come to me if you need any help.

434
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:33,666
I will.

435
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:34,875
Later,

436
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,333
I’ll ask you for a lot of favors.

437
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,416
How is it going

438
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:41,525
with you and Gu Xixi?

439
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:45,916
Not bad.

440
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,600
I met her the other day.

441
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,750
She’s quite straightforward.

442
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,625
We had a problem communicating.

443
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,250
That’s her temper.

444
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,375
She’s always straightforward.

445
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,083
Talk to her more and it’ll be better.

446
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:05,750
You know a lot about her?

447
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,625
The longer I get on with her,

448
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,208
the more I realize that

449
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,416
the understanding I think I have

450
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:14,958
is simply a small part.

451
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,208
She’s like a treasure box.

452
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:21,025
Every day, she surprises me.

453
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,475
Sichen,

454
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:28,875
you like her.

455
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,083
By the way,

456
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,125
Grandma said she missed you.

457
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,333
Do you have time today?

458
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:37,833
Go home with me

459
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,166
and give your gift to her.

460
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:40,875
Why not?

461
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,250
(ifc)
Pay attention to the detail.

462
00:20:45,575 --> 00:20:46,208
Mm.

463
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:46,875
And this part...

464
00:20:47,675 --> 00:20:48,591
Mm. Okay.

465
00:20:49,475 --> 00:20:50,708
Send it to me after you modify it.

466
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:51,208
Okay. I see.

467
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:51,875
Excuse me.

468
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:53,583
Qiqi,

469
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:54,958
go with me.

470
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:03,208
Are you not used to the work?

471
00:21:03,225 --> 00:21:04,150
You can tell me.

472
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,708
I’m not Qiqi.

473
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,083
It doesn’t matter.

474
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,916
If you have any confusion,

475
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,125
come to me in my office.

476
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,250
All right, Mr. Shang.

477
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,950
Everybody, stop and come here.

478
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:31,333
He’s gathering us.

479
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,291
- Here.
- Let’s get there first.

480
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,208
A meeting for you.

481
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:33,900
Be quick.

482
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:34,958
Come on. Come on.

483
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,833
I asked you to gather here

484
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:38,625
so that

485
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:39,958
you could check this report sheet.

486
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,000
Tingting made it.

487
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:43,583
It’s clear and simple

488
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,500
without any unnecessary words.

489
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,791
She’s new here,

490
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,083
but you should all learn

491
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,750
from her attitude at work.

492
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:51,958
Yes. Yes.

493
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:53,625
Who’s Tingting?

494
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:58,791
Xuanxuan?

495
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,075
Tongtong?

496
00:22:01,325 --> 00:22:01,958
Mr. Shang,

497
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,350
I’m Xiaoxin.

498
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,583
And this report sheet.

499
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,750
I just copied it.

500
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,750
It has nice bookbinding, doesn’t it?

501
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,416
Especially the details.

502
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:18,833
Details matter most.

503
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:21,500
She deserves the praise, doesn’t she?

504
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,041
Yes.

505
00:22:24,325 --> 00:22:25,083
Good. Good.

506
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,583
Come to tomorrow’s business talk

507
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:27,600
for auditing.

508
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:28,450
All right.

509
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,541
I’ll be auditing carefully.

510
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:30,791
Goodbye, Mr. Shang.

511
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,541
Check it out without me.

512
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:51,525
We’ve got a guest.

513
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:53,925
Oh.

514
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:58,083
Sichen.

515
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:01,708
Miss Ran?

516
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:05,666
Sichen asked to have a chat with Granny

517
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:07,291
in case she felt bored alone.

518
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:10,333
Grandma went out for fun
with her friends.

519
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:11,333
Don’t you know?

520
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:11,916
I forgot that.

521
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:14,208
It’s okay.

522
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:15,625
Miss Gu,

523
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,791
I brought you a scarf from Paris.

524
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:18,916
Hope you’ll like it.

525
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,083
For me?

526
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:20,775
Mm.

527
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,350
As my apology.

528
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:24,166
Apology?

529
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:25,950
Sichen,

530
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:28,416
what I said to you that day...

531
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:29,291
Don’t take it to heart.

532
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,791
I thought about it carefully

533
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,041
and I regretted it.

534
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:34,916
So, I came

535
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,750
to apologize to Miss Gu, too.

536
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,208
What did you say to him that...?

537
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:40,850
Gu Xixi,

538
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
go get some water for me.

539
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,208
I confessed my love to him.

540
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,150
Oh.

541
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,725
Oh?

542
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,450
Oh.

543
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:20,541
Gu Xixi,

544
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:22,458
where are the masks kept?

545
00:24:24,275 --> 00:24:24,958
I don’t know.

546
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:26,083
I haven’t used any.

547
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:30,000
You get allergic to pollen
at this time of year.

548
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:31,250
Over the years,

549
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,875
I always carry a mask with me.

550
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:34,375
But don’t mind, Xixi.

551
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,850
After all, in the past,

552
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,166
Sichen didn’t have you.

553
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,791
I used to take care of him.

554
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:41,708
But now that you’re with him,

555
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,250
I don’t need to bother anymore, do I?

556
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:45,458
Thank you.

557
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,416
If you excuse me, I’ll leave.

558
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:50,958
Okay.

559
00:25:01,425 --> 00:25:03,625
Do I need to give it to you?

560
00:25:06,275 --> 00:25:07,291
Gu Xixi,

561
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:09,416
another girl confessed to your husband.

562
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,291
And you only said oh?

563
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,750
What else should I say?

564
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,125
Don’t you think you gave yourself away?

565
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,750
I did?

566
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:26,541
Let me explain.

567
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,125
When I said oh,

568
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:29,708
it didn’t simply mean what it meant.

569
00:25:29,916 --> 00:25:31,333
It had many other meanings.

570
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:34,000
It expressed my full trust for you

571
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:36,875
and my scorn for the rival in love.

572
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,166
Even if she confessed to you,

573
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:41,125
I’m still your wife.

574
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:49,708
Gu Xixi, aren’t you
so full of yourself?

575
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:52,458
Should you be jealous at least?

576
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,416
I indeed behaved poorly.

577
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:57,833
What?

578
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,083
I’ll be jealous.

579
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,208
Look.

580
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:10,875
It’s now my exclusive mask.

581
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,333
Childish.

582
00:26:23,825 --> 00:26:25,000
Boss, shall I...

583
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,041
Shall I give the gift to you?

584
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,125
She bought you with only one scarf?

585
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:31,875
You need two at least.

586
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:33,475
One for you and the other for me.

587
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:35,875
However,

588
00:26:36,925 --> 00:26:37,916
you know what?

589
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:40,500
Obviously, Ran Xiwei is
a high-level scheming girl.

590
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:42,250
She showed off in front of you

591
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:43,833
and tried to break

592
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:44,916
your relationship with Yin Sichen.

593
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,666
If I were there,

594
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:49,458
I would take the scarf,

595
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:50,125
crush it on the ground,

596
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:50,850
and said,

597
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,125
“I don’t want this scarf.”

598
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:54,475
That’s a limited edition.

599
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:55,250
It is?

600
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:58,041
I’ll pick it up, then.

601
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,833
- That’s another matter, then.
- Your mouth is watering.

602
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:02,400
Wipe it.

603
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,475
However,

604
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,425
aren’t you jealous at all?

605
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,333
I am.

606
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:08,583
A little bit.

607
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,125
But what can I do?

608
00:27:12,275 --> 00:27:14,325
Ran Xiwei and Yin Sichen

609
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:17,083
have known since they were little.

610
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:18,541
If I didn’t pop out,

611
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:20,550
they might have got married.

612
00:27:21,425 --> 00:27:23,166
There’s no if.

613
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:24,416
You and Yin Sichen

614
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:25,750
have got married.

615
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,000
Whether it’s good luck

616
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,375
or bad luck

617
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:30,666
it’s a heaven-sent fate

618
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:32,575
that has been destined.

619
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:33,208
But,

620
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:36,791
your contract will expire soon.

621
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:38,100
I think

622
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,250
it’s time for you
to think about your future.

623
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,875
In my opinion,

624
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:43,825
Mo Zixin is a good guy.

625
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,050
You may consider being with him.

626
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:47,041
Are you done talking about him?

627
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:55,175
Does Yin Sichen really like me?

628
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,583
Don’t overthink.

629
00:28:37,775 --> 00:28:38,725
Hello, Mr. Shang.

630
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,658
Hello, Mr. Shang.

631
00:28:42,525 --> 00:28:43,250
Have you...?

632
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:45,350
Have you made the sheet
for last quarter?

633
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,625
- How are you going with it?
- Sheet of last quarter?

634
00:28:47,775 --> 00:28:48,275
Right.

635
00:28:48,275 --> 00:28:49,325
The sheet of last quarter.

636
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:49,750
This?

637
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:50,625
It’s okay, I think.

638
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:52,791
The sheet we made...

639
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:55,208
I’ve been too busy.

640
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:56,583
Look, I was busy all around

641
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:57,458
and didn’t even have dinner.

642
00:28:57,458 --> 00:28:59,166
Shall we...?

643
00:28:59,333 --> 00:28:59,958
Mr. Shang,

644
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,041
this is a very important document.

645
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:03,916
Do read it carefully till the end.

646
00:29:05,475 --> 00:29:06,208
Document?

647
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:08,625
What about dinner?

648
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,916
Important document...

649
00:29:16,325 --> 00:29:17,975
(Tsui Wah Restaurant at 8:00 PM tonight)

650
00:29:20,475 --> 00:29:21,000
What’s going on?

651
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,833
No idea.

652
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:23,000
What makes him so thrilled?

653
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,083
Why is Mr. Shang so happy?

654
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,416
This is the internal library

655
00:29:29,416 --> 00:29:30,225
of an economic research institution.

656
00:29:30,825 --> 00:29:32,041
It’s not open to the public.

657
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,250
But,

658
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,041
the boss of this institution
is my friend.

659
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:36,750
So,

660
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,791
feel free to stay

661
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:38,916
and look for whatever you want.

662
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,458
Thank you, Senior.

663
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:42,875
I’m so grateful.

664
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:44,708
Shall I invite you to dinner?

665
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,041
Don’t bother.

666
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,041
But promise me one thing.

667
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,916
I’ll ask for it when I need it.

668
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,416
Don’t worry.

669
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:55,125
I won’t embarrass you.

670
00:29:56,916 --> 00:29:57,916
It’s a deal, then.

671
00:29:58,166 --> 00:29:58,583
All right.

672
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:00,083
Senior,

673
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:02,333
here are so many books.

674
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:03,041
Senior,

675
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:04,791
if you have work to do, go ahead.

676
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:06,041
I’ll look myself.

677
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:07,041
Don’t worry.

678
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:08,833
I don’t have work to do today.

679
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,083
I’ll accompany you

680
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:11,666
and read some books, too.

681
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:13,041
All right.

682
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,750
I’ve found some books for you.

683
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:19,166
I wonder if they’re helpful.

684
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:20,375
This one looks helpful.

685
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:22,458
I’ll take it.

686
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,208
Done.

687
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:30,475
Thank you, Senior.

688
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
(Special thanks to Mo Zixin)
I used special thanks to you.

689
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:38,041
Don’t thank me.

690
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:39,475
You made the efforts yourself.

691
00:30:39,775 --> 00:30:41,208
I didn’t.

692
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:43,583
Done.

693
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,833
Perfect.

694
00:30:57,416 --> 00:30:58,125
Gu Xixi,

695
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:00,041
I’ll show you

who is the real business genius.

697
00:31:21,525 --> 00:31:22,500

Call me Darling at home.

How many times have I told you?

What do you want, Darling?

708

Where are you going?

709
00:32:14,575 --> 00:32:15,458
To see Lin Xiaoya.

710
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,958
What are you holding?

711
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:18,791
Let me see.

713
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:26,083
You made the proposal?

714
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:27,333
Kind of.

715

716
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:31,375
Special thanks to Mo Zixin?

717

He helped me to do the proposal.

What’s the problem?

720
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:46,750
Nice proposal.

721
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,284
Lend it to me.

722
00:32:48,284 --> 00:32:48,884
Ah?

723
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:49,833
What?

724
00:32:50,666 --> 00:32:51,666
Go get the bath water ready.

725
00:32:52,416 --> 00:32:53,833
Don’t you see Madam Song is busy?

726
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,666
I’ll go?

727
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,525
Mm.

728
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,083
Fine.

729
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:11,183
All right. I’ll have a bath.

730
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,208

731
00:33:12,725 --> 00:33:13,375
Mm.

732
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,083
Boss.

733
00:33:15,541 --> 00:33:16,350
My proposal.

734
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,550
Yin Sichen!

735
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:23,666
You can’t do this!

736
00:33:24,175 --> 00:33:26,333
Yin Sichen, don’t push it!

737
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:27,500
Yin Sichen!

738
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,925
Where’s my iPad?

739
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,900
Yin Sichen, you did it deliberately,
didn’t you?

740
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:54,416
What about my proposal?

741
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:56,333
I’ll buy you a new iPad.

I...

743
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,625
Don’t move. Don’t.

744
00:34:10,525 --> 00:34:11,166
You!

745
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:14,333
Don’t move.

746
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:17,925
Go, go, go.

747
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:22,083
Walk slowly.

748
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:36,750
Turn around.

749
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:39,083
Who wants to see your body?

750
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,750
You can ask Mo Zixin
to make one for you again.

751
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,416
He helped, anyway.

752
00:34:57,125 --> 00:34:57,916
He can do it quickly.

753
00:34:58,125 --> 00:34:58,675
Fine.

754
00:34:58,708 --> 00:35:00,125
I’ll go ask him to help.

755
00:35:00,675 --> 00:35:01,291
Stop.

756
00:35:02,025 --> 00:35:02,708
Come back.

757
00:35:10,725 --> 00:35:11,666
I spent my spare time

758
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:12,916
making a proposal for you, too.

759

I said I just spent my spare time.

765

What?

766
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:40,375
How will you thank me?

767
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:45,250
My iPad has cloud backup, right?

768
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:46,916
I may get my proposal back.

769
00:35:46,916 --> 00:35:48,041
Thank you, but I don’t need yours.

770
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,450
You won’t use mine?

771
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,041
It’s free for you.

772
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:52,708
I won’t charge.

773
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:57,166
I prefer to use my proposal

774

775

Could you write special thanks to me?

777
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:12,791
You ruined my proposal

778
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:14,375
and you made one for me.

779
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:17,083
You were just making it up.

780
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,125

783
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,291
Hello?

784
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:28,875
Xixi, bad news.

785
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:31,583
Mo Zixin knew you had a fake marriage.

786
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:34,075
What do I do?

787
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:38,166
What do I do? Did I tell him?

788
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:40,666
I don’t think so.

789
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:44,916
If Xixi knows, I’ll be screwed.

790

791
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:46,958
What’s wrong, Xiaoya?

792
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:48,041
Why are you so flustered
in the early morning?

793
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:49,375
Xiaoya.

794
00:36:49,825 --> 00:36:50,375
Xiaoya?

795
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,083
What happened?

796
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:53,833
I’m sorry to you.

797
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:55,208
It’s okay. Speak calmly.

798

Last night, Mo Zixin and I...

799
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:00,000
Mo Zixin?

800
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,166
I’m sorry

801
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:04,041
for inviting you unexpectedly.

802
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:05,416
Mr. Mo,

803
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:07,458
what do you want me for?

804
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:09,575
Here’s the thing.

805
00:37:10,725 --> 00:37:11,833
You’re Xixi’s friend.

806
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:15,208
There’s something I can’t ask her.

807
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:17,333
Is she in trouble lately?

808
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:19,916
Why did she suddenly marry Yin Sichen?

809
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:21,166
Is there a reason for that?

810
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:27,583
You know what, Mr. Mo?

811
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:28,791
Yin Sichen

812
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,458
isn’t a good guy.

813
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,625
He bullies Xixi every day.

814
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:35,375
He forced her to sign

815
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:36,875
a lot of contracts

816
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:39,041
and always tricks her.

817
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:41,000
Contracts?

818
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,333
What contracts?

819
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:44,041
I mean...

820
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:49,325
Cheers.

821
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:50,583
Let’s keep drinking.

822
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:52,958
Bottom up.

823
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,375
Then you told him everything?

824
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:56,416
No.

825
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:57,958
Maybe I didn’t say anything.

826
00:37:57,958 --> 00:37:59,525
What do you mean maybe?

827
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:01,833
Because I was drunk last night.

828
00:38:02,275 --> 00:38:03,041
Don’t.

829
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:04,208
The phone is quite expensive.

830
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:07,541
I really want to screw you.

831
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:09,583
But before that, I need to make a call.

832
00:38:10,575 --> 00:38:11,291
I’ll deal with you later.

833
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:14,541
Hello.

834
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:15,916
Hello,

835
00:38:15,916 --> 00:38:17,166
I’d like to talk to Mr. Mo.

836
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,625
Miss Gu,

837
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:19,791
I’m sorry,

838
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:22,625
but Mr. Mo is attending a meeting
in W Hotel.

839
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:25,291
Shall I ask him to call you back?

840
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:26,708
Sorry,

841
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,041
but I have an emergency to talk to him.

842
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:29,666
Shall I go wait for him

843
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:31,208
in the lobby of W Hotel?

844
00:38:31,416 --> 00:38:32,666
When the meeting is over
and he comes down,

845
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:33,708
I’ll talk to him for a minute.

846
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:35,525
Because I really have
an emergency, okay?

847
00:38:35,525 --> 00:38:36,458
Okay.

Senior.

850
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,125
Xixi,

851
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:49,541
you came in a hurry.

852
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:50,450
What for?

853
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Did you drink
with Lin Xiaoya last night?

854
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:56,791
Oh, that?

855
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:57,833
Yeah.

856
00:38:58,125 --> 00:38:58,916
Miss Lin...

857
00:38:58,916 --> 00:38:59,833
She was drunk last night.

858
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:02,291
I asked my assistant Yunong
to drive her back home.

859
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:03,166
You don’t need to worry.

860
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:04,958
When she was drunk,

861
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:07,083
did she tell you anything?

862
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:10,750
She told me some funny things
about your college life.

863
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,291
And...

864
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:15,625
And some of your trouble lately.

865
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:18,833
Trouble?

866
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:22,708
Did she say it specifically?

867
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:27,125
The contract between you
and Yin Sichen.

868
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:29,583
Contracts?

869
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:32,125
What contracts?

870
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:43,225
Sichen?

871
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,000
Why are you here?

872
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,000
Gu Xixi,

873
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:49,666
this is my question for you.

874
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:51,416
Why are you here?

875
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:52,958
I... I...

876
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:53,916
Nothing.

877
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,041
Mr. Mo,

878
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,208
are you familiar with my wife?

879
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:00,583
Mr. Yin,

880
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:02,458
I’m honored

881
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:04,916
that your wife and I studied
at the same middle school.

882
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:07,333
For some reason,

883
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:08,500
we met each other some days ago.

884
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,458
So, it can be

885
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:12,083
the destiny between us.

886
00:40:13,425 --> 00:40:14,250
Right.

887
00:40:14,825 --> 00:40:17,250
Mr. Mo was my senior at middle school.

888
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:22,208
Later, because of some hobbies,

889
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:23,500
we became friends.

890
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,041
Today we came here to see...

891
00:40:27,575 --> 00:40:30,791
Comic show. There’s a comic show here.

892
00:40:30,791 --> 00:40:31,625
Comic?

893
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:34,541
What comic can be so great

894
00:40:34,916 --> 00:40:35,916
that you have to enjoy it here?

895
00:40:37,675 --> 00:40:38,350
It’s about...

896
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,333
Gu Xixi, shut up.

897
00:40:41,425 --> 00:40:42,125
Mr. Mo.

898
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:46,208
If you want to see my wife again,

899
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,250
shouldn’t you tell me in advance?

900
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,416
I’m sorry.

901
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,250
But I think Miss Gu

902
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:57,666
can arrange her own schedule.

903
00:40:58,225 --> 00:41:00,583
After all, she’s a free girl,

904
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,625
isn’t she?
