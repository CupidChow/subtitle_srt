=Episode 24=

23
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:46,208
About our contracted marriage...

24
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,250
- I...
- I know what you’re going to say.

25
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,500
When you came to Milan,

26
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:52,208
I could feel your sincerity
of the apology.

27
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,666
If it were a mistake at work

28
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,708
or a dispute on price,

29
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,125
it could be negotiable.

30
00:01:58,791 --> 00:01:59,916
But the point is

31
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:02,291
to cooperate with me,

32
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,000
you made up a lie to deceive me.

33
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,583
If you were me,

34
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:07,625
would you forgive it?

35
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,150
I knew you wouldn’t easily forgive me.

36
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,443
So, I came

37
00:02:13,957 --> 00:02:16,916
to explain to you the whole story.

38
00:02:18,082 --> 00:02:19,416
Back at that time,

39
00:02:19,457 --> 00:02:21,125
I indeed had a fake marriage
with Gu Xixi

40
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,707
so that I would get
the contract of Marry Me.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,207
But I didn’t expect that

42
00:02:27,332 --> 00:02:28,916
she and I would love each other

43
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,416
because of Marry me.

44
00:02:34,225 --> 00:02:35,025
At first,

45
00:02:35,025 --> 00:02:36,875
I only knew you designed Marry Me

46
00:02:37,832 --> 00:02:38,875
for your wife.

47
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,666
But after I fell in love with Gu Xixi,

48
00:02:42,957 --> 00:02:45,332
I finally realized its real meaning.

49
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,832
At the Fashion Celebration,

50
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,825
I recalled how Gu Xixi looked

51
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,375
in a Marry Me dress at our wedding.

52
00:02:57,332 --> 00:02:58,207
She looked gorgeous.

53
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,750
It was then that I realized that

54
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:06,041
Marry Me wasn’t only a commodity,

55
00:03:07,082 --> 00:03:08,875
but also an agreement on love.

56
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,582
So, no matter whether you forgive me,

57
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,691
I hope the love between Xixi and me

58
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,834
can make a contribution to Marry Me.

59
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,750
Sorry, Mr. Yin.

60
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,000
Where’s that lady?

61
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:56,625
She went that way.

62
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:57,884
Thank you.

63
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,916
Yin Sichen,

64
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,416
you must have written bad words
about me.

65
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:15,957
You made a big mistake.

66
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,958
If it were the old me,

67
00:04:22,915 --> 00:04:23,790
I didn’t think

68
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,125
I had anything to say to the future me,

69
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,665
because I had been living
a methodical life every day.

70
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,875
Those wishes were more like

71
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,500
reachable targets to me.

72
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,415
But everything’s different now.

73
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,250
I’m not sure

74
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,583
when the change started.

75
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,375
Maybe,

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,790
because of what happened in Milan.

77
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,415
Or maybe earlier.

78
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:50,875
Anyway,

79
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
I worry about her when she’s lost.

80
00:04:53,915 --> 00:04:55,415
Do you know
how much I worried about you?

81
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,125
I feel my heart hurt when she’s hurt.

82
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,875
I even start to have unrealistic wishes.

83
00:05:04,915 --> 00:05:05,900
I hope the next time

84
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,625
I open the time capsule,

85
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,850
she’s still by my side.

We knew we had a slim chance.

Yeah.

00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,333
We should cherish the happiness
we’re having.

117

00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,125
No.

123
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,208
What am I scared of?

124
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,458
I’ve tried my best, anyway,

125
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:12,975
even if we don’t end up well

126
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,458
or even if we have to pay the price
for the mistake we made.

127
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,583
What if we end up well?

00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,165
If we end up well,

129
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,375
I’ll be grateful.

130
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,250
I’m grateful that
I have such a good wife

131
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,708
who solves the problem for me.

132
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,290
What about you?

133
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:33,415
Are you scared?

134
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,458
I have nothing to be scared of.

135
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,165
I’m already lucky to be with you.

136
00:07:40,665 --> 00:07:42,540
I should be contented.

137
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,750
As long as we’re together,

138
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:46,333
nothing can scare me.

139
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,665
Something important just occurs to me

140
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:54,708
that we haven’t had yet.

141
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:55,790
What is it?

142
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:56,750
The honeymoon.

143
00:07:56,825 --> 00:07:57,475
Mm?

144
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,250
Don’t you realize that
since we got married,

145
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,500
we haven’t had a honeymoon yet?

146
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,200
If this time,

147
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,915
I fail to manage Why Mall,

148
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,915
let’s find a place you like

149
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,775
and enjoy a honeymoon there.

150
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,675
But there are many places I want to go.

151
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,375
Then let’s visit all the places

152
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,915
you want to go.

153
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,275
It won’t interfere with our business.

154
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,125
I didn’t agree.

155
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,925
I didn’t agree.

156
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:40,700
Dear audience,

157
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,083
here we are

158
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,416
at the head office

159
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,916
of China’s famous company Why Mall.

160
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:45,500
Some days ago,

161
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,708
CEO Yin Sichen of Why Mall

162
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,125
- was exposed to having a fake marriage.
- As we know,

163
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:48,708
- this meeting will decide
- We’ll keep...

164
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,250
- the final result of this case.
- ...wild attention.

165
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,583
- Whether Yin Sichen can stay
- The stock price is influenced, too.

166
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,250
- has been the center of attention.
- The situation is not promising.

167
00:08:53,675 --> 00:08:54,333
About the follow-up,

168
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,431
- we’ll keep reporting it.
- Here he comes. Mr. Yin!

169
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,083
Mr. Yin, Mr. Yin!

170
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,750
Answer our questions.

171
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,425
Mr. Yin!

172
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,291
Say something, Mr. Yin!

173
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,291
For this shareholders’ meeting,

174
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,625
do you have any solution?

175
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:06,791
Answer us.

176
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,291
Mr. Yin, Mr. Yin. Mr. Yin!

177
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:10,750
Do you have any predictions

178
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,416
about this shareholders’ meeting?

179
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:13,250
Mr. Yin,

180
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,166
you’ll be dismissed from your post.

181
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,250
Do you have any solution?

182
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,250
What would you like to say?

183
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:18,375
Mr. Yin!

184
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,125
Mr. Yin!

185
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,166
Mr. Yin!

186
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:22,941
Sichen.

187
00:09:22,941 --> 00:09:23,458
Go away!

188
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,500
I’ll always be with you.

189
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:25,200
Okay.

190
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,333
Say something, Mr. Yin!

191
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:29,625
Wait for me.

192
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,166
What solution do you have?

193
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:32,575
Let’s go.

194
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,942
What will you do, Mr. Yin?

195
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,083
Xixi.

196
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:36,675
Go.

197
00:09:49,075 --> 00:09:51,166
You’ve all made your comments.

198
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,150
Anything else to say?

199
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:56,166
Mr. Chen,

200
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,208
I have something to say.

201
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,458
This time,

202
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,208
because of my own problem,

203
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,291
our company has suffered losses.

204
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,166
I feel very sorry.

205
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,125
I’ll be responsible for it

206
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:16,666
and I’ll retrieve the losses
with the best I can do.

207
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,458
No matter what the result is,

208
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,125
I’d like to thank you

209
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,833
for trusting me and supporting me
over the past years.

210
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:33,750
Yeah.

211
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,075
Will Mr. Yin be dismissed?

212
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,583
He hasn’t come out yet?

213
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,833
Could you be quiet for a while?

214
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:39,416
Yeah. It’s taking such a long time.

215
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,750
I’m just worried.

216
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,625
I’m more nervous about him
than about myself.

217
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,166
He’s at the meeting
for such a long time

218
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,250
that it even gets dark

219
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,250
before a result comes out.

220
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,475
Such a shareholders’ meeting

221
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,416
won’t be finished in a short time.

222
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,550
Besides,

223
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,950
Why Mall is in the eye of the storm.

224
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:58,916
Every decision can be crucial.

225
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,416
On Weibo, someone started to vote

226
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,083
for whether Yin Sichen and Gu Xixi

227
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,083
have faked love or true love.

228
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,333
80% of the users voted for true love.

229
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,875
They’re just onlookers.

230
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,041
You don’t understand.

231
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,833
Why Mall’s stock price declined

232
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,750
because of negative comments.

233
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,625
Now, so many people speak for them.

234
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,333
Won’t the situation
take a favorable turn?

235
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,458
This is a good thing.

236
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,708
But it takes some time

237
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,750
to turn public comments into capital.

238
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:23,850
Now,

239
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,125
besides the shareholders at the meeting,

240
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,625
no one can decide
how Yin Sichen will end up,

241
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:29,500
except for...

242
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,416
Alex.

243
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,500
God bless us.

244
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,708
I hope Xixi and Sichen
could get through this.

245
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,375
Sichen is young,

246
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,291
but he’s very experienced.

247
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,333
So, it’s just a problem
of a shareholder.

248
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,475
He’ll be all right. Don’t worry.

249
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,416
We’ve tried our best.

250
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,500
No matter what we get at last,

251
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,250
I’ll share responsibility with Sichen.

252
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,583
I believe

253
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,458
you have your judgments on this case.

254
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,125
Next,

255
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,666
let’s vote by raising hands.

256
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,666
If you want Yin Sichen to be dismissed,

257
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,125
raise your hand.

258
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:15,300
Three votes.

259
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,825
If you want Yin Sichen

260
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,083
to continue his post

261
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,500
as CEO of Why Mall,

262
00:12:21,425 --> 00:12:22,175
raise your hand.

263
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,166
Three to two.

264
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,125
I’m afraid...

265
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:32,900
Mr. Chen,

266
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,625
Mr. Alex hasn’t come yet.

267
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,100
Will his presence

268
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:38,833
really influence the result?

269
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,208
Do you really think

270
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:42,791
Alex will vote for you?

271
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:43,958
To say the least of it,

272
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,416
even if he does,

273
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,083
you’ll only get a draw.

274
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,041
Now that Alex hasn’t come

275
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,150
or asked anyone else to vote for him,

276
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,041
we had to take it as his abstaining.

277
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:57,575
Fine, then.

278
00:12:58,666 --> 00:12:59,333
I declare

279
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:04,800
Yin Sichen will no longer...

280
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:05,825
Please wait a minute.

281
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,325
Sorry, I’m late.

282
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:20,458
I’m glad you’ve come.

283
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,916
We’re having the vote by raising hands.

284
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,250
Three to two.

285
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:26,791
Mr. Alex,

286
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,458
what’s your opinion?

287
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,166
I have only one question.

288
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,025
After Mr. Yin Sichen is dismissed,

289
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,875
who will take over his post?

290
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,916
You don’t need to worry.

291
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,958
There are many talents in Why Mall.

292
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,208
We can have

293
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,166
a new CEO anytime.

294
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
In that case,

295
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,000
my opinion is

296
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,250
to let Yin Sichen still be the CEO.

297
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,000
Are you sure?

298
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:01,875
Don’t forget.

299
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,250
To acquire Marry Me,

300
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:04,666
he even had a fake marriage.

301
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,916
I’m a shareholder of Why Mall

302
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,333
and I have to be responsible for it.

303
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,166
There are many talents in Why Mall.

304
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,791
But there’s only one Yin Sichen.

305
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,475
Up to now,

306
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,708
I’m sure you’ve witnessed

307
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,416
how Mr. Yin reacts
and solves the problem.

308
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,291
The losses Why Mall has suffered

309
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,958
are kept to a minimum
within my cognition.

310
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:35,700
It indicates how capable Mr. Yin is.

311
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,333
He established Why Mall.

312
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,375
I believe no one will
care about it more than he does.

313
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,875
As for Marry Me,

314
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,500
I think it’s a personal problem

315
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,916
between Mr. Yin and me.

316
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,775
You don’t need to waste time on it.

317
00:14:59,125 --> 00:14:59,775
Thank you.

318
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,958
Come on.

319
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,375
It’s not time to celebrate yet.

320
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,833
If you want Yin Sichen

321
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,458
to still be

322
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,416
the CEO of Why Mall,

323
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:11,583
raise your hand.

324
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,000
Three votes.

325
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,083
If you want Yin Sichen to be dismissed,

326
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,375
raise your hand.

327
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,625
There they are!

328
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,708
They’ve got the result.

329
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,125
Come on!

330
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:24,750
Have they made a decision?

331
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,375
Mr. Chen is coming.

332
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:26,250
What’s the result?

333
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:26,750
Yeah.

334
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,458
Mr. Yin is behind him.

335
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,333
We don’t know what the result is.

336
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:29,991
Yeah.

337
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,208
What is the result?

338
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,525
Please tell us something.

339
00:15:34,275 --> 00:15:35,041
Mr. Yin.

340
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,125
Mr. Alex.

341
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:37,958
This way, please.

342
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,425
Mr. Yin. Mr. Yin.

343
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,166
What’s the final decision

344
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:43,791
of the shareholders’ meeting?

345
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:44,750
Could you answer us?

346
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,750
Yeah. Mr. Yin, please say something.

347
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:48,375
Tell us about it.

348
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:48,975
Say something.

349
00:15:48,975 --> 00:15:50,325
Thank you for your concern.

350
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,166
After hours of discussion,

351
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,625
we’ve got a clear result

352
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,041
for this shareholders’ meeting.

353
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,791
The CEO of Why Mall...

354
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,525
...is still me.

355
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,833
That’s awesome! Awesome!

356
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,500
Congratulations, Mr. Yin!

357
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:17,833
Xixi.

358
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:18,750
I knew it.

359
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:31,650
Mr. Alex,

360
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,458
I won’t let you down.

361
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:36,458
Ms. Zheng?

362
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:40,791
I abstain.

363
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,125
So do I.

364
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:45,875
Three to two.

365
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:46,875
I declare

366
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,875
that Yin Sichen isn’t dismissed

367
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,541
and he’ll still be the CEO of Why Mall.

368
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,375
I’ll make Marry Me shine.

369
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:03,583
I believe in your ability.

370
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,025
But you owe my vote

371
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,075
to Miss Gu.

372
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,125
Alex,

373
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,958
sorry to keep disturbing you

374
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:23,916
under such circumstances.

375
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,083
We indeed made a mistake.

376
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,333
I’m making a solemn apology to you.

377
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,291
When I first put on the Marry Me dress,

378
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,300
I didn’t know

379
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,083
the man in front of me

380
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,750
would be the love of my life.

381
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,625
So, the Marry Me dress was

382
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,625
only a well-designed artwork to me.

383
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,625
But after I fell in love
with Yin Sichen,

384
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:46,450
I realized that

385
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:48,416
Marry Me led me

386
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,166
to the palace of love.

387
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,125
It’s not only a wedding dress,

388
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,625
but also the combat uniform
for all brides

389
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:59,600
that makes us braver to get married.

390
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:01,708
So,

391
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,458
no matter what decision
you make at last,

392
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,125
I think I should

393
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,416
tell you what I think of Marry Me.

394
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,416
I’ve mixed my feelings

395
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,875
into the design of Marry Me.

396
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,541
I hope it’ll bring
some different inspirations

397
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,375
to your future design.

398
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:24,708
Mr. Alex,

399
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,208
why?

400
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,500
I was angry because you cheated me

401
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:32,791
and I even wanted to sue Why Mall

402
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:33,708
and get back Marry Me.

403
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:38,125
I actually witnessed

404
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,150
what you did in Milan.

405
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,100
But it didn’t change my mind

406
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:46,075
until

407
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,650
Miss Gu emailed me.

408
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,700
I felt her sincerity.

409
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,625
Through her designs,

410
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,000
I felt your true love.

411
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,525
Love doesn’t deceive anyone.

412
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,250
Anyway,

413
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,416
I’d like to thank you.

414
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,291
Don’t thank me yet.

415
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,450
As compensation,

416
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,583
I’ll consider raising
the price of renewal for Marry Me.

417
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,075
Don’t worry.

418
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,225
We’ll renew the contract as you wish.

419
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,900
Cherish the love between you.

420
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,325
Mm.

421
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:37,700
Thank you.

422
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,100
Let’s go.

423
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,208
The prince and princess

424
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,958
live a happy life ever after.

425
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:55,875
I’m the prince.

426
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,375
And the princess is over there.

427
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,166
What?

428
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:05,125
Where can I get my boyfriend?

429
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,541
Where are the reporters?

430
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,150
(Abstract: In financial management,
evaluating an enterprise...)

431
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,100
Miss Ran,

432
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,416
we’ve received some news.

433
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,166
The case we were working on...

434
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:44,958
Leyi quitted.

435
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:49,750
I see.

436
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,083
Also,

437
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,750
there are some gossips online

438
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,375
about you and Mr. Yin.

439
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,333
They don’t sound pleasant.

440
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,791
Shall I contact some content farms?

441
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:06,291
Don’t bother.

442
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,875
Take the normal process.

443
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,541
All right. I know.

444
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:31,475
It hurts.

445
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,700
Then why did you fight?

446
00:21:35,575 --> 00:21:36,375
If you fight again,

447
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,250
I won’t talk to you.

448
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,175
Because they bullied you.

449
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,150
We’re good friends.

450
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,541
I’d certainly defend you.

451
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,083
Who asked you to defend me?

452
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:44,975
It hurts.

453
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:46,708
Why did you beat me?

454
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,500
Sichen,

455
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,250
I’m sorry.

456
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:55,458
If it weren’t for me,

457
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:56,875
you wouldn’t have been wounded.

458
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,125
It’s not your fault.

459
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,208
They bullied you first.

460
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,125
They should say sorry.

461
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,375
Did I bump into you?

462
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,166
It doesn’t matter.

463
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,125
Take this.

464
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,333
Thank you.

465
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:47,750
By the way,

466
00:22:48,175 --> 00:22:50,458
CICI will be open in a month.

467
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,375
I’ll ask Fei’ang
to email you the details.

468
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,300
All right.

469
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,950
I’ll hold an opening show

470
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,250
to present my new products.

471
00:22:59,125 --> 00:22:59,850
Okay.

472
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,250
I’ll have Fei’ang help you.

473
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:02,825
Don’t bother.

474
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,325
I can handle that.

475
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:08,833
Are you planning something?

476
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:09,600
Yeah.

477
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,208
But I can’t tell you.

478
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:16,583
Keeping a secret from me?

479
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:17,750
Yeah. A secret.

480
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:19,958
Do you want me to punish you?

481
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:22,458
Wanna run?

482
00:23:26,275 --> 00:23:29,950
(A month later)

483
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,875
Are these the clothes
for the presentation?

484
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Some haven’t been presented yet.

485
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,291
Which one is the dress for the finale?

486
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:50,550
Take a guess.

487
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:54,075
Any reward?

488
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:58,166
Nothing.

489
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,666
I’ll have to find it out myself.

490
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,083
I’m still working.

491
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,275
What are we expecting here?

492
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:17,600
I don’t know.

493
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,291
Xixi makes it mysterious.

494
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,708
I don’t even know many details.

495
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,125
She’s been preparing so carefully.

496
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:26,083
She’ll give us a surprise, I guess.

497
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,791
Aren’t you curious about the surprise?

498
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:33,958
I’m waiting to see it.

499
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:36,583
I don’t want to spoil her preparation.

500
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:38,500
All right, then.

501
00:24:40,175 --> 00:24:41,208
Speaking of surprise,

502
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:45,791
I’ve got two tickets

503
00:24:47,025 --> 00:24:48,208
to your idol’s concert.

504
00:24:49,425 --> 00:24:50,066
Would you like it?

505
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:50,708
Yes!

506
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,500
You should at least tell me

507
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:57,958
what kind of proposal Xixi likes.

508
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,666
You’ll propose to Xixi?

509
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:03,625
What are you talking about?

510
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:04,300
Oh.

511
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:06,833
My friend gave me two concert tickets.

512
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:08,625
- I don’t want to go.
- Yes.

513
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:10,125
Give them to Xiaoya, then.

514
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,583
She likes concerts, doesn’t she?

515
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,208
Give them to her.

516
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,150
Mm.

517
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:16,708
Deal.

518
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:28,000
For a proposal,

519
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,583
the atmosphere matters most.

520
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:31,425
You can decorate the proposal scene

521
00:25:31,425 --> 00:25:33,166
in the way Xixi likes.

522
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:34,750
As far as I know,

523
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,416
Xixi likes forget-me-nots best.

524
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:37,791
When you put rows of them,

525
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:39,708
they’ll look fresh and nice.

526
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,125
I’ve ordered a thousand forget-me-nots

527
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,791
from the biggest flower shop
in Jiangbei.

528
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:46,375
They promise to deliver the flowers

529
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:47,333
before dawn on the opening day.

530
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,875
Miss Gu will not find it in advance.

531
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,583
Good.

532
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,000
Hello?

533
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,875
- Have you ordered
- What?

534
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:53,775
a thousand forget-me-nots?

535
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:55,791
A thousand forget-me-nots?

536
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:57,708
No, no, no.

537
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,083
Except for what I ordered,

538
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:01,083
we need no other flowers.

539
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:01,958
Yes.

540
00:26:01,975 --> 00:26:04,075
We’ll use that place alone, right?

541
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:05,916
Fine, fine.

542
00:26:05,916 --> 00:26:07,375
Go confirm it.

543
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:10,659
You ordered flowers?

544
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,300
Ah?

545
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:12,275
I didn’t.

546
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:15,900
Maybe someone booked them
as the opening present.

547
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:18,750
Could it be Sichen?

548
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:20,925
Maybe the flower shop just got it wrong.

549
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:24,125
Have you arranged other parts

550
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,208
for the opening show?

551
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,333
I still need to confirm the band.

552
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:30,875
Band?

553
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:33,300
The one we used to listen to in college.

554
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,416
In the Live House.

555
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,300
Must you invite them?

556
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,225
You love them, don’t you?

557
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:42,000
You even said when we got rich,

558
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,500
we would hire them to sing for us alone.

559
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:51,650
Hello?

560
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,375
Yes.

561
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:55,000
I booked the band to play on the 10th.

562
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:58,275
They’re already booked?

563
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:00,025
I’m going to propose to my wife.

564
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:02,250
She likes your band very much.

565
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:04,291
So, I must have you perform.

566
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:05,375
How about this?

567
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:06,625
I’ll pay more.

568
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,166
He’s rich, so what?

569
00:27:08,166 --> 00:27:09,833
I’ll propose, too.

570
00:27:10,225 --> 00:27:10,850
Well,

571
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:11,583
no matter what price he offers,

572
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:13,500
I’ll double it.

573
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,291
What do you think?

574
00:27:14,291 --> 00:27:15,541
Bid with me?

575
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:17,625
Help me to persuade him

576
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:18,666
not to waste his efforts.

577
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:20,916
I insist on hiring you.

578
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:21,875
How about this?

579
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:24,708
My husband has
a large social relationship.

580
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:26,166
If you come,

581
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:28,416
I’ll recommend you
more performance chances.

582
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,291
Competing on the social relationship?

583
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:32,791
My wife is an emerging designer
in China.

584
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:33,950
How about this?

585
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:36,791
I’ll ask her to design
the costumes for you.

586
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:38,125
Here’s the thing.

587
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,833
We suddenly decide
to have a day off that day.

588
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:40,750
Sorry,

589
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,875
but please get another band.

590
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:43,625
What?

591
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:47,750
Oh, please!

592
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,325
What do we do now?

593
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:51,541
Let’s go check the site.

594
00:27:52,708 --> 00:27:53,500
By then,

595
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:56,000
I want to put up a stage here.

596
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:57,791
When there’s a performance,

597
00:27:57,791 --> 00:27:59,125
the atmosphere will be better.

598
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,000
But didn’t you fail to hire the band?

599
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:04,541
You’ll know.

600
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:11,950
Hello? Sichen.

601
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:18,291
I’m doing pattern making
with Xiaoya in the studio.

602
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:21,500
Dinner?

603
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:22,958
All right. See you at dinner.

604
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:23,583
Okay.

605
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:25,958
She’s doing pattern making.

606
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,333
Ask the workers to move the flowers in.

607
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:28,250
That’s good.

608
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,875
The flowers can be arranged
directly on that day.

609
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:30,950
It’ll save time.

610
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,625
Is that Chen Fei’ang?

611
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:40,708
Why is Yin Sichen also here?

612
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:41,350
Where?

613
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:43,375
I just saw them.

614
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,500
Isn’t she in the pattern maker’s studio?

615
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:50,625
Why is she here?

616
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:52,875
- Xiaoya.
- Mm.

617
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:53,500
Listen carefully.

618
00:28:53,541 --> 00:28:55,166
No matter what, you must cover me

619
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,575
and don’t let them see me.

620
00:28:56,575 --> 00:28:57,250
I’ll go hide.

621
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,416
- But why?
- Nothing.

622
00:28:58,416 --> 00:28:59,291
I gotta go.

623
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,541
Didn’t Lin Xiaoya say Miss Gu

624
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:03,833
was preparing a surprise for you?

625
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:06,083
We can just check
what surprise she’s preparing.

626
00:29:07,425 --> 00:29:08,208
Stay and keep an eye.

627
00:29:08,541 --> 00:29:09,375
I’ll go hide.

628
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:21,550
Be careful.

629
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,208
You!

630
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,500
- You’re keeping something from me.
- You must be keeping something from me.

631
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,208
No matter what you’re doing,

632
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:41,208
I’ve forgiven you.

633
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:42,400
Let’s go.

634
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,075
Xixi.

635
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:46,750
This way.

636
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,425
Sichen,

637
00:29:50,925 --> 00:29:52,208
I miss you so much.

638
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,725
So do I.

639
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:03,000
We’d better go this way.

640
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:13,075
Sichen, let’s...

641
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:20,333
Leave.

642
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:21,958
Proposal...

643
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:23,100
I’ll leave. Come on!

644
00:30:39,425 --> 00:30:40,458
Shall we...?

645
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:42,175
Go this way?

646
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:49,225
They’re quite close.

647
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,875
So, you’re also preparing the proposal?

648
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:54,375
They’re truly of one mind.

649
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:56,500
Who do you think

650
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,750
will manage to propose to the other?

651
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,208
It’s hard to tell.

652
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:07,475
Shall we make a bet?

653
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:19,975
So,

654
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:22,875
all the preparation is almost done.

655
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,875
Don’t worry.

656
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:24,425
Mm.

657
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,475
All right.

658
00:31:25,791 --> 00:31:27,075
Thank you, darling.

659
00:31:35,708 --> 00:31:36,625
What do you want this time?

660
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:40,075
Don’t be nervous.

661
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:41,500
I’m not here for you.

662
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:47,200
Miss Gu,

663
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:49,100
may I have a word with you?

664
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:01,958
Congratulations.

665
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,125
I didn’t expect Alex
to be convinced by you.

666
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:07,041
I underestimated you.

667
00:32:08,916 --> 00:32:10,333
You gained a complete victory.

668
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:11,541
It feels good, doesn’t it?

669
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:15,041
I’d like to thank you for that.

670
00:32:15,916 --> 00:32:17,041
Without you, I wouldn’t know

671
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:18,250
I could be so capable.

672
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:20,300
I guess

673
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:21,708
after I leave,

674
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:24,125
when I can’t meet another girl

675
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:24,916
like you,

676
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:26,850
I’ll be bored.

677
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:30,175
You’re leaving?

678
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,000
Yes.

679
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:34,291
What?

680
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:37,083
You want me to stay
and keep fighting you?

681
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:41,500
Maybe something is destined.

682
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:44,458
No matter how hard I try

683
00:32:45,025 --> 00:32:46,325
or what I do,

684
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:48,458
Sichen will not come back to me.

685
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:52,875
Time to let it go.

686
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:56,700
Xiwei,

687
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:00,083
if you really loved Sichen,

688
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:03,916
you shouldn’t have hurt him like that.

689
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,250
You don’t love him.

690
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:08,208
You’re just being selfish.

691
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:09,958
Selfish?

692
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:11,625
You would rather

693
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,291
take the risk of his failure

694
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:15,125
than accept my offer.

695
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,916
Aren’t you selfish, too?

696
00:33:22,275 --> 00:33:23,166
But in the end,

697
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:25,083
you won everything

698
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:27,166
while I lost everything.

699
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:31,750
But love is love.

700
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:34,708
There are no winnings and losses.

701
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:39,575
Gu Xixi,

702
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:46,250
he’s waiting for you.

703
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:47,541
Off you go.

704
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:01,000
Xiwei,

705
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:03,325
may you be happy.

706
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:10,916
You will find a man

707
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:12,541
who can give you a happy life.

708
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:15,700
Have a nice journey.

709
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:38,958
Sichen,

710
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:42,000
goodbye.

711
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:03,725
Alex.

712
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:04,833
Mr. Alex.

713
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:05,541
Mr. Alex, look this way, please.

714
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:06,208
Look this way.

715
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:07,291
Look at the camera, Mr. Alex.

716
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,208
Mr. Yin.

717
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,000
Mr. Alex,

718
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:13,750
I’m glad that you came
to CICI’s new product show.

719
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:15,050
It’s CICI’s show.

720
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:16,708
I’d certainly come and support it.

721
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,833
Hope you’ll be satisfied

722
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:20,833
with our further cooperation.

723
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:21,850
I will.

724
00:35:22,458 --> 00:35:23,333
Also, I believe

725
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:25,958
this cooperation will be
as good as expected.

726
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,458
This cooperation?

727
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,350
Were you also involved

728
00:35:32,208 --> 00:35:33,291
in this design?

729
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:37,083
Take your seat, please.

730
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:37,833
Please excuse me.

731
00:35:37,833 --> 00:35:38,525
Of course.

732
00:35:38,525 --> 00:35:39,100
Mm.

733
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,125
Fei’ang.

734
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:41,166
Sichen.

735
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:41,775
Grandma.

736
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:42,642
Mm.

737
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:43,875
Dad?

738
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:44,375
Ah.

739
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,125
You’re back!

740
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:46,791
It’s such an important occasion tonight.

741
00:35:47,291 --> 00:35:48,291
I’d certainly come.

742
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:50,700
Fei’ang told us about it.

743
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:53,333
He said you would propose to Xixi

744
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,041
at the end of the fashion show.

745
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,458
We’ll witness it.

746
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:00,625
Is everything ready?

747
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,625
Yes, Grandma.

748
00:36:01,791 --> 00:36:02,458
I’m sure

749
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:04,208
this is the most romantic fashion show
you’ve ever seen.

750
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:06,500
Xixi reserved the best seats for you.

751
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,250
Let me take you there.

752
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:07,775
All right.

753
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,333
Where’s Xixi?

754
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,150
She’s over there.

755
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,333
This suit looks great.

756
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,925
Looks special.

757
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:32,750
Mom,

758
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:35,125
after seeing the dresses Xixi designed,

759
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:36,583
I want to buy them all.

760
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:37,625
The last one looked better.

761
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:38,375
I agree.

762
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:40,083
Xixi told me in advance

763
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:42,416
that these are limited edition.

764
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,208
She has reserved some for us.

765
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:46,625
I love the purple dress best.

766
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,708
Where’s Sichen going?

767

What?

768
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:50,900
He’s going to get changed.

769
00:36:58,041 --> 00:36:58,750
What’s going on?

770
