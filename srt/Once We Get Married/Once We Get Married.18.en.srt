23
00:02:10,975 --> 00:02:12,957
Are we interrupting anything?

24
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,416
Sorry for the intrusion.

25
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:17,075
It’s OK.

26
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:20,118
Mr. Yin was helping me
with the light bulb.

27
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,082
Let’s go home.

28
00:02:24,457 --> 00:02:26,541
We’re working on marketing strategies.

29
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:27,625
Would you like to sit in?

30
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,000
Sure.

31
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,457
OK.

32
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,975
President as SA?

33
00:02:35,975 --> 00:02:36,550
Yeah.

34
00:02:37,475 --> 00:02:38,225
That’s right.

35
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:40,332
By working as your SA,

36
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,725
I can help promote your brand

37
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:42,957
with my popularity.

38
00:02:43,332 --> 00:02:44,875
Think of me as a brand ambassador

39
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,582
or a celebrity endorser.

40
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,250
And the best part is I’m totally free.

41
00:02:50,675 --> 00:02:51,750
That won’t be necessary.

42
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:53,625
I happen to drop by

43
00:02:53,725 --> 00:02:55,725
to discuss the shares with Xixi.

44
00:02:56,707 --> 00:02:58,375
I’m glad you’re here, too,

45
00:02:58,832 --> 00:03:01,125
because I’m buying you out.

46
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:04,332
Fei’ang will negotiate
the details with you.

47
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,957
What makes you think I’d agree to that?

48
00:03:08,332 --> 00:03:10,541
CICI has reached a critical period.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,625
Why Mall is the best choice

50
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,332
for financial support and cooperation.

51
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,832
My company might not be the Fortune 500,

52
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:20,541
but I have enough resources, too.

53
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,125
No worries there, Mr. Yin.

54
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,725
I’m her husband.

55
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,666
Others better stay out of

56
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,291
our family business.

57
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,375
Sometimes,

58
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:32,493
a close friend knows her better

59
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,916
than her so-called husband.

60
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,600
Why do I feel like we’re third wheels?

61
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,200
Me too.

62
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,832
Uh... guys,

63
00:03:44,832 --> 00:03:47,500
take a breath. May I jump in?

64
00:03:48,332 --> 00:03:49,125
Sichen.

65
00:03:49,832 --> 00:03:50,541
Sichen!

66
00:03:54,082 --> 00:03:55,375
Sichen.

67
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:56,791
- Don’t...
- Gu Xixi!

68
00:03:57,575 --> 00:04:00,166
Don’t be like you got money to burn, OK?

69
00:04:00,925 --> 00:04:03,884
I think Zixin has a point.

70
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,541
But...

71
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:09,207
But I think we need

72
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,332
more than one president as SAs.

73
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:13,916
Sichen,

74
00:04:14,425 --> 00:04:16,508
why don’t you join us?

75
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,032
Deal.

76
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:40,000
Don’t you think
I could use a better suit?

77
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,842
How about this one?

78
00:04:48,165 --> 00:04:49,040
How do I look?

79
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,683
Just perfect, Mr. Mo!

80
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:54,708
- That shirt...
- This one it is.

81
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:55,500
I’ll put it on.

82
00:04:59,075 --> 00:05:01,833
That shirt is a bit off.

83
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,708
Xiaoya, bring me the new one, please.

84
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:04,625
OK.

85
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,150
Which tie do you prefer?

86
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:13,165
It’s your call.

87
00:05:14,075 --> 00:05:16,375
A gray suit

88
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,415
could use some color.

89
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,083
Gu Xixi, doesn’t that tie

90
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,625
suit me better?

91
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:25,918
This one?

92
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:26,790
Put it on me.

93
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:41,540
How old are you?

94
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,375
Come on.

95
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,250
Can’t the head of Wenye wear a tie?

96
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,125
I’ll do it myself.

97
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Grow up!

98
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
Act your age!

99
00:06:09,415 --> 00:06:10,208
You big baby!

100
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:24,275
It’s pretty!

101
00:07:24,725 --> 00:07:26,150
Look, it’s their store.

102
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:27,458
I like this one. It’s cute.

103
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,290
You’ll look great in it.

I am!

107
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:38,958
We’re open.

108
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,050
It’s open. The door is open.

109
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:42,950

You first.

114
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,375
I’d like to be the last.

115
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,458
Welcome to CICI.

116
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,915
Welcome.

117
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,225
Hi.

118
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,000
I’m torn among those dresses.

119
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,725
Could you pick one for me?

120
00:08:17,725 --> 00:08:18,300
Yes, please.

121
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,083
Please help us.

122
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,925
- This one matches your skin tone.
- Pick one for me, please!

123
00:08:20,925 --> 00:08:22,083
- But this one shows your curve.
- I’ll take that one.

124
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,083
Sure. Whatever you say.

125
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,625
May I take a photo with you?

126
00:08:24,665 --> 00:08:25,375
No problem.

127
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,583
Make a purchase

128
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:28,458
and you get a photo with me.

129
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,250
I’m buying it.

130
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:29,708
OK.

131
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,958
This is great!

132
00:08:31,415 --> 00:08:33,291
Give them your number, too! Hypocrite!

133
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,416
- Hey, stop looking at him.
- Could you choose one for me?

134
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:35,200
Focus on your work.

135
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,925
Will I look good in this one?

136
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:37,291
Could you take a look?

137
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,625
Young man, the blouse is a bit small.

138
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:40,666
Could you get me a larger one?

139
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,850
That is the largest, ma’am.

140
00:08:41,925 --> 00:08:42,825
What?

141
00:08:43,075 --> 00:08:43,875
Go to the next door.

142
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,083
They sell extra-large clothes.

143
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,125
May I friend you on WeChat?

144
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,375
Of course.

145
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,541
It’s better if you have my number.

146
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:52,708
That way,

147
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:53,583
you can call me

148
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:54,500
if there’s any problem.

149
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,458
OK! Great!

150
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,691
- Young man,
- I got his number!

151
00:08:56,691 --> 00:08:57,708
a little help here.

152
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:58,625
I can’t choose

153
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,083
between these two blouses.

154
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,083
Which one is better?

155
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:01,875
Ma’am,

156
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,791
neither of them suits you.

157
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:04,916
Don’t you feel the clothes here

158
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,333
aren’t for you?

159
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,708
I could use a change of style.

160
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,250
- Alright.
- He’s so hot!

161
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,375
I’ll take both.

162
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,166
What else do you recommend?

163
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:15,450
Hey, it’s my turn.

164
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,875
Can we take a photo together?

165
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,291
- Go ask him.
- Go get it for me.

166
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,208
No photos here.

167
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:20,875
No photos!

168
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:21,458
Just one, please.

169
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,750
He’s your photo guy.

170
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,833
- Go over there.
- Don’t push us away.

171
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:24,833
No photos!

172
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:25,425
Let’s do it. Come on.

173
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:26,875
Don’t be shy, hotshot.

174
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,125
I said no photos!

175
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,083
You can go ask him!

176
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:33,791
There are fans for everyone.

177
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:34,833
He’s so cute!

178
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,625
Mr. Mo sold

179
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:40,833
326 outfits today.

180
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,333
Good job!

181
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,916
You’re a better salesman than I thought.

182
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,041
Your design did most of the work.

183
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,083
Is that a lot?

184
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,675
You haven’t seen it!

185
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:52,375
Huh? See what?

186
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:56,666
Unfortunately,

187
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,750
someone only sold 134.

188
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:00,625
Less than half of Mr. Mo’s.

189
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:01,934
No way!

190
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,075
(Yin Sichen sold 134.
Mo Zixin sold 326.)

191
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,333
Wait for it.

192
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,958
Tomorrow, I’m gonna show you

193
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,666
what I’m capable of!

194
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,125
Are you busy?

195
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,500
Have some snacks.

196
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:30,916
Put the tray down.

197
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,166
Don’t drool over me.

198
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,875
Taste it.

199
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,125
I made everything myself.

200
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,833
Thank you for everything.

201
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,000
Don’t thank me.

202
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,291
Thank Mo Zixin.

203
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,750
Are you jealous?

204
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:01,625
Of course not!

205
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:03,750
Mo Zixin is nothing

206
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,083
compared with me.

207
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,166
If you aren’t hungry,

208
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,833
I’ll take the snacks away.

209
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,416
You already made them.

210
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,291
It’s wrong to waste food.

211
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,333
Look, don’t be too serious.

212
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,208
That President as SA thing

213
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,666
is only a stunt.

214
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,041
It’s OK if you lose.

215
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,083
I said I’d help you

216
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,458
and I’d do my best.

217
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,333
I’ve never lost to anyone,

218
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,166
let alone a rival in love!

219
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:37,791
Don’t stay up too late.

220
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:38,625
I’m going to bed.

221
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:39,475
Sure.

222
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,742
Does this one suit me?

223
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,125
If you ask me,

224
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,166
the shape and the design

225
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,541
are tailor-made for you.

226
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,541
OK.

227
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,625
Hey,

228
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:58,333
my turn!

229
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,458
What about this one?

230
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,291
OK. I’ll take a look.

231
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,291
One at a time, everyone.

232
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,125
Be patient.

233
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:02,791
Line up, please.

234
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:05,625
Both of them are perfect for you.

235
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,291
But they’re practically the same.

236
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,750
One for home

237
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,750
and one for office.

238
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:10,666
It’s good to have a spare one.

239
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:11,958
I’ll take both then.

240
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,275
May I take a photo?

241
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:16,875
He’s so cute!

242
00:12:17,025 --> 00:12:19,025
Smoking hot!

243
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,916
Xiaoya, give her the bill.

244
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:25,250
My turn, my turn! I want a photo, too.

245
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:25,875
Hello?

246
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,041
Let’s take a photo together.

247
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:35,166
Mo Zixin’s total number is 356.

248
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:40,258
Yin Sichen’s total number is...

249
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,833
357!

250
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,875
Wow!

251
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,083
See?

252
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,541
I won eventually.

253
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:53,541
Congratulations, Mr. Yin.

254
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,208
No offense,

255
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,750
but I won that last business project.

256
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,675
None taken.

257
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,708
At least, I sold more clothes for Xixi.

258
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,458
Oh, my God!

259
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,125
We’ve never sold
hundreds of clothes in one day

260
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,300
since the opening.

261
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:06,975
That’s true.

262
00:13:06,975 --> 00:13:07,666
Boss,

263
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,416
we should celebrate!

264
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,200
Totally! And I’ve decided...

265
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,333
To give me a raise?

266
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,583
To buy you all dinner.

267
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:17,708
Fine.

268
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,333
What’s up?

269
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,583
I need the money back from a dress

270
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:27,875
I paid to put under Yin Sichen’s name.

271
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:30,791
You...

272
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,925
You cheated to help him win?

273
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,375
He’s a sore loser.

274
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,858
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

275
00:13:40,858 --> 00:13:41,750
Cheers!

276
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,992
First off,

277
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:51,000
I’m so glad that CICI is booming.

278
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,291
I promise that
your interest and dividend

279
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,833
will be paid in full.

280
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,458
- We’re gonna be rich soon!
- Mr. Mo,

281
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,000
I’d like to toast you.

282
00:13:59,475 --> 00:14:00,150
I hope so.

283
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,575
Thank you for helping my wife,

284
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,200
Gu Xixi.

285
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:06,458
You’re welcome.

286
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,125
I’m doing so

287
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,083
because we’re friends.

288
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,666
Be that as it may,

289
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,000
as her husband,

290
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,708
I’m obliged to you on her behalf.

291
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,875
That said,

292

when it comes to a day

293
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,833

00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,166
I won’t back down.

Me neither.

296
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,875
Now that we have our own studio

297
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,666
and the rent is affordable,

298

Aren’t you looking into Gu Xixi?

347
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,616
I have some information.

348
00:17:09,925 --> 00:17:11,825
(Creative Writing
Name: Gu Xixi Class: Class 4, Grade 1)

349
00:17:15,725 --> 00:17:16,666
They’re all you got?

350
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:17,708
Are they not enough?

351
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,541
Oh, I almost forgot about this.

352
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,250
I asked Gu Jiaqiang for this notebook

353
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,291
simply because of its cute cover,

354
00:17:24,325 --> 00:17:26,783
but turns out, it’s Gu Xixi’s old diary.

355
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,783
(April 27 Rain Giving out fliers.)

356
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:34,425
(April 29 Sunny Is the only way
to be rich is to marry a rich man?)

357
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,500
Nice to meet you. This way, please.

358
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,416
What happened?

359
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,375
Xixi.

360
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,000
Xixi?

361
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,333
Where is she?

362
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,833
Are you OK, Xixi?

363
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:04,958
Don’t scare me!

364
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:08,833
Xiaoya,

365
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,858
I’m doomed!

366
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,958
What’s wrong? Talk to me!

367
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,791
I can’t draw anything.

368
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:17,875
You scared the hell out of me!

369
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,750
I was sitting there

370
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,375
for three hours,

371
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,000
but nothing came out.

372
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,025
That never happened before!

373
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,708
Listen,

374
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,666
it’s common for brainworkers

375
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,208
to get stuck.

376
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,208
You’ll get through it soon.

377
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,000
No, it’s not like that!

378
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,250
This time is different.

379
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,475
I scrawled crap!

380
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,541
But we’re supposed to launch

381
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,250
a new collection next month, aren’t we?

382
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,000
What will happen to CICI?

383
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,041
Yeah.

384
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:44,916
What to do?

385
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,125
Don’t panic.

386
00:18:47,175 --> 00:18:48,791
You’re having rough days.

387
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,083
I’m sure we’ll figure something out.

388
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,675
Relax. Everything will be fine.

389
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:58,958
Zixin,

390
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,833
I’ve got a serious problem.

391
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,500
Tell me about it.

392
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,541
I wonder if it happened to you

393
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:13,850
when drawing cartoons.

394
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,458
It’s like a challenge,

395
00:20:16,225 --> 00:20:17,791
or more so like a fantasy.

396
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,541
Everyone around you said

397
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,708
it’d be impossible to succeed,

398
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,083
but you wouldn’t give up

399
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,208
whatsoever.

400
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,250
You’d do everything you could

401
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,875
to get close to the finish line.

402
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:30,916
Even one step would make a difference.

403
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:35,500
Yeah.

404
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,500
It happens to me all the time.

405
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,500
I guess things don’t always go our way.

406
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,250
Are we

407
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,458
talking about the same thing?

408
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,458
Is it about Yin Sichen?

409
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:51,791
No.

410
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,633
It’s about my design. I’m stuck.

411
00:20:56,025 --> 00:20:57,983
We’re launching a new collection,

412
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,300
but my mind is a blank.

413
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,958
Xiaoya did say

414
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,000
that we could

415
00:21:05,325 --> 00:21:06,950
hire another designer, though.

416
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,041
Are you on board with her idea?

417
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,083
No.

418
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,975
CICI is my brand.

419
00:21:14,475 --> 00:21:16,559
I can’t pin all my hopes on others.

420
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:18,958
CICI

421
00:21:19,575 --> 00:21:21,992
is far away from being perfect,

422
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,708
but I’d like to

423
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,250
grow with her.

424
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,291
I understand.

425
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,084
By the way,

426
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,691
the Art Center is having
an exhibition this weekend.

427
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,367
They say it’s incredibly big

428
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,709
with paintings rarely seen.

429
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,416
I can’t help you much

430
00:21:45,025 --> 00:21:46,333
with your problem,

431
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,166
but I believe

432
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:51,217
Gu Xixi isn’t a quitter

433
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:53,791
even if you’re playing against yourself.

434
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,291
Thank you, Zixin.

435
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:56,675
Enough about that.

436
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:57,633
Let’s eat.

437
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,600
OK.

438
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:04,800
It’s me.

439
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,725
I’m holding an art exhibition

440
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,041
this weekend at the Art Center.

441
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,958
Whatever it takes,

442
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:13,500
just get it done.

443
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:20,000
Those details are amazing.

444
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:20,666
They are.

445
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:23,166
This one got a great impact.

446
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,166
I agree. It’s my favorite, too.

447
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:25,958
Look here.

448
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:31,625
Xixi, what do you think?

449
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,416
Do those paintings give you any ideas?

450
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,250
Yeah.

451
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,958
Don’t feel pressured.

452
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,375
Think of this as a walk.

453
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:43,333
Mr. Mo.

454
00:22:43,675 --> 00:22:44,175
Hello.

455
00:22:44,175 --> 00:22:44,950
Check this out.

456
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,425
- Long time no see.
- Indeed.

457
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,791
Let me introduce you to each other.

458
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,700
This is

459
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,375
Mr. Wang Bo, an art critic.

460
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:51,550
This is Gu Xixi.

461
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,175
Nice to meet you.

462
00:22:52,175 --> 00:22:52,916
It’s a pleasure.

463
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:55,125
Mr. Mo, you don’t usually
come to art exhibitions.

464
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,450
Something about this one
must’ve interested you.

465
00:22:58,041 --> 00:22:59,208
I’m a businessman.

466
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,791
Art is beyond my level of appreciation.

467
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:02,541
I’d rather not embarrass myself here.

468
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,250
You’re being too modest, Mr. Mo.

469
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:06,708
Everyone in the city knows

470
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:07,500
your private collection alone

471
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,958
can hold up an exhibition.

472
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:11,708
Speaking of which,

473
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,791
this one is a waste of your time.

474
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:17,583
How so?

475
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,958
As big as it seems,

476
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,208
the quality of works varies.

477
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,125
Few can be considered excellent.

478
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:25,292
Well,

479
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:27,791
this is one of them.

480
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,075
Bold colors,

481
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:32,416
distinct layers and the strong impact

482
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,125
make it a masterpiece.

483
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
On the contrary,

484
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,541
those around it are subpar.

485
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I like

486
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,750
the one next to it.

487
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:45,875
As unripe as it is,

488
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:49,541
it shows a surprisingly strong vitality.

489
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,250
That might be true,

490
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,291
but the brushwork,

491
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,500
colors, lines and the composition

492
00:23:55,575 --> 00:23:57,375
are a mess.

493
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,833
Most importantly,

494
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:00,583
it’s not even inscribed.

495
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:01,541
Meaning whoever did it

496
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,375
is most likely a nobody.

497
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:04,375
It’s valueless.

498
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:06,625
Still, it speaks to me.

499
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,041
We have different tastes.

500
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:10,333
And I don’t think

501
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:11,625
the value of a painting

502
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,708
should depend on its painter.

503
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,250
Miss Gu,

504
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,666
you seem to know a lot about art.

505
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:19,333
Not exactly.

506
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,125
That’s just my opinion.

507
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:23,250
How are you today?

508
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,958
I’m responsible for this exhibition.

509
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:27,291
How can I help you?

510
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:30,833
Is that painting in the auction?

511
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,125
I’m sorry, Miss.

512
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:34,000
It belongs to a private collector

513
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:37,125
who lent it to us for the exhibition.

514
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:38,916
It’s not for sale.

515
00:24:40,425 --> 00:24:41,541
May I ask

516
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:42,833
who the collector is?

517
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,208
Uh...

518
00:24:44,225 --> 00:24:44,933
It’s me.

519
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,500
Mr. Mo,

520
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:49,541
I need him

521
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:51,500
for something else.

522
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,125
Please excuse me.

523
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:52,625
Sure.

524
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:54,875
Let’s talk over there.

525
00:24:56,666 --> 00:25:00,041
So you own that painting!

526
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,041
Why didn’t you say anything

527
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,541
when I went on and on about it?

528
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:04,791
I found it

529
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:07,458
at the graduation exhibition
of the Academy of Art.

530
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:08,833
After all these years,

531
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,291
you’re the only one
who truly understands it.

532
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:11,750
That’s too nice of you to say that.

533
00:25:11,825 --> 00:25:13,250
I only had a few random thoughts.

534
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:14,375
Gu Xixi?

535
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:17,750
What’s she doing with Mo Zixin?

536
00:25:28,575 --> 00:25:30,458
Zixin, I’m sorry

537
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:32,416
that I’ve taken up too much of your time

538
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:34,125
from work.

539
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,725
“Sorry”, “thank you”,

540
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,084
“I apologize”.

541
00:25:40,725 --> 00:25:42,891
Those are the words
I don’t wanna hear from you again.

542
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,783
Friends don’t need such politeness.

543
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,075
You’re right about one thing, though.

544
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,750
We only have so much time and energy,

545
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:51,666
so I’d rather spend it

546
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:53,416
on people I care.

547
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:55,541
Zixin,

548
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:58,250
I know you’re a good friend,

549
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,000
but I can’t take advantage of you.

550
00:26:01,225 --> 00:26:02,267
So dinner is on me, OK?

551
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,900
OK, got it.

552
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:05,983
Mr. Mo,

553
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:08,333
that painting in the exhibition

554
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:09,541
has been delivered to
Miss Gu’s store as you requested.

555
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,375
I know you like it,

556
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:13,125
so I want you to have it.

557
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:16,083
That empty wall in your store

558
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:17,625
is perfect for that painting.

559
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,541
I can’t take it.

560
00:26:21,425 --> 00:26:22,208
Why?

561
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,625
You don’t like it?

562
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,541
Or it’s a student’s work,

563
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:28,708
and you think it’s not good enough...?

564
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:29,600
No.

565
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,517
It’s just that

566
00:26:32,275 --> 00:26:34,275
you discovered that painting.

567
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,875
You know it better

568
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:36,750
and you cherish it more than me.

569
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:38,458
I don’t think I deserve it.

570
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:39,333
Besides,

571
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:41,708
that empty wall

572
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,875
has already belonged to Yin Sichen.

573
00:26:43,925 --> 00:26:45,541
He said he’d decorate it.

574
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,083
Thank you, Zixin.

575
00:26:47,525 --> 00:26:48,458
And sorry.

576
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:49,291
No need.

577
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,725
I’ll take you back.

578
00:26:50,725 --> 00:26:51,275
Thanks.

579
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,375
Why Mall and V. Studio’s cooperation

580
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:58,458
is also important to us.

581
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,333
Let’s keep each other updated.

582
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:02,666
I’ll have Fei’ang keep a close eye, too.

583
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:03,875
Great.

584
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:05,166
Let’s have dinner together.

585
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:06,541
No, thanks.

586
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,208
I’m heading back to the office. See you.

587
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:09,500
Sichen.

588
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:10,625
Yeah?

589
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,333
This morning,

590
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:13,950
I saw Miss Gu at the art exhibition.

591
00:27:14,025 --> 00:27:15,475
She was with Mo Zixin.

592
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,500
Art Exhibition?

593
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,791
I don’t think there is one this month.

594
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:23,125
It’s private.

595
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:24,875
I learned it from the inside.

596
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:26,250
According to my source,

597
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,242
Mo Zixin asked for it out of the blue.

598
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,833
I also heard Miss Gu saying

599
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:32,541
she got stuck and needed inspiration.

600
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,725
Did she say that?

601
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,550
Yeah.

602
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:39,416
No wonder she wasn’t herself lately.

603
00:27:40,175 --> 00:27:42,758
How come she didn’t say anything to me?

604
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,458
Miss Gu

605
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:46,166
and Mo Zixin seem pretty close.

606
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,008
It’s OK for them to go there together.

607
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:50,625
Mo Zixin!

608
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,666
I see. Thanks for telling me.

609
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:02,791
Xixi.

610
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,916
Sichen.

611
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:04,958
Come with me.

612
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:05,958
Where to?

613
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,125
You’ll find out.

614
00:28:10,175 --> 00:28:11,416
Xixi, Xixi,

615
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:12,416
I found that outfit!

616
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,083
Where is she?

617
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,208
Amusement park?

618
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,750
Not just that.

619
00:28:31,958 --> 00:28:33,625
It’s also a creativity booster.

620
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,333
You’re running out of ideas, aren’t you?

621
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:36,708
The release of dopamine

622
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:38,375
can stimulate you to draw better.

623
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:41,833
It’s much more useful
than some exhibition.

624
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,375
Are you jealous?

625
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,208
Yeah!

626
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:47,083
Why didn’t you deny it like before?

627
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:49,900
You don’t wanna mess with a jealous man.

I love taking care of you.

691
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:05,083
Giving

692
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:09,075
is better than taking and demanding.

693
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:26,100
Mr. Yin...

694
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:29,900
- Is she still in there?
- Give me that.

695
00:32:31,225 --> 00:32:32,791
She skipped dinner.

696
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:34,875
I’m worried about her.

697
00:32:37,425 --> 00:32:40,875
I can make her some snacks.

698
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,625
No, thanks.

699
00:32:41,925 --> 00:32:42,666
I’ll take it from here.

Good night.

701

Good night.

702

Take a break and eat.

You can’t work on an empty stomach

704

however you’re inspired.

705
00:33:10,825 --> 00:33:12,908
Inspirations don’t come easy.

706
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:15,125
Your way of climbing worked actually.

707
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:16,791
I keep getting ideas

708
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,284
and I must draw them out.

709
00:33:21,275 --> 00:33:23,125
Take a bite

710
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:25,375
and enjoy our moment together.

711
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:30,541
Fine. Master Gu is too busy.

712
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:32,291
I’ll leave you alone.

713
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:44,500
Don’t move. I’ll get it.

714
00:33:47,575 --> 00:33:48,375
Thanks.

715
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:57,541
I’m going to bed.

716
00:33:58,208 --> 00:33:58,916
Sweet dream.

717
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,900
The procedure shall stick to this plan.

718
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,375
Yes.

719
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:02,941
Got it.

720
00:35:02,941 --> 00:35:03,425
OK.

721
00:35:06,525 --> 00:35:07,317
Fei’ang.

722
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:09,125
What brings you here?

723
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:11,125
Sichen has updated the plan

724
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:12,333
and asked me to go through it with you.

725
00:35:13,416 --> 00:35:14,875
Why didn’t he come?

726
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:18,158
He’s... occupied.

727
00:35:20,175 --> 00:35:21,000
Fine.

728
00:35:23,225 --> 00:35:24,392
A surprise?

729
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:26,667
What are the fireworks for?

730
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:27,833
About that...

731
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:32,791
I guess Sichen’s making it up to Xixi.

732
00:35:33,666 --> 00:35:34,458
Right?

733
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:38,125
OK, got it.

734
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:47,817
Now that Sichen has found his love,

735
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,075
you should let go of your obsession.

736
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:52,625
I know.

737
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,291
He’s my friend.

738
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:56,125
I’ll make his Fashion Celebration

739
00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:57,791
the event of the year.

740
00:35:58,325 --> 00:35:59,992
See you around.

741
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:00,900

OK.

748
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:38,775
Is that correct?

749
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,625
Go get it done.

to be played later?

753
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,291
Yes. It’s in the laptop.

754
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,500
Go help the others.

755
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,500

Look here, Mr. Yin.

00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:20,375
This side, too.

761

Mr. Yin.

762
00:37:26,725 --> 00:37:27,350
Look here.

Here comes the hidden star of the day.

764
00:37:30,775 --> 00:37:31,500
Mr. Yin,

765
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:32,775
long time no see.

766
00:37:32,775 --> 00:37:33,750
It’s been a while.

767
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:35,750
We got some catching up to do.

768
00:37:37,275 --> 00:37:37,875
Be right back.

769
00:37:37,916 --> 00:37:39,041
This way, please.

770
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,750
You look stunning, Mrs. Yin!

771
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:43,750
Thank you.

772
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,750
Other ladies

773

That’s very kind of you.

00:37:48,425 --> 00:37:49,208

777
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:49,725
Thanks.

778
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:51,125
- Will you excuse me?
- Sure.

779
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:51,875
Take your time.

780
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:54,000
Hi, Zixin.

781
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,300
It’s been a while, Mr. Wang.

You look gorgeous today.

783
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,075
He’s probably over there.

784

Thank you.

785

Can we talk more about it later?

788
00:38:05,425 --> 00:38:06,450
Sure.

789
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:07,333
Appreciated.

790
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,041
Excuse me.

791
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:09,583
Yes, Mr. Yin.

792
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:12,708
Tell my wife to come over.

793
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:13,291
Yes, sir.

794
00:38:14,975 --> 00:38:16,225
Are you busy lately?

795
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:17,791
I’m working on...

796
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:19,416
Ma’am, Mr. Yin is asking for you.

797
00:38:21,225 --> 00:38:22,458
Sorry. Please excuse me.

798
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:25,041
Mr. Mo.

799
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,833
How can I help you, Mr. Yin?

800
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:34,975
What were you doing?

801
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:36,416
Having a little chit-chat.

802
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:37,666
Really?

803
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:38,625
All for courtesy.

804
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,375
Gu Xixi’s diary?

805
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:49,041
(I must be rich...)
Mrs. Yin looked innocent

806
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:50,125
and I kinda liked her.

807
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:52,125
Read those lines!

808
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:54,250
They’re gross!

809
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:55,541
Mrs. Yin said that?

810
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,958
Yeah. She seemed pure.

811
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:58,250
(I must be rich...)
I was her fan.

812
00:38:58,291 --> 00:38:59,375
I didn’t know her true colors until now!

813
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:00,291
She’s money-worshiping!

814
00:39:00,291 --> 00:39:01,583
Who wrote that?

815
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:02,500
What a surprise!

816
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:03,625
Take more photos.

817
00:39:04,025 --> 00:39:05,942
I knew she was a gold digger.

818
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:07,875
Yeah! It’s written all over her face!

819
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:09,500
She’s all for money!

820
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,083
Take photos of everything.

821
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,083
It’s a big story!

822
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:15,541
How shameless!

823
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:16,541
Oh, my God!

824
00:39:16,775 --> 00:39:17,750
If you ask me...

825
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,333
This so-called Mrs. Yin

826
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:20,000
- cheated her husband and everyone.
- She’s craving easy money.

827
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:21,541
Think about it.

828
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:23,000
How could a greedy village girl

829
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,375
- I’m not...
- wrap the Yin family

830
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:25,958
around her little finger?

831
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,750
It’s not true.

832
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:27,600
Turn it off!

833
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:28,825
Sorry, Mr. Yin.

834
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:29,666
Big news! It’s huge!

835
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:30,250
Take photos.

836
00:39:30,575 --> 00:39:31,416
Quickly!

837
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:32,708
Over there!

838
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:34,500
It’s gonna hit the headlines!

839
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,041
Take photos!

840
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:36,277
Take as many as you can!

841
00:39:36,277 --> 00:39:37,425
What’s her background?

842
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,875
Mr. Mo, it’s Yin Sichen’s family matter.

843
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:42,875
Better not interfere.

844
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:45,583
Can’t you see they’re insulting her?

845
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:46,416
I can’t sit back and do nothing.

846
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:47,208
She’s Yin Sichen’s wife.

847
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:48,333
He’ll protect her.

848
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:49,416
But she’s also my friend.

849
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:52,333
She’s nakedly ambitious!

850
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:54,575
Is all that true?

851
00:39:57,325 --> 00:39:58,300
Big news!

852
00:40:03,666 --> 00:40:04,791
I can’t believe it!

853
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:07,983
