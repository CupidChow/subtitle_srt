(More than two months later)

24
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,041
What if they haven’t fallen asleep?

25
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,458
They must be asleep at this time of day.

26
00:02:02,175 --> 00:02:03,625
Surprise!

27
00:02:15,332 --> 00:02:17,750
Grandma, Mom, why haven’t you slept yet?

28
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:18,332
We haven’t.

29
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:21,332
We’re holding a welcome party for you.

30
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,332
It’s getting late.

31
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:24,582
We’re going to sleep.

32
00:02:24,582 --> 00:02:26,025
You shall go to bed, too.

33
00:02:26,207 --> 00:02:26,875
Yes, yes.

34
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,000
After a long flight, you must be tired.

35
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,457
Get back to your room and sleep.

36
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,000
Mom, you made sense.

37
00:02:32,582 --> 00:02:35,875
Let’s have the welcome party tomorrow.

38
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:39,082
We’re going up to sleep now.

39
00:02:39,082 --> 00:02:39,707
All right. All right.

40
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,000
Leave everything to tomorrow.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,025
Get to sleep.

42
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:48,750
At this rate,

43
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,041
my lady, you’ll soon

44
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,457
have a great-grandson.

45
00:02:52,957 --> 00:02:55,000
Don’t disturb them.
Keep your voice down.

46
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,416
Get going. Go have some sleep.

47
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,416
Go, go.

48
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:58,875
Come on.

49
00:02:59,250 --> 00:02:59,707
Let’s go.

50
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,332
Mrs. Yin.

51
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,250
- Mm?
- Time to sleep.

52
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:11,500
I’m unpacking the suitcase.

53
00:03:11,707 --> 00:03:13,082
If you’re sleepy, get to sleep first.

54
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:17,666
Without you lying here,

55
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,957
how can I fall asleep?

56
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,916
Get something to do, then.

57
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:23,500
Fine.

58
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:31,125
What? I’m in the middle of something.

59
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,791
Didn’t you ask me
to get something to do?

60
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,650
How about unpacking with me?

61
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,500
Yes, sweetheart.

62
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,457
You want to settle in Why Mall?

63
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:52,957
Why didn’t you tell me?

64
00:03:54,707 --> 00:03:57,625
This was the subject of the courses.

65
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,125
However,

66
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,750
through the learning of three months,

67
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,207
I indeed found out a problem.

68
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,041
CICI needs a bigger platform.

69
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,207
So,

70
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:13,625
you prefer Why Mall?

71
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,290
I’ve thought about it.

72
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,750
But I don’t think CICI

73
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,665
has reached the standard of Why Mall.

74
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:29,165
Gu Xixi,

75
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:31,958
you’re now the hostess of Why Mall.

76
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,875
All its standards

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,333
can be reset for you.

78
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:40,625
I reject it.

79
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,415
I’ll make it

80
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:45,458
the final task of my learning.

81
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,665
So, don’t ever try to help.

82
00:04:53,915 --> 00:04:54,415
All right, then.

83
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,250
Do whatever you want.

84
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,665
Good boy.

85
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:02,833
Wait. Wait.

86
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,875
Time to get our real business done.

87
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,790
Yin Sichen!

88
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,540
You love learning after the courses?

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,150
Why are you so sleepy?

90
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,875
You must have learned
with Yin Sichen late last night.

91
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,583
Shall I send you to check the inventory
in the storehouse?

92
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,125
I just did that.

93
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,458
Looks like you have nothing to do.

94
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,125
I have some clothes to iron.

95
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,583
You do?

96
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:47,900
(Sichen)

97
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:50,625
You’ve got a call, boss.

98
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,500
Hello?

99
00:05:58,665 --> 00:05:59,375
Darling.

100
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,665
Now?

101
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,040
Fine. I’ll be right there.

102
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,125
Bye-bye.

103
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,750
Xiaoya, I’ve got an emergency.

104
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,083
I gotta go. Bye-bye.

105
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,500
Take care of the store.

106
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:18,958
I want some bonus, then.

107
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,625
In your dream!

108
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,083
Gu Xixi, how cruel you are!

109
00:06:37,975 --> 00:06:39,208
Xixi isn’t in?

110
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,708
She just left.

111
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:41,790
Shall I call her?

112
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,000
No, no.

113
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,583
Come on in, girls.

114
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:46,900
Mm.

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,958
Is this the store?

116
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:51,100
Come on.

117
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,625
Browse around as you wish.

118
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:54,041
- My daughter-in-law
- Looks great.

119
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,325
is an emerging fashion designer.

120
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,290
She has unique taste.

121
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,000
Look at this.

122
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,100
Oh.

123
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,675
What fabric is this made of?

124
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:02,790
I’m allergic to cheap fabric.

125
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:03,915
What are you talking about?

126
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,833
How would my daughter-in-law

127
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,040
make clothes with cheap fabric?

128
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,333
Come on.

129
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,375
We all know your daughter-in-law
is beautiful and competent.

130
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,375
You don’t need to praise her
all the time.

131
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,958
Now that you know, do something.

132
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,415
Look, you didn’t give her any gift
when she got married.

133
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,833
How about this?

134
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,415
Invest in her store

135
00:07:21,415 --> 00:07:22,750
as a gift for her.

136
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:24,290
- Don’t you invest too?
- It’s a deal, then.

137
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,150
- It’s a deal.
- Fine.

138
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:25,625
All right.

139
00:07:25,665 --> 00:07:27,250
Have a browse around.

140
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,250
- Shoes are over there.
- All right.

141
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:28,833
All right.

142
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,625
Xixi’s mother-in-law is so nice to her.

143
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,150
- Hello? Mom.
- Leave it to the Law Department.

144
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,040
The Marketing Department
did such a bad job.

145
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,208
I’m with Sichen.

146
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,175
We’ll have to work overtime.

147
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,958
I’ll have Xiaoya entertain you.

148
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,175
We can’t finish it.

149
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:44,833
Have fun.

150
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,333
What did Mom say?

151
00:07:48,475 --> 00:07:50,375
She is shopping
with her friends in CICI.

152
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,540
Let’s get back to business.

153
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:55,665
Sichen,

154
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,915
I haven’t finished the application yet.

155
00:07:58,915 --> 00:08:00,750
Why are we talking
about settling already?

156
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,500
Your application is already formal.

157
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,958
I just asked them to enrich it.

158
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,625
By the way,

159
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:09,958
ask the Marketing Department

160
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,875
to verify CICI’s application first.

161
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,125
But Sichen...

162
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:14,915
Don’t worry.

163
00:08:14,915 --> 00:08:16,040
I’m not interfering.

164
00:08:16,225 --> 00:08:16,750
Everything is done

165
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,583
according to the rules of Why Mall.

166
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,375
He didn’t force us.

167
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,915
He just asked us
to complete the three-month work

168
00:08:22,915 --> 00:08:24,375
within a day.

169
00:08:24,915 --> 00:08:25,665
Besides that,

170
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
he has done nothing.

171
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,790
They’re just working overtime,

172
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,291
with the highest overtime pay
in the industry.

173
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,875
After the project is over,

174
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,791
they’ll also have
a two-month paid leave.

175
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,166
Isn’t it too exhausting?

176
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:41,916
What?

177
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:43,708
Feeling sorry for your husband?

178
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,541
I mean for your employees.

179
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,125
It’s us who are suffering.

180
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,958
If you keep doing PDA,

181
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,750
I’ll apply for compensation.

182
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,750
Well,

183
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,291
go to the Finance Department

184
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,916
and get your pay for this month.

185
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:01,125
You don’t need to come tomorrow.

186
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,958
Come on. Look at this.

187
00:09:06,325 --> 00:09:07,041
Mrs. Yin,

188
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,791
come and check the details
of the contract.

189
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,208
She doesn’t need to.

190
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,333
You just need to remember.

191
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,250
This is the project
of Why Mall’s hostess.

192
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,500
Without disobeying the company rules,

193
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,208
you shall handle the details.

194
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:18,291
Do you get it?

195
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,175
Yes.

196
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,041
Sichen...

197
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,750
All right. Work is done.

198
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:25,625
I miss you.

199
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,791
I’m just beside you.

200
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,750
But we are at work. It doesn’t count.

201
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,000
I want...

202
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:35,416
Are you out of your mind?

203
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,500
We’re in your company
and they’re watching.

204
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,850
Looks like we have to
work overtime tonight.

205
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,800
We must work overtime for the proposal.

206
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,375
We can’t finish it in the day.

207
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,583
Xiwei, you came for Sichen?

208
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,625
If you need any help, tell me.

209
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,208
No, aunt.

210
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,166
It’s just about business cooperation.

211
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,375
Sichen is back.

212
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,333
I came to talk with him about it.

213
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,041
Young men like you

214
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,708
should often visit each other like this.

215
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,250
When you can help each other,

216
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,250
we feel relieved.

217
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:24,708
Aunt,

218
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,625
when Sichen and I were little,

219
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,166
we often had discussions.

220
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,208
Now we’ve grown up and got to work,

221
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:31,833
whenever there’s a chance
of cooperation,

222
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,416
we usually try our best to get it.

223
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,291
So, many people

224
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,833
misunderstand our relationship.

225
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,958
There’s nothing to be misunderstood.

226
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,041
We’ve been a family.

227
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,208
You must be kidding me.

228
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,041
Sichen has got married.

229
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,333
How can we be a family?

230
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,541
Don’t sound like a stranger.

231
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,333
Sichen is married.

232
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,875
But it doesn’t stop him
from treating you as his sister.

233
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,375
Sister?

234
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:58,250
Yeah.

235
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,291
Xiwei,

236
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,208
I watched you grow up.

237
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:04,708
In my eyes,

238
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,750
you’re just like Sichen.

239
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,083
In my heart,

240
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,291
you’ve been my daughter.

241
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:11,458
By the way...

242
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:13,750
Look.

243
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,875
A friend of mine works on new media.

244
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,375
He knows much more than Sichen.

245
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,291
You’ll have no problem
cooperating with him.

246
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:26,666
Thank you.

247
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,833
You’re welcome.

248
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,291
Xiwei,

249
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,416
if you have any problem at work,

250
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:33,500
tell me directly.

251
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:35,875
I treat you as my child.

252
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,333
I’ll help you.

253
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,250
Don’t hesitate to ask me for help.

254
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,550
Mm.

255
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,509
(Zhang Xinyu, Guangxuan New Media)
I was so stupid

256
00:11:54,175 --> 00:11:56,200
that you thought you could use me

257
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:57,750
and abandon me as you wish.

258
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:00,708
However,

259
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,291
I won’t be stupid anymore.

260
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:18,125
Mom,

261
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,833
we’ll get CICI to settle in Why Mall.

262
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,291
We’ll hold an opening fashion show
in a couple of days.

263
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,500
Come and support Xixi with Grandma.

264
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,166
I’ve reserved the best seats for you.

265
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,333
All right.

266
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,708
By then,

267
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,916
I’ll attend the fashion show

268
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,500
in the dress Xixi designed.

269
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,083
Don’t worry.

270
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:37,708
I’ve prepared the dresses for you.

271
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:38,675
You have?

272
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:39,225
Mm.

273
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,750
You’re the best girl, Xixi.

274
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,750
I don’t agree.

275
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,450
Ah?

276
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,000
Why?

277
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:53,050
Don’t always interfere with their stuff.

278
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,041
Xixi is a very talented

279
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,166
emerging designer.

280
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:57,458
Why Mall also needs

281
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,458
new brands like CICI.

282
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,375
I’m certainly aware

283
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,583
that Why Mall needs
young brands like CICI

284
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,000
to expand the market.

285
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:08,875
But to Xixi,

286
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,375
she needs a bigger platform

287
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,958
where more people
will get to know her talent.

288
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,575
So, you don’t trust Why Mall?

289
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,975
You’re my son.

290
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,125
I trust your ability with no doubt.

291
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,000
But today,

292
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,083
my friends and I visited CICI.

293
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,708
They speak highly of CICI

294
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,083
and want to introduce you

295
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,333
to global department stores.

296
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,375
If it works,

297
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,916
CICI can start

298
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,750
directly from the international market.

299
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:39,833
By then, Why Mall

300
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,958
has to beg you to settle in it.

301
00:13:48,325 --> 00:13:49,000
Mom,

302
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:51,083
we’re going through
the contract already.

303
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,000
Don’t interfere, will you?

304
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,675
After all,

305
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,708
it’s Xixi’s brand.

306
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,208
She decides

307
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,250
which she will pick.

308
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,333
What do you think, Xixi?

309
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:06,208
Mom,

310
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,791
it’s always been my dream

311
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,083
to get CICI to the international market.

312
00:14:12,775 --> 00:14:13,750
Yin Sichen,

313
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,291
if you have a sore throat,
drink more water.

314
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,000
Xixi, ignore him.

315
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:18,791
Go on.

316
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,125
But I think

317
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,375
CICI suits Why Mall better.

318
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,291
Because CICI hasn’t reached

319
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,750
the standards
of the international market.

320
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,333
So, I want to work hard with Sichen.

321
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,958
They have their own plan.

322
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,666
We should let them go

323
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,625
so that they can develop.

324
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,333
You’re full?

325
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:53,666
I’ll have some hawthorn juice
to cleanse the palate.

326
00:14:59,325 --> 00:15:00,083
Let’s enjoy the meal.

327
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,075
Mm.

328
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,333
Sichen.

329
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:17,958
You’re awake?

330
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:18,850
Mm.

331
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,400
I’m going to work.

332
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,833
Work hard.

333
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,708
Be a good girl at home.

334
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,050
Mm.

335
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:40,708
This is the surveillance video

336
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,291
for the Fashion Celebration
you asked me to find out.

337
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:43,916
It was revised.

338
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,291
It took me a long while,
but I finally got it back.

339
00:15:46,975 --> 00:15:47,666
Thank you.

340
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,875
According to the surveillance video,

341
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,625
it was indeed Miss Ran

342
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,666
who copied Miss Gu’s diary
into the player.

343
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,750
I’ll take care of it.

344
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,208
What about Miss Gu?

345
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,000
I’ll explain to her
after I take care of it.

346
00:16:00,325 --> 00:16:00,958
By the way,

347
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,291
when you find that

348
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,333
Ran Xiwei meets Gu Xixi in private,

349
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:05,541
tell me immediately.

350
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:06,125
Got it.

351
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,166
Oh,

352
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,166
how’s the contract for CICI going?

353
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,750
I urged the Law Department.

354
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,333
They’ll complete it in a day or two.

355
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,041
When I get to my office,

356
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,000
ask them to see me.

357
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,833
I’ll cancel the contract with Gu Xixi.

358
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:21,791
Cancel?

359
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,666
Do you think we still need that?

360
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,819
(Prenuptial Agreement)

361
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,041
Fei’ang.

362
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,291
Miss Ran has come.

363
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,625
Why did she come?

364
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,458
What did you come for?

365
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,833
I want to talk with you

366
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,416
about some cooperation.

367
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,666
I also have something

368
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,041
to ask you.

369
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,250
We think so alike.

370
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:03,916
Not really.

371
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,000
Who did you cooperate with

372
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,250
at the Fashion Celebration?

373
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,208
What else did he tell you?

374
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,541
Why did you ask about that?

375
00:17:17,425 --> 00:17:19,625
I had no partner
for the Fashion Celebration.

376
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:20,541
Are you sure?

377
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,791
What else would you like to explain?

378
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:34,500
Yes.

379
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,416
I played the VCR.

380
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,125
I did that

381
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,500
simply to expose Gu Xixi’s true colors.

382
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:41,916
I want you to see her through

383
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,625
so that you won’t get hurt again.

384
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,416
This is Gu Xixi’s privacy.

385
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,875
Why do you think you could do that?

386
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,000
Because I wanted everyone to know

387
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,875
that Gu Xixi was a liar.

388
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,625
She married you for money only!

389
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,541
Why can’t you understand?

390
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,750
Gu Xixi isn’t a liar.

391
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,166
She’s my wife.

392
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,375
If you defame her again,

393
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,791
don’t blame me for not taking you
as a friend again.

394
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:11,583
Yin Sichen,

395
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,166
we’ve known each other
for a dozen years.

396
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,500
But how long have you known her?

397
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,041
Half a year?

398
00:18:20,325 --> 00:18:22,500
Why are you threatening me for her?

399
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:24,541
Do you even care

400
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:26,291
a little bit for me?

401
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,458
Please be sensible!

402
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:29,350
Gu Xixi doesn’t deserve

403
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,791
your care for her!

404
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,458
Why do you think you can say this?

405
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,541
You claim that Gu Xixi lied to me.

406
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:40,375
What about you?

407
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:42,625
At first,

408
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,291
Gu Xixi rejected Alex.

409
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,166
Then she was attacked
after being interviewed by you.

410
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,500
And her diary was exposed
at the Fashion Celebration.

411
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,166
You arranged all this, didn’t you?

412
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,791
There are more things I know

413
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,041
or I don’t know.

414
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,291
Do you need me to list them?

415
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,166
I don’t care what you think of me.

416
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,208
I’ve done everything for your own good.

417
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,416
I don’t want you to be deceived anymore!

418
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,041
But I don’t need you to do that!

419
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,083
For the sake that you’re my friend,

420
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,416
I let you go for the last time.

421
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,458
One more time...

422
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,208
If you hurt Gu Xixi one more time,

423
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,291
I’ll make you pay the price.

424
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:27,750
I’ve got a meeting.

425
00:19:30,475 --> 00:19:31,166
Sichen.

426
00:19:48,425 --> 00:19:49,675
(Prenuptial Agreement)

427
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,916
You have a fake marriage?

428
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:00,825
Yin Sichen,

429
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,125
now that you abandon our relationship

430
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,791
over a dozen years for Gu Xixi,

431
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,500
I’ll help you

432
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,208
as you wish.

433
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:20,458
Hello? Huahua.

434
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,833
You wrote a nice news report last time.

435
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,500
I need you to write another report.

436
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:29,958
The president of Why Mall

437
00:20:30,425 --> 00:20:32,675
had a contracted marriage
for business cooperation.

438
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,666
Isn’t it breaking news?

439
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:37,333
When they first got married,

440
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:39,791
didn’t they promote
their fairy tale love story?

441
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,250
Readers love such a big twist.

442
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,250
Why did you come so early?

443
00:20:52,975 --> 00:20:54,308
I was eager to see you.

444
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:55,900
I spent my lunch hour

445
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,208
finishing all my work.

446
00:20:57,525 --> 00:20:58,525
I haven’t had lunch yet.

447
00:20:58,666 --> 00:20:59,625
What would you like to eat?

448
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:00,583
My treat.

449
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,708
You rarely treat me to lunch.

450
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,333
I’ll pick a nice restaurant.

451
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:14,875
Come on.

452
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,833
Could you restrain yourselves?

453
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,416
I’m still here.

454
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,350
We’re leaving immediately.

455
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,975
Take care of the store.

456
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,833
How cruel you are!

457
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:26,916
You’re going on a date,

458
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,166
but I have to work alone?

459
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,375
It’s okay.

460
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,208
There’s little work on a weekday.

461
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,208
You may leave, too.

462
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,750
You’re the best, Xixi.

463
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:35,916
You love me most.

464
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,625
No.

465
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:38,750
My wife can love me only.

466
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:43,291
Love you.

467
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,083
Here. Here.

468
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:44,875
Mr. and Mrs. Yin,

469
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,583
is the online news true
that you have a contracted marriage?

470
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,225
Did you fake your marriage

471
00:21:47,225 --> 00:21:48,625
for the contract with Alex?

472
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,458
Isn’t that business fraud?

473
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,000
- Mrs. Yin.
- Mr. Yin.

474
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,625
- Please answer our questions.
- Please answer.

475
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:52,666
Are you really doing business fraud?

476
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:54,625
- What’s your real relationship?
- Please answer.

477
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:55,958
Why did you start a fake marriage?

478
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,375
What’s your real relationship?

479
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:58,666
Please answer our questions.

480
00:21:59,525 --> 00:22:00,666
Answer our questions.

481
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:01,625
Answer our questions.

482
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:02,583
Mr. Yin, could you answer us?

483
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:03,916
Please explain.

484
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,077
Are you married for business?

485
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:06,833
Mr. Yin!

486
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:07,958
Make way! Make way!

487
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,208
(Closed)
Please explain.

488
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:09,750
Back off.

489
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:10,958
Reporters.

490
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:12,833
Reporters, please be quiet.

491
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:13,825
Be quiet.

492
00:22:13,825 --> 00:22:14,300
Mr. Yin.

493
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:14,958
Listen to me.

494
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,416
I’ve got the latest news.

495
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:17,333
If you have questions, ask me.

496
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:18,333
Miss Mu, from beginning to end,

497
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,791
you’ve known about that?

498
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,583
Are they doing business fraud?

499
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:22,958
Everybody, listen to me!

500
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,416
I, Shang Ke, decide

501
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:26,916
to get engaged.

502
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:27,916
Engaged?

503
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:28,916
But...

504
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:29,775
But,

505
00:22:29,775 --> 00:22:30,650
what does it have to do with them?

506
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,625
It has nothing to do with them.

507
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:32,875
They’re over there!

508
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,175
Let’s go!

509
00:22:35,175 --> 00:22:35,775
- Be quick!
- Go, go, go!

510
00:22:35,775 --> 00:22:36,625
Go after Mr. Yin.

511
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:37,916
Mr. Shang wasted our time.

512
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:38,458
Quickly.

513
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:39,208
They haven’t gone too far.

514
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:43,708
(The liar couple put on
big business fraud)

515
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:47,083
The liar couple put on
big business fraud.

516
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,333
The netizens are too realistic.

517
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:50,208
A couple of days ago,

518
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,208
they just said you had fairy tale love.

519
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:54,916
They changed so quickly.

520
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,125
Wait. Wait.

521
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,958
So, you...

522
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:58,675
You...

523
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:01,666
You were just pretending?

524
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:03,125
But now it’s true.

525
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,208
But...

526
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,458
Even she knew it.
Why didn’t you tell me?

527
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:07,166
Yin Sichen,

528
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,083
we’ve been friends for years.

529
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:09,833
Are we real friends?

530
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,875
It’s not time to argue about this.

531
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:13,833
You knew it, too?

532
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:15,500
So, you all knew this,

533
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:16,666
but me?

534
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:17,958
Weren’t you bullying me?

535
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,458
I’ve communicated with the reporters.

536
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,458
They won’t take further action
for the moment.

537
00:23:23,175 --> 00:23:23,775
Sichen,

538
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,850
who exposed your secret?

539
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:26,916
Do you have an idea?

540
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,083
Ran Xiwei did it.

541
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,416
- How did she know?
- What?

542
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:33,666
At the Fashion Celebration,

543
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:34,625
it was also her.

544
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,500
No matter what exactly she wants,

545
00:23:37,475 --> 00:23:38,875
we’ll handle this problem.

546
00:23:39,325 --> 00:23:39,950
No way.

547
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,875
I must call her

548
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:42,541
and ask her about it.

549
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:43,875
Why did she...?

550
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:44,500
Come back.

551
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,000
When she did this,

552
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,833
she showed her stand and attitude.

553
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:52,875
What’s the point of asking her now?

554
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:54,125
Sichen made sense.

555
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,083
By now, 0.12 billion is suddenly off

556
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,583
the market value of Why Mall.

557
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:58,958
The stock price keeps declining.

558
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:01,291
Our top priority is
to solve this problem.

559
00:24:02,125 --> 00:24:03,625
You’d better gain
the forgiveness of Alex.

560
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:06,083
The pressure of public opinion
will be reduced by half.

561
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,166
I’ve sent an email to Alex,

562
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:09,375
explaining the whole story.

563
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:10,666
I’m waiting for his reply.

564
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:12,083
I’ve got an idea.

565
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,083
I think

566
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,458
we can arrange an antenatal examination.

567
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:16,708
Let Sichen accompany Xixi
for an antenatal examination

568
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,958
and post the photos on the Internet.

569
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,333
Then Granny Yin can clarify that

570
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,416
you’re only preparing for a baby.

571
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:22,958
Then the attention can be shifted.

572
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,500
No way. Grandma is innocent.

573
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:26,916
We can’t get her involved.

574
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,666
This isn’t the best solution.

575
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,500
But it’ll shift others’ attention.

576
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,500
Forget it. I have an idea.

577
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:34,625
I have a paparazzo friend.

578
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,500
He has dirt on many stars.

579
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,041
When he posts it,

580
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:38,708
netizens will be excited about stars.
And your news will die down.

581
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,291
Right?

582
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,250
I agree!

583
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,875
This isn’t simply pink news

584
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:43,833
like it was at the Fashion Celebration.

585
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:47,291
The contracted marriage
has a direct influence on Why Mall,

586
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:49,750
CICI and even the stock price
of the Yin Group.

587
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,291
I can’t try to let the problem slip by

588
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,625
by leaving things to chance.

589
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:56,083
I agree.

590
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:57,291
We should take the initiative

591
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:59,000
to explain the truth to the public

592
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,250
and gain their forgiveness.

593
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:03,958
But in this way,

594
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:06,208
you’ll fall into a passive condition.

595
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:07,375
After all,

596
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,958
when you’re in such a crisis,

597
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:10,750
you have to pay the price.

598
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,125
It doesn’t matter.

599
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:18,916
No matter what happens,

600
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:20,541
I’ll bear it with Sichen.

601
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:22,791
I won’t get you hurt.

602
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:33,333
Mr. Yin, shareholders
hold an urgent meeting

603
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:34,166
to ask you to be accountable.

604
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:36,333
They’re waiting for you
in the meeting room.

605
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,541
I get it.

606
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,500
All right.

607
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:42,208
Get to your business.

608
00:25:43,025 --> 00:25:44,083
I’m all right.

609
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:46,425
Take good care of yourself.

610
00:25:46,725 --> 00:25:47,250
Mm.

611
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:50,791
Why is he leaving?

612
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:06,541
Done?

613
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:08,375
I’m serious.

614
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,550
Next, some people

615
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,875
may have some radical behaviors.

616
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:11,833
So, Xixi,

617
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:13,916
you have to calm down
and don’t act on impulse.

618
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:14,791
Don’t worry.

619
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,250
I won’t act on impulse!

620
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:18,125
Come on.

621
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:18,625
Come on!

622
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:20,333
Come on!

623
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,833
So far, three companies asked

624
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:22,875
to terminate the contract with us.

625
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,166
Among them, Deli asked us

626
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,791
to compensate for all the losses.

627
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:27,166
As of just now,

628
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,958
our stock price has declined by 9.7%.

629
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:30,708
I’m still a bit worried about Xixi.

630
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,541
Send someone to check in her store.

631
00:26:32,916 --> 00:26:33,475
All right.

632
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:35,833
How do I look?

633
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:37,916
Quite confident

634
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:39,250
and fully prepared.

635
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,875
Tell me as soon as Alex replies.

636
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:42,425
Mm.

637
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,458
There won’t be a problem, will there?

638
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,708
There won’t.

639
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:55,875
I’ll leave you here.

640
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:56,575
Mm.

641
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,833
You’ve got a shooting job, right?

642
00:26:57,875 --> 00:26:58,458
Go ahead.

643
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:00,458
I’m going right away.

644
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,416
And I’ll be right back after that.

645
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:01,916
Mm.

646
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:02,333
I gotta go.

647
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:02,958
Don’t worry.

648
00:27:09,575 --> 00:27:10,250
She’s there!

649
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,291
She’s Gu Xixi!

650
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:12,000
Just as in the news.

651
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,525
That’s her!

652
00:27:12,525 --> 00:27:13,916
It’s because of her fake marriage
with Yin Sichen

653
00:27:13,916 --> 00:27:15,400
that the stock price declined

654
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,650
and we lost all our money!

655
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:17,507
Liar!

656
00:27:17,507 --> 00:27:18,325
- Give me my money back!
- Pay me back!

657
00:27:18,325 --> 00:27:19,000
Liar!

658
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,004
- Smash her!
- Liar!

659
00:27:20,004 --> 00:27:21,025
- Give me my money back!
- Liar!

660
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,375
You cheated us of our hard-earned money.

661
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:24,500
You heartless couple!

662
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,083
Give the money back to us!

663
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:25,875
Our money is all gone!

664
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:26,583
Yeah!

665
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:27,791
We earned it by hard work.

666
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:29,041
I’ll smash you! Give me my money back!

667
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:30,291
Give me my money back!

668
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,125
How dare you defend her! Smash them!

669
00:27:33,475 --> 00:27:34,650
Give the money back to us!

670
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:35,350
Give it back!

671
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,250
Liar, give me my money back!

672
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:36,825
Liar!

673
00:27:36,825 --> 00:27:37,900
Give the money back to us!

674
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,646
Liar!

675
00:27:38,646 --> 00:27:39,833
Give the money back to us!

676
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:42,041
Give it back! Give it back!

677
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,541
It’s been three hours

678
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,375
since Mr. Yin’s contracted marriage
was exposed.

679
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:53,541
Director Gao, what’s the direct loss

680
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,750
in the past three hours?

681
00:27:58,666 --> 00:27:59,958
By three o’clock this afternoon,

682
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:02,750
and estimated by the closing price
at Shanghai Stock Exchange,

683
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,416
0.12 billion is off the market value
of Why Mall.

684
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:09,416
Three companies may terminate

685
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:11,708
their advertising cooperation with us.

686
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:14,750
One of them has submitted
the request for compensation.

687
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:17,125
It’s estimated to be

688
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:18,791
about 73 million.

689
00:28:21,675 --> 00:28:23,208
I’ve asked the Marketing Department

690
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:25,000
to approach this company.

691
00:28:25,541 --> 00:28:27,000
The compensation Deli asked for

692
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,750
isn’t reasonable.

693
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,208
So, the loss of this part

694
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,208
can be reduced.

695
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:32,775
As for the stock market,

696
00:28:33,825 --> 00:28:34,475
I believe,

697
00:28:34,475 --> 00:28:36,208
when I gain the forgiveness of Alex,

698
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,208
and he makes a statement,

699
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:41,750
the stock price can get back
to its original standard.

700
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,041
What’s Alex’s attitude?

701
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,458
I’ve sent an email to him.

702
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,166
He hasn’t replied yet.

703
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,041
I’ll try my best

704
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:53,750
to gain the forgiveness of Alex.

705
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:57,541
Mr. Yin, I trust your judgment.

706
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,708
I trust your business strategy, too.

707
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:01,416
Honestly,

708
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,375
we don’t care

709
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:05,416
if you have a real or a fake marriage.

710
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:07,291
But this has

711
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:09,625
severely influenced
the interests of the company.

712
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,666
You’re not the only one
who has lost money.

713
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:14,041
So now,

714
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:15,916
you must give us a perfect solution.

715
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:16,525
Right?

716
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:18,166
Mr. Chen made sense.

717
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:20,000
Before Alex makes a statement,

718
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:21,500
the stock price will keep declining.

719
00:29:22,475 --> 00:29:24,541
Who will be responsible for the loss?

720
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:27,250
Under such circumstances,

721
00:29:27,925 --> 00:29:30,125
we should also explain to investors.

722
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,958
In my opinion,

723
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:37,166
how about this?

724
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,750
Let’s give Mr. Yin 15 days.

725
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:41,666
In 15 days,

726
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:43,291
all of us will have

727
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:44,875
another shareholders’ meeting here.

728
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:46,958
By then, we will decide

729
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:48,541
how to deal with Mr. Yin’s problem.

730
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:50,708
But within 15 days,

731
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,041
let’s suspend his administrative post.

732
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,625
What do you think?

733
00:29:58,541 --> 00:29:59,916
Let’s do this, then.

734
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:17,208
Alex has replied?

735
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:18,125
It’s Miss Gu.

736
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,583
She was in trouble.

737
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,916
I’m so sorry, Zixin.

738
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:30,208
Sorry for getting you involved.

739
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:33,333
It’s a new suit we just launched.

740
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,166
If you don’t mind,

741
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:36,750
take it as my apology.

742
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:39,541
With such a chance,

743
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,375
I’ve got your new product.

744
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:42,875
I’m profiting.

745
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,125
Why did you come today?

746
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:48,250
I read about the news on the Internet.

747
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,350
I was worried about you.
So I came.

748
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:52,791
Those investors lost a lot of money
in the stock market.

749
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:55,916
You’d better close your store
these days.

750
00:30:57,416 --> 00:30:58,416
I can’t close it.

751
00:30:58,708 --> 00:30:59,708
Don’t worry.

752
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:02,708
You can still run the online store.

753
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:05,291
Our Publicity and Marketing
Departments will help you.

754
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,375
What if they make trouble in Why Mall

755
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:10,208
when I close CICI?

756
00:31:10,916 --> 00:31:12,500
Sichen is already stressed out.

757
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,333
I want to share some pressure for him.

758
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:18,666
What about you?

759
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,208
Luckily, I was just passing by.

760
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:22,458
What about next time?

761
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:24,000
Those investors

762
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,625
may be more violent.

763
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:27,708
I don’t fear their violence.

764
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,583
I fear that I can’t help Sichen.

765
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:35,333
Gu Xixi!

766
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:36,333
Sichen?

767
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:39,916
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

768
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,000
Alright, Sichen.

769
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I’m fine.

770
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:45,875
But Zixin defended me

771
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:47,250
and his suit was stained.

772
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:55,583
I’m glad that you were there.

773
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,041
Thank you.

774
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:00,375
When I can hear you say “thank you”,

775
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:03,075
my suit wasn’t wasted.

776
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:13,875
Don’t worry. I’m all right.

777
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:16,166
I’m indeed all right.

778
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:29,166
Sichen.

779
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:30,375
Mm?

780
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:32,000
It doesn’t look like the way home.

781
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:36,666
We’re not going home.

782
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:38,083
I’m taking you somewhere.

783
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:39,416
Where?

784
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,166
The end of the world.

785
00:32:49,666 --> 00:32:50,208
Here we are.

786
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:57,541
Why is this place the end of the world?

787
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:01,025
When I was little,
once I quarreled with my mother

788
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,458
and then I ran away from home.

789
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,875
As I walked,

790
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:06,916
I came here.

791
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:09,375
To me at that age,

792
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:11,666
this was the end of the world.

793
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:15,375
I don’t know where
the real end of the world is.

794
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:19,875
So, I can only take you
to my end of the world.

795
00:33:26,916 --> 00:33:27,458
Look.

796
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:39,125
How did you know the timing?

797
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:41,916
By accident when I first came.

798
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,166
After that, every time
I have trouble or difficulty,

799
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:47,375
I come here

800
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,541
and do such a boring trick.

801
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:54,000
Sichen,

802
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,291
you’ve worked too hard.

803
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:00,041
From now on, I’ll always be with you.

804
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,458
Life is always filled

805
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,275
with many things

806
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:07,708
we can’t control or handle.

807
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:10,875
Before I met you,

808
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:14,000
I could have handled this.

809
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:17,625
As I stay here longer,
I’ll have enough courage

810
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:20,083
to confront those problems.

811
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,541
Take it as charging.

812
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,291
Let me charge you, then.

813
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:35,208
This is a big problem.

814
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:38,000
Unless I’m fully charged,

815
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,583
I can hardly solve it.

816
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:44,375
It doesn’t matter.

817
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,958
If you can’t, let it be.

818
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:49,041
I have CICI, anyway.

819
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:50,625
The income of CICI

820
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:53,458
will be enough
for our ordinary life, won’t it?

821
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:54,375
No way.

822
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:56,500
You have some hobbies that cost a lot,

823
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,500
such as the garage kit.

824
00:34:57,916 --> 00:34:58,625
But it doesn’t matter.

825
00:34:58,791 --> 00:34:59,958
You don’t need to give it up.

826
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,708
I can make some for you by hand.

827
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:02,541
I can make...

828
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:03,125
Xixi.

829
00:35:08,725 --> 00:35:09,875
I want nothing,

830
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,166
