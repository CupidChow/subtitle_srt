Xixi, here’s…

25
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:05,166
Mom, just put it there

26
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,166
A quilt.

27
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:06,791
Thanks.

28
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,300
Thanks, Mom.

29
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,791
Did you draw here when you were little?

30
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,791
Yeah.

31
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,500
I just started drawing back then.

32
00:02:26,575 --> 00:02:27,375
What’s that?

33
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,207
No, no, no.

34
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:31,327
Yin Sichen, please don’t.

35
00:02:31,327 --> 00:02:32,150
Seriously, no.

36
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:37,957
Give it to me.

37
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:39,916
Let me take a look. Don’t be mean.

38
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:46,250
Dear Xixi.

39
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,750
Don’t read it out loud.

40
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,332
Give me a break.

41
00:02:50,275 --> 00:02:52,275
A love letter, Gu Xixi.

42
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:56,457
You just left it in the drawer.

43
00:02:56,457 --> 00:02:57,625
And there are so many.

44
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,750
It’s lucky to be admired.

45
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:05,400
Let’s do it tonight.

46
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:06,791
What?

47
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,791
Read them to me as bedtime stories.

48
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,091
You wish.

49
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,009
What about

50
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,582
finishing what we started just now?

51
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,332
Where should we start?

52
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:24,832
Which one do you like?

53
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:37,500
Good night.

54
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,100
- Good morning, Miss.
- Good morning, Miss.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,200
What are your names?

56
00:03:55,575 --> 00:03:56,541
How adorable!

57
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,416
Let’s go home.

58
00:03:58,457 --> 00:03:59,332
Isn’t it Xixi?

59
00:03:59,332 --> 00:03:59,850
Hi, Ma’am.

60
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,000
Xixi.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,250
You’re well known in our neighborhood.

62
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:04,500
Why?

63
00:04:04,957 --> 00:04:06,875
I heard you married Yin Sichen.

64
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,000
Did you bring him back?

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,916
Ma’am, this is him.

66
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,207
I have to tell you

67
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:15,291
I’ve never seen

68
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,915
a big boss in flesh.

69
00:04:19,415 --> 00:04:22,040
How good-looking he is!

70
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,750
So charming!

71
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,458
So attractive!

72
00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:29,083
- Xixi.
- How wonderful!

73
00:04:29,665 --> 00:04:31,000
- A boss in flesh.
- Xixi.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,875
Wonderful!

75
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:32,700
Good for you!

76
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,540
- Ma’am.
- Good for you!

77
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:34,833
Mo, you’re back.

78
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,583
Why are you here?

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,333
Why do I see you everywhere?

80
00:04:39,775 --> 00:04:40,875
It’s destiny.

81
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:43,165
So you know each other?

82
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,208
Not really.

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,950
I have to go now.

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,700
Come for dinner when you’re free.

85
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,325
- The ribs I cook are just tasty.
- All right, Ma’am.

86
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,165
Come for dinner.

87
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:52,700
- OK.
- Sure.

88
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:53,967
Promise me.

89
00:04:54,165 --> 00:04:54,790
For sure.

90
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,290
Let’s go.

91
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,400
Goodbye, Miss.

92
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,875
Senior Mo, what a coincidence.

93
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,040
Xixi.

94
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,790
What brought you back home?

95
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,375
Some family stuff.

96
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,250
I’m back for a few days.

97
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:08,000
Thank you for asking

98
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,958
the itinerary of my wife.

99
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,025
Xixi,

100
00:05:11,425 --> 00:05:13,165
let me you know if you

101
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,333
need help.

102
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:15,458
After all,

103
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:16,775
I know this place better than Mr. Yin.

104
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:17,350
OK.

105
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,708
How shall I leave her errands to you?

106
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:23,083
Don’t worry.

107
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:23,750
It’s all done.

108
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,750
We’re friends.

109
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,083
My pleasure to help.

110
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:29,708
We have to go now.

111
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,643
Suit yourself, Mr. Mo.

112
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,150
I never found you’re chicken before.

113
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,325
What’s wrong?

114
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:51,083
You’re his father-in-law.

115
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,290
Go ask him for a favor.

116
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,165
You can’t let him force you
to pay it back.

117
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,083
What are you talking about?

118
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,875
Aren’t they divorced already?

119
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,200
But that’s still your daughter.

120
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,083
How does it help now?

121
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:05,800
What’s your solution then?

122
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:09,475
Let me think it over.

123
00:06:11,525 --> 00:06:12,200
Hello.

124
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,750
Are you Miss Gu’s father?

125
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,300
I am.

126
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,208
Who are you?

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,775
I’m a journalist.

128
00:06:19,165 --> 00:06:21,458
I’m here to ask you a few questions

129
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,875
about Miss Gu’s past.

130
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,665
She’s not my daughter.

131
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,400
Wait.

132
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,915
You’ll be paid.

133
00:06:31,665 --> 00:06:32,875
But it depends on

134
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,875
how valuable your info is.

135
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,665
Please come to me

136
00:06:40,665 --> 00:06:41,875
anytime if you want.

137
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,425
(Ran Xiwei)

138
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,083
Let’s go.

139
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,958
Wait.

140
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,333
Well,

141
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,625
why does Mo Zixin still live here,

142
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,000
like a haunting ghost?

143
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,458
You can’t just let it go.

144
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,290
It’s his hometown.

145
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,625
He comes back when he’s free.

146
00:07:13,665 --> 00:07:14,333
What’s the big deal?

147
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:15,708
And he gets along with neighbors

148
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,958
very well.

149
00:07:17,675 --> 00:07:18,450
OK.

150
00:07:18,925 --> 00:07:20,625
He’s quite popular.

151
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,915
You are jealous.

152
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,250
Why am I jealous?

153
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:24,665
He’s just a sweet talker.

154
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:25,915
I can be one too.

155
00:07:25,915 --> 00:07:26,833
You’re back.

156
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:27,333
Mom.

157
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,250
- Mom.
- Yeah.

158
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,175
Yeah.

159
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,040
Is there anything I can help with?

160
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,375
It’s fine. I can do it.

161
00:07:32,665 --> 00:07:34,208
How naturally you call her Mom.

162
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,665
Did you get what I wanted?

163
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:37,790
Yes, Mom.

164
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,500
Another thing, Mom.

165
00:07:40,915 --> 00:07:42,665
I’ve taken care of your divorce.

166
00:07:42,915 --> 00:07:44,083
Why don’t you stay at Meishan

167
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,458
and open a new laundry shop?

168
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,208
I’ve found a place for the new shop.

169
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,583
And I bought new furniture

170
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:50,958
and electronics.

171
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,083
They’ll be delivered soon.

172
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,583
Thank you, Sichen.

173
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,625
My pleasure.

174
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,250
You’ve spent so much time on it.

175
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,665
I know you two are both busy.

176
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:04,000
You may get back to work.

177
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,575
It’s fine.

178
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,375
I’ve pulled things together.

179
00:08:06,665 --> 00:08:08,790
I’ll stay here with Xixi
for a few more days.

180
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,915
When did I agree to that?

181
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,208
All right, all right.

182
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,975
What do you want to eat? I’ll cook.

183
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,125
Mom, why are you on his side?

184
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,600
Mom, you’ve been busy the whole day.

185
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,225
Why not leave it to Xixi?

186
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,000
You’re right. Let her do it.

187
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,775
It’s your turn to cook.

188
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,275
OK.

189
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,675
What do you want? I’ll go shopping.

190
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,425
What do you want?

191
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,290
Let me go shopping with her.

192
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,666
I’m afraid

193
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,291
she’ll buy things that I don’t like.

194
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,625
Mom, let’s have yam and bitter lemon.

195
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:38,625
All right.

196
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,975
It’s your call.

197
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:43,275
Where is the soya sauce?

198
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:46,833
Where is it?

199
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,375
What are you doing?

200
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,083
Getting soya sauce.

201
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,125
Why did you get so many?

202
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,291
One bottle for each type.

203
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,458
It makes cooking easier.

204
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,500
It takes a long time to

205
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,083
use up a bottle of soya sauce.

206
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,333
You don’t need to buy a lot.

207
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:06,625
Please have some common sense.

208
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:07,916
Well, I saw

209
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,791
Madam Song buy every type of it.

210
00:09:12,475 --> 00:09:14,041
My bad. Let me rephrase it.

211
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,958
Please have some knowledge of commoners,

212
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:17,750
all right?

213
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,800
Which one shall we pick?

214
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,583
The cheapest one.

215
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,416
Cheap stuff sucks.

216
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,333
It’s spending wisely. You don’t get it.

217
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,041
Put them back on the shelf.

218
00:09:30,225 --> 00:09:30,775
OK.

219
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,100
Sichen, here.

220
00:09:38,475 --> 00:09:39,125
Have some more.

221
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:39,825
Thanks, Mom.

222
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:40,875
Mom, stop refilling his bowl.

223
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,333
He won’t eat.

224
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:43,125
- Why?
- Here.

225
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,208
Mom was helping me.

226
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:44,875
You are jealous.

227
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:45,958
Yes. I am.

228
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,083
She didn’t help me.

229
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,125
All right, all right.

230
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,000
- Eggs for you.
- Let me help you.

231
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,666
Thanks, Mom.

232
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:50,225
Here.

233
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,525
Here.

234
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,291
I don’t need your help.

235
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,083
No, thanks.

236
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,750
If you don’t accept my help,

237
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,041
you are turning Mom down.

238
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,041
Mom, does it make any sense?

239
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,333
It makes every sense.

240
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,375
All right, go ahead.

241
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,525
- Mom, look at him.
- Open your mouth.

242
00:10:03,525 --> 00:10:04,833
All right, eat it.

243
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:05,900
Open your mouth.

244
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,083
Mom, help me.

245
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:13,583
All right.

246
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:14,875
Some more eggs.

247
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:16,791
Look at you.

248
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:17,791
Is it all right?

249
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,791
Mom, please put that in my bowl.

250
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:21,500
OK.

251
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:50,475
Mr. Yin.

252
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:51,800
A penny for your thoughts.

253
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,625
Do you feel like

254
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,458
we are a real…?

255
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:01,333
A real what?

256
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,666
We’re like a real couple.

257
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,800
I’ve never had such a happy meal

258
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,791
with my dad and mom

259
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,250
before.

260
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,500
Why?

261
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,375
You know we have lots of rules

262
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,000
at home,

263
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,500
even strict table manners.

264
00:11:35,225 --> 00:11:36,725
I’ve never felt like this.

265
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,375
Feel like commoners?

266
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,041
No.

267
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,225
It makes me feel calm

268
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,458
and secured.

269
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,875
It feels like a sweet home.

270
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:58,666
Yin Sichen.

271
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,575
Yes?

272
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,950
I wouldn’t have known what to do

273
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,458
if it hadn’t been you these days.

274
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,083
Thanks for being here.

275
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:19,916
No big deal.

276
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:25,458
I’m sleepy.

277
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,000
Lend me your shoulder.

278
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,425
You just waste your time on drawing.

279
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:14,875
Why did you come home so late?

280
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:17,875
Just finished after-school classes.

281
00:13:18,825 --> 00:13:19,425
I see.

282
00:13:21,475 --> 00:13:22,125
Well.

283
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,666
If there’s anything that upsets you,

284
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:25,666
you may talk to me.

285
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,375
How can I be upset?

286
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:28,750
But you.

287
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,416
Don’t keep everything to yourself.

288
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:31,833
It will get you sick.

289
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:33,708
In fact, you can tell me.

290
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,041
I can share it with you.

291
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,041
I…

292
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,791
May I talk about everything with you?

293
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,541
If you feel embarrassed,

294
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,666
you may draw it.

295
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:45,375
Follow me.

296
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,333
You may draw here.

297
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,083
It’ll be our message board.

298
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,500
If we share it together,

299
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:14,791
you won’t feel so sad.

300
00:14:15,025 --> 00:14:15,625
OK.

301
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:16,958
No matter what happens,

302
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:18,791
I’ll be there with you.

303
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,833
I said I’ll be there with you.

304
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,500
I’ll help you no matter what.

305
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:29,625
Even if

306
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,041
you’re in love with him.

307
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,708
Mom, have you seen my diary?

308
00:14:49,725 --> 00:14:50,583
Look for it carefully.

309
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,083
Is it in the box?

310
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,083
The lowest one?

311
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,325
OK.

312
00:14:58,825 --> 00:14:59,600
What are you looking for?

313
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,000
Let me help you.

314
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,041
My diary.

315
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,125
Diary.

316
00:15:12,575 --> 00:15:13,300
Hey.

317
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,291
Let me look.

318
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:15,925
Don’t.

319
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:19,708
Yin Sichen.

320
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,708
Gu Xixi, is it you when you were little?

321
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:22,458
No.

322
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,250
It’s not.

323
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:26,000
You were chased by a dog?

324
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:26,958
It’s not a dog.

325
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,250
It’s a fierce dog.

326
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,208
A dangerous and fierce dog.

327
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,416
A fierce dog?

328
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,458
Isn’t it you stole persimmons

329
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,208
and got beaten by the owner’s dog?

330
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,583
Mom. Why did you say it?

331
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,958
Gu Xixi, you stole persimmons?

332
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,708
Shame on you.

333
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,625
None of your business. Give it back.

334
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,125
Beg me.

335
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:46,208
I beg you.

336
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,791
I didn’t say
I’ll give it back if you do.

337
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,375
Xixi.

338
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,208
Yin Sichen.

339
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:53,958
Xixi, open the door.

340
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:54,916
Let me get the door.

341
00:15:55,925 --> 00:15:56,625
Here you are.

342
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,250
Stop.

343
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,375
There’s nothing you can help here.

344
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,525
Mr. Yin, you misunderstood me.

345
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,000
I’m just passing by.

346
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,166
And,

347
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,333
you should be confident about yourself.

348
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,166
I just don’t want to see your face.

349
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,208
I’m not here to visit you.

350
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,333
Mo Zixin, I need to warn you.

351
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,875
Stay away from Gu Xixi.

352
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,666
She’s my wife.

353
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,083
But I’m her schoolmate,

354
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,750
shareholder and idol.

355
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:52,583
Zixin.

356
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:55,666
Why are you here?

357
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,708
I just swing by to visit your mom.

358
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,850
Mo Zixin, you…

359
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:02,583
Mo is here.

360
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,208
Have you eaten dinner yet?

361
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:05,875
Not yet.

362
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,666
OK, then.

363
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:07,458
Come join us.

364
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:08,083
All right, thanks.

365
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,041
Come join us.

366
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,425
Thanks, Mom.

367
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,250
One more soup and we’re done.

368
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,208
Mom, let me cook it.

369
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,541
No. You stay here with them.

370
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,333
Help yourselves.

371
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,000
Thanks, Ma’am.

372
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,750
No problem.

373
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,583
Thanks, Mom.

374
00:17:31,975 --> 00:17:32,700
Let’s get started.

375
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,675
Here, try this.

376
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:39,125
That’s too oily.

377
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,041
Try this.

378
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,166
That’s my favorite.

379
00:17:52,075 --> 00:17:53,208
I didn’t know you liked it.

380
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:54,625
If I knew earlier,

381
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,875
I’ll help you.

382
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,333
This garlic. This one.

383
00:17:58,666 --> 00:17:59,666
It looks yummy.

384
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:00,250
Take it.

385
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,267
This pepper, I’m sure you’ll like it.

386
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,041
Can I just have some eggs?

387
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,041
- I’ll help.
- I’ll help.

388
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,125
Enough, that’s enough.

389
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:24,775
Stop.

390
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,791
Look at the connection between you two.

391
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:34,750
- Excuse me?
- Excuse me?

392
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,250
(Xinhongji Real Estate)

393
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,666
Please help me fax it.

394
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:50,333
OK.

395
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,583
Are you coming back for the meeting?

396
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,375
Please call it off.

397
00:18:55,925 --> 00:18:56,875
I’ll be busy tomorrow.

398
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:02,425
Never mind.

399
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:04,375
Let’s have the meeting as planned.

400
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,450
It’s my secret sanctuary back then.

401
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,291
I drew sad and happy things

402
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,208
on the wall.

403
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,708
Are these all your drawings?

404
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:24,950
Not really.

405
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,250
Also…

406
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:30,583
Mo Zixin’s.

407
00:19:35,025 --> 00:19:36,575
So you grew up together.

408
00:19:37,475 --> 00:19:39,125
Later before I knew I was leaving,

409
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,925
I drew a dandelion over there.

410
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,300
It means I’m leaving.

411
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,375
What are you doing?

412
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,000
Stay away.

413
00:19:47,275 --> 00:19:50,550
(Stay away)

414
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,200
Yin Sichen!

415
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,375
It’s running late.

416
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,975
I should go.

417
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,916
Wait.

418
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,650
What?

419
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,000
Just sit.

420
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,666
Sit down.

421
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,100
Would you like to move in?

422
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,625
What do you mean?

423
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,458
You left me every night

424
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,541
like Cinderella,

425
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,583
without leaving a glass slipper.

426
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,375
You mean

427
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,291
you want to…

428
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:34,891
Yes.

429
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,708
Would you?

430
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,166
Are you serious?

431
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:39,000
I am.

432
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,125
Are you prepared?

433
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:43,791
It’s all set.

434
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,708
I asked the cleaner to clean the closet.

435
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,083
You can move in anytime.

436
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,166
I can go get your luggage.

437
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:55,875
All right.

438
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,041
Answer my questions first.

439
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,500
They’re top reasons for breakups

440
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,875
after living together.

441
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,958
I must make sure we won’t have

442
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,291
such problems when we live together.

443
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:05,825
OK.

444
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,250
I’ll say each question first,

445
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:10,800
we give our answers at the same time.

446
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,400
All right.

447
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,125
Question 1.

448
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,416
Which side of bed do you sleep on?

449
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:17,375
- Left.
- Left.

450
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:22,125
I mean if you sleep on the right side,

451
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,208
I can sleep on the left.

452
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,125
If you choose the left side,

453
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,458
I can sleep on the right.

454
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,250
If you move in,

455
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,250
I can even sleep on the floor.

456
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,458
Question 2.

457
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,291
Do you shower at night

458
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,625
or in the morning?

459
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:34,750
I remember

460
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,500
she showered in the morning last time.

461
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,666
- In the morning.
- At night.

462
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:49,125
I can’t bear sleeping without showering.

463
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,375
Question 3.

464
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:56,000
Do you sleep with the light on or off?

465
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,208
- On.
- Off.

466
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,375
Come on. I…

467
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:01,250
OK.

468
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:02,541
The last one.

469
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:08,225
Do you prefer sweet
or salty jellied tofu?

470
00:22:08,225 --> 00:22:08,916
The last chance. Sweet.

471
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:09,666
- Sweet.
- Salty.

472
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:12,875
Look.

473
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,208
It’s obvious.

474
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,833
Living together is not good for us.

475
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:17,875
I… I can change.

476
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,166
Even if you do,

477
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,875
I don’t want people to

478
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,550
change their habits for me.

479
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,791
Otherwise, we’ll both be stressed out.

480
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,000
I feel like

481
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,958
we are not ready to live together

482
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,150
for now.

483
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:31,475
Let’s give it some time, okay?

484
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,208
Good boy.

485
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:34,416
I need to go.

486
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:39,050
Be careful.

487
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:42,750
Bye.

488
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,541
Gu Xixi, don’t you think

489
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:51,458
you’re not acting like a good wife

490
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:53,291
which will make people suspicious?

491
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:55,200
Really? What did I do?

492
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,300
Look at her.

493
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,225
Just help with your clothes.

494
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,750
I can also do that.

495
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,166
You’ll wear a tie for me every day,

496
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,583
Mrs. Yin.

497
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:18,041
Don’t you know how to do it?

498
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:18,750
Why are you asking me to wear your tie

499
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,750
when you can do it by yourself?

500
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,375
Are you giving me a hard time?

501
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:27,250
You have to act like it’s real.

502
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,450
Yin Sichen, don’t push me too hard.

503
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,416
All right, no more teasing.

504
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
♪Ah yeah♪

505
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,210
♪Does anyone♪

506
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:54,300
♪Make me like and care for him♪

507
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:55,791
Aren’t you going to the office?

508
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:56,958
Go. Don’t be late.

509
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:57,750
Go ahead.

510
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,916
I’m leaving.

511
00:23:58,916 --> 00:23:59,591
OK.

512
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,333
Have a good day at home.

513
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:03,083
I’ll take you somewhere after work.

514
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,375
OK. You need to go.

515
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:05,000
Bye.

516
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:05,675
OK.

517
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,416
It’s closed. Can we get in?

518
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,225
Didn’t you want to go on it with me?

519
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,083
But it’s been long abandoned.

520
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,208
I guess it won’t work.

521
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:44,675
Is it the Ferris wheel

522
00:24:44,675 --> 00:24:46,166
that you always wanted to get on?

523
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,625
It is.

524
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,400
You didn’t open it.

525
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:56,833
Open it now.

526
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,383
Actually, I already did.

527
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,750
It took me hours to find it
in the fountain.

528
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,916
I was almost mistaken as a thief.

529
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,791
You have two options now.

530
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:19,916
One,

531
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:23,041
keep it safe

532
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:24,575
as a memory.

533
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,250
Two,

534
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,708
put it in the slot.

535
00:25:32,475 --> 00:25:33,700
Turn on the wheel

536
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:36,916
to make it up

537
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:39,541
and open a new life.

538
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,525
Is

539
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:58,916
the coin invalid?

540
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:12,875
Looks like even that is afraid of you.

541
00:26:14,425 --> 00:26:15,083
Let’s go.

542
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:18,375
The keeper didn’t

543
00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:19,166
give me much time.

544
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:22,708
How beautiful!

545
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,958
The views up here

546
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,541
are exactly the same as I imagined.

547
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,200
When I was little,

548
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,125
I thought it wouldn’t be

549
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,916
fun to get on it when I grow up.

550
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:37,625
It turns out the opposite.

551
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:41,750
What you can see from here is different.

552
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:51,500
Yin Sichen.

553
00:26:51,725 --> 00:26:52,325
Yes?

554
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:53,541
Thank you.

555
00:26:57,525 --> 00:26:58,525
In fact,

556
00:27:01,075 --> 00:27:02,500
I should say thank you.

557
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:06,083
There are things I want to tell you.

558
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:10,666
Since you came to my home,

559
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:14,375
I’ve slept sound every night.

560
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,250
When you were not around,

561
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,825
I became restless.

562
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,200
When you were sad, I also became upset.

563
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:26,925
When you were happy,

564
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:29,958
it made me happy too.

565
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,350
I…

566
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:39,583

Xixi.

592

Yes?

593
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:50,375
I’ll pack up my things and go back

594
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:51,375
to the old house tomorrow.

595
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:54,791
You stay here with Sichen.

596
00:28:55,916 --> 00:28:57,750
Mom, why are you leaving?

597
00:28:58,166 --> 00:28:59,416
Don’t you want me to stay with you?

598
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:01,791
I know you care about me.

599
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:02,833
But I can’t let

600
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:04,625
you and Sichen be affected
because of me.

601
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:06,666
I don’t feel safe to leave you alone.

602
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,541
Mom, let me go to Meishan

603
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:10,000
and stay with you for a few more days.

604
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,950
All right.

605
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:17,458
Sichen is a good boy.

606
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:20,166
He is kind and considerate.

607
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:21,975
Xixi.

608
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:23,958
To be honest,

609
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:26,541
I wasn’t determined to

610
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:27,800
divorce your dad

611
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:30,916
because I was afraid your life
will fall apart.

612
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,166
But now

613
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:34,833
you have Sichen.

614
00:29:39,916 --> 00:29:41,875
Why am I talking about that?

615
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,250
From now on,

616
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,541
we’ll live happily ever after.

617
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:50,975
Yes.

618
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:52,750
All right.

619
00:29:54,825 --> 00:29:56,425
(Meishan)

620
00:30:07,925 --> 00:30:09,125
Ma’am, let me help you.

621
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:10,125
Mo, you’re here.

622
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:11,875
It’s a little heavy. Be careful.

623
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:12,458
It’s fine.

624
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:14,275
Come on.

625
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:19,291
I’m sorry, Ma’am.

626
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:20,125
I’m sorry.

627
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:21,333
It’s fine.

628
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:22,833
This is Xixi’s box.

629
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:23,958
It’s already broken.

630
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:24,750
Don’t worry.

631
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:26,291
I’m sorry, so sorry.

632
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,041
It’s OK.

633
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:30,333
She’s afraid her dad would toss it away.

634
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:32,825
So she kept it in my shop.

635
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,833
Here it is.

636
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,225
Is there

637
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:40,291
anything special about it?

638
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:43,083
She didn’t say much.

639
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:44,291
Put it up there.

640
00:30:45,725 --> 00:30:46,250
Come on.

641
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:46,750
OK.

642
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:48,500
She just told me

643
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:49,750
it’s a gift from

644
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,500
someone important to her.

645
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,475
Look.

646
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:54,875
There’s no empty space.

647
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:56,291
But she didn’t want to throw it away.

648
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:58,208
Once she was cleaning the room,

649
00:30:58,208 --> 00:30:58,875
but couldn’t find it.

650
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:01,041
She cried for a long time.

651
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:08,750
Thank you, Zixin.

652
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,916
Someone important.

653
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:17,458
Ma’am,

654
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:20,041
this pad is so dear to her.

655
00:31:20,175 --> 00:31:21,250
I’ll go back soon.

656
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,958
Why don’t you let me give it to her?

657
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,708
That’s great.

658
00:31:23,975 --> 00:31:24,708
I’m sure

659
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:25,916
she’ll be thrilled to see it.

660
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:26,875
That’s great!

661
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:37,625
It’s your birthday tomorrow.

662
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:39,375
Please make time for me.

663
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,375
9 PM tomorrow,

664
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:41,291
at Fisherman’s Wharf

665
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,208
I’ll meet you there.

666
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:43,666
Because

667
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,666
I want to know your answer.

668
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:47,225
Why shall I listen to you?

669
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:50,041
Make an appointment first, okay?

670
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,050
Hi, Zixin.

671
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,675
I’m at the cafe outside.

672
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,041
Are you free to meet up?

673
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:04,083
OK. I’ll be there soon.

674
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,541
Zixin.

675
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:14,925
Zixin.

676
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,041
Is it

677
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:17,750
my old drawing pad?

678
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:18,708
Yes.

679
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:20,875
I went back to Meishan today.

680
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,541
Your mom was sorting things out

681
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:23,708
and she found it.

682
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:24,875
She said it’s important to you.

683
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,625
So I brought it back.

684
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
My goodness.

685
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:31,500
I didn’t know I would find it again.

686
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:36,291
Zixin, I didn’t break my promise.

687
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:38,458
I am a designer now.

688
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,916
You are awesome.

689
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:41,800
I remember,

690
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:43,958
when you gave it to me,

691
00:32:44,291 --> 00:32:45,875
you encouraged me to keep drawing.

692
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:49,375
If it wasn’t your words,

693
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:51,375
I may not become a designer.

694
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:54,833
It’s not just for cheering you up.

695
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:00,375
I am a selfish person.

696
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:03,600
I wanted to leave something

697
00:33:04,541 --> 00:33:06,125
in your heart when I left.

698
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:09,041
So when you look at it again,

699
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
you’ll think of me.

700
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:13,875
Zixin.

701
00:33:15,225 --> 00:33:15,833
You...

702
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,333
When I met you for the first time,

703
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:21,550
I couldn’t help staring at you.

704
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:24,350
Even for one more glance.

705
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:26,250
The story of Nianxi

706
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:28,850
is actually about you.

707
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,075
Well.

708
00:33:39,725 --> 00:33:40,525
You may hug me.

710
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,625
What do you mean?

711
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:52,625
Zixin.

712
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:55,375
Are you Nianxi?

713
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:57,666
You know what?

714
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:00,875
You like drawing.

715
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,400
So I want to do the same thing.

716
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:07,291
Then I can get closer to you.

717
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:10,041
My comic stories

718
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:12,967
are the things I want to tell you.

Zixin.

720
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,100
I…

721
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,416
Sichen and I are…

722
00:34:33,475 --> 00:34:34,092
I know.

723
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:36,075
I know it.

724
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:38,541
You have a contract with him.

725
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:42,375
I can wait till it is expired,

726
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:43,775
till you’re free,

727
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,000
if you can give me one more chance.

728
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:48,775
You don’t have to answer me now.

(No.332, Jinchen North Street, Jiangbei)

735

What?

736
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:11,250
Mo Zixin is Nianxi?

737
00:35:11,525 --> 00:35:12,250
Yes.

738
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,333
And both of them

739
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:14,958
asked you for dinner on your birthday

740
00:35:14,958 --> 00:35:15,791
one after another?

741
00:35:16,025 --> 00:35:17,025
Oh my god!

742
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,816
Don’t get excited.

743
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:21,708
Nianxi, Nianxi.

744
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:23,458
It means “miss Xixi”?

745
00:35:24,425 --> 00:35:26,458
How touching it is!

746
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:32,375
But he was late.

747
00:35:32,525 --> 00:35:34,075
You already have Sichen.

748
00:35:34,075 --> 00:35:36,958
I… I’m not sure about that.

749
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,041
We haven’t confirmed our relations.

750
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,291
Don’t you love him?

751
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:46,500
I do.

752
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,150
So?

753
00:35:47,291 --> 00:35:49,850
But I’m not sure if it’s a fling

754
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:51,775
or

755
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:53,500
if he is the one

756
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,125
I can spend my life with.

(Yin: pros cons
Mo: pros cons)

759
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,416
How to make sure

760
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:04,208
if he is the right one?

761
00:36:04,416 --> 00:36:06,250
Just fill these columns.

762
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:07,708
The answer will be there.

763
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,625
Pros and cons.

764
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:12,250
Let’s start from Yin Sichen.

765
00:36:12,575 --> 00:36:13,275
Sarcastic.

766
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:16,083
People in his position are sarcastic.

767
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,275
Bossy, arrogant.

768
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:19,000
Arrogant.

769
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,375
- Narcissist.
- Narcissist.

770
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:21,833
Proud, mean.

771
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:24,041
Childish, unromantic.

772
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:27,208
That’s too many cons.

773
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:29,000
It looks like in your eyes, his cons

774
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,833
are just endless.

775
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:31,400
Yes.

776
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,666
Now the pros.

777
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:35,791
Pros.

778
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,650
Pros...

779
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:46,083
I can’t think of any.

780
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,916
Let’s turn to Mo Zixin’s pros.

781
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,250
Polite, gentle.

782
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,059
Tender, elegant.

783
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:56,041
Considerate, very nice to people.

784
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:57,625
He likes helping others

785
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:59,725
and never asks anything back.

786
00:37:02,575 --> 00:37:05,875
The answer is very obvious.

787
00:37:07,775 --> 00:37:08,525
Yes.

788
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,416
The answer is very obvious.

789
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:13,375
But

790
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,541
I don’t need an answer now.

791
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,700
All I think about

792
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:20,250
Yin Sichen are his cons.

793
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:24,083
But I don’t know from which moment,

794
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:26,541
all his cons

795
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,916
became the sweetest and brightest part

796
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,375
of my memory.

797
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,425
OK.

798
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,333
I think that’s what love is.

799
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,750
All you see about him are cons,

800
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,791
but you still have feelings for him.

801
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:52,958
I’ll see you off now.

802
00:37:53,375 --> 00:37:54,075
All right, Mr. Yin.

803
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:55,875
Goodbye.

804
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:06,500
Well, well, I just see you everywhere.

805
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,325
Isn’t Xixi with you?

806
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,166
Please send my words to her.

807
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,791
I’ll invite her to dinner tomorrow.

808
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:15,125
Mo Zixin. Gu Xixi is my wife.

809
00:38:15,916 --> 00:38:17,393
Please respect

810
00:38:17,393 --> 00:38:18,875
the fact that she’s married.

811
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,200
Is it written in your contract that

812
00:38:22,325 --> 00:38:24,125
she’s not allowed to dine with others?

813
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,875
What do you mean?

814
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,666
Don’t worry.

815
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:34,208
I never confirmed with Xixi.

816
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:36,333
I don’t plan to leak it.

817
00:38:38,958 --> 00:38:40,083
What do you want?

818
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:42,416
I won’t dig out why you did this.

819
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,925
But I need to tell you.

820
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:45,791
A contracted marriage

821
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,916
will end up some day.

822
00:38:48,325 --> 00:38:49,616
And I’ll wait until that day.

823
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,000
How much longer will it take, please?

824
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:20,208
It’s jammed. I’m not sure.

825
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,100
It may take a few minutes,

826
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:24,000
or 30 minutes.

827
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:27,166
You may finish the order.

828
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:28,166
I’m getting off now.

829
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:29,583
Right here?

830
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:30,875
Yeah. It’s fine.

831
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,375
Be careful.

832
00:39:34,525 --> 00:39:35,125
OK.

833
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,416
(LOVE)

834
00:39:40,416 --> 00:39:42,250
Mr. Yin, we’ll be closed soon.

835
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,050
What about…?

836
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:43,875
Let’s wait.

837
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:45,375
We can wait till 10.

838
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,125
If your guest has not arrived
before that,

839
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:48,250
there’s nothing we can help.

840
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,458
OK.

841
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:50,458
I got it.

842
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:50,425
