(Sichen)

24
00:01:54,325 --> 00:01:55,333
Hello, Sichen.

25
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,208
What’s up?

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,416
If you didn’t answer my phone again,

27
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:58,166
I would call the police.

28
00:01:58,625 --> 00:01:59,458
Where have you been all night?

29
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:00,458
I need an explanation.

30
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,333
I’m with Ruona.

31
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:03,625
You’re together?

32
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:04,375
You two made up?

33
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,450
Yes.

34
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,125
I need help.

35
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:09,291
- Gu Xixi...
- Yin Sichen,

36
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,000
it’s your problem.

37
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:12,957
Don’t bother Shang Ke.

38
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,082
He is mine.

39
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:22,541
Ruona,

40
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,625
you just said I’m yours.

41
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,541
It’s too late to regret.

42
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,250
Right.

43
00:02:37,082 --> 00:02:38,150
I hit the ball.

44
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,707
Good job!

45
00:02:39,957 --> 00:02:41,125
I finally got somewhere.

46
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,125
Right.

47
00:02:59,675 --> 00:03:00,341
Sichen.

48
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:01,884
Stop it.

49
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,582
No, I want to practice.

50
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:06,541
What are you doing?

51
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:06,957
Go.

52
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:11,750
Sichen.

53
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,750
I want to please your mom.

54
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,525
So I have to learn

55
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,250
her favorite sports so that I can

56
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,125
have a common topic with her, right?

57
00:03:21,457 --> 00:03:23,000
But Golf is too difficult for you.

58
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:24,832
Let us choose a simple one.

59
00:03:24,832 --> 00:03:27,125
What’s simple? What choice do I have?

60
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,525
No matter Italian or swimming,

61
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,791
I can’t learn any of them.

62
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,625
Then we won’t learn any.

63
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:36,582
You just have to be yourself.

64
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:40,957
Be myself?

65
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,625
If so, I think

66
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,707
the barbecue smells good.

67
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,125
When I passed by the stall just now,

68
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,207
I just wanted to have a barbecue.

69
00:03:49,207 --> 00:03:51,250
I haven’t eaten anything all day

70
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,457
because a celebrity needs
to have a good figure.

71
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,125
I only ate vegetables.

72
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,666
If I fail to do so,

73
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,332
your mom won’t like me.

74
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:00,125
What if she wants to separate us?

75
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:07,457
Follow me.

76
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,193
Sit down.

77
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,915
- Wait a second.
- Sichen.

78
00:04:17,665 --> 00:04:19,708
Sir, hot spicy chicken wings.

79
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,415
OK.

80
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,375
Sichen.

81
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,468
I can’t eat this.

82
00:04:31,665 --> 00:04:32,708
I’ll eat

83
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,833
and get fat with you.

84
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,415
Screw body management and celebrity.

85
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,125
It has nothing to do with us.

86
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,000
We are just two ordinary persons.

87
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:44,150
We eat what we like

88
00:04:44,665 --> 00:04:46,040
and do what we love to do.

89
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,000
I love you.

90
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,790
So I don’t want you to change yourself

91
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,290
because of anyone or anything.

92
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:54,165
You’re already good enough.

93
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:58,958
All right, stop crying.

94
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,540
I love you too.

95
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,475

00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,865
you’ll get caught in the middle.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,040
If I can make her like me...

99
00:05:13,665 --> 00:05:14,583
I can make her like me

100
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,250
by changing a little,

101
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,125
and may not put you on the spot,

102
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,040
I’m willing to try.

What are you doing back home?

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,290
Why didn’t you tell me in advance?

121
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,583
We didn’t have time to prepare to

122
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,290
meet you.

123
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:50,833
Where’s my dad?

124
00:06:53,257 --> 00:06:54,800
He has work to do

125
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,925
so he can’t come back and cover for you.

126
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,225
Mom, it’s my fault to get married
without telling you.

127
00:07:03,725 --> 00:07:05,540
But it was urgent then

128
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,040
and I didn’t have time to
explain it to you.

129
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:09,790
You can rest assured.

130
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:11,915
Now we are very happy.

131
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,875
I haven’t introduced her to you yet.

132
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,665
This is...

133
00:07:15,665 --> 00:07:17,040
This must be Miss Gu, right?

134
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,792
Nice to meet you, auntie.

135
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,025
Mom.

136
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,875
If I hadn’t watched the news,

137
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,083
I wouldn’t have known

138
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,665
I had a daughter-in-law.

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,165
Let’s go to have dinner.

140
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:45,810
Mom, try this steak.

141
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
The black pepper sauce

142
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,225
has been cooked by Xixi
since last night.

143
00:07:51,225 --> 00:07:51,825
Um.

144
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:10,875
How do you like it?

145
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:18,665
It tastes OK.

146
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:21,875
By the way,

147
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,000
I heard Miss Gu is from Jiangbei.

148
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,375
Yes, I grew up in Jiangbei.

149
00:08:29,915 --> 00:08:31,250
What do you do for work?

150
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,583
I majored in design.

151
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,375
I opened a store

152
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,916
with my friend.

153
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,083
Why Mall got

154
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,208
the exclusive agency of Alex this time

155
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:44,666
thanks to Xixi.

156
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,000
Alex also thought highly of her

157
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,375
and asked her to be responsible for

158
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,166
Why Mall series.

159
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,500
Sichen flattered me.

160
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,583
In fact, it’s all his credit.

161
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,083
I communicated with Mr. Alex

162
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,791
about design

163
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,541
and then did a little help.

164
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,375
Let’s eat.

165
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,041
- Grandma, please.
- Go ahead.

166
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:12,000
Come on, try this. Xixi made it.

167
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,083
Wait!

168
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,708
Sichen didn’t eat yam since childhood.

169
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,250
Don’t you know that?

170
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,583
You have been married for so long.

171
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,708
You should know and
care about each other.

172
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,458
How can I rest assured that

173
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:27,666
you can’t figure out such a small thing?

174
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,041
Mom.

175
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,666
Xixi has made some changes

176
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:35,250
to the yam.

177
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:36,458
Right.

178
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,458
Xixi is

179
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,583
attentive and careful.

180
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:41,916
She treats Sichen

181
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,916
no worse than you.

182
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,833
Stop chatting. The dishes are cold.

183
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,541
Let’s eat.

184
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:51,916
Come on.

185
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,416
Go ahead. Try it.

186
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:03,708
What’s up?

187
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,500
Don’t you think I didn’t

188
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
behave well enough at dinner?

189
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,750
You’ve done a good job.

190
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,666
My mom has been confused by you

191
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,041
and was out of moves. Don’t you see?

192
00:10:21,975 --> 00:10:24,975
But I still want to do better.

193
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,708
I already have an idea.

194
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:30,917
But I’m not sure if it works or not.

195
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,791
You can rest assured.

196
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,458
Even if my mom is hard on you,

197
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,208
won’t I help you?

198
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,000
Good boy.

199
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,791
Look, I’m her son.

200
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:44,291
Since I like you,

201
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,333
she’ll accept you slowly.

202
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,041
I know you feel uncomfortable at home.

203
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:53,750
Well,

204
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,250
let’s go out on a date tomorrow.

205
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,250
I’ll arrange everything.

206
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:04,291
You just need to show up on time.

207
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,833
Give me a chance, Mrs. Yin.

208
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,875
Then I give you the chance.

209
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,166
Speaking of sons,

210
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,416
how about having a son?

211
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,291
I like daughters very much, too.

212
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,208
Go away.

213
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,916
Auntie, these

214
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,708
supplements are selected by me for you.

215
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,550
They are good for your health.

216
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,375
Xiwei, it’s nice of you.

217
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,250
Auntie, you went abroad

218
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,166
for recuperation days ago.

219
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,166
Do you feel better now?

220
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,666
How can it be so fast?

221
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,791
I just went out for a new environment

222
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,083
and a new mood.

223
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,208
Auntie, if you don’t mind,

224
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,375
I can come to stay with you.

225
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:53,458
Good idea.

226
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,117
Mom.

227
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:56,583
Miss Ran.

228
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,166
By the way, Xiwei,

229
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,916
aren’t you a fashion editor?

230
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,416
You two

231
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,458
should have a lot in common.

232
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,400
Xixi

233
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,750
has Sichen to help her.

234
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:15,208
I don’t think I can help her.

235
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,166
Seriously?

236
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,000
Sichen indeed helped me a lot.

237
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,041
Because of Sichen,

238
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:21,958
I’m not tired at work.

239
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,416
Mom, if you’re free,

240
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,791
we could go to my store.

241
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,208
Auntie is so busy

242
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,750
that she should have no time.

243
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,000
OK.

244
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,541
I have nothing to do this afternoon.

245
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:36,708
Let’s pay a visit.

246
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,375
Xiwei,

247
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,500
join me?

248
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:42,541
OK, auntie.

249
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,083
Xixi, there you are.

250
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
This is...

251
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,791
Let me introduce for you.
This is Sichen’s mom.

252
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,750
Mom, this is Xiaoya,

253
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:58,500
my best friend.

254
00:12:58,875 --> 00:12:59,458
Hello.

255
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,166
Hello, auntie.

256
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,083
Just like Xixi said,

257
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,291
you’re so elegant.

258
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:06,541
Mom, take a seat.

259
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:07,416
I’ll get you a glass of water.

260
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,000
OK.

261
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,166
Auntie, please take a seat.

262
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,350
I’m going to help her.

263
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:12,900
Um.

264
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,916
Why is Ran Xiwei here?

265
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,541
She happened to be at my home.

266
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,500
I’m sure she’s here to pick on you.

267
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,083
Forget it. She has come.

268
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:23,916
By the way,

269
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,666
get the dress I made for my mom.

270
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:27,175
OK.

271
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:28,583
Go.

272
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,625
Xiwei, you’re a professional.

273
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,175
What do you think of these clothes?

274
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:46,958
Auntie,

275
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,125
I wrote a report

276
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,916
for CICI.

277
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,708
But it caused trouble.

278
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,333
Auntie, don’t worry.

279
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,458
I’ve solved it.

280
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,125
How could it happen?

281
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,541
Mom, here is the water.

282
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:01,458
OK.

283
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,625
It was nothing.

284
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,166
Xiwei just praised me excessively.

285
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,000
Xiwei grew up with Sichen.

286
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:13,666
She’s

287
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,541
like my daughter.

288
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,875
That’s her personality.

289
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,166
Don’t take it personally.

290
00:14:20,925 --> 00:14:22,958
Mom, I made a dress

291
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,416
for you.

292
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:26,875
I wonder if you like it.

293
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:27,875
Xiaoya.

294
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:28,916
Coming.

295
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,666
Your design has always been innovative.

296
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,000
But this dress

297
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:41,875
is less than perfect.

298
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,583
Given the status and

299
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,625
aesthetics of auntie,

300
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:46,833
this dress

301
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:47,916
doesn’t fit her.

302
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,625
Not this dress.

303
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,333
I’m sorry, I got the wrong one.

304
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,708
Miss Ran,

305
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,208
don’t you remember this dress?

306
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,541
You wore it

307
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,541
at the Fashion Celebration.

308
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,208
Xixi thought

309
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,750
it didn’t fit you well.

310
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,625
She bought

311
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:08,875
and altered it for you.

312
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,166
It was chosen by yourself.

313
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:13,750
By the way,

314
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:14,875
I think

315
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,166
you should

316
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,916
pay attention to your image.

317
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,833
Or, size zero clothes won’t fit you.

318
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,916
Because you’re too fat.

319
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,000
Thank you, Miss Gu.

320
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,833
Auntie, I’ve got some stuff.

321
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:34,958
I’m leaving.

322
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,833
Take care on the road.

323
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:37,400
OK.

324
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:43,833
The dress!

325
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,325
Sorry, mom.

326
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,083
Xiaoya took the wrong one.

327
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,500
Sorry, auntie.

328
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,958
I’m going to get the right dress.

329
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:55,000
Xixi, Xiwei is not an ordinary girl.

330
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,250
You really impressed me.

331
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,775
Auntie, this one is for you.

332
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:08,458
Mom, I made this dress for you.

333
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,625
So beautiful.

334
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:19,958
Very nice.

335
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,708
Seems that you have worked hard.

336
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,000
Sure.

337
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,208
Xixi said she must do her best

338
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,458
to make this dress for you.

339
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,100
She stayed up late for several days.

340
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,000
Well,

341
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,125
I have a gathering in two days.

342
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,416
I’ll wear it.

343
00:16:38,775 --> 00:16:40,000
Glad you like it.

344
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:43,958
Remember!

345
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,208
Violinist, cakes and flowers.

346
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:47,458
Prepare all of these.

347
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,458
Do it as romantic as it can.

348
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,916
How come you’re so wordy now?

349
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:51,916
Consider it done.

350
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:52,458
And

351
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,416
you get caught in the middle.

352
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:55,500
Don’t you feel aggrieved?

353
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,875
As long as my mom can accept Xixi,

354
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,541
I’d rather be aggrieved.

355
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,708
This is the price of love.

356
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,166
Single people like you won’t get it.

357
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,583
Right, I don’t get it.

358
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,000
But at least, I’m smart.

359
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:07,791
Sichen.

360
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,333
Mom.

361
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,166
What are you doing here?

362
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,708
Don’t forget, I’m also a shareholder.

363
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,083
I came to inspect your work.

364
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,000
Do you mind?

365
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:17,916
Fei’ang,

366
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,166
bring me the reports of each department.

367
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:21,625
Yes, madam.

368
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,916
Would you like to start serving now?

369
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,500
No, not now.

370
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,291
OK.

371
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,333
Get me a glass of water.

372
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:35,958
OK.

373
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,208
Are you in a hurry?

374
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,208
I have an appointment later.

375
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,125
I’m...

376
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,416
With whom?

377
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:01,708
Is dating

378
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,041
more important than business?

379
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:05,958
No.

380
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:07,916
It’s Gu Xixi, right?

381
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,333
You’re really obsessed

382
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,666
and getting more careless.

383
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,375
Sometimes I even think

384
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,666
you’re not as sensible as Gu Xixi.

385
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,416
Mom, you said she was sensible.

386
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,250
Why don’t you recognize her?

387
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,583
I didn’t cultivate you

388
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,875
to fall short of success

389
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,083
when you met her.

390
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,125
She’ll ruin you.

391
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,791
Mom, you’re wrong.

392
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,333
She never ruined me

393
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,541
but helped put me where I am.

394
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:35,958
Because of her,

395
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,833
I know what love is.

396
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:39,708
She also

397
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,708
brought me another kind of life.

398
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,625
She has done so much for me.

399
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,375
I can see what she has done.

400
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,625
Why do you turn a blind eye?

401
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,625
It doesn’t matter if you’re wrong.

402
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,041
It’s not too late to make things right.

403
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,083
It’s just like a business.

404
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,125
It doesn’t matter if you lose.

405
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,291
The most important is to stop loss.

406
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,791
How can feelings be compared with
business?

407
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,250
There is no winning or losing.

408
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,675
Gu Xixi is my only love.

409
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,916
This won’t change anyway.

410
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:20,458
Mom.

411
00:19:21,825 --> 00:19:23,617
No matter what I like since childhood,

412
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,200
you’ll take it away from me

413
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,458
without hesitation.

414
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,684
I used to follow your arrangement.

415
00:19:28,975 --> 00:19:29,892
But this time,

416
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,625
I want to protect her.

417
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,208
Nice place. Let’s come back next time.

418
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,083
OK.

419
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,925
Sorry, sir.

420
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:56,875
We’re closed.

421
00:19:57,725 --> 00:19:59,791
Sir, we’re closed.

422
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:00,791
If you need a meal,

423
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,125
please come tomorrow.

you think I’m an evil mother-in-law.

and self-motivated.

00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:29,791
I want ice cream.

471
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:30,625
Not me?

472
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:31,125
Ice cream.

473
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:31,750
Not me?

474
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,475
Ice cream.

475
00:22:32,475 --> 00:22:33,350
- Not me?
- Ice cream.

476
00:22:33,425 --> 00:22:34,142
Not me?

477
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:17,083
Mom, you asked me

478
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,541
to carry bags for you.

479
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:19,916
Listen to yourself.

480
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:21,291
Don’t tell me that you want Xixi to
carry them.

481
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,583
Honey, thank you.

482
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,208
My pleasure.

483
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:31,750
But my mom is a bit biased.

484
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,458
She only knows her daughter-in-law
but not her son.

485
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:34,000
You...

486
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:35,125
You little rascal!

487
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,750
I’ll cook something delicious
for you, OK?

488
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,291
Hey,

489
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:44,958
Xixi.

490
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:46,550
Come here.

491
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:48,083
Look at this shirt.

492
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,250
It really suits you.

493
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:50,166
Try it on.

494
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:51,791
Coming.

495
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:54,458
OK.

496
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,166
Try it on.

497
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:56,958
OK.

498
00:24:00,775 --> 00:24:02,333
Is it OK? Like it?

499
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:02,900
Yes.

500
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:03,750
I like it.

501
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,370
- Hungry?
- The restaurant you introduced.

502
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,625
- How do you like it?
- It’s really nice.

503
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:09,250
- See, they’re all there.
- A nice place with a good environment.

504
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,000
Hi, there.

505
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,916
- Coming.
- Come here. Come here.

506
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:12,083
I’m sorry.

507
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:12,791
We’re all waiting for you.

508
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:15,250
We got stuck on the road.

509
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:15,875
Sit here.

510
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,750
Sit.

511
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,916
I haven’t seen you for a while.

512
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,541
You look better.

513
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:20,916
If I’m free,

514
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,375
I’ll go abroad for a short stay.

515
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:24,250
I’m flattered.

516
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,083
It’s all

517
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,166
Xixi and Sichen’s credit.

518
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:28,791
With them around me,

519
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:29,916
I feel much better.

520
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,708
- Then I have good health.
- Yes, that’s right.

521
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:33,416
You know how to enjoy life.

522
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,041
This is Miss Gu, right?

523
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,833
Just call me Xixi.

524
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:39,000
Hello, aunts.

525
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:40,291
Hope I’m not disturbing you.

526
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:41,791
- No.
- No.

527
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:43,875
- You’re so pretty.
- Right.

528
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:46,458
You’re much prettier than
when we were young.

529
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:48,125
Of course.

530
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:50,583
Xixi’s really beautiful.

531
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,875
How do you like my dress?

532
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:54,750
- So gorgeous!
- Beautiful, right?

533
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,400
So beautiful.

534
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,208
Look at the pattern.

535
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:58,666
It was designed by Xixi.

536
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,708
It’s really nice.

537
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,458
Can Xixi design dresses?

538
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:03,625
What do you know?

539
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,083
It’s a delight in life.

540
00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:08,666
I also usually

541
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:10,291
make some clothes

542
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:11,666
and tablecloths

543
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:13,025
to pass the time.

544
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:14,916
That’s not the case, auntie.

545
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:16,916
I’m a designer.

546
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:18,041
It’s my job.

547
00:25:18,325 --> 00:25:19,875
I opened a store.

548
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:20,916
Not bad.

549
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:21,750
You opened a store?

550
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,875
See,

551
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:26,708
she is really something.

552
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:29,583
If my daughter is half as good as her,

553
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:31,541
I’ll rest assured.

554
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,625
If your daughter was
interested in such things,

555
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:35,083
she would have gone into business.

556
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:35,700
But

557
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,583
she prefers academic study.

558
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:39,791
Forget it.

559
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:41,958
We talked over on the phone last night.

560
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,833
She’ll study for a doctorate.

561
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:46,458
That’s a good thing.

562
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:47,666
Xixi,

563
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,958
which college were you in?

564
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:53,708
Is it in France or Italy?

565
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,250
It’s Jiangbei College of Design.

566
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:57,500
Jiangbei?

567
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:00,708
There is such a college in Jiangbei?

568
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:02,458
I’ve never heard of it.

569
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:05,166
Xixi is smart

570
00:26:05,425 --> 00:26:06,875
and capable.

571
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,041
No college can cultivate such talent.

572
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:09,916
Right?

573
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,600
Yeah, that’s right.

574
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,175
Yeah.

575
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:13,458
That’s true.

576
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:15,500
We’ll have a wine party this weekend.

577
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,000
- Really?
- Be sure to attend.

578
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,575
Yes.

579
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:30,333
Xixi.

580
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:30,958
Mom.

581
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:32,958
In fact,

582
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:35,291
they meant no harm.

583
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:36,708
Don’t take it to heart.

584
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:37,583
I won’t, mom.

585
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:38,500
Don’t worry.

586
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,500
I know

587
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:40,833
in your eyes,

588
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:44,375
a rich life is not enviable.

589
00:26:44,666 --> 00:26:46,416
Living this way

590
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:48,000
has become a burden.

591
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,291
But

592
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,458
this is

593
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:53,125
our usual life.

594
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:54,750
It’s also Sichen’s life.

595
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:57,083
Since you chose him,

596
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:58,666
you have to adapt to each other

597
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:01,083
and care for each other.

598
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,458
Not everyone can be Mrs. Yin.

599
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:06,291
Am I right?

600
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,083
I see what you mean.

601
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:10,625
I know

602
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:12,875
you will still have difficulties

603
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:14,291
on this road.

604
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,166
But don’t worry,

605
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:17,416
Xixi.

606
00:27:17,666 --> 00:27:19,458
No matter what it is,

607
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:21,000
I will fully support you.

608
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:23,833
Thank you, mom.

609
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:26,791
We’re family.

610
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:30,541
Welcome, Mr. Mo.

611
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:31,208
Hello.

612
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:32,208
As usual?

613
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:32,975
Yes.

614
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:35,333
OK, please.

615
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:36,083
Wait a second.

616
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:40,750
Xixi?

617
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:42,791
Zixin?

618
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,159
May I join you?

619
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,916
I’ve seen a lot of news about you.

620
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:51,458
You get along quite well.

621
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:52,666
I bless you.

622
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:54,875
Thank you.

623
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:03,916
What’s up?

624
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,041
Any problem?

625
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:11,458
Sichen’s mom

626
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:15,500
said something to me before.

627
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:17,791
I can’t help thinking.

628
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:20,958
She gave you a hard time?

629
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:23,083
No. No. No.

630
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:25,750
I mean,

631
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:28,000
Sichen’s mom treats me well.

632
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,125
She took me to a gathering.

633
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:32,583
Then I found that even though

634
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:35,291
Sichen and I have been through a lot,

635
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:36,875
and we are in love,

636
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,916
to outsiders,

637
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:40,833
we’re from two different worlds.

638
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:45,791
It’s so hard to be together.

639
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:52,791
I know that you won’t

640
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:54,875
be defeated by difficulties.

641
00:28:57,175 --> 00:28:57,875
Xixi,

642
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,083
you’re a good friend of mine.

643
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,725
I really hope you are happy.

644
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:07,175
You’re truly happy.

645
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:10,458
Don’t worry, Zixin.

646
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,208
I’m happy now.

647
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:16,375
I’m just thinking about something.

648
00:29:17,416 --> 00:29:18,500
Between me and Sichen,

649
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:20,250
as long as he doesn’t tell me personally

650
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,291
that he doesn’t like me

651
00:29:22,316 --> 00:29:23,541
or he’ll separate with me,

652
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:24,916
I’m sure nothing can

653
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:25,958
separate us.

654
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:28,625
I’ve decided.

655
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:30,166
I shouldn’t think about these now.

656
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:32,750
I should try to make progress

657
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:33,833
so that everyone will know

658
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:35,875
I’m not worse than anyone.

659
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:38,000
I’ll strive to make CICI the best

660
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:38,958
so that everyone will consider

661
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,916
me as the best partner of Sichen
at work.

662
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:42,833
Cheers.

663
00:29:43,041 --> 00:29:43,541
Come on.

664
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:49,125
What are you laughing at?

665
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:51,208
You don’t think I’ll succeed?

666
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,166
I just wonder

667
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:57,375
why you

668
00:29:57,625 --> 00:29:58,500
always have

669
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,250
a steady stream of courage and hope.

670
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:02,208
You know,

671
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:04,375
not everyone can still

672
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:06,041
maintain the same faith and courage

673
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:07,458
after being through a lot.

674
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:10,500
I don’t seem to be as good as you said.

675
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,375
Xixi,

676
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:18,458
I wish you two happiness.

677
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:20,041
And

678
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,625
no matter what decision you make,

679
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:25,458
I will always support you.

680
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:26,916
It’s just because

681
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:29,250
we’re friends.

682
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:32,208
Thank you.

683
00:30:32,825 --> 00:30:33,491
By the way,

684
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,375
didn’t you just say

685
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,875
you wanted to expand CICI?

686
00:30:36,975 --> 00:30:37,541
Yes.

687
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:38,833
I have good advice for you.

688
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,600
First,

689
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,075
I want to expand the store.

690
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:45,208
Then...

691
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:49,550
(Refresher Course Arrangement)

692
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:51,041
Study visit?

693
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,275
Yes.

694
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:54,666
Look,

695
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:56,708
there have been so many setbacks

696
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:58,291
since the opening of CICI.

697
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,208
Each one caught me off guard.

698
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:01,666
I think I have

699
00:31:01,708 --> 00:31:02,708
too little experience.

700
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:05,541
So I’m going to take a refresher course

701
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:07,000
to improve myself.

702
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:09,925
Um.

703
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,875
If you’ve thought about it,

704
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,250
there is no problem.

705
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:18,666
You know

706
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:21,083
I always support you.

707
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,875
Really? You’ll support me?

708
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:23,541
Sure.

709
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,458
I’ll pick you up every day.

710
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:26,083
OK?

711
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:28,833
It’s out of town.

712
00:31:32,541 --> 00:31:33,708
Out of town?

713
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:36,958
It doesn’t matter. I’ll go with you.

714
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:42,375
Three months should be too long for you.

715
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:43,041
How long?

716
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:44,791
Three months.

717
00:31:44,791 --> 00:31:45,541
So long!

718
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,708
And out of town.

719
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:50,333
No.

720
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:51,625
Absolutely no.

721
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:56,500
The three-month course
is the shortest one.

722
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,583
I have many things to learn.

723
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:58,666
So three months are not enough.

724
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:05,250
I can teach you anything
you want to learn.

725
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,708
Why bother to take a refresher course?

726
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,125
I also want you to spoil me,

727
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:13,458
and take the profit.

728
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,333
But it’s not me.

729
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,000
I still want to work hard.

730
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:19,041
You’ve worked hard, really!

731
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:23,375
So you just don’t support me?

732
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:27,708
I support you

733
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,291
for sure.

734
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:31,708
Of course, I’m in favor of your study.

735
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:32,541
I’ll not only support you

736
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:33,958
but also be your strong backing.

737
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,958
But you have to think about it.

738
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:36,666
It’ll be three months.

739
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:37,300
Um.

740
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:39,291
Won’t you miss me?

741
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,000
I will.

742
00:32:41,575 --> 00:32:43,125
I’m sure I’ll miss you.

743
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:43,791
Right.

744
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:46,041
But I have to work.

745
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:49,375
You can’t stand being separated from me

746
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:50,375
for three months?

747
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:53,250
Who am I?

748
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:55,500
I’m Yin Sichen, a workaholic.

749
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:57,958
Am I an idiot
who sticks to my girlfriend

750
00:32:57,958 --> 00:32:59,791
once I fall in love?

751
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,750
No, I’m a mature adult.

752
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:05,666
Long-distance love

753
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:07,083
is not a problem for me.

754
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:08,500
I definitely won’t miss you.

755
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:09,791
I’ll be fine.

756
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:11,125
Then we agree that

757
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,125
you won’t text and call me

758
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:15,041
from morning to night every day

759
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:16,083
to affect my study.

760
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:17,291
Let’s make a deal.

761
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:19,250
Ten calls a day.

762
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:21,666
Don’t you think it’s too many?

763
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:22,791
My class will start from 8:00 AM

764
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:23,666
to 10:00 PM.

765
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:24,791
Let’s make a call

766
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:26,250
before sleep, OK?

767
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Are you serious?

768
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:31,041
What kind of courses will be scheduled

769
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:31,833
for more than 12 hours a day?

770
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:33,083
How can you have time to rest?

771
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:34,333
Forget it.

772
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:35,875
Forget about ten calls a day.

773
00:33:35,916 --> 00:33:36,916
Let’s make it a text per day.

774
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:39,000
You have to eat regularly and get rest.

775
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:40,791
OK.

776
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:42,166
I know you’re the most considerate.

777
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,875
How dare you say OK?

778
00:33:45,708 --> 00:33:46,291
OK.

779
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:48,583
When will you leave? I’ll see you off.

780
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:49,750
The day after tomorrow.

781
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:56,333
Sichen.

782
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:06,333
Gu Xixi, what are you looking for?

783
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:08,958
Sichen, have you seen my ID card?

784
00:34:10,708 --> 00:34:12,875
No, I haven’t. Keep looking carefully.

785
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:21,208
Is it in the bag?

786
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:24,958
No, it’s not in here.

787
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,625
Gu Xixi!

788
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:32,583
Ouch, it hurts.

789
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:34,000
- Come here, hurry!
- What’s with you?

790
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:35,041
Come here and help me.

791
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,333
Where are you hurting?

792
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:38,500
My head.

793
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:44,166
It hurts.

794
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,333
Here?

795
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:47,025
Um.

796
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:48,833
It hurts badly.

797
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:51,625
Let me have a look.

798
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:14,083
Gu Xixi, you used your feminine wiles.

799
00:35:14,825 --> 00:35:16,791
I know you hid it.

800
00:35:17,125 --> 00:35:18,583
Haven’t you agreed?

801
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,083
Why did you back out?

802
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:22,458
I just think

803
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:24,416
putting your ID card under my pillow

804
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:26,166
will make me sleep soundly.

805
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,791
Maybe I’ll dream about you.

806
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:28,333
Right?

807
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:31,666
Aren’t I right next to you?

808
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:49,041
Fei’ang.

809
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:55,166
How’s the weather tomorrow?

810
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:57,041
It’ll be

811
00:35:58,541 --> 00:35:59,208
cloudy.

812
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:00,541
That’s good.

813
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:03,833
I still have a chance if it’s cloudy.

814
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:05,166
If it’s raining heavily,

815
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:06,541
the flight will be cancelled, right?

816
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:08,583
The rainfall probability is 10%.

817
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,000
Why? Are you going on a business trip?

818
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:11,525
- I think...
- Not me.

819
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:12,500
It’s Gu Xixi.

820
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:15,708
If you don’t want Miss Gu

821
00:36:15,916 --> 00:36:16,666
to go on business,

822
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:17,875
just tell her.

823
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:19,916
Am I lovestruck?

824
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:23,083
I’m a cold fish, OK?

825
00:36:24,083 --> 00:36:25,708
She didn’t tell me
that she would miss me

826
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,041
and she couldn’t bear to leave me.

827
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:27,750
How can I directly tell her?

828
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,075
I can’t, right?

829
00:36:29,075 --> 00:36:29,675
Um.

830
00:36:32,416 --> 00:36:33,541
You’re so stubborn that...

831
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:36,250
Tomorrow will be sunny.

832
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,708
Contact the airline

833
00:36:43,708 --> 00:36:45,150
and I’ll purchase it.

834
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:46,625
OK.

835
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:49,541
Hello, this is Why Mall.

836
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,500
Do you sell a UFO?

837
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:54,625
You do. Good.

838
00:37:22,525 --> 00:37:24,333
Why is the photo in my luggage case?

839
00:37:26,225 --> 00:37:27,392
I’m afraid you’ll miss me.

840
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,208
It’s used to comfort you.

841
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:34,708
What about the T-shirt?

842
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:38,666
It’s customized by me.

843
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:39,833
I tell you.

844
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:41,958
You must wear this T-shirt
on the first day of school,

845
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:43,666
showing that you’ve got married

846
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:45,166
and you’re my wife.

847
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:47,333
I believe few people in the world

848
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:49,375
dare to take you away from me.

849
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:54,416
Why did you

850
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:56,333
take out all these clothes?

851
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,375
These clothes

852
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:00,083
show too much skin and are so beautiful.

853
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:02,175
You’re not allowed to wear them
for others.

854
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:05,416
You’re going to study.

855
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:07,708
So T-shirts and jeans will be proper.

856
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:09,125
Why will you wear dresses?

857
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:12,875
Sichen, I’m going to study.

858
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,375
These clothes are designed by me.

859
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:16,958
I have to take some of my works

860
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,125
for exchanges.

861
00:38:26,825 --> 00:38:27,925
Pack up them by yourself.

862
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:30,250
Sichen.

863
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:40,166
I think this T-shirt is very beautiful.

864
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:43,083
But I can’t wear it on the first day.

865
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:45,041
I promise you
I’ll wear it once afterward.

866
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:55,291
You’re so well-behaved

867
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,208
and helped me pack my bag.

868
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:01,025
Let me reward you.

869
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,041
You got up so early.

870
00:39:27,075 --> 00:39:29,166
Yin Sichen, promise me

871
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:32,083
to be happy and work hard every day.

872
00:39:32,666 --> 00:39:34,708
You’re sleeping so soundly
that I won’t wake you up.

873
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:36,083
See you three months later.

874
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:37,500
Gu Xixi.

875
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:43,875
Madam Song.

876
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:44,458
Mr. Yin.

877
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:45,250
Any sign of Xixi?

878
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:47,166
She left early in the morning.

879
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:48,166
Did she say where she was going?

880
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:49,750
Uh, no.

881
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:51,375
But when she went out,

882
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:52,666
she took a luggage case.

883
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:56,550
(Connecting to Xixi)

884
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,750
Where’s Gu Xixi?

885
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,500
She’s already on the plane.

886
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:18,550
What are you looking at me for?

887
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,700
She’s not here.

888
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:24,416
Gu Xixi.

889
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:29,833
Come out.

890
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:33,625
Gu Xixi.

891
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,833
I give up.

892
00:40:37,925 --> 00:40:39,958
I don’t want you to go. I give up.

893
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:41,958
Gu Xixi, come out.

894
00:40:42,225 --> 00:40:43,708
