23
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:41,416
The talented,

24
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:44,291
independent and individual designer,

25
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:45,833
Gu Xixi, rejected Alex

26
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,833
and established her own brand.

27
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:52,416
Sorry

28
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,625
that I can’t live my life

29
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:55,708
according to your plan.

30
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,958
Although I rejected Alex,

31
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:00,916
that’s not something I would do.

32
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,916
It’s not your business now, Gu Xixi.

33
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:06,291
You’re free.

34
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:08,666
You can open your own store now.

35
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:11,750
Thanks to you,

36
00:02:12,582 --> 00:02:14,457
many people
have to work overtime tonight.

37
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:21,916
The situation is more urgent now.

38
00:02:22,332 --> 00:02:23,750
On the one hand,
we have to make an alternative plan

39
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,000
by next Wednesday.

40
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:26,250
On the other hand,

41
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:27,291
I need the Law Department

42
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:28,750
to find out

43
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,166
who tipped the media off

44
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,375
that Gu Xixi

45
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,832
rejected Alex.

46
00:02:33,207 --> 00:02:34,500
Okay, we’ll take care of it.

47
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:35,525
And also,

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,832
how serious is the impact now?

49
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,700
I’ve analyzed the data.

50
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,457
It will take some time

51
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,500
whether to protect the asset

52
00:02:43,832 --> 00:02:44,957
or to contact the social media
to delete the news.

53
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,207
In other words,

54
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,416
if we can’t acquire Enjoy,

55
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,791
our plan of going public
will be affected.

56
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,541
A little impatience spoils a great plan.

57
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,375
Just bite the bullet
and make a little sacrifice

58
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:58,666
to steady someone

59
00:02:58,916 --> 00:02:59,875
and buy us some time.

60
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:04,082
It’s Alex.

61
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,625
I don’t think this plan is feasible.

62
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:08,666
Hello, Mr. Alex.

63
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:09,707
I’m Yin Sichen.

64
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:10,332
Mr. Yin.

65
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,832
I thought we had
a pleasant communication last time.

66
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,541
If I didn’t take it wrong,

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I thought the answer would be yes.

68
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,957
Why did I hear such news today?

69
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:19,875
Is it true?

70
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:21,291
Mr. Alex.

71
00:03:21,582 --> 00:03:22,332
I’m really sorry.

72
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,957
Something came up.
I was just about to apologize to you.

73
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:26,666
What you saw on the Internet

74
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,166
is not true.

75
00:03:28,332 --> 00:03:29,332
If you want to turn me down,

76
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,291
you should tell me in person

77
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,750
in a polite way.

78
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,791
Now I learned from the third-party media

79
00:03:33,832 --> 00:03:35,041
that I was rejected.

80
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,250
It puts me in a difficult place.

81
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,916
Well, Mr. Alex.

82
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:39,957
When you come next Wednesday,

83
00:03:39,957 --> 00:03:41,500
I’ll show you my sincerity

84
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,082
and explain it to you.

85
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,375
I’m sorry.

86
00:03:45,707 --> 00:03:46,707
Sorry, Mr. Yin.

87
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,291
My schedule is full.

88
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,832
I don’t think I have time
to meet you on Wednesday.

89
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:52,791
Maybe next time.

90
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,291
Fei’ang.

91
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:58,957
Find out when Alex gets off the plane

92
00:03:58,957 --> 00:04:00,125
next Wednesday.

93
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,666
I must meet him in person.

94
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:02,832
No problem.

95
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,250
Alex’s temper

96
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,625
is well known in the industry.

97
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,541
Looks like

98
00:04:10,707 --> 00:04:12,332
I have to take Gu Xixi

99
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,166
with me to apologize to Alex.

100
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,875
I, Lin Xiaoya, swear to God

101
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,458
that I never told anyone about it.

102
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:21,915
I don’t know what to do now.

103
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,790
I can’t prove myself.

104
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,458
Could it be that I was too loud
when we were eating in the restaurant

105
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,875
and someone else overheard me?

106
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,540
Why were you being loud in a restaurant?

107
00:04:31,725 --> 00:04:32,458
If the news

108
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,833
was leaked by us,

109
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,333
I would be in big trouble.

110
00:04:35,415 --> 00:04:36,125
But

111
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,833
he kept it from you at first.

112
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:39,915
It was his fault.

113
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:40,833
Why do you care about him?

114
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,540
It was just between us at first.

115
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,375
We could have talked about it
and solved it.

116
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,500
But it got serious suddenly.

117
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,250
It’s hard to end it now.

118
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:55,225
(“One Hundred Years of Solitude”)

119
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,958
The city of mirrors

120
00:05:05,915 --> 00:05:08,333
would be wiped out by the wind

121
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,915
and exiled from the memory of men,

122
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,458
and that everything
written on the parchments

123
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,165
was unrepeatable
since time immemorial and forever more,

124
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,250
because races condemned to
one hundred years of solitude

125
00:05:19,415 --> 00:05:22,875
did not have a second opportunity
on earth.

126
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,125
Gu Xixi, you are so silly.

127
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,583
You actually recorded the whole book
of “One Hundred Years of Solitude”.

128
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:36,958
To reward you,

129
00:05:37,165 --> 00:05:37,583
no,

130
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,790
to encourage you
to read another book for me,

131
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,040
I can promise you

132
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,375
a little wish.

133
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,583
But the next book

134
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,208
I want you to read
is Pride and Prejudice.

135
00:05:58,415 --> 00:06:01,250
It’s quite easy to persuade Gu Xixi.

136
00:06:02,165 --> 00:06:03,665
As I used to do,

137
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,375
treat her to a meal

138
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,583
and give her something more expensive

139
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,708
than she can imagine,

140
00:06:11,165 --> 00:06:14,415
then make her break the gift
by accident.

141
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,165
She’s gonna have to listen to us

142
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,333
in the face of a heavy compensation.

143
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,000
I think this can work.

144
00:06:22,665 --> 00:06:24,250
That’s what I would do before,

145
00:06:25,165 --> 00:06:26,375
but I won’t do it anymore.

146
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,250
Gu Xixi is right about me.

147
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,625
I’m a jerk without empathy.

148
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,458
I can do anything to get what I want,

149
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,625
and I did hurt a lot of people.

150
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,915
This time, I will use my sincerity

151
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,625
to persuade her to meet Alex with me.

152
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:44,958
By the way, there is one more thing.

153
00:06:45,165 --> 00:06:46,165
I found the person who spread the news

154
00:06:46,165 --> 00:06:48,040
on social media.

155
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:49,625
I did a quick check.

156
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,458
He used to work in a fashion magazine,

157
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,625
and he was in close contact
with Miss Ran before.

158
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,875
Okay, I see.

159
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,250
Let’s have a meal together

160
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,975
(Gu Xixi)
at Jinling Hotel at 12:00 PM tomorrow.

161
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:29,450
See you there.

162
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,575
(“One Hundred Years of Solitude”,
“Pride and Prejudice”)

163
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,458
I don’t need you to fulfill my wish.

164
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,375
I just hope we can take a ride
on the Ferris wheel

165
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,500
if you have time.

166
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,290
And the whole leak thing,

167
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,583
maybe someone overheard it
from Lin Xiaoya

168
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,958
when she was eating at a restaurant.

169
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,040
I apologize to you about this.

170
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:58,875
If needed,

171
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,458
I’ll apologize to Alex in person.

172
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,915
Okay, I’ll start reading.

173
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,625
Pride and Prejudice. Chapter one.

174
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:15,175
(CICI Business Hours 8:00-20:00
Welcome)

175
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,790
Three, two, one.

176
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,790
- CICI is open!
- CICI is open!

177
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,250
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

178
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,175
Great.

179
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,875
Ladies, go shopping inside.

180
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,458
Feel free to pick your favorites.

181
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,041
Don’t miss it.

182
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,625
Free membership
for the first one hundred customers.

183
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,250
Inside please. Welcome.

184
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,791
Don’t miss it. Buy more.

185
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,291
This pair of shoes.

186
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,041
This hat is perfect for you.

187
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,425
Yeah!

188
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,625
I’m so tired.

189
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,083
Well, we earned a lot today, right?

190
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:13,583
See for yourself.

191
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,166
Nice.

192
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,666
A good start.

193
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,458
I wish it would keep going well
like today.

194
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,708
Definitely.

195
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,875
We are clear and hard-working.

196
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,375
What’s wrong?

197
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,083
You’ve been unsettled these days.

198
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,000
No.

199
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,375
I’m just thinking something

200
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,708
about my future.

201
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,875
Your future?

202
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,958
Shouldn’t it be bright?

203
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,958
Or maybe miserable?

204
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,708
Miserable...?

205
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:53,250
Miss Gu.

206
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,583
Mr. Yin asked me to pick you up.

207
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:56,875
I see.

208
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:01,291
Xiaoya.

209
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,400
Um.

210
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:04,458
I’ll be back soon.

211
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,675
Why does Xixi look like

212
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:14,416
she is going to die like a hero?

213
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,000
Yin Sichen.

214
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,125
Here you are.

215
00:10:35,925 --> 00:10:36,625
Sit down.

216
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:37,958
Why do you want to see me?

217
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:39,925
A married couple has lunch together.

218
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:41,458
What’s the problem?

219
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,291
Do you have something for me?

220
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:55,666
How do you know it?

221
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:58,666
Take it out.

222
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,558
Then make her break the gift
by accident.

223
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,166
She’s gonna have to listen to me.

224
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,250
This is Pandora’s Box, right?

225
00:11:26,725 --> 00:11:27,416
How are you going to make me

226
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,875
break the thing inside by accident?

227
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,525
What do you mean?

228
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,666
I heard you on the phone with Fei’ang.

229
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:36,666
On the phone?

230
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,416
If I open this box,

231
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,458
my destiny will be in your hands, right?

232
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:45,958
I thought our time together

233
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,375
might have changed you a little bit.

234
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,791
At least you would show

235
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,958
some empathy and kindness to me.

236
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,291
But I’m wondering if I’m wrong.

237
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,000
You haven’t changed at all.

238
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,300
Listen.

239
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,375
You misunderstood me.

240
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,375
I did.

241
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,500
I misunderstood our relationship.

242
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,250
I misunderstood all the things you did
that moved me.

243
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,375
It may not mean anything to you.

244
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,541
You designed all of it.

245
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,000
I think you didn’t hear me out
that night.

246
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:24,583
I meant...

247
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,458
I’m grateful for all the things you did.

248
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,500
If this matter is worth
going to all that trouble

249
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,541
to set me up,

250
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:32,958
then don’t bother.

251
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,083
I promise you.

252
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,791
I will shut CICI down for a while

253
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,500
and agree to Alex’ request,

254
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,791
but only during the validity period
of our contract.

255
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,208
Once the contract expires,

256
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,000
you will be the same old Yin Sichen

257
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:49,791
and I’ll go back to be Gu Xixi.

258
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,125
Let’s not contact anymore.

259
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:55,850
Xixi.

260
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,291
Open it and take a look.

261
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,291
I can’t afford it.

262
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,041
Alex has arrived.

263
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:15,375
Shall we leave now?

264
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:28,085
(International Arrivals W3)

265
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,041
Mr. Alex.

266
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:32,375
Mr. Yin?

267
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,333
I’m sorry

268
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,375
to show up in front of you like this.

269
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,250
If you have time,

270
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,000
I want to take you to a place.

271
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,541
Maybe it will change your mind.

272
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:43,833
It won’t take long.

273
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,166
You are already here.

274
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,000
I have no reason to turn you down.

275
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:49,750
Let’s go.

276
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:00,416
Mr. Yin.

277
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,958
What do you want to show me?

278
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,583
The CICI here

279
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,125
is Xixi’s own brand.

280
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,125
That’s why she turned me down?

281
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:12,375
Yes.

282
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,416
She turned down your offer

283
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:16,958
because it has always been

284
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,458
the career she is pursuing,

285
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,083
and her dream.

286
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,250
What about your choice?

287
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,083
My choice is to support her choice.

288
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,416
Although CICI

289
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,125
is just a small store now,

290
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,375
I believe

291
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:37,625
it will become

292
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,458
a popular brand

293
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,875
like Marry Me one day.

294
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,583
Don’t you also think she is talented?

295
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,708
So you decided

296
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,958
to give up Enjoy?

297
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,000
Of course not.

298
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,333
I just hope you can change the term

299
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,666
of making Xixi the manager.

300
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,558
Here are some alternatives we offer.

301
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,541
We will choose
three internationally renowned artists

302
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,291
to be the brand director,

303
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,833
the art director
and the consultant of your brand.

304
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:17,375
We will also set up five
concept flagship stores in the city.

305
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,541
And rest assured,

306
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,500
your brand

307
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,916
won’t be confined to Why Mall.

308
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,833
As for the acquisition,

309
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,958
I hope to exchange Why Mall’s equity

310
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,041
with you.

311
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,708
There are still many details
I need to tell you,

312
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,125
but the premise is

313
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:33,958
that you are willing to hear me out.

314
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,000
Miss Gu is a person with magic.

315
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,333
It’s not long,

316
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,333
and some interesting changes

317
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,791
seem to have taken place in you.

318
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,375
But sorry,

319
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,208
I can’t grant your request.

320
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:52,958
It’s okay.

321
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,583
I’ve prepared for this.

322
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,166
Even though I still insist

323
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,500
Miss Gu be the manager,

324
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,041
you will still choose
to respect Miss Gu’s decision, right?

325
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:08,458
To be honest,

326
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:10,583
I’m ready

327
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,750
to be rejected by you.

328
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:20,083
I’ll still support her dream.

329
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,083
I see what you mean.

330
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,750
I’ll keep the proposal.

331
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:24,708
But

332
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:28,166
you can’t convince me now.

333
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:29,800
Sorry.

334
00:16:38,575 --> 00:16:39,333
Check again.

335
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,541
Okay, got it.

336
00:16:40,825 --> 00:16:42,475
There must be a problem with the data.

337
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,416
I believe

338
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,333
Fei’ang has told you the result.

339
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,325
Sadly,

340
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,416
Alex turned us down in the end.

341
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,250
It’s not your problem.

342
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:07,750
I’m responsible for this.

343
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,291
I allow

344
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,225
any of you

345
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,250
to leave Why Mall now.

346
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,625
I’ll write a letter
of recommendation for you

347
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,916
and you can go to the Yin Group.

348
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,208
I believe all of you

349
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,958
will have a better future.

350
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:27,950
Boss.

351
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:29,916
Amy, where do you want to go?

352
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,500
I want to stay in Why Mall.

353
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,958
I’ve been scared of you.

354
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:37,583
I feel that you are

355
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,666
impersonal.

356
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,800
But,

357
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,875
you did this for a girl you like.

358
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,225
It’s pretty cool.

359
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,541
There will be a tough battle to fight,

360
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:47,416
but we believe in you.

361
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,625
You made the miracle of Why Mall.

362
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,083
I don’t believe you don’t have Plan B.

363
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,833
I’m ready

364
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,375
to work overtime with you.

365
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,166
Thank you all.

366
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,208
I’ve chosen

367
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,041
three alternative brands

368
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,125
and showed them

369
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,300
our intention to acquire them.

370
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,958
They also showed great interest in us.

371
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,583
Even if Alex turned us down,

372
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,875
we won’t go home empty-handed.

373
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,416
But even combine these three brands...

374
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,375
I know
that the combined sales and influence

375
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,375
of these three brands

376
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,083
are less than half that of Enjoy,

377
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,583
but it’s just a rough plan.

378
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,583
In the next six months,

379
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,833
I’ll keep looking for brands
we can work with

380
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,125
to make up for our loss this time.

381
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,125
I knew from the beginning

382
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,958
that you are ready to be turned down.

383
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:40,708
This is the worst situation.

384
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,333
Anyway,

385
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,333
you still have to be prepared
for a long-term battle.

386
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,175
Come on.

387
00:18:50,075 --> 00:18:50,825

What’s wrong?

395
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,083
I threw the wrong coin.

396
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,083
I don’t think I can find it.

397
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,567
Is that coin important?

398
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,583
It’s a commemorative coin

my dad gave me when I was a kid.

400

Just a little cold. I’ll sleep it off.

Miss Gu.

429
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,541
Mr. Alex.

430
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,541
Sorry to bother you so late.

431
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,416
Thank you for agreeing to see me.

432
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,750
You finally come to me.

433
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:45,775
I’m here

434
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:47,916
to apologize to you.

435
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,041
For some personal reasons,

436
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:54,150
I declined your offer
of making me the manager,

437
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,875
but it was not because

438
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,025
I have any problems with you
or your brand.

439
00:21:59,166 --> 00:21:59,916
It’s just

440
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,583
some trade-offs in my career plan.

441
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,083
I don’t want to impose.

442
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,625
I won’t make you do anything
you don’t like.

443
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:10,291
You don’t have to apologize.

444
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,166
I don’t want you to misunderstand me

445
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,791
or misunderstand Sichen.

446
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:17,791
I didn’t misunderstand either of you.

447
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:19,791
I trust your talent

448
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:20,833
and your creativity.

449
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:22,666
If you don’t agree,

450
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:24,833
I can only turn Mr. Yin down.

451
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,416
I’m sure you also know it.

452
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,625
I guessed the result.

453
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:31,583
I know it can be very inappropriate

454
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,000
for me to say this,

455
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:34,916
but I really want to have a try.

456
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,875
Because my husband...

457
00:22:42,275 --> 00:22:43,750
Because Yin Sichen

458
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,375
really put a lot of efforts

459
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,041
in you and your brand.

460
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,100
You are very important to him.

461
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:52,625
Therefore, if you turned him down

462
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:54,166
because of me,

463
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:55,458
I can promise you now.

464
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,384
If you want,

465
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,375
I can work for your brand.

466
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,458
I’m surprised to hear you say that.

467
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:06,000
Miss Gu, what changed your mind?

468
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,625
I suddenly found

469
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,458
that Sichen has been
doing things for me silently.

470
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:18,833
I shouldn’t just think about myself.

471
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:21,041
I should also think about him.

472
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,775
So,

473
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:24,666
will you accept my apology

474
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,583
and reconsider Sichen’s proposal?

475
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:28,541
If I say yes to you,

476
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,833
your husband will blame me.

477
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:35,000
Shouldn’t he be happy?

478
00:23:35,675 --> 00:23:36,666
I’ve been to your store.

479
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,000
Mr. Yin took me there.

480
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:39,666
It’s good.

481
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,375
Although it’s just a small store,

482
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:44,875
the display and furnishings

483
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:47,083
are cleverly designed.

484
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:49,833
He told me

485
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:52,750
no matter what my decision is,

486
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,525
he will respect your opinion.

487
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:57,750
He brought me to your store

488
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,083
so that I can understand you

489
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:01,708
and respect your dream.

490
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:04,900
You are just like the old me,

491
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,750
with all these expectations
for the future.

492
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,041
I even feel

493
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,275
that the old me

494
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,400
was doing something
that deprived others of their dreams.

495
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,666
He actually said that to you?

496
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:27,400
I’m not wrong about you and Mr. Yin.

497
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:30,583
You are willing to give for each other.

498
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:33,250
So,

499
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:35,041
does it mean

500
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:37,333
that you’ll accept my proposal?

501
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,416
Not yours, but his proposal.

502
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,833
I’ll respect your dream

503
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:45,708
and accept his proposal
at the same time.

504
00:24:48,775 --> 00:24:49,666
Thank you.

505
00:24:58,541 --> 00:24:59,583
Sorry, sorry.

(Leasing Contract
for No. 48, Liuyin Street)

507
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:05,500
Don’t you need to work today?

508
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,541
I’ll stay home today
sorting out the accounts.

509
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000

510
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,458
why your company
wanted to rent this store?

511
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:15,875
Well,

512
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:16,791
these are the addresses
of the five boutiques

513
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:19,125
selected by the Purchasing Department.

514
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:21,050
I haven’t had time
to show them to Sichen.

515
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:22,083
What’s wrong?

516
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,042
Does Sichen not know about it?

517
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:25,275
Um.

518
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,416
But

519
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:29,083
I guess there is no need
to show him now.

520
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:31,541
Alex has turned us down.

521
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,725
Maybe

522
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:35,333
there will be a turnaround.

523
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:36,333
A turnaround?

524
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:38,500
Maybe.

525
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:41,291
Sichen is in the study. Go ahead.

526
00:25:41,525 --> 00:25:42,125
Um.

527
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:43,208
Bye-bye.

00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,675
Um.

529
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:50,975
Okay. Okay.

530
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,583
Thank you, Mr. Alex.

531
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,416
Okay.

532
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,050
Yeah!

533
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:02,500
What’s wrong?

534
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:04,000
Alex agreed to our proposal.

535
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,075
He agreed?

536
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:07,916

don’t you know

620
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:25,916
many modeling agents?

621
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:27,625
Don’t they have any models?

622
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:29,750
Those models are expensive.

Hello, we are running

634
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,700
a new brand called CICI.

635
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:52,708
The models you chose this time

636
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:54,333
are not for our year-end celebration.

637
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:56,333
I’ll talk to you myself later.

638
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:56,791
Okay.

639
00:30:57,125 --> 00:30:57,750
Would it be convenient for you

640
00:30:57,791 --> 00:30:59,625
to send us a copy
of the new information?

641
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:01,375
No problem.

642
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:02,375
After we receive the new information,

643
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:03,666
we will recommend suitable models

644
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:04,583
according to your requirements.

645
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:05,300

646
00:31:05,525 --> 00:31:06,300
- Yeah.
- By then...

647
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:08,208
He got a lot of models working for him.

648
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,650
- I need you to contact this agent.
- We can adjust

649
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:12,425
if there are any requirements on site.

650
00:31:12,425 --> 00:31:13,825
I’ll audition their models in person
this afternoon.

651
00:31:13,825 --> 00:31:14,450
Okay.

652
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:16,375
- See you then.
- Thanks.

653
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,374
- See you then.
- Um.

654
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:22,075
We got it?

655
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,400
Yeah!

658
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:08,825
Where are they?

659
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:10,583
They haven’t come yet.

660
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:11,450
They haven’t come?

661
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:12,050
Um.

662
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:14,041

663
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:18,900
Hello.

664
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,750
I’m CICI’s Gu Xixi. We met yesterday.

665
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:23,875
Aren’t you supposed to bring the models

666
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,833
to our studio at 10:00 AM today?

667
00:32:28,225 --> 00:32:28,875
What...?

668
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:30,166
What do you mean you can’t come?

669
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:33,750
All right. All right.

670
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:35,166
What’s going on?

671
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:36,875
He said he can’t come.

672
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,541
There is a big fashion celebration

673
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,125
and all the models went there.

674
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:42,791
They don’t have any models left now.

675
00:32:42,791 --> 00:32:44,000
He has no contract spirit at all.

676
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,958
What to do then?

677
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:46,500
The studio and the photographer

678
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,958
cost us a lot for one day.

679
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:52,325

680
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,525

00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:56,416
I heard that you are shooting today.

682
00:32:56,416 --> 00:32:57,500
I came here to take a look.

683
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,625
Well,

684
00:32:59,083 --> 00:32:59,708
haven’t you started yet?

685
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,500
Our models were poached.

686
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:03,833
We’re worried about what to do now.

687
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:05,000
It’s all my fault.

688
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,666
I didn’t sign a contract with them.

689
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:08,125
I have to see

690
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:09,958
if there is any model
who can come in time,

691
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:12,333
but I think the chance is slim.

692
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:12,975
What’s wrong?

693
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:17,800
I think

694
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:20,125
a good idea flicks.

695
00:33:21,675 --> 00:33:22,475
Mr. Mo.

696
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,875
Why don’t you help us?

697
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:24,950
You can be our model.

698
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:26,291
He is a president.

699
00:33:26,291 --> 00:33:27,666
How can he be a model?

700
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:28,725
Can I?

701
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,725
Be confident. You definitely can.

702
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:34,208
You are the only one
who can help us now.

703
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:35,583
There is no other way.

704
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:37,375
Well,

705
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:39,208
okay.

706
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:39,775
Really?

707
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:40,925
Really?

708
00:33:40,925 --> 00:33:42,583
But you can’t laugh at me

709
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:43,625
if I don’t do it well.

710
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:44,541
You won’t.

711
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:45,750
How come?

712
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,500
Change your clothes then.

713
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,050
Okay.

714
00:33:55,725 --> 00:33:56,900
We are going to the studio now.

715
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,166
By the way,

716
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:01,541
I’m gonna tell Gu Xixi I like her.

717
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:03,250
You’ve finally decided.

718
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:08,525
Help me think of a romantic way
to do it.

719
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:09,958
Romantic...

720
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:12,800
Let me think about it.

721
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,125
Take your time.

722
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:17,950
A masquerade?

723
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:20,708
How is it, Senior?

724
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:21,583
Do the clothes fit well?

725
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:23,375
I think the shirt is a little too big.

726
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:28,625
It’s a bit big.

727
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:29,625
Let me clip it for you.

728
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:31,333
Okay.

729
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:58,750
You need to tuck it in.

730
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:03,791
It seems much better now.

731
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:07,416
Put on the suit then.

732
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,083
Okay.

733
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:25,950
Let me see.

734
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:27,350
Okay, it’s perfect.

735
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,083
Okay.

736
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,925
Xiaoya, get ready to shoot.

737
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,000
So handsome.

738
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,875
Lin Xiaoya, wipe your drool.

739
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:58,916
Don’t be so boy-crazy.

740
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:01,166
Senior Mo is supposed to be a model,

741
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:03,375
but his business stands in his way.

742
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,625
That’s right.

743
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:06,775
I think

744
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:09,166
he is even hotter than

745
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:09,916
all the models we met yesterday.

746
00:36:09,916 --> 00:36:11,625
How did he become a president?

747
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:12,958
What a pity!

748
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:13,575
Exactly.

749
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:17,925
Well, let’s take a break.

750
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:19,025
Thank you.

751
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,250
Thanks.

752
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,200
Let me see.

753
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:23,025
How is it?

754
00:36:23,291 --> 00:36:24,425
Am I doing alright?

755
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:25,892
Senior.

756
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:27,875
If you don’t want to be
a president anymore,

757
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,375
please be a model.

758
00:36:29,416 --> 00:36:30,875
You are perfect for it.

759
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,600
If there is such a day,

760
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:34,333
you must still hire me to be your model.

761
00:36:35,416 --> 00:36:36,333
I’m afraid I can only hire you

762
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:38,583
when I become a famous designer.

763
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:39,625
Otherwise, I can’t afford it.

764
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:43,050
Sorry. Sorry.

765
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,208
Sorry.

766
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,125
I’m gonna change my clothes.

767
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:56,675
Um.

768
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:01,333
Are you all right?

769
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:02,050
I’m fine.

770
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,916
I feel

771
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:06,916
the way he looked at you is abnormal.

772
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:09,916
Lin Xiaoya.

773
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:10,916
Everything is abnormal to you.

774
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:12,416
I think you have a problem
with your brain.

775
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:14,166
Who has a problem?

776
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:15,875
I think you are too insensitive.

777
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,750
I didn’t expect the photos of Senior

778
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:19,708
are really good.

779
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:20,541
It’s really good.

780
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:24,458
Yin Sichen?

781
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:26,208
What are you doing here?

782
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:29,458
I’m here to surprise my wife at work.

783
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,666
Wow.

784
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,000
There is so much food.

785
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:40,700
Why is he here?

786
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:43,625
The models we hired before

787
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:44,958
canceled on us at the last minute.

788
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:46,541
Senior is here to save us

789
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:47,500
and be our model.

790
00:37:58,416 --> 00:37:59,916
It’s our family affair.

791
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,092
How can you trouble someone else?

792
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,708
Isn’t it just modeling?

793
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:07,416
I can do it, too.

794
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:11,791
How can you do modeling?

795
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:14,208
Okay, we are short of models anyway.

796
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,775
It would be great if Mr. Yin can help.

797
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,925
Let’s change clothes now.

798
00:38:20,791 --> 00:38:21,458
See you later.

799
00:39:03,275 --> 00:39:04,250
Okay, done.

800
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,650
Thank you, Mr. Mo.

801
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:06,958
Come on. Hurry up
and get ready for the next set.

802
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:07,916
Thank you, Senior.

803
00:39:08,509 --> 00:39:09,100
No problem.

804
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,250
We need you to be lively and cheerful

805
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:13,625
for the next set of photos.

806
00:39:13,791 --> 00:39:15,041
It’s more casual.

807
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:16,000
Wait.

808
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:21,475
What are you doing, Yin Sichen?

809
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:23,475
That’s what I should ask you.

810
00:39:23,475 --> 00:39:24,458
What are you doing?

811
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:26,875
His tie is crooked.
I wanted to adjust it for him.

812
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:28,050
Is there a problem?

813
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:30,875
I’m the next one to be photographed.

814
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:32,975
You should adjust my clothes.

815
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,875
Yin Sichen, listen.

816
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:36,875
I’m working now. Don’t cause me trouble.

817
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,375
Gu Xixi, I’m your husband.

818
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:39,450
Just for now.

819
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:48,708
Mr. Yin, you can get ready.

820
00:39:49,875 --> 00:39:50,550
Go ahead.

821
00:40:01,916 --> 00:40:03,458
Look at the camera.

822
00:40:07,775 --> 00:40:08,400
Hey,

823
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:09,833
Yin Sichen, what’s that look?

824
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:11,416
Do you want to kill someone?

825
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:13,450
I want the cute

826
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,958
and sunshine-boy style.

827
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:16,875
Is it hard?

828
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,683
Yin Sichen, are you doing it on purpose?

829
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:25,600
Is it that hard to be cute?

830
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:26,791
Just like this.

831
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:27,775
Like this.

832
00:40:27,775 --> 00:40:28,650
Gu Xixi.

833
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:30,666
You said you want to do this.

834
00:40:30,666 --> 00:40:32,000
You have to cooperate.

835
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,666
No, forget it. Never mind.

836
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:47,083
I don’t think he can do that style

837
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:49,041
with his inborn poker face.

838
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:50,791
Prop master, give him a coke.

839
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:57,083
Well, imagine

840
00:40:57,083 --> 00:40:59,083
you are running like crazy

841
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,750
in the very hot summer.

842
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,500
You have run three kilometers

843
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:05,500
and you are tired and hot.

844
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:07,416
It’s too hot

845
00:41:07,416 --> 00:41:10,041
and you are really thirsty.

846
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:11,200
Then,

847
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:13,125
someone handed you

848
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:14,650
a bottle of cold coke.

849
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,159
You can’t wait to open it.

850
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,250
Yin Sichen!

851
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:24,650
What should I do?

852
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:25,225
Come on.

853
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:27,000
No need to make a fuss.

854
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I won’t blame you.

855
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:29,416
This coke didn’t splash on my face.

856
00:41:29,833 --> 00:41:30,833
My hair isn’t messy, is it?

857
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:32,083
I’m not worried about you.

858
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:33,992
I’m talking about the shirt.
What should I do?

859
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:34,825
This is the only handmade shirt

860
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:35,833
I brought.

861
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:37,708
There are coke stains on it now.

862
00:41:38,425 --> 00:41:39,100
Wait.

863
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:40,500
Think about it.

864
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:43,583
I’ve run three kilometers.
I’m thirsty and tired.

865
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:45,708
Suddenly,
there is a bottle of cold coke.

866
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:47,458
Of course, I would pop it open

867
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:48,416
with a crisp sound.

868
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:49,750
That’s how they act in the ads.

869
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:52,041
Yes, it made you look cool.

870
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:53,250
What about my shirt?

871
00:41:53,775 --> 00:41:54,333
You have to pay for it.

872
00:41:56,875 --> 00:41:57,916
You wanna rip me off again?

873
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:01,300
You wanna plant it on me?

874
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:03,083
You should learn for a few more years.

875
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:06,075
Yin Sichen, you...

876
00:42:06,375 --> 00:42:07,083
Do you have a conscience?

877
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:08,950
You have to give me the money.

878
00:42:10,575 --> 00:42:12,500
I’m exhausted.

879
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,325
I have no idea

880
00:42:13,325 --> 00:42:15,333
if I can live till the day I get rich.

881
00:42:16,916 --> 00:42:17,875
It’s up to you,

882
00:42:18,575 --> 00:42:21,000
but you have to live long enough
to fulfill the contract.

883
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:22,791
Are you a devil?

884
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,416
I can’t make it.

885
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,833
Boss, is it a bonus?

886
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:35,833
This is for the damaged clothes today,

887
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:39,083
also a little surprise for you

888
00:42:40,333 --> 00:42:41,750
to give you something to live for.

889
00:42:42,041 --> 00:42:42,791
Thank you, boss.

890
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:44,041
What do you mean?

891
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,333
Answer me a question first.

892
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:47,041
Go ahead.

893
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:50,583
I didn’t want to ask it,

894
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
but your performance today upset me.

895
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,291
Who did better today, me or Mo Zixin?

896
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:04,250
The red packet is for buying me.

897
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,625
Cut it off, just tell me.

898
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:10,416
Mo Zixin.

899
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:13,700
He is handsome and graceful
with a pair of long legs.

900
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:15,250
He is also cooperative.

901
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:16,791
No doubt he got a perfect score.

902
00:43:17,791 --> 00:43:19,625
You are also handsome,

903
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:22,166
and graceful. Your legs are long, too.

904
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:24,666
But you had a murderous look

905
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:26,208
and you were not very cooperative.

906
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:27,375
I think it cost you one point.

907
00:43:27,375 --> 00:43:28,300
You got 99 points.

908
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,416
Boss.

909
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:34,648
Gu Xixi, I think

910
00:43:34,648 --> 00:43:36,291
this red packet is too thick for you

911
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:37,708
to take.

912
00:43:38,166 --> 00:43:38,750
Wait for me.

913
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:39,750
I’ll go upstairs
and wrap a new one for you.

914
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:41,583
Boss, listen to me.

915
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:43,791
99 is also good.

916
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:45,666
Look, one point

917
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:48,000
leaves you some room for improvement.

918
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:49,958
It means that you have
limitless potential.

919
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:53,083
It’s a game of two

920
00:43:53,083 --> 00:43:54,458
and you ranked me second.

921
00:43:54,708 --> 00:43:55,475
But,

922
00:43:56,416 --> 00:43:58,708
you used a red packet
to allay my tiredness.

923
00:43:58,958 --> 00:44:00,541
It means you are caring and warm.

924
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:03,100
You can also get a perfect score, okay?

925
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:12,833
Take it seriously.

926
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:16,900
Who is first,

927
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:18,875
me or him?

928
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:26,650
It’s a foul to threaten the referee.

929
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:35,208
Mr. Yin told me in advance

930
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:36,625
that you’ve had a long day

931
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:39,925
and a cup of hot milk
can help you sleep.

932
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Thanks, Madam Song.

933
00:44:44,575 --> 00:44:45,275
Well,

934
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:46,833
since you brought me milk,

935
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:48,000
I’ll give you one more point.

936
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,208
You are the real number one now.

937
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:52,825
Gu Xixi.

938
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,750
You are my wife.

939
00:44:56,083 --> 00:44:57,875
Do you need me to teach you

940
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:00,325
how to be a good Mrs. Yin?
