23
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,041
What are you doing here?

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,775
(LOVE)
Don’t worry,

25
00:02:00,275 --> 00:02:01,958
I just have something to say to you.

26
00:02:02,425 --> 00:02:03,541
I’ll leave after I’m done.

27
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,833
What else do you wanna say?

28
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,082
I know what I did made you

29
00:02:09,925 --> 00:02:10,916
disappointed

30
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:12,332
and mad.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,250
But I did those things

32
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,332
only because I love you
too much, Sichen.

33
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,375
I think you are confused
about your feelings for me.

34
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,016
I’m not!

35
00:02:23,825 --> 00:02:25,041
I’ve always believed

36
00:02:25,975 --> 00:02:27,416
that you were my everything

37
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:28,832
since we first met.

38
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,250
And I wasn’t the only one
who thought so.

39
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,000
Your family

40
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,625
and all our friends

41
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,832
were certain that I was the one who’d

42
00:02:36,832 --> 00:02:37,832
marry you in the end.

43
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:39,625
But it all changed

44
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,166
because of Gu Xixi.

45
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:42,707
She ruined everything!

46
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:44,300
She ruined my life!

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,791
Xiwei,

48
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,416
actually, I was going

49
00:02:49,082 --> 00:02:50,916
to talk to you at the party last time.

50
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:56,666
Maybe we just got used

51
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,825
to how other people thought about us.

52
00:03:00,575 --> 00:03:02,666
Or maybe it was just a habit.

53
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,025
Anyway, we both misunderstood

54
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:06,291
our relationship.

55
00:03:07,207 --> 00:03:08,582
It may just be your illusion

56
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:11,082
that you thought we were in love.

57
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,582
At least it’s never

58
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:15,625
occurred to me that we could

59
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:16,916
become lovers.

60
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:19,841
I only have Gu Xixi in my heart.

61
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,500
Then do you know her well?

62
00:03:23,957 --> 00:03:25,457
She’s nothing like
how you think of her!

63
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,500
I don’t need you to tell me

64
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,916
what kind of person she is.

65
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,625
Zixin.

66
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:54,759
I prepared all these gifts for you.

67
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,832
(GIORGIO ARMANI)
Today is your

68
00:03:57,275 --> 00:03:58,984
25th birthday.

69
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,000
I hope I can be a part of your past,

70
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,582
as well as be a part of your life now

71
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,957
and in the future.

72
00:04:11,332 --> 00:04:12,000
Zixin…

73
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,541
Xixi,

74
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:15,500
you know,

75
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:17,142
I’m very glad that you came.

76
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,625
Since fate brought us back together,

77
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,165
I don’t want to miss
this opportunity again.

78
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,540
Gu Xixi,

79
00:04:27,175 --> 00:04:28,000
I love you.

80
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:38,458
I’m sorry, Zixin.

81
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:40,375
I really appreciate

82
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,125
for your encouragement and help,

83
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,583
and I’m really touched

84
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,290
for your care and your love.

85
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,625
I’ve been seeing you as my friend,

86
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:49,875
senior,

87
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,258
partner,

88
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,458
and even Nianxi Guru for these days,

89
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:58,960
but I’ve never liked you
in a romantic way.

90
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:03,185
I’m sorry!

91
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,125
You are still that Gu Xixi
I fell in love with,

92
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,333
as straightforward as always.

93
00:05:17,675 --> 00:05:19,165
I’m really sorry, Zixin.

94
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,458
But I can’t lie to myself.

95
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:25,958
I’ve fallen in love with Yin Sichen.

96
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,750
Then can we still be friends?

97
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,583
Just like before?

98
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,025
Hmm.

99
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,540
Then I’m leaving.

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,875
Sir, to Fisherman’s Quay, please.

101
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:08,665
Alright.

102
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,375
Your guest has arrived, right?

103
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,500
Shall we start serving the dishes?

104
00:06:20,775 --> 00:06:21,500
Not yet.

105
00:06:23,325 --> 00:06:24,407
She’s not the one I’m waiting for.

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,708
Okay.

107
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,257
Sichen,

108
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:31,583
why can’t you

109
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,250
try to love me, even just a little?

110
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:34,915
I really just want…

111
00:06:34,915 --> 00:06:36,665
You just want Gu Xixi
to misunderstand.

112
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,333
You just want her birthday

113
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,790
to become even worse.

114
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,708
Your trick is getting old already,
Xiwei.

115
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,500
You are only humiliating yourself.

116
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,915
Please just leave.

117
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:10,425
Sir, when can we get there?

118
00:07:10,425 --> 00:07:11,625
With this traffic condition,

119
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:12,375
it’s hard to say.

120
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:14,333
It could be in a few minutes,

121
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,083
or in half an hour.

122
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:20,775
(Sichen, I’m on my way, but stuck
in a traffic jam. Wait for me!)

123
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:30,083
Careful, miss.

124
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,000
It’s about to rain.

125

126
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,290
Miss, I’m sorry,

127
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:48,500
but we are closed.

128
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,500
Are you miss Gu Xixi?

129
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,165
Yes.

130
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:53,915
Mr. Yin had been waiting for you.

131
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,125
But you didn’t show up,

132
00:07:55,415 --> 00:07:56,250
so he left.

133
00:07:58,325 --> 00:07:59,158

Thank you for everything you did.

174
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,500
I’m so moved

175
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,333
and I forgot to tell you just now

176
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,541
that I love you.

177
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,041
I knew.

178
00:10:59,975 --> 00:11:01,450
You… You knew what?

179
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,208
I knew

180
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,650
you also loved me.

181
00:11:11,525 --> 00:11:14,650
♪Your smile is as sweet♪

182
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,075

183

00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,175

♪What do you say♪

190
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:08,425
Why do I always
have to lose something

191
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,575
every time when I
make a progress in life.

192
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,375
Mr. Mo,

193
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,833
since you want to get over Miss Gu,

194
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,750
shall we put

195
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,541
our cooperation with CICI

196
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,792
on pause for a while?

197
00:12:21,425 --> 00:12:22,541
Yin Sichen

198
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,125
has also talked to us about this.

199
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:25,166
Why don’t we…?

200
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,166
No.

201
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,125
I’m not gonna leave her
just because I got rejected.

202
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,250
I can still be Xixi’s friend.

203
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:33,875
Besides,

204
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,791
I won’t give Yin Sichen
the satisfaction of victory.

205
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:38,575
Come on.

206
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:39,708
Let’s go back.

207
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,208
So, it’s the agenda for the meeting.

208
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,583
Take a look. Any questions?

209
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,041
I do have a question.

210
00:12:50,225 --> 00:12:51,166
Okay, shoot.

211
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,958
What do you want for dinner?

212
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:57,791
Although we try to keep

213
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:59,125
our relationship a secret at work,

214
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,916
our coworkers have already
found out about us.

215
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,416
And I’ve told you

216
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,375
that we need to be professional
when we are in the office.

217
00:13:05,825 --> 00:13:06,625
No problem.

218
00:13:09,425 --> 00:13:10,875
I have one more question.

219
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,534
You’d better be serious.

220
00:13:14,534 --> 00:13:15,500
I am very serious.

221
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,000
Cut it out!

222
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,458
Alright, I’ll go to the meeting now.

223
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:23,275
Okay.

224
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,416
Clean the lipstick mark.

225
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,125
I feel like I’ve reached
the pinnacle of my life.

226
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,791
I feel so lucky that I have

227
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,625
such a lovely girlfriend to be with me

228
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,791
while I’m at work.

229
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:49,333
Mom, you saw it?

230
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,625
My dear mother,

231
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,458
wouldn’t it be nicer if you
went have some tea

232
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,625
and chat with your friends,

233
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:58,791
or kept fish at home?

234
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,000
Why do you have to bring me the soup?

235
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,884
How can you blame me for that?

236
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,833
If you told me you had a girlfriend,

237
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,625
I wouldn’t have
to guess around like a spy.

238
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:11,625
Ruona wants to keep
our relationship a secret.

239
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,291
We were just waiting
for the right time to tell you.

240
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:19,083
This girl is quite cunning.

241
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,000
Mom, let me get this clear,

242
00:14:21,175 --> 00:14:22,875
please don’t pull such trick

243
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,250
as testing her by giving her

244
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,291
some money and asking her to leave

245
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,583
like some plots in TV dramas.

246
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:27,208
Do not do that.

247
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,458
No true love can

248
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,333
be shaken by money.

249
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,125
Mother…

250
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,775
It’s not like that.

251
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,041
Sichen.

252
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:02,208
Xixi.

253
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,750
Am I intruding?

254
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:15,625
What are you doing here?

255
00:15:18,325 --> 00:15:19,750
I’m here to see Xixi.

256
00:15:20,175 --> 00:15:21,375
I’m sorry, Xixi.

257
00:15:21,475 --> 00:15:22,666
You suffered a lot

258
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,375
because of the interview last time.

259
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:25,666
It was my fault.

260
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:27,625
I didn’t expect

261
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,500
that it’d hurt you that much.

262
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,958
Can you forgive me?

263
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:35,375
It’s okay.

264
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,583
It’s water under the bridge.

265
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,291
But

266
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,375
I don’t want it to happen again.

267
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,708
Don’t worry.

268
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,541
I will do my best

269
00:15:46,725 --> 00:15:48,291
to minimize the negative impact

270
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,166
of this incident.

271
00:15:53,775 --> 00:15:54,350
Hey.

272
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,166
What are you doing?

273
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,583
Then I’ll leave now.

274
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,583
I’ll let them publish an apology letter
right after I get back.

275
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,208
Thank you, Xixi.

276
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,500
It’s alright.

277
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,875
Why were you staring at me?

278
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,041
Hello? Fei’ang.

279
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,666
Tell them to cancel all my meetings.

280
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:30,750
I won’t be in the office today.

281
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,975
Fei’ang.

282
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:35,650
Don’t cancel the meetings.

283
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,500
Your CEO will be there on time.

284
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,250
Bye-bye.

285
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,666
Gu Xixi,

286
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,000
I’m right here, yet you still made

287
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,000
a decision without even asking me.

288
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,166
It’s not like that.

289
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,458
You are the CEO.

290
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,333
You can’t just leave work
at any time you want.

291
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,416
I was trying to protect your image.

292
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:02,958
Even so, as your husband,

293
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,416
how can I just leave you here alone?

294
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:08,375
But

295
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,500
I’ve said yes to Fei’ang.

296
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:11,875
If you don’t go,

297
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:12,916
I’ll be held accountable.

298
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,791
No worries. I’ll be good and stay here,

299
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,250
waiting for you.

300
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,083
Now, go to work.

301
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,416
You’ve got to be good.

302
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,300
Hmm.

303
00:17:37,675 --> 00:17:38,458
I promise.

304
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:55,175
(Xixi)

305
00:17:56,225 --> 00:17:58,125
Don’t you think Mr. Yin
is a little weird today?

306
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,000
Amy brought him
the wrong files this morning,

307
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,333
but he didn’t yell at her at all.

308
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,041
It’s never happened before.

309
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,166
- Mr. Yin.
- Mr. Yin.

310
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:06,625
Hello.

311
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:08,916
See?

312
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,041
I think so, too.

313
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:11,875
Mr. Yin has never acted
like that before.

314
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,350
But now he looks cheerful all the time.

315
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,375
Hold on.

316
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:18,791
Xixi?

317
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:19,708
What Xixi?

318
00:18:20,425 --> 00:18:22,000
Are you two Xixi’s friends?

319
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:23,458
Xixi?

320
00:18:24,325 --> 00:18:25,333
I don’t know.

321
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,225
Did you buy this outfit at CICI?

322
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,291
Yes, Mr. Yin.

323
00:18:32,975 --> 00:18:33,958
Good taste.

324
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,875
I’ll double the bonus
for you two this month.

325
00:18:40,175 --> 00:18:40,900
What?

326
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,458
You want me to teach you
how to please a girl?

327
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:46,208
Don’t get carried away.

328
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,625
I can’t believe it’s happening!

329
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:52,208
You know,

330
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,166
I was the one who always copied
your homework when we were little.

331
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,375
And now you want me
to teach you something.

332
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:58,916
Wait a second.

333
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,083
You have married already.

334
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,416
You…

335
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,500
Tell me, who are you
having an affair with?

336
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:08,708
What affair?

337
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,375
I just think that Gu Xixi and I

338
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,583
got married right after we met,

339
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,083
and we’ve never really dated.

340
00:19:15,575 --> 00:19:17,208
So, I wanted to make it up to her.

341
00:19:17,975 --> 00:19:18,916
It makes sense.

342
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,125
You’ve come to the right person.

343
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:21,708
Wait here.

344
00:19:27,425 --> 00:19:28,875
Dating tips!

345
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,166
It records

346
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,666
my dating history of all these years.

347
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,208
Listen, in this notebook…

348
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,291
Take it.

349
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,791
I have Ruona already anyway.

350
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,416
I tell you what, in here you can find

351
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,125
stuff like sweet talks,

352
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:48,325
dating locations, and such.

353
00:19:48,325 --> 00:19:49,458
Which part is about dating?

354
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,291
Section 8, Chapter 7.

355
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,041
Based on your dating phases,

356
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,458
you can find suitable topics,

357
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,291
and develop your relationship,
then get it done.

358
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,958
You can learn a lot from it.

359
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,291
Why don’t you thank me?

360
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,041
You should get a new chair.

361
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:06,916
I…

362
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,275
It’s just a meal.

363
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,166
Why am I so nervous?

364
00:20:23,425 --> 00:20:24,208
Sichen!

365
00:20:49,575 --> 00:20:51,958
You are late on our first date.

366
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,541
Am I?

367
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,416
Just one minute late.

368
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,850
It’s… It’s a bouquet!

369
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,875
It’s for you.

370
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:03,575
He brought her a bouquet!

371
00:21:04,675 --> 00:21:06,250
And it’s quite an expensive one.

372
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:07,666
Thank you. It’s so pretty.

373
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:10,916
Answer me and be honest.

374
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,750
Why are you this beautiful?

375
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,083
Did you learn the cliché

376
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:22,916
sweet talks

377
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,166
from Shang Ke?

378
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,708
Don’t say that anymore.

379
00:21:27,025 --> 00:21:27,916
Yes, ma’am!

380
00:21:28,325 --> 00:21:29,208
My sweetheart!

381
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,458
It’s also something
Shang Ke would say.

382
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,333
Stop that!

383
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:33,625
Fine.

384
00:21:35,175 --> 00:21:35,875
Here.

385
00:21:43,075 --> 00:21:43,617
It’s mine.

386
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,333
You are so bad.

387
00:22:25,675 --> 00:22:28,041
Your steak looks good.

388
00:22:28,575 --> 00:22:29,375
Very tasty!

389
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,583
When can I find a boyfriend like that?

390
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,916
Your boyfriend is not bad either.

391
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:54,125
I think it’s really good.

392
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,634
I’ll order another one for you.

393
00:22:57,634 --> 00:22:58,775
That’s not what I meant.

394
00:22:59,025 --> 00:22:59,733
I…

395
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:00,550
Yeah.

396
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,300
So sweet!

397
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,350
Oh.

398
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,583
I see what you mean now.

399
00:23:12,175 --> 00:23:12,800
Hmm.

400
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,791
I know what you want,

401
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,166
but I won’t do it.

402
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:33,000
I bought this movie especially for you.

403
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:34,416
You can’t wait to watch it, can you?

404
00:23:36,175 --> 00:23:38,000
You like horror movies?

405
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,000
Are you afraid?

406
00:23:39,925 --> 00:23:40,750
I don’t know.

407
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:44,291
Xiaoya used to tell ghost stories a lot,

408
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,833
so I didn’t dare to watch horror movies.

409
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,583
I don’t know if I’ll be scared.

410
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,541
That’s great!

411
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:50,000
What?

412
00:23:50,675 --> 00:23:51,583
Nothing.

413
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,750
Let’s get it started.

414
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:27,708
Sichen.

415
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:32,750
You…

416
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:36,583
I’m fine. I’m fine.

417
00:25:03,825 --> 00:25:04,700
Xixi!

418
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:06,052
Gu Xixi!

419
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,625
Gu Xixi!

420
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,750
I think horror movies are fun.

421
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:20,708
Let’s watch a few more.

422
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,750
More?

423
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:25,250
I’m not afraid of it.

424
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,041
I just think it’s not exciting enough.

425
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:32,999
Let’s watch something else.

426
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,000
Gu Xixi.

427
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,666
I’m going to bed.

428
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:41,791
You haven’t brushed your teeth yet.

429
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:46,125
Let’s do it together.

430
00:25:48,025 --> 00:25:48,583
Okay.

431
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:49,583
I’ll go with you.

432
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:50,200
- Let’s go.
- Hmm.

433
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,375
Sichen.

434
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,450
Are you afraid?

435
00:26:02,925 --> 00:26:03,525
Hmm.

436
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,041
Still afraid?

437
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:07,958
I’m right here, aren’t I?

438
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:14,583
Looks like this horror movie

439
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:16,225
really traumatized you.

440
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:18,875
Hmm.

441
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:27,333

00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:43,250
I’m fine, grandma.

514
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:43,833
Now,

515
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:44,750
give me your hand.

516
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:48,416
38!

517
00:30:49,708 --> 00:30:50,750
You are having a fever.

518
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:52,958
Madam Song.

519
00:30:52,958 --> 00:30:53,475
Yes.

520
00:30:53,475 --> 00:30:54,225
Call a doctor over.

521
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:56,250
It’s okay.

522
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,208
You don’t have to.

523
00:30:57,291 --> 00:30:59,458
I’ll be fine after taking some medicine.

524
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:00,541
You are burning up.

525
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:01,833
You need a doctor to treat you.

526
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:02,500
Listen to him.

527
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:03,375
You’ve got

528
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:04,333
to lie down and wait

529
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:05,458
for the doctor to come.

530
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:07,208
Be good.

531
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:09,000
Come here.

532
00:31:13,958 --> 00:31:14,750
What are you doing?

533
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,625
Please, I need to go to work!

534
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,791
The doctor said you need rest.

535
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:20,416
But I’ve already…

536
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:22,500
I’ve sent Fei’ang to your store to help.

537
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:24,075
And I’ll take a day off today

538
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,416
and stay with you at home.

539
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:27,166
You can’t go anywhere today.

540
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:28,666
Stay in bed and rest.

541
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,250
Hello? Zixin.

542
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,500
Hello? Xixi.

543
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:53,000
I went to your store
but I didn’t see you.

544
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:53,791
Is everything okay?

545
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:56,791
I got a cold,

546
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,575
so I have to take a day off.

547
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,125
You are sick?

548
00:32:01,175 --> 00:32:01,775
Yes.

549
00:32:01,775 --> 00:32:02,500
What happened?

550
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:03,833
Did you see a doctor?

551
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:04,583
I’m fine.

552
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:05,791
I feel better now.

553
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:09,541
I’m having a meeting right now,

554
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:11,416
and I’ll have another one in 10 minutes.

555
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:12,916
How about this?

556
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:13,875
As soon as the meeting is over…

557
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:14,750
- It’s okay!
- I’ll go check on you.

558
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,750
Just go back to work, Zixin.

559
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:16,916
I know you are busy.

560
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:17,916
You don’t have to come.

561
00:32:20,525 --> 00:32:21,583
I haven’t…

562
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:23,791
Gu Xixi needs rest.

563
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,083
You can talk to me if there’s anything.

564
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:26,958
Oh, wait. I’m also busy.

565
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:28,250
I’ve got to go. Bye.

566
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:30,175
You…

567
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:34,000
I’ll keep your phone while you are sick.

568
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:34,958
Why?

569
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:36,500
Don’t you remember
what the doctor said?

570
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
You need rest.

571
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:39,166
Staring at the phone for too long

572
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:39,833
will make you tired.

573
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,875
Take this.

574
00:32:45,225 --> 00:32:46,416
It’s too bitter. I don’t want to.

575
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:55,708
How can you get better
if you don’t take the medicine?

576
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,125
But it’s too bitter.

577
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:01,625
I don’t want to take it.

578
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:02,500
If you finish it,

579
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:04,166
I’ll let Madam Song cook

580
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:05,333
whatever you want to eat.

581
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:07,041
I want to drink bubble tea.

582
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:07,708
No.

583
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:13,625
You won’t even grant me
such a small wish.

584
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:14,625
Why would I take it?

585
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:15,791
I’d rather die.

586
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:18,000
I’m just following
the doctor’s instructions.

587
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:20,250
It’s all for your own good.

588
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:21,833
Besides,

589
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:22,875
even if you aren’t sick,

590
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,375
you should still quit such junk food.

591
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:27,541
Now, take it.

592
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:47,625
What are you doing?

593
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:49,458
What are you doing?

594
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:53,375
You’ll get the cold
from me by doing this!

595
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,625
I’ll take it.

596
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:11,958
Be good.

597
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:13,791
Go to bed.

598
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,225
Hmm.

599
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:16,958
Carry me.

600
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,125
Carry me.

601
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,333
Have a good rest.

602
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,416
I’ll go back to work now.

603
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:42,791
I want you to stay with me.

604
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,000
Okay.

605
00:35:48,666 --> 00:35:49,333
You woke up.

606
00:35:50,975 --> 00:35:52,083
When did you get up?

607
00:35:52,325 --> 00:35:53,166
Do you feel better?

608
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,333
Much better.

609
00:35:58,958 --> 00:35:59,666
It’s true.

610
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:00,875
Stay in bed.

611
00:36:01,166 --> 00:36:02,291
I’ll go get you something to eat.

612
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,150
Hmm.

613
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:09,833
Tell them

614
00:36:10,325 --> 00:36:11,950
that although I’m out of the office
for these couple of days,

615
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:14,375
it doesn’t mean they can
get sloppy at work.

616
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,425
If it happens again,

617
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:18,833
they’d better have their
resignation letters prepared.

618
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:24,642
Sichen,

619
00:36:27,775 --> 00:36:29,250
what are you making?

620
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:31,125
You said you wanted bubble tea,

621
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,416
so I’m making healthy
bubble tea for you.

622
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:35,583
I promise it won’t do any harm to you.

623
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:37,541
Oh, my! This is bubble tea?

624
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:38,125
What else could it be?

625
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:40,333
So, would you like to give it a try?

626
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,500
Come on.

627
00:36:44,541 --> 00:36:46,083
Sichen, I’m not thirsty.

628
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:47,875
You think my cooking

629
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:50,291
is bad, don’t you?

630
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,416
No way.

631
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:53,083
Grandma.

632
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,416
Grandma is having tea
with her friends.

633
00:36:55,958 --> 00:36:57,500
No one can save you.

634
00:37:01,925 --> 00:37:03,291
Mr. Yin, we have a guest.

635
00:37:04,575 --> 00:37:05,625
We’ve got a visitor.

636
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:22,250
Zixin.

637
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,166
What are you doing here?

638
00:37:25,791 --> 00:37:27,416
Xixi, it’s for you.

639
00:37:27,725 --> 00:37:28,666
Thank you.

640
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:30,916
I haven’t seen you
for days at your store.

641
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,333
I’m worried about your health,

642
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,416
so I came by to check on you.

643
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:34,083
How are you feeling?

644
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:35,125
Have you got better?

645
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:36,583
Thank you, Zixin.

646
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:37,750
I feel much better now.

647
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,375
I can go to work tomorrow.

648
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:41,125
Thank you for helping me these days.

649
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:41,916
Don’t mention it.

650
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:43,150
What a rare guest!

651
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:45,333
Mr. Mo,

652
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:47,833
what brought you here
to my humble home?

653
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,083
How may I help you?

654
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:51,875
I’m here to check on Xixi.

655
00:37:54,275 --> 00:37:55,583
And you brought a bouquet.

656
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:57,541
That’s very thoughtful of you.

657
00:37:58,875 --> 00:37:59,958
I’m just stopping by.

658
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:02,666
Hope you won’t mind.

659
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:03,791
Of course not.

660
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:06,833
After all, you are here
to visit my wife.

661
00:38:07,175 --> 00:38:08,583
So you are my guest, too.

662
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:10,333
Take a seat.

663
00:38:11,425 --> 00:38:12,050
Give it to me.

664
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:17,250
Zixin, please sit.

665
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:22,375
I came here in a hurry,

666
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:23,800
and I didn’t have time
to buy other things,

667
00:38:24,225 --> 00:38:25,041
but I thought

668
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:26,875
you’d like this.

669
00:38:27,475 --> 00:38:29,500
How did you know
I like this kind of bubble tea?

670
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:30,958
I asked Xiaoya,

671
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,458
and she told me that when you are sick,

672
00:38:32,583 --> 00:38:33,958
you always drink this bubble tea,

673
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:35,291
which makes you feel better.

674
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:36,083
Thank you, Zixin.

675
00:38:37,666 --> 00:38:39,541
He’s got a helper.

676
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:43,416
Gu Xixi,

677
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:45,333
between the two cups of bubble tea,
you need to choose one.

678
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:00,583
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

679
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:14,375
You’ve had the bubble tea delivered.

680
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:15,666
Now you can go.

681
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:20,083
I happen to feel a little thirsty.

682
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,750
Mr. Yin, it’s quite tasty.

683
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:39,833
Thanks.

684
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:44,291
Xixi, if there’s nothing else,

685
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:45,791
I’ll leave now.

686
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:46,708
Hope you’ll get well soon.

687
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:48,833
See you, Zixin.

688
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,833
I thought the bubble tea was for me,

689
00:39:57,833 --> 00:39:59,041
yet I didn’t get to drink any.

690
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:05,083
I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

691
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:07,166
It’s okay. It’s okay. It’s okay.

692
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:24,541
Congrats!

693
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:26,416
Looks like you’ve got
what you wanted.

694
00:40:28,925 --> 00:40:29,958
How did you know?

695
00:40:30,475 --> 00:40:31,291
You know what?

696
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:33,208
There are two words
written on your forehead.

697
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:34,625
In love.

698
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:37,875
Is it that obvious?

699
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:40,750
Do you know what’s written
on my forehead?

700
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:42,583
Let me see.

701
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:45,416
Envious!

702
00:40:46,525 --> 00:40:47,650
Gu Xixi,

703
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,850
let me warn you,

704
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:50,125
you are not allowed

705
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:51,208
to show off your love in front of me!

706
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:51,833
Otherwise,

707
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:54,625
I’d feel really sad!

708
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,916
Miss Lin Xiaoya,

709
00:40:56,975 --> 00:40:59,250
I don’t think your warning works.

710
00:41:00,275 --> 00:41:03,000
Then what about the warning
of our turnover?

711
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,791
You know what?

712
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:08,291
The other brands are all outspending
the competitors on marketing,

713
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:10,666
such as hiring celebrity spokesperson,
or introducing co-branded products.

714
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:13,000
Compared to them,
our marketing effort is too weak.

715
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,258
We’ll be short in loan next month.

716
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:18,958
What should we do, boss?

717
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,208
Call our shareholder over.

718
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:24,500
We’ll hold a shareholder’s meeting.

719
00:41:29,175 --> 00:41:30,041
Therefore,

720
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:32,208
we need to strengthen the publicity

721
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:34,416
and enhance brand awareness
and influence.

722
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,708
Maybe we should hire
a celebrity spokesperson, too.

723
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,666
We don’t have that kind of money.

724
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:41,250
It’s true.

725
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,000
That’s easy.

726
00:41:43,575 --> 00:41:45,708
I can promote your brand
on the homepage of our website,

727
00:41:45,725 --> 00:41:46,625
and it’s free.

728
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:52,083
I think we should take it slow
when it comes to publicity.

729
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:54,333
If we do too much all at once,

730
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:55,458
we may get negative results.

731
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:57,416
Our main customers

732
00:41:57,458 --> 00:41:58,541
are females,

733
00:41:59,041 --> 00:41:59,666
so

734
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:01,541
wining over the female customers

735
00:42:01,541 --> 00:42:03,208
is very important for us.

736
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:04,850
How about this?

737
00:42:06,041 --> 00:42:08,000
I have a tentative suggestion.

738
00:42:12,125 --> 00:42:13,916
The power is out again.

739
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:15,458
Xiaoya, let’s go take a look.

740
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:17,458
Zixin, please wait here for us.

741
00:42:17,708 --> 00:42:18,166
Okay.

742
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:19,750
You are not afraid, huh?

743
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:39,916
Mr. Yin.

744
00:42:40,675 --> 00:42:41,541
Are you here to see Xixi?

745
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:44,625
Where is she?

746
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:46,916
She’s busy.

747
00:42:47,275 --> 00:42:49,609
You can take a seat and wait for her.

748
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:57,166
How can I bother you
for such a small problem?

749
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:58,375
Let me fix it.

750
00:42:58,375 --> 00:42:59,083
It’s alright.

751
00:43:00,075 --> 00:43:02,033
There’s not enough space
on the table for both of us anyway.

752
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:05,208
Why don’t you help me
stabilize the table?

753
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:19,166
I didn’t know the CEO
of the Wenye Group

754
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:22,400
was also good at fixing the light bulb.

755
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,450
It’s because I like

756
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:24,833
to do things in the lights.

757
00:43:25,666 --> 00:43:26,650
Not like someone else

758
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:29,500
who’s used to enjoying
the fruits of others’ labor.

759
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:33,791
You should mind your own business.
