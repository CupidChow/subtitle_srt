60
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:25,332
I did.

61
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,916
I thought Ran Xiwei

62
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,416
would bad-mouth us,

63
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,291
but the whole thing was like an ode.

64
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,666
Who are those trolls

65
00:03:31,707 --> 00:03:33,050
to spew nonsense on us,

66
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,416
saying our reputation is undeserved?

67
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:35,750
She spoke for us

68
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:36,707
in the comment area

69
00:03:36,707 --> 00:03:37,916
which only led to more controversies.

70
00:03:40,475 --> 00:03:41,666
One last question.

71
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,875
One of the recent trending topics

72
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,250
is that Alex asked you

73
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,916
to be in charge of Marry Me

74
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:48,582
but you said no to him.

75
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,082
May I ask

76
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,416
why you turned him down?

77
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,332
Let me be clear.

78
00:03:53,475 --> 00:03:55,625
I’m a huge fan of Alex

79
00:03:55,675 --> 00:03:58,082
and his design

80
00:03:58,275 --> 00:04:00,525
and I appreciate his kind offer.

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,707
But it’s always been my dream

82
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,875
to have my own brand.

83
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:05,875
So,

84
00:04:06,332 --> 00:04:08,457
there are some tough decisions to make.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,916
You said it yourself

86
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:12,500
that you’re Alex’s fan.

87
00:04:12,675 --> 00:04:14,166
Is it safe to say

88
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,625
that your design is inspired by his?

89
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,540
I guess you could say that

90
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,068
because I’m familiar with all his works.

91
00:04:21,475 --> 00:04:22,267
Still,

92
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:23,950
my design remains independent

93
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,575
and it represents my own idea.

94
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,625
I do hope

95
00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:29,665
I can be a great designer like him.

96
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:31,925
Thank you for your time, Miss Gu.

97
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,208
What’s on your mind?

98
00:04:36,725 --> 00:04:37,682
I’m thinking

99
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,875
it can’t be a coincidence

100
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,290
that every argument

101
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,290
and question

102
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,583
match those

103
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:45,583
in Ran Xiwei’s interview.

104
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,875
What’s more,

105
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:47,958
this article is elevating CICI

106
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,833
to an international brand,

107
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,250
and emphasizing my refusal

108
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,833
in every letter

109
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:55,192
without even a word
about my explanation.

110
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,375
Yeah.

111
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,875
And let’s not forget

112
00:04:57,915 --> 00:04:59,500
this is Ran Xiwei’s Official Account.

113
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,415
She can say whatever she wants.

114
00:05:01,415 --> 00:05:02,375
Maybe

115
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,415
she paid them
to say bad things about us.

116
00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:07,600
But what’s in it for her?

117
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,333
Wake up, silly!

118
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,500
Right now,

119
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,083
you’re Yin Sichen’s wife.

120
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,375
She’s probably getting back at you

121
00:05:13,415 --> 00:05:15,000
for him.

122
00:05:15,175 --> 00:05:16,675
What a witch!

123
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,525
OK. Stop.

124
00:05:19,915 --> 00:05:21,458
Enough about her. My head is exploding.

125

Our top priority

126
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,540
is to clear CICI’s name

127
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,400
and reduce the damage to the minimum.

128
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,350
I agree.

129
00:05:29,775 --> 00:05:31,600
(You call that design? It’s crap!)

130
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,575

You’re nowhere near his level!)

You’re good!)

133
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,415
I heard about what happened.

134
00:06:00,975 --> 00:06:02,475
Why didn’t you tell me?

135
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,000
Gu Xixi, arguing with them

136
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,415
is a pure waste of time.

137
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,090
The public doesn’t need
your defense.

138
00:06:12,225 --> 00:06:13,600
So I should sit and do nothing

139
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,790
while they accuse me
of things I didn’t do?

140
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,165
I did nothing wrong.

141
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,958
And they need to know the truth.

142
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:19,665
Yes.

143
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,185
You’re innocent,

144
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,300
but the more you speak,

145
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,350
the stronger the backlash gets.

146
00:06:24,975 --> 00:06:25,875
It’s better

147
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,625
that you wait for it to blow over,

148
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,833
and then post a short and sweet

149

clarification.

150
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,825
Yin Sichen,

151
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,165
if you were in my shoe,

152
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,625
would you do the same?

153
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,665
Of course I would.

154
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,632
It’s the best solution.

155
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,625
Don’t let your emotions
cloud your judgment.

156
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,850
Think rationally.

157
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,375
Like I said

158
00:06:47,225 --> 00:06:50,725

I’m here to help?

That day at the masquerade...

162
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,208
I knew what happened.

163
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,760
I already did.

164
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,418
I’m busy. Could you leave me alone?

165
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,708
Aren’t I here to explain to her?

166
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,460
Now, she needs to rest.

00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:25,050
(Shut it down!
Stop embarrassing yourself!)

174
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,750
You can’t abuse my woman!

175
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,208
Yin Sichen is probably right.

176
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,541
They can’t be reasoned with.

177
00:08:42,925 --> 00:08:44,383
I gotta calm down.

178
00:08:51,975 --> 00:08:54,500
Iced Americano.

179
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,434
Who’s that?

180
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,083
He argued with so many of them.

181
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,000
Why would he defend me?

182
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,083
Could he be my hardcore fan?

183
00:09:13,425 --> 00:09:15,708
Hi, thanks for speaking for me.

184
00:09:40,575 --> 00:09:44,775
(Hi, thanks for speaking for me.)

185
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,083
Gu Xixi, how dare you!

186
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,134
You stayed out all night again!

187
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,775
What are you doing here?

188
00:10:17,925 --> 00:10:19,425
I should ask you that.

189
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,492
Gu Xixi,

190
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,000
where were you

191
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,000
the whole night?

192
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,791
You’re married, OK?

193
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,208
Mr. Yin, nice to meet you again.

194
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,792
Don’t you have work to do, Mr. Mo?

195
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,050
Why are you always here?

196
00:10:37,275 --> 00:10:39,108
It’s not what you think.

197
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,583
Xixi and I

198
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,250
are working on a counterplan.

199
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,916
She’s got some ideas

200
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:44,791
and we’re exchanging views.

201
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,958
She already has me.

202
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,916
We don’t wanna trouble you.

203
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:51,416
I’m her friend

204
00:10:51,475 --> 00:10:53,041
and shareholder

205
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,250
which makes this store my business, too.

206
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:55,875
Gu Xixi,

207
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:57,916
this should be our store.

208
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:01,500
It belongs to me.

209
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But I’m your husband!

210
00:11:03,925 --> 00:11:04,541
You...

211
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,208
Sorry to interrupt,

212
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,041
but here isn’t Why Mall

213
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:12,916
and we aren’t discussing family matters.

214
00:11:13,425 --> 00:11:14,875
Please respect

215
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,291
the owner of CICI.

216
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:38,958
I’m sorry.

217
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,633
You still haven’t patched things up?

218
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:48,825
You must be hungry.

219
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:50,483
Breakfast is on me.

220
00:12:10,525 --> 00:12:11,275
President.

221
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,541
How could Mo Zixin be her shareholder

222
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:15,375
but not me?

223
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,275
Aren’t I hotter,

224
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,575
richer

225
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,750
and a better investor than him?

226
00:12:19,975 --> 00:12:21,625
She chose the wrong guy.

227
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,000
I understand perfectly

228
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,375
how bad you feel,

229
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,250
but I strongly advise you

230
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,708
not to argue with her over that

231
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,625
especially now.

232
00:12:29,975 --> 00:12:31,875
Given that
your misunderstanding still stands

233
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,333
and her business is in crisis,

234
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,958
the best way to help her

235
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,250
is to focus on

236
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,375
her biggest issue.

237
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,333
I know.

238
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:41,375
That attack is organized

239
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,000
in an attempt to destroy Gu Xixi.

240
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,708
I thought she knew where the line was,

241
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,250
but she didn’t,

242
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,916
and crossed it way too far!

243
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:49,675
Who’s she?

244
00:12:51,725 --> 00:12:53,208
What a surprise visit!

245
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,425
I called you several times

246
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,850
but you didn’t pick up.

247
00:12:59,825 --> 00:13:01,825
I heard you’re being cyber-bullied

248
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:04,392
because of that article.

249
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,450
Oh, that.

250
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,375
Don’t worry.

251
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,166
I’m fine. It’s nothing.

252
00:13:09,525 --> 00:13:11,525
I can handle it.

253
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:12,875
My point being,

254
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,500
as that article is featuring Gu Xixi,

255
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,500
she’s abused and attacked, too,

256
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,083
over the past few days.

257
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,666
So you’re concerned about her.

258
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,083
I didn’t expect any of that.

259
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,541
I meant to

260
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,791
help promote her brand

261
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,125
but somehow, it backfired.

262
00:13:39,175 --> 00:13:39,925
I know.

263
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:45,000
Some people could be
scarier than we thought.

264
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,008
Xiwei,

265
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,875
I also read that article.

266
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,983
It twisted facts about CICI
in a subtle way

267
00:13:53,425 --> 00:13:55,375
that was oblivious to Xixi,

268
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,250
but you should’ve picked that up.

269
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,017
I’m sorry for my negligence

270
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,458
but I was way too busy at the time,

271
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:04,708
so I had my people

272
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,167
review it.

273
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,375
They were too careless.

274
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:09,583
But I promise

275
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,125
that I’ll handle it.

276
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,208
If Xixi

277
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,500
needs anything,

278
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,583
she can always ask me.

279
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,750
That’s unnecessary.

280
00:14:17,575 --> 00:14:18,833
I got her back.

281
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,208
Xiwei,

282
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,666
we’re friends.

283
00:14:25,075 --> 00:14:26,541
If you’re in trouble,

284
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,833
I’ll do my best to help you out

285
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,583
and protect

286
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,416
all that you’ve worked so hard for.

287
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:34,791
That said,

288
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,541
I’m letting certain things slide

289
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,916
not because I’m not seeing them.

290
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,000
Gu Xixi is my wife.

291
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,416
I’ll never allow anyone to hurt her

292
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,583
for any purpose!

293
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,166
What’s that supposed to mean?

294
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:48,708
Are you implying that
I plotted the whole thing?

295
00:14:49,275 --> 00:14:50,541
Why would I do that?

296
00:14:51,175 --> 00:14:52,375
You saw what happened.

297
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,333
I’ve made it clear

298
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,333
that I’m on Gu Xixi’s side

299
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,775
from the very beginning.

300
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:58,358
I’m not implying anything

301
00:14:59,475 --> 00:15:01,684
or thinking the worst of anyone.

302
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,958
But I do hope

303
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,833
this mess stops here and now.

304
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,250
Sichen,

305
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:10,500
you’ve never

306
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,000
given me this attitude before.

307
00:15:12,275 --> 00:15:14,358
Did Gu Xixi say anything to you?

308
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,217
We grew up together.

309
00:15:18,825 --> 00:15:20,742
Don’t you know me?

310
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,500
I cherish our friendship

311
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,634
for old times’ sake

312
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,417
and I hate to see we ruin it.

313
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,675
Quit it before it’s too late.

314
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,333
I got work to do.

315
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,250
Have a nice day.

316
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:38,833
Enjoy your drink.

317
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,666
(Granny)
Xixi is home! Come back now!

318
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,291
Yeah?

319
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,541
Sichen, it’s me.

320
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,375
Come to the pub. It’s urgent!

321
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,166
I just had a meeting and got a break.

322
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,375
It’s not me.

323
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,375
It’s Xiwei. Come quickly!

324
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,166
Xiwei? What about her?

325
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,708
I don’t know what happened

326
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,875
but she asked me to drink with her

327
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,041
and she’s hitting the bottle too hard.

328
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:12,833
We really need you!

329
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,250
Why didn’t you stop her?

330
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,041
Would I call you if I could?

331
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:16,750
Just come over!

332
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,375
I can’t.

333
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:19,375
I’m needed elsewhere.

334
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,333
I don’t care!

335
00:16:20,725 --> 00:16:21,916
We’re old friends.

336
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,375
If anything happens to her,

337
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:24,125
I won’t be easy on you!

338
00:16:24,975 --> 00:16:26,208
It’s your call. We’re waiting.

339
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,500
This way.

340
00:16:37,575 --> 00:16:38,541
We’re here.

341
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,750
She’s already wasted.

342
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,208
Take care of her.

343
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,458
Gotta go. See you.

344
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:53,875
Xiwei.

345
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:57,916
Sichen?

346
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,308
Why are you so cold to me?

347
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,166
We’ve been friends for like forever.

348
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,375
We know each other so well.

349
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:09,625
Does all that mean nothing to you?

350
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:10,875
Do I

351
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,666
mean nothing to you?

352
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,583
You mean a lot to me, Xiwei,

353
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,884
as much as Shang Ke does.

354
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,192
Both of you are
my indispensable friends.

355
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,125
Just friends?

356
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:25,791
After so many years,

357
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,708
I’m used to having you around.

358
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
All our friends believe

359
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,916
we’ll be together eventually.

360
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,333
But why?

361
00:17:35,575 --> 00:17:36,708
Why are you turning a blind eye

362
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:37,958
to all my efforts?

363
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,875
Can’t you see all that I’ve done?

364
00:17:41,175 --> 00:17:43,541
I’m always seeing you as my friend.

365
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,166
Maybe you’re right.

366
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,166
We’re used to each other’s company,

367
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,375
but that’s not affections

368
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,875
or love.

369
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,500
Love is the moment you see someone,

370
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,875
you never wanna let her go.

371
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:57,750
So,

372
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,458
is that “someone” Gu Xixi?

373
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,041
Are you already in love with her?

374
00:18:04,325 --> 00:18:06,617
I don’t want her to get hurt in any way.

375
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:09,583
Shang Ke will take you home.

376
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,666
Get more rest.

377
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:16,541
Sichen...

378
00:19:26,225 --> 00:19:27,083
Xiaoya.

379
00:19:27,475 --> 00:19:28,150
Yeah?

380
00:19:28,425 --> 00:19:29,416
Come here.

381
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,666
What?

382
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:31,333
Come here and look.

383
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,666
See if this statement is good enough.

384
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,000
Read it.

385
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:39,333
It’s well-written.

386
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,375
Accurate and clear with enough evidence.

387
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,916
I’ll post it on Weibo now.

388
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,625
In your face, trolls!

389
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:46,600
Hold it for a few days.

390
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,416
Why?

391
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,791
Weren’t you the one

392
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,375
fighting against them earlier?

393
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,375
Here’s the thing.

394
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,916
Yin Sichen said

395
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,125
the public is still too hot-headed

396
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,708
to think calmly.

397
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,333
Our response should better wait

398
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,416
until they cool down.

399
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,166
I gave it a thought

400
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,125
and found it reasonable.

401
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,708
Didn’t someone call his names

402
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,875
in front of me only a few days ago?

403
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,708
Why the sudden change of attitude?

404
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,175
There might be hidden treasure

405
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:16,708
in a pile of trash, right?

406
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,000
He’s unreliable per se,

407
00:20:18,825 --> 00:20:20,708
but his idea isn’t too bad.

408
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,083
Who are you trying to convince?

409
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:25,666
In that case,

410
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,000
this isn’t your paid poster, isn’t it?

411
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:32,300
Iced Americano?

412
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,333
I thanked him in a private message.

413
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,125
I checked his profile page

414
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,291
and found nothing.

415
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,250
That ID was recently registered.

416
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,000
So I assumed you hired him.

417
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:49,666
That tone is familiar.

418
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,500
What’s wrong?

419
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,708
It’s Yin Sichen!

420
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:01,250
Him?

421
00:21:05,775 --> 00:21:07,483
I’m gonna give him a good talking-to.

422
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,958
Calm down. Don’t be mad.

423
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,625
He was defending us.

424
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,583
He asked me to stop

425
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,416
but he started a war online.

426
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,250
What was that?

427
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,750
I guess he tried to protect you.

428
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:22,416
Alright.

429
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,541
Forget about him.

430
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,708
Leave all that mess behind.

431
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,000
Even a computer

432
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,625
can’t work 24/7, much less you.

433
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:29,250
Look at yourself.

434
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,083
Your dark circles are reaching your jaw.

435
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,083
It’s time

436
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:32,916
to take a break from work

437
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,250
and all our problems.

438
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,000
Or your CPU will overheat.

439
00:21:36,925 --> 00:21:37,625
I can’t.

440
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,250
I must

441
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,166
focus on the work.

442
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,416
No, you’re not.

443
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,208
You’re gonna go shopping,

444
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,458
have fun and relax yourself.

445
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,166
Don’t exhaust yourself to death.

446
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,500
Xixi.

447
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,208
Hi. Hello.

448
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:51,916
I’m here.

449
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,675
(A new private message.)

450
00:22:01,275 --> 00:22:02,975
(Gu Xixi)
Don’t interfere again.

451
00:22:03,675 --> 00:22:06,550
And don’t cross the line yourself.

452
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,850
I can explain.

453
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,800
(Message successfully sent
but rejected by the receiver.)

454
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,258
She unfriended me?

455
00:22:16,825 --> 00:22:17,583
Hey,

456
00:22:17,775 --> 00:22:18,325
uh...

457
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,500
Mr. Mo, take a seat.

458
00:22:19,775 --> 00:22:20,458
No, thanks.

459
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:21,333
I won’t stay for too long.

460
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:23,958
I thought long and hard at home

461
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,708
and realized this matter
is bigger than we thought.

462
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:27,250
Given that

463
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,000
neither of you
have candled PR crisis before,

464
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:30,083
the longer we wait,

465
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,791
the worse CICI looks in the public eye.

466
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:32,500
Exactly.

467
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,125
They’re still launching attacks
online this morning

468
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,791
with dozens of pages of catty comments.

469
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:37,708
So I’m thinking

470
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:40,000
maybe it’s time to bring in
Wenye Group’s PR team

471
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,825
to help CICI out.

472
00:22:44,075 --> 00:22:45,250
I understand your concern.

473
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,166
But no worries.

474
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,166
Wenye Group won’t be under the spotlight

475
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,000
or connected to this matter.

476
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,708
The tricky part is

477
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:53,875
the public doesn’t trust my capacity.

478
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:55,458
They think I’m not a qualified designer.

479
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,166
Having a PR team

480
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,583
reverse their opinion

481
00:22:58,625 --> 00:22:59,666
might not be the best choice.

482
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:01,458
What we need is a chance

483
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,375
to prove ourselves to everyone.

484
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:04,458
I like what you think.

485
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,416
Still,

486
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:08,625
I don’t know what to do.

487
00:23:08,775 --> 00:23:09,875
But trust me.

488
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,416
Give me some time

489
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:12,850
and I’ll figure it out.

490
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,083
We’ll figure it out.

491
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,875
I’m your shareholder, no?

492
00:23:16,075 --> 00:23:17,541
I’ll always stand behind you.

493
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,750
We should be dealing with this together.

494
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:22,125
That’s right.

495
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:22,916
We’ll do it together!

496
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:28,250
Xiaoxin,

497
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:30,708
ask Miss Mu to come over.

498
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,625
Yes, Mr. Shang.

499
00:23:35,025 --> 00:23:38,025
Is she gonna like this pose?

500
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,250
Wait. Or should I be like this?

501
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:42,750
What’s up?

502
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,458
While we’re here,

503
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,975
please sign these files.

504
00:23:48,975 --> 00:23:50,750
What would you like for dinner?

505
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,625
Can’t you ask me that in a message?

506
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,125
I miss you!

507
00:23:55,525 --> 00:23:57,125
Sign the files first.

508
00:23:58,025 --> 00:23:59,025
You got it.

509
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,675
Who the hell is that?

510
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,225
(Dear Mother)

511
00:24:16,925 --> 00:24:17,925
Hi, Mom.

512
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:18,592
What’s up?

513
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,916
Mrs. Zhao’s daughter, Qing,
is back from abroad.

514
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,083
Come home tonight.

515
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,333
We’re gonna have dinner together.

516
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:25,291
- I’m busy.
- Go ahead.

517
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:27,125
I told them you’d be there.

518
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:28,166
Besides,

519
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,041
you and Qing
haven’t seen each other for years.

520
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:32,500
You guys can catch up over dinner.

521
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:33,541
But, Mom,

522
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:35,833
I’m already seeing someone.

523
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:36,666
Who is that?

524
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,208
- It’s huge.
- Are you nuts?

525
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:39,291
Why didn’t you say anything about it?

526
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,041
Stop it!

527
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,250
Mom, gotta go. Duty calls.

528
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,083
Can’t talk.

529
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:50,167
Why did you tell her?

530
00:24:50,575 --> 00:24:52,783
That’s my mom.

531
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,450
We’re in a relationship, aren’t we?

532
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,742
There’s nothing to hide.
Why keep it secret?

533
00:24:56,742 --> 00:24:57,916
I don’t want everyone

534
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:59,350
to know about our thing.

535
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:02,083
My mom isn’t them. She needs to know.

536
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,458
Don’t tell her yet.

537
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,375
But... Uh...

538
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:10,334
And dinner... What’s for dinner?

539
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,550
Xixi. Xixi!

540
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,083
Granny.

541
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,458
Look at me.

542
00:25:19,575 --> 00:25:20,625
How do I look in this dress?

543
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:23,050
Isn’t that from our brand, Granny?

544
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,708
You look fabulous in it!

545
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,166
I picked it up from your store.

546
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:26,708
Granny,

547
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:27,541
how about I put on

548
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:28,916
something similar

549
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:30,166
and go to the mall with you?

550
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:30,916
Great idea!

551
00:25:31,175 --> 00:25:32,800
That’s fantastic!

552
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,350
We haven’t gone shopping together.

553
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:38,583
- Yeah! Let’s go!
- Let’s go! Let’s go!

554
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,166
Look.

555
00:25:49,225 --> 00:25:50,550
Be careful, Granny.

556
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,708
She’s old but stylish.

557
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:53,208
I agree. She’s got good taste!

558
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:53,850
Yeah.

559
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:54,791
Xixi,

560
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:57,875
I look OK in this dress, right?

561
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:00,583
Better than OK!

562
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:01,541
Excuse me.

563
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:02,583
May I ask,

564
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:04,166
where did you get that outfit?

565
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:06,458
My mom’s birthday is coming.

566

That’s the best way

575
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:32,458
I could think of

576

to prove our ability to design.

00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:36,875
Brilliant!

It’s Granny, actually.

people refuse a change of style

582

because they fear what others may think

583
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,375
and if it will turn out well.

584

OK.

and meanwhile, develop our brand.

- Indeed.

Here.

595

Not good enough. Give her another one.

597

606

called The Average’s Makeover.

607
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,541
They’ve got videos ready

608
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:46,791
and reached out to the content farm

609

to promote their program.

610
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,708
They must’ve racked their brain for it.

611
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:52,041
Inform them

612
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,416

I never meant to draw a line between us.

685
00:30:38,175 --> 00:30:38,925
Hell,

686
00:30:40,525 --> 00:30:42,108
I even hoped there’d never be

687
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,675
such a thing between us.

688
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:46,958
I unfriended him

689
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,442
and didn’t see all those messages.

690
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,866
Did he also not know I...?

691

OK.

717
00:32:17,275 --> 00:32:18,375
I’m going back to work.

00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:19,958
See you tonight.

719
00:32:21,925 --> 00:32:22,525
See you.

720
00:32:29,916 --> 00:32:31,375
That’s a date!

721
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,166
Stop it!

722
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,425
(You just paid 16,500 RMB
with your credit card.)

723
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:49,291
(Gu Xixi)
Sorry, I can’t make it.

724
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:50,458
Something turned up last minute.

725
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:51,416
I hope you can understand.

726
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:52,666
She canceled it?

727
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,708
What could possibly trump our date?

728
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,125
Come in.

729
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:02,375
Hi, Sichen.

730
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,875
What brings you here?

731
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:07,791
Is everything OK?

732
00:33:08,775 --> 00:33:10,041
I came

733
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:11,333
to apologize.

734
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,416
What happened to Xixi

735
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:14,500
was my fault.

736
00:33:15,075 --> 00:33:16,742
I brought you your favorite, though.

737
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:18,958
Thanks.

738
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:20,750
Leave it to the side.

739
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,875
Aren’t you gonna taste it?

740
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,067
Rice noodles with clams!

741
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,017
Rice noodles with clams?

742
00:33:28,275 --> 00:33:29,625
When we were abroad,

743
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:32,000
we’d go to that Chinese restaurant

744
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:33,291
for your favorite
rice noodles with clams

745
00:33:33,416 --> 00:33:34,833
every time we finished the exercises

746
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:36,475
for the final exam.

747
00:33:36,925 --> 00:33:38,583
When you went to the men’s room,

748
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,916
I’d eat up

749
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:42,441
all the clams in your bowl.

750
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:44,325
One time, you caught me

751
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:45,958
and said

752
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,067
you’d remember me for that forever.

753
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:51,958
That was a joke.

754
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,583
I had totally forgotten about it

755
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:54,458
before you brought it up.

756
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:57,750
I still remember I was happy every day

757
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,542
because you were always with me.

758
00:34:13,075 --> 00:34:13,867
Smells good.

759
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:16,375
You can’t find it elsewhere.

760
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:17,666
It’s custom-made.

761
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,500
Since when did you cook?

762
00:34:21,075 --> 00:34:22,242
After you came back after graduation,

763
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:24,625
I still went to that place regularly

764
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,733
and made friends with their chef.

765
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,584
He taught me the skill.

766
00:34:29,825 --> 00:34:31,325
Why did you learn to
cook this dish in the first place?

767
00:34:32,275 --> 00:34:33,359
Because you like it.

768
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,250
Back then,

769
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,791
I thought

770
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,416
I’d make it for you every day
once I was home,

771
00:34:42,575 --> 00:34:44,158
but I probably came back too late.

772
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,358
That’s fine.

773
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:47,625
I can still make it for you

774
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:49,000
anytime you want.

775
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,900
You don’t have to...

776
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,708
Don’t move!

777
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,775
Your vest went up.

778
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,666
(Lin Xiaoya)
Gu Xixi’s family is in trouble!

779
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:16,416
You know

780
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:18,583
why I stole clams from your bowl?

781
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,083
Sichen, I haven’t changed a bit.

782
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:24,291
I’m needed elsewhere.

783
00:35:25,075 --> 00:35:25,875
Gotta go.

784
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,166
I’ll wait here for you.

785
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:27,875
No need.

786
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:29,125
Enjoy the rice noodles.

787
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,516
I appreciate your work,

788
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,083
but you can stop making them.

789
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,083
This way, please.

790
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,541
Excuse me.

791
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,291
Sorry, Miss,

792
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,291
I called this beautician first.

793
00:35:52,925 --> 00:35:53,875
What’s going on?

794
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:55,291
Is this how you treat your VIP?

795
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,250
Even VIPs got ranks.

796
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,666
I’ll pay extra.

797
00:35:59,975 --> 00:36:01,291
I’ll double it.

798
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,833
(Bank of China Private Banking)
My husband gave me this secondary card

799
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:06,333
and put no limits on it.

800
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,208
You’ll pay double?

801
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,716
I’m intimidated.

802
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,666
Is that how much your face is worth?

803
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:12,499
I’ll pay triple.

804
00:36:12,725 --> 00:36:13,375
Quadruple.

805
00:36:13,375 --> 00:36:13,925
Quintuple.

806
00:36:13,925 --> 00:36:14,550
Sextuple.

807
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,133
Deal!

808
00:36:16,325 --> 00:36:17,492
She’s all yours.

809
00:36:17,825 --> 00:36:18,450
OK.

810
00:36:20,325 --> 00:36:22,033
How dare you try to steal my beautician!

811
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:23,666
Are you new to salons?

812
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:24,333
How dare you steal

813
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:26,166
someone else’s husband and father!

814
00:36:26,575 --> 00:36:27,708
Are you that cheap?

815
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:28,850
What did you say?

816
00:36:31,275 --> 00:36:32,666
Are you...?

817
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,592
Are you Gu Jiaqiang’s daughter?

818
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:35,217
That’s right.

819
00:36:35,975 --> 00:36:37,041
I’m Gu Xixi.

820
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:39,458
Oh, that’s you.

821
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:41,900
You look average.

822
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:44,000
What did Yin Sichen see in you?

823
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,000
Don’t feel too good about yourself.

824
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,208
When you get old and gross,

825
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:49,708
he’ll dump you for sure!

826
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:50,500
I’m sorry, Miss Xu,

827
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,666
but your card has been declined.

828
00:36:52,475 --> 00:36:53,500
No way!

829
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,708
Your bill is

830
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:56,541
158,300 yuan.

831
00:36:56,541 --> 00:36:57,375
Try again.

832
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,592
OK.

833
00:36:58,592 --> 00:36:59,708
It’ll still be declined.

834
00:37:00,675 --> 00:37:03,500
That card got my name on it

835
00:37:03,975 --> 00:37:05,350
and I’ve told the bank I had lost it.

836
00:37:06,025 --> 00:37:06,958
You’ll have to pay

837
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,625
from your own pocket.

838
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:11,166
Gu Xixi,

839
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:12,208
you set me up!

840
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:13,208
Yes, I did.

841
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:15,208
Or why would I take time

842
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:16,708
to run into you?

843
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:18,416
Xu Qian, I’m warning you

844
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:20,166
that stay away from married men!

845
00:37:20,425 --> 00:37:21,916
Aren’t you ashamed of yourself

846
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:22,650
calling my dad your husband?

847
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,708
He wanted it. He threw himself at me.

848
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,291
I know my dad is at fault,

849
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:29,208
but aren’t you?

850
00:37:29,825 --> 00:37:30,958
You’re almost 50,

851
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:33,708
but you said you’re 30 online
to scam married men.

852
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,875
You could be liable for fraud.

853
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:36,916
You’re bluffing!

854
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,166
That’s attempted assault.

855
00:37:41,475 --> 00:37:42,891
You’ll still be held responsible.

856
00:37:45,675 --> 00:37:46,541
Are you OK?

857
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,850
You don’t know
Gu Xixi’s true colors, do you?

858
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,708
She’s average and humble

859
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,125
who must’ve tricked you
into marrying her.

860
00:37:54,425 --> 00:37:56,175
You really should look into her.

861
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,083
I bet your marriage is part of her plot.

862
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:01,666
You’re right.

863
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
It is a plot.

864
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,875
I fell for Gu Xixi

865
00:38:07,225 --> 00:38:08,541
at first sight,

866
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:10,750
and then I deliberately plotted a plan

867
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,458
to lead her right into my trap.

868
00:38:13,775 --> 00:38:15,817
I went all out to win her heart

869
00:38:16,075 --> 00:38:17,616
and eventually, she had to marry me.

870
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,666
She’s a homewrecker!

871
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,166
She’s having an affair
with a married man.

872
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:22,708
Yeah!

873
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:24,125
How brazen she is!

874
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:25,750
I know. She doesn’t look like one.

875
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:27,916
She’ll be damned!

876
00:38:27,916 --> 00:38:28,375
You...

877
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,166
Xu Qian,

878
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,041
listen,

879
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:36,833
your humiliation and embarrassment today

880
00:38:37,475 --> 00:38:38,250
aren’t even close

881
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,166
to what my mom has suffered.

882
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,708
Fei’ang,

883
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,708
you take it from here.

884
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:50,708
Read it

885
00:38:51,325 --> 00:38:52,325
or go to the police station.

886
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:55,083
Confession?

887
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,458
I’m Xu Qian, female,

888
00:38:57,475 --> 00:38:58,333
49 years old

889
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:00,500
from Taiping District,
Jiangbei Province.

890
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:02,208
I’ve divorced nine times

891
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:04,050
and had 20 boyfriends.

892
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,708
I pretended to be single

893
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:07,541
to seduce and scam married men.

894
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:08,875
I’m guilty.

895
00:39:09,325 --> 00:39:10,708
My sins are unforgivable.

896
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,083
Please don’t turn me in to the police!

897
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:14,075
I’m begging you!

898
00:39:17,725 --> 00:39:18,666
Read it 10,000 times.

899
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,291
Thanks.

900
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:27,125
Let’s take Mom back to Meishan.

901
00:39:28,275 --> 00:39:29,666
We owe you a big one.

902
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,500
Thank you.

903
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,175
It’s the same as before.

904
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:53,600
Mom.

905
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,325
Yeah?

906
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:56,125
Have a good night.

907
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,992
I’ll take care of the rest.

908
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,166
Well,

909
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:01,125
if there’s nothing else,

910
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,291
I’m off.

911
00:40:02,975 --> 00:40:03,575
OK.

912
00:40:03,708 --> 00:40:04,700
It’s too dark.

913
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,458
You shouldn’t be driving this late.

914
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:07,750
Just stay for the night.

915
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:08,516
Mom.

916
00:40:08,516 --> 00:40:09,125
Yeah?

917
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:11,125
Sichen still has work tomorrow.

918
00:40:11,425 --> 00:40:12,508
That can wait.

919
00:40:14,725 --> 00:40:16,500
Our house

920
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:17,416
is too small for him.

921
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:19,500
Not at all. It’s quite cozy.

922
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,958
As small as it is,

923
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:24,750
there are still two bedrooms.

924
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,875
Mom, I’m sleeping with you tonight.

925
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:28,600
You can’t! You’re married.

926
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,166
I’m fine.

927
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:31,083
Don’t worry about me.

928
00:40:31,416 --> 00:40:32,541
But Mom...!

929
00:40:32,775 --> 00:40:33,791
Alright, be good.

930
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:34,700
It’s a long day.

931
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,583
I’m going back to my room.

932
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:37,666
You kids don’t stay up too late.

933
00:40:37,725 --> 00:40:38,350
OK.

934
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:41,075
Good night, Mom.

935
00:40:41,075 --> 00:40:42,041
Good night.

936
00:40:45,225 --> 00:40:46,000
Come on.

937
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,833
Let’s go to bed.

938
00:40:47,325 --> 00:40:47,875
You...

939
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,541
Is this your old room?

940
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:00,067
You knew there’s only one bed.

941
00:41:00,067 --> 00:41:01,067
Why did you choose to stay?

942
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,875
What are you doing?

943
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:07,875
Going to sleep.

944
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,375
In my bed?

945
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:12,541
I can’t sleep on the floor!

946
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,583
Wait, hold on.

947
00:41:15,583 --> 00:41:16,541
What now?

948
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:18,291
I can’t sleep in my clothes.

949
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:20,125
I’ll go get pajamas. Sit still.

950
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:31,750
These two are all I got.

951
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:33,333
This one is probably too small for you.

952
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:36,208
I’ve never worn this one
because it’s too big.

953
00:41:36,525 --> 00:41:37,150
You can have it.

954
00:41:37,425 --> 00:41:39,458
You’re messing with me, aren’t you?

955
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:40,500
Take it or leave it.

956
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,166
Get changed.

957
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:46,416
I’ll go outside.

958
00:41:58,925 --> 00:41:59,583
Hey,

959
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,375
Gu Xixi...

960
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:03,166
Let me see.

961
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,416
That’s it.

962
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:07,041
Delete it.

963
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,333
I won’t.

964
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:09,166
Never!

965
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:09,833
