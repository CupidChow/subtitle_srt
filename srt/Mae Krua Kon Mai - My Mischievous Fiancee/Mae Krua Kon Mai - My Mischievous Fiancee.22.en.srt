1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,800
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,240
(Previously...)

3
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,280
Not only we lured Dao to meet Doctor.

4
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,320
We will need to make her admit

5
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,080
that she's Faidam.

6
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,160
We'll have Phon take Auntie to Ubon Ratchathani then.

7
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,760
And I'll bring Dao there.

8
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,880
Choose the celebrity you want to be.

9
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,160
Can you tell me,

10
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,880
what kind of person Lomdao is?

11
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,000
Are you ready to meet Miss Dao?

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Of course.

13
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,960
This party is going to be so much fun.

14
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,640
You're going to have a blast.

15
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,360
Dao.

16
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,040
Wow!

17
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,000
She's alone too.

18
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,000
Do you want to join me after the party?

19
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,640
You're beautiful even with that mask on.

20
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,640
If you take it off,

21
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,080
I would be speechless.

22
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,280
Sure.

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,800
What a handsome man, I wouldn't dare reject you.

24
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,120
Oh, an invitation already!

25
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,600
After the party's over, meet me at the backdrop.

26
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,600
I'll send my wife to bed.

27
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,320
Then I'll take you to bed.

28
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,960
Sure!

29
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,040
How about my face, familiar?

30
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,040
This pretty face,

31
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,920
this sexy body,

32
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,960
my wife for sure.

33
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,040
I recognize you, I do!

34
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,640
Where are you going?!

35
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,440
You! You haven't stopped your playboy ways! Sleep outside tonight!

36
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,520
Wait, honey, calm down! Calm down!

37
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,720
People are watching, I'm embarrassed!

38
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,080
- Embarrassed? - Yes, be gentle.

39
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,080
- Really? - Yes.

40
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,480
- Really? - Yeah, gentle!

41
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,520
- Yes. - Okay, fine! Gentle!

42
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,760
Gentle as phoenix feather.

43
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,600
Full socket, full socket.

44
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,760
Where's the waiter? Come here.

45
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,480
Give me one more of this dish.

46
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,400
The flavor is so rich Grandma! So delicious!

47
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,840
It's the same place that I used to order for you

48
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,360
when you were a kid, don't you remember?

49
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240
Delicious!

50
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,280
Auntie.

51
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,000
If you don't put your mask on, what will you do

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,080
if Miss Dao sees you and runs away?

53
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,880
I'm hungry.

54
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,840
Look, Grandma Pathum doesn't even put one on.

55
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,960
Because Miss Dao knows Grandma is attending

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,120
but she doesn't know that you are!

57
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,480
How about this?

58
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,920
Wait until Miss Dao comes and then

59
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,120
make your grand entrance by taking that mask off. Sounds good?

60
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,120
Fine.

61
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,160
But let me finish this dish first, alright?

62
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
Yes.

63
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,600
Dude, who's this crazy guy?

64
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,000
He dances harder than I do.

65
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,440
That's James Ji, he followed you from LehBanPaKarn,

66
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,560
the legendary hundred years love story.

67
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Looks familiar.

68
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,920
The guys all look familiar to me.

69
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,080
We'll know once we take off the masks, just keep on dancing!

70
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
Dance!

71
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,520
Wat, is this you?

72
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
I'm right here!

73
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,320
If you're there.

74
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
Then...

75
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,560
Who grabbed me?

76
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,640
You're the one,

77
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,480
who grabbed me.

78
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
Doctor.

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,440
Ahem, ahem.

80
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,040
Alright, it's time to take off your masks!

81
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,600
So it'll be convenient to eat.

82
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,800
Food is served!

83
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,320
Drinks are ready!

84
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,240
Let's have some fun! DJ, let's go!

85
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,320
It's time to take off your mask.

86
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Dao.

87
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,720
Dao! Dao!

88
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,040
We need to talk.

89
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
But I don't want to.

90
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,960
Why are you disguise yourself as Faidam?

91
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,840
- I'm not... - You're going to say you're not Faidam?

92
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,240
I don't know what you're talking about.

93
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You do.

94
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,640
You know full well.

95
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,240
The reason I know.

96
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,120
Isn't just because of the make up or the wig you used.

97
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,400
The day you were sick,

98
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,560
the doctor had to use alcohol wipe to sanitize before injecting saline.

99
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,400
I was the one who sent you to the hospital.

100
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,640
You think I wouldn't see it?

101
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,520
Maybe your maid has vitiligo.

102
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,280
The day you drowned,

103
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
I put the powder on you myself.

104
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
Alright.

105
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
I admit

106
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,200
that I disguise myself as a maid to enter your house.

107
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Why?

108
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,920
Because I don't want to marry someone,

109
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
who wants my money to pay off debts.

110
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,200
But I never have an intention to marry you for money.

111
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,520
Of course you would say that.

112
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,760
If you admit it.

113
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,880
You'd be scared you won't get the money to pay off the mortgage debt.

114
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
If...

115
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,840
I didn't stay at your house.

116
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,080
I wouldn't have known so much details.

117
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,360
And if I allow myself to marry you.

118
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,320
I would've been a stupid woman,

119
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,720
who went for a big surname.

120
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,240
Which sounds good but broke.

121
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,880
Only has an image to deceive and leech off woman.

122
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,880
Please go ahead and marry that third rate actress like Riga.

123
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
But

124
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,280
she probably has no money for you to leech off.

125
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,200
Rotten ghost stays with a decayed coffin.

126
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,160
That woman wants your money too.

127
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,640
What a pair you'd make.

128
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,040
You probably won't believe me,

129
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,080
no matter what I say.

130
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,520
You're right.

131
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,880
And I want to tell you that,

132
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,840
please call off the engagement.

133
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,440
Go on and marry Miss Riga, the person who

134
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,080
let the world knows that she's marrying you.

135
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,120
Because I won't marry you.

136
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,720
Miss Ranee, I didn't know that you

137
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,920
knew Grandma and her family as well.

138
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:19,520
I have just met her today as well, usually I only see Dao.

139
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,880
Jeez, Wat as well.

140
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,480
You never said anything about knowing Dao.

141
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,760
Otherwise, I would've told you to bring her over to my house.

142
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,640
So I didn't have to come all the way here and save up my money!

143
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,200
That's so true, Auntie.

144
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,760
I never knew you wanted to meet Dao.

145
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,520
Of course, I do.

146
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,120
You probably didn't know yet,

147
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,760
Dao is Dr. Param's fiancee.

148
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,280
Breaking news

149
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,960
By the way, where did Dao go?

150
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,800
Earlier, I saw her going somewhere with Doctor.

151
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,880
Oh really? By now they must be...

152
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,840
What are you saying?

153
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,280
That's Doctor's here.

154
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,120
Come here, son, have a seat.

155
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,920
Give us a report.

156
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,720
So, what did she say to you?

157
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,280
Well...

158
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,960
She didn't say much.

159
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,280
- Hey, Pa. - Yes?

160
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,360
Come check out the desserts with me.

161
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,160
We'll be back.

162
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,560
Some wine?

163
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,160
You should eat first.

164
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,040
Oh, I already ate.

165
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,000
Auntie will be very upset.

166
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,160
If she knew Dao deceived her

167
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,040
by disguising as Faidam for a long time.

168
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,160
I have been wondering,

169
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,440
why Miss Dao had to disguise herself.

170
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,040
Is my family not trustworthy?

171
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,360
But when I think about it.

172
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,080
I do understand Miss Dao about why she had to do it.

173
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,040
A picture is worth a thousand words.

174
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,520
So she had to disguise herself to see with her own eyes.

175
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,160
The problem is...

176
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,680
As you said, if Auntie knows, she'll be angry.

177
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,240
In that case,

178
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,040
even if today goes well,

179
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,960
and Dao is okay with Doctor,

180
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,440
Auntie still won't accept it.

181
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,000
I doubt there wouldn't be a wedding.

182
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,720
Here.

183
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,880
Eat a lot, let me know if you want some more.

184
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,240
Thank you so much.

185
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,800
Eating this much I would need medicine to help with digestion.

186
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,000
Eat up, son.

187
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,080
Every single dish is delicious.

188
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,560
Too bad I didn't take my cook, Faidam, here with me.

189
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,520
Otherwise, I'll have her taste everything

190
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,080
so she can make it in Bangkok for me.

191
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Delicious.

192
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,680
- Eat some. - Okay.

193
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,600
Here, you know it's not easy to find these in Bangkok.

194
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,360
Good atmosphere as well as good food.

195
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
Right.

196
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,880
Once you're in Ubon Ratchathani, eating pork sausage is a must.

197
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,640
Why is he here?

198
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,600
Oab invited him to the party.

199
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,280
Does everyone have a part in this plan?

200
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,480
You all deceived me into meeting Doctor's family.

201
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,360
What about you deceiving people?

202
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,920
You don't think it's wrong.

203
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,640
But I had my reason.

204
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,840
What reason?

205
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,520
They're going to use our money to pay off the mortgage debt!

206
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,080
He doesn't like me but he wants my money.

207
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,080
You still want me to marry him?

208
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,440
Mortgage debt...

209
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,440
About this Riga, I think I can easily deal with her Grandma.

210
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,240
- How? - I will hire someone to act as loan sharks,

211
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,040
reclaiming the debt and the house.

212
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,480
Make it seems like we'll be completely broke.

213
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,720
That mortgage debt was all made up.

214
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,960
Pisamorn wanted to use the story to chase

215
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,440
that actress away from Dr. Param's life.

216
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,240
Who knows that woman can be so shameless and refuse to leave.

217
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,360
So the debt...

218
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,000
It doesn't exist?

219
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,360
It doesn't.

220
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,560
I was there when they were planning everything.

221
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,040
Go, you should talk to him.

222
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,160
Yeah.

223
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,760
I rather not.

224
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,600
Actually, it wasn't only about the debt.

225
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,760
What else then?

226
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,400
His girlfriend.

227
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Girlfriend...

228
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,480
That actress?

229
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,720
I don't want people saying I steal someone's man.

230
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,720
I saw with my own eyes.

231
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,040
That shameless actress is his woman.

232
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,960
Plus, earlier...

233
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,520
I already told Doctor,

234
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,240
that I won't marry him.

235
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,160
Alright, alright.

236
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,840
Up to you then.

237
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,240
You don't want to, then don't.

238
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,520
But...

239
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,600
I can't be the one who tell Pisamorn.

240
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,800
She really adores you.

241
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,840
You must tell her yourself.

242
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,880
Have a proper chat with her.

243
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,160
I will.

244
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
Dao.

245
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,120
If you heard us talking,

246
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,280
then this should be over.

247
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,280
If you don't want to.

248
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,680
We won't marry each other.

249
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,800
I promise.

250
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,960
When I go back, I'll quit.

251
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,640
So we can end this.

252
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,520
If that will happen,

253
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,200
then I think you should know,

254
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,680
how I feel about you.

255
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,320
At first I really hate you.

256
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,320
When I heard that I was forced to marry you.

257
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,080
I don't understand it.

258
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,840
Why won't you be upfront with me?

259
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,760
At least meet me,

260
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,800
and talk properly about what we should do.

261
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
Until one day,

262
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,280
I found out my fiancee, Lomdao,

263
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,080
disguised herself as Faidam.

264
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,360
A cook who always get on my nerves.

265
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,840
But in truth, I wanted to defeat you.

266
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
I want you to admit it yourself,

267
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,480
that you are Faidam.

268
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,640
How long have you known?

269
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,640
Long enough to realize...

270
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,560
I've fallen for you.

271
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,520
Why didn't you tell everyone...

272
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,800
Because if I did,

273
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,200
I won't get to be close to you.

274
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,360
I'm sorry for making you cry.

275
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,280
From now on,

276
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,840
you won't be crying because of me.

277
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,360
Are you full now?

278
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,720
I'm so full.

279
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,160
I ate so much today.

280
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,360
We're here.

281
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,960
Cookies for desserts, Pisamorn.

282
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,280
I baked them myself, they're not too sweet.

283
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,960
I can't eat anymore, I'm so full.

284
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,240
- They're tasty. - Too bad, you won't get to taste my cooking.

285
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,920
She bakes delicious cookies.

286
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,240
I do want some but I'm too full.

287
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,320
How about this?

288
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,720
Could you wrap it up for me?

289
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,000
Of course, I'll put them in a box for you.

290
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,560
I just want to give them to my maids at home.

291
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,920
Faidam and Taew, they're looking after the house right now.

292
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,320
They'll think I'm not generous

293
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,520
and didn't get something for them.

294
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,480
Alright, alright.

295
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,680
No problem.

296
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,680
Thank you so much.

297
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,520
- Mom. - Yes?

298
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,880
Let's go home.

299
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,800
Back to Bangkok?!

300
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,880
Why? I booked the hotel for so many nights!

301
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,880
I spent so much on it!

302
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,480
I'll excuse myself, goodbye.

303
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
Seriously?!

304
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,400
What is this?!

305
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,920
What's wrong?

306
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,760
Something urgent, I have to head back.

307
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,200
Let's go, Phon.

308
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,520
See you later.

309
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,720
Hey!

310
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,080
What in the world is going on?!

311
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,920
Then I must go now Grandma.

312
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,960
Goodbye.

313
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,880
What's with him?

314
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,160
Here are your cookies.

315
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,360
Cookies!

316
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,160
Great, I thought I would go home empty handed.

317
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,000
Thank you so much, Miss Pa.

318
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,920
Too bad I couldn't stay, I'll come again. The food's great.

319
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,560
- Let's go, dear. - Go ahead.

320
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,880
Phon.

321
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,640
I'll see you in Bangkok.

322
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,480
Okay.

323
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,200
I'm leaving now, goodbye.

324
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,920
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

325
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,640
Must be Dao's doing.

326
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,840
Stop! Param!

327
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,120
Hey! Won't you tell me what happened with Dao?

328
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,280
She said she doesn't want to marry me.

329
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,560
And I agreed.

330
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,600
Param!

331
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,320
I know I disappointed you.

332
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,720
But you have to accept the reality,

333
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,160
that she doesn't want to marry me.

334
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,960
Auntie.

335
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,080
They had their talk.

336
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,920
There's nothing we can do now.

337
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,160
This time she must really mean it.

338
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,040
I saw her talking to Dr. Param.

339
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,800
That's why he had that look and went back to Bangkok.

340
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,880
It's good.

341
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,000
They make this decision now,

342
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,880
so they don't regret it later.

343
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,280
Because even if they marry,

344
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,040
they'll probably end up divorcing.

345
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,560
I think Dao is regretting it right now.

346
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,960
Alright, let's go to bed. We'll talk about it tomorrow.

347
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
Let's go

348
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,200
You suspect that

349
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,840
Lomdao that I know and Param's fiancee is the same person.

350
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,560
I do think, Lomdao's not a common name in Ubon Ratchathani.

351
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,040
Doctor's fiancee is from Ubon Ratchathani.

352
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,400
Your friend is also from Ubon Ratchathani.

353
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,760
Yes.

354
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,240
This friend of yours, did she just got back from overseas?

355
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,320
She did.

356
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,640
They must be the same person.

357
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,880
Even if we know, there's nothing we can do.

358
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,080
They're engaged.

359
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,200
You won't get him.

360
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,680
And I won't get her.

361
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,960
Actually, Dr. Param won't get her either.

362
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,800
The reason Dao avoided him is because

363
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,840
she already has a fiance in the States.

364
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
Lomdao!

365
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,160
You've got a fiance and still steal my Doctor!

366
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,760
Disgusting!

367
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,040
How long have you known?

368
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,160
Long enough to realize...

369
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,840
I've fallen for you.

370
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,560
From now on,

371
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,080
you won't be crying because of me.

372
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,560
She might not want to see anyone.

373
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,280
Dao.

374
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,520
You rejected him.

375
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,200
You don't have to marry, so why are you sad?

376
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,720
I don't know.

377
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,880
Wat.

378
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,120
Did you know that his family is not in debt?

379
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,040
It's a plan from Grandma and Madam to chase away Riga.

380
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,400
What are you trying to say?

381
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,840
I think...

382
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,720
I like Dr. Param.

383
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,480
Wat.

384
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,600
Wat.

385
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
Why...

386
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,360
Aren't you surprised?

387
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,360
Why aren't you asking me questions?

388
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
I'm sleepy.

389
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,320
I'm going to bed.

390
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,080
Hey!

391
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,680
Wat.

392
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,680
You already have the answer.

393
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,320
What's with that face?

394
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,400
Didn't you already get what you want?

395
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,920
It's...

396
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,720
I'm worried about resigning from work at Madam Pisamorn's.

397
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,360
She loves and adores Faidam.

398
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,480
I don't want her to be upset with what I've done.

399
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,800
Just realized it?

400
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,640
Grandma.

401
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,080
I'm leaving.

402
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,240
Good luck.

403
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,680
Goodbye.

404
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,640
Come.

405
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,200
Safe trip.

406
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,960
Yes.

407
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,840
I'm going now.

408
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,920
Goodbye.

409
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,200
Thank you so much.

410
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,440
It's nothing.

411
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,800
I wish we could stay a bit longer.

412
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,440
Stay then!

413
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,960
Please visit us again.

414
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,040
Of course.

415
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,440
I'll leave Dao to you.

416
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,400
I don't know how things will be when she gets back.

417
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,360
Don't worry, I'll call if anything comes up.

418
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,680
- Thanks. - Goodbye.

419
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,800
Goodbye.

420
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,560
Safe journey.

421
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,840
Thank you.

422
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,400
Look at Dao.

423
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,360
Doesn't even wait for them.

424
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,160
- Dao. - Stop, Oab.

425
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,560
Don't say anything.

426
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,200
Fine, I won't.

427
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,680
Get in the car then.

428
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,200
What about those two?

429
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,320
Wat, wait.

430
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,280
Wat, let me ask you something.

431
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,760
Dao really doesn't like Dr. Param?

432
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,840
She does, otherwise I wouldn't join forces with Oab.

433
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,440
What? If she likes him, why would she reject him?

434
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,560
I think she has her own reason.

435
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,680
Let's go, Mom. We don't want to miss the flight.

436
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,840
So sweaty.

437
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,640
Taew!

438
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,720
I think we should go for another round.

439
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,280
You're crazy, Buab!

440
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,600
I'm still tired.

441
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,200
But once I see this...

442
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,160
Take it easy, baby!

443
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,200
Your teeth is going to hit my face.

444
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,320
Buab!

445
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,800
Let's do it.

446
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,960
Madam and Doctor is back!

447
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,960
Buab! What do we do now?!

448
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,920
Buab! What are you doing?!

449
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,480
Hiding, I'm hiding!

450
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,680
You can't hide there, come out!

451
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,760
Buab! What now?!

452
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,360
- Am I hidden? - No!

453
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,800
- Really? - Really!

454
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,160
Buab!

455
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,840
That's enough! Come here, Buab!

456
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,280
Buab! Why would you go in there?!

457
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,080
You're not having an affair with the owner, why are you running?!

458
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,920
You're right.

459
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,760
Why am I running away when I'm not

460
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,520
having an affair with the owner!

461
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,280
Wait, no!

462
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,520
What?

463
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,520
Not good! If Madam and Doctor see me, I'm screwed!

464
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,400
Buab! Where are you going?!

465
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,280
You got me and you're going to dump me?

466
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,120
I'm not, I believe that fleeing is best, baby.

467
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,880
You can't! Buab!

468
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,240
You have to talk to Madam.

469
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,280
She's like my mother.

470
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,480
You need to tell her whether you want

471
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,640
to marry, move in together, or whatever.

472
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,240
You need to ask for my hand formally!

473
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,920
- Really? - Yeah!

474
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,080
You guys slept together?

475
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,720
How did you know Madam?

476
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,720
He hasn't said anything yet.

477
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,680
There's an aura.

478
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,080
Is that soft drink's brand name, Aura?

479
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,720
The two of you

480
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,720
are wearing each other's shirt!

481
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,360
It's so obvious.

482
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,240
No such thing as aura.

483
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,560
Buab!

484
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,880
You two are moving really fast!

485
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,120
What will you do, Buab?

486
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,840
I probably need some time, Doctor.

487
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,160
I'll have to save up and ask for Taew's hand in marriage.

488
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,800
But in the mean time

489
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,240
I'd like to ask for permission to take

490
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,280
her to live with me at Mr. Wat's house.

491
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,320
That's good.

492
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,280
Husband and wife shouldn't be separated.

493
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,560
Or there will be a problem in your marriage life.

494
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,400
When will that be?

495
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,720
Right now! Come on Buab, I'm ready to go!

496
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,760
Taew!

497
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,160
There's no need to rush!

498
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,360
I gave you my word, I said that you can go!

499
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,840
Sit!

500
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,280
Let me tell you one thing.

501
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,960
Once you leave,

502
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,760
you better not come back and get your salary from me!

503
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,520
Jeez, Madam!

504
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,040
Taew is staying with Buab at night.

505
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,840
But during the day, I'll still be here working for you Madam.

506
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,600
Okay?

507
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,080
Oh, right! Where's Faidam?

508
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,880
Hey!

509
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,600
Why the confused look?

510
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,960
I ask you where my favorite cook Faidam is?

511
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,520
She's...

512
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,440
I'm right here!

513
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,720
I'm right here!

514
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,440
- Faidam! - Yes?

515
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,320
Did you go out again?

516
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,920
Tell me right now, where have you been?

517
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,920
I didn't, Madam.

518
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,920
I went to the market and buy groceries to cook for you.

519
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,840
You know me so well.

520
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,160
You have money to use while I wasn't home?

521
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,280
Don't worry, Madam.

522
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,920
I know your motto really well,

523
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,880
"full stomach, full wallet"!

524
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,360
That's why...

525
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,720
This meal will be my treat to welcome you home!

526
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,720
Really?

527
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,960
How cute! Come here, come closer.

528
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,640
I can look at you and know what you're thinking!

529
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,160
If you're not here, I would be bored to death.

530
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,240
Right?

531
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,600
Buab! I'm so, so cold, baby!

532
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,640
You're feeling cold?

533
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,480
Yes , I'm cold Buab, Buab!

534
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,720
Buab!

535
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,280
Are you cold, baby?

536
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,440
Hey!

537
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,200
Taew! Buab!

538
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,800
I know it's the honeymoon phase.

539
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,720
Go, now! Go back to your room!

540
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,920
Miss Phon must have known already.

541
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,280
Faidam, when did you get back?

542
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,760
The moment you saw me.

543
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,160
I thought you're in trouble for sure when Madam asked for you.

544
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,520
Why does Doctor seem so mad at you?

545
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,600
That's right.

546
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,400
Doctor knows about my disguise.

547
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,920
I guess that's the reason.

548
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,240
Then both of us will head over to Mr. Wat's house.

549
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,360
Yeah, we still need to tell Mr. Wat

550
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,920
about Taew moving in.

551
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,360
Doctor.

552
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,520
How did you return?

553
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,800
I took the plane.

554
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,360
Actually, you didn't have to come.

555
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,800
You don't have to marry me anymore.

556
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,040
That means,

557
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,440
you no longer need to look into my family.

558
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,520
I...

559
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,800
I don't want Madam to be sad.

560
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,360
I don't want her to know that I've been lying to her for months.

561
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,600
Even if I quit,

562
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,720
I still want Madam to be happy when she thinks of Faidam.

563
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,120
Isn't that too selfish?

564
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,960
You tricked the people here.

565
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,000
You still want them

566
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,240
to love you like before.

567
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,760
Anyway, I'm begging you.

568
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,280
Please don't tell Madam about me.

569
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,200
Dao wants to cook one last meal for Madam before she quits.

570
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,880
Mr. Wat!

571
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,480
- Mr. Wat! - What?

572
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,680
What's all this noise?

573
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,440
I think Doctor knows about Faidam's disguise!

574
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,320
I thought it was something else.

575
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,640
Mr. Wat!

576
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,440
Aren't you surprised or shocked?

577
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,080
- You won't go help her? - Yeah.

578
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,040
He knows for a while now.

579
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,000
- Huh?! - Oh.

580
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,640
Isn't that too selfish?

581
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,760
You tricked the people here.

582
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,800
You still want them

583
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,160
to love you like before.

584
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,280
I can look at you and know what you're thinking!

585
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,960
If you're not here, I would be bored to death.

586
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,720
Right?

587
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,640
(Next episode.)

588
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,600
Dao!

589
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,080
What are you up to?

590
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,440
I should call you Lomdao, right?

591
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,480
You can call me however you like.

592
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,640
Go pack your things.

593
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,120
And get out of this house.

594
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,000
You don't need to find

595
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,920
an excuse to not marry Param anymore.

596
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,040
Even if you wanted to marry him now,

597
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,240
I will no longer allow it.
