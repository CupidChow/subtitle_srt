1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,800
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,480
I stand in front of your room because I have something to give you.

3
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,120
(Previously...)

4
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,360
Just you wait tomorrow, you will get it.

5
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,680
But if you want it,

6
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,520
you need to go scratch for lucky numbers around there.

7
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,800
- Hey! I have nothing to do with this! - Auntie!

8
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,160
Don't you like lucky numbers? Come, I'll arrange it for you.

9
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,000
Here, there's no lucky number. But it's evidence to show you disguised.

10
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,880
Why are you doing this?

11
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Lomdao.

12
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,120
Doctor!

13
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,480
You're crazy!

14
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,800
I'm Faidam, not Lomdao.

15
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,200
You think I'll believe you?

16
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
And…

17
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,720
what's this powder?

18
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Doctor!

19
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,400
This is scurf.

20
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,840
I haven't showered for three weeks.

21
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,920
Right now, there's so much scurf.

22
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,280
Oh my, my, my goodness.

23
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,320
Look here.

24
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,040
It can be substitute for a clay.

25
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,680
And there you go saying I disguised myself.

26
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,920
Still think I'll believe in your crazy excuse?

27
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,280
Lomdao.

28
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,920
I'm not stupid.

29
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,320
I'll prove that you are Lomdao.

30
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,560
Hey, Doctor!

31
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,480
What's Lomdao? Who's this Lomdao?

32
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,200
Are you alright? You watched too much movies?

33
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,280
I'm Faidam, a maid, not Lomdao.

34
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
Hey.

35
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,080
What's else, Doctor?

36
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,960
You can't just walk away

37
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,520
when you've brought people into my house.

38
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
Come here.

39
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,280
- Move it! - Doctor!

40
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,040
Don't!

41
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,080
Faidam.

42
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,880
What kind of weird play is going on?

43
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,000
It's not a weird play, Miss Phon.

44
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,200
Doctor gave me this seven colors scarves.

45
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,280
When I wrapped them around,

46
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,000
the goddess comes to me!

47
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,520
What about now?

48
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,880
You won't answer.

49
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,560
The goddess didn't really exist.

50
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't think I'm clueless about what you did.

51
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,000
What am I doing, Doctor?

52
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,360
You...

53
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,520
Just get out of here.

54
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,280
Fine.

55
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,440
Not like I want to stay.

56
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Faidam!

57
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,400
Faidam, are you leaving again?

58
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
Faidam!

59
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,240
What I said earlier,

60
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,640
I meant you can go anywhere you want.

61
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,840
But stay within the house.

62
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,680
Don't go outside.

63
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,080
I'm too lazy to find you.

64
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
Yes.

65
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,520
If I keep chasing after her like this, she will be spoiled.

66
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
Param.

67
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,640
What are you doing to Faidam now?

68
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
Nothing.

69
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,720
And did you really buy that

70
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,160
seven colors scarves for Faidam?

71
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
Yes.

72
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,800
She's so mischievous!

73
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,360
But she's right.

74
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,000
How could you buy seven colors scarves?

75
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,200
If that was me,

76
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,880
once I got it I'd probably see the goddess as well.

77
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,720
Faidam!

78
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,560
I shouldn't have joined forces with you!

79
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,320
Good thing both of them aren't mad.

80
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,280
Otherwise, we both would've gotten kicked out!

81
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,800
I'm not scared.

82
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,800
I don't want to be here anymore.

83
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
I know.

84
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,560
Once you finish the report,

85
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,720
you'll leave.

86
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,640
How's the report going?

87
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,880
No.

88
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,120
Not yet.

89
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,400
It hasn't progressed at all.

90
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
Faidam.

91
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
Honestly,

92
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,920
I don't want you to finish the report.

93
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,400
I want you stay here for a long time

94
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,600
so I can have a friend.

95
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,720
I don't know if you leave

96
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,240
and a new cook comes...

97
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,440
I might not be as close to her as I am to you.

98
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,360
I want you to stay for a long time.

99
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,320
Hey, don't cry Taew, don't cry.

100
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,760
Hesitant?

101
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,320
I understand.

102
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,120
Madam Pisamorn might be stingy

103
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,680
but she's got a big heart.

104
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,200
Once she loves someone,

105
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,880
she gives them all of her love.

106
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,760
From what I can see,

107
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,760
she seems very fond of Faidam.

108
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,040
I feel that.

109
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
But…

110
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,840
I'm still concerned about

111
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,000
her wanting Doctor to marry me

112
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,840
because they can pay off their debts.

113
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,320
We may be neighbors,

114
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,560
but I know nothing about their financial status.

115
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,240
I really have no idea.

116
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,080
About that Sis Kim and Sis Hong you mentioned,

117
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,400
when are they going to seize the house?

118
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
Right!

119
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
That's true.

120
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,840
It's overdue now.

121
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,080
Maybe…

122
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,160
- What? - Maybe what?

123
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,280
Perhaps they used her money to pay it off?

124
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,240
How did you know that?

125
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,720
I'm just guessing.

126
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,160
Take that!

127
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,120
Guessing?! You can't just guess things like this.

128
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,720
That's not good.

129
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,280
Look, Dao is concerned now.

130
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,840
It might be true.

131
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,680
But if Grandma knows,

132
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,800
why does she still want me to marry him?

133
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,000
For insurance? To make sure she gets it back?

134
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,680
Dad.

135
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,920
Why are you sitting here?

136
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,120
Your mom won't let me in.

137
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,320
I had to sleep on a vehicle.

138
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,760
How comfortable.

139
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,920
You can come home late and no one complains.

140
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,960
My ass! It's hot and there's tons of mosquitoes.

141
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,160
Dad, what's so difficult?

142
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,160
Just close the doors and turn on the air conditioner, done.

143
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,560
Air conditioner my ass!

144
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,960
I slept on that motorcycle!

145
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,360
Right! We went out on a bike!

146
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,440
Yeah!

147
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,320
Serves you right.

148
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,080
You act like you have no obligations whatsoever.

149
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,760
Jeez, Mom.

150
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,080
It's not often that I come to Bangkok, I'd like to check things out.

151
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,200
You must not gotten any sleep.

152
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,440
Yes, so sleepy.

153
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,960
Check things out all night.

154
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Hey.

155
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,640
If you go out to play again,

156
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,120
I'll give you the same thing again.

157
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,480
- How's that Mom? - Good.

158
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,080
Next time, it'll be rougher.

159
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
I think…

160
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,800
you should go looking after Dao instead.

161
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,200
That Dr. Param doesn't seem trustworthy.

162
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,440
I guarantee.

163
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,080
He's a decent man.

164
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,960
The most suitable for being my grandson-in-law.

165
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,120
Are you sure?

166
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,520
Did you see the news of that actress?

167
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
What news?

168
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,360
How sneaky!

169
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,760
Socialite Dr. Param takes actress Riga

170
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,400
to look for wedding dates?!

171
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
What?!

172
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,600
What in the world is this?!

173
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Faidam!

174
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,520
Taew! Get over here!

175
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,560
- Yes! - Yes!

176
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,240
What's the matter, Madam?

177
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,280
Go get Param for me.

178
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,640
Go get Param for me.

179
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,080
Alright, okay.

180
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
Why?

181
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,840
I need to talk to him.

182
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,240
I see, I'll tell him that.

183
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,520
Oh dear, Param.

184
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,800
(Online news)

185
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
Faidam.

186
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,360
That's my phone.

187
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,440
Oops.

188
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,320
Sorry.

189
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,080
See this? Let's call off the engagement.

190
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,720
- Or do you want me to handle this? - Dad!

191
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,880
Calm down now.

192
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,640
Can I have a talk with him first?

193
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,000
Give it a go.

194
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,480
And tell your friend

195
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,120
that this is the last chance for him.

196
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,960
(Oabboon)

197
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,800
Doctor.

198
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,960
Doctor.

199
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,680
Doctor.

200
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,920
(Oabboon)

201
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,200
Doctor? Doctor.

202
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,760
Doctor.

203
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,160
Where did he go?

204
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,320
(Oabboon)

205
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,880
Calm down, Madam.

206
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,720
Doctor will come down soon.

207
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,000
What's taking her so long?

208
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,040
Madam!

209
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,360
I don't know where he went,

210
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
he left his phone in the room.

211
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,960
It kept ringing so loudly, my ears are about to burst!

212
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,560
It stopped, nice timing.

213
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,320
Have you searched the whole house?

214
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,760
I did.

215
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,600
He's always avoiding me

216
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,240
whenever I need to talk to him.

217
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,600
Calm down.

218
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,040
I don't need massage anymore.

219
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,840
You could have told me nicely.

220
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,480
I'm going to my room.

221
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,200
If you see Dr. Param,

222
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,320
tell him to see me as soon as possible!

223
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,360
- Yes. - What's the matter?

224
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,280
You won't tell.

225
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,400
I'll ask Faidam.

226
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,560
What is it, Faidam?

227
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,360
Doctor is going to marry Miss Riga.

228
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,600
Marry Miss Riga?

229
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yeah.

230
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,320
Then his engagement will be void.

231
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,800
So pity.

232
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,520
That's awful!

233
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,680
Faidam wait...

234
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
Hey!

235
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,480
I'm the madam of this house!

236
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Jeez!

237
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,120
Calling again!

238
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,480
So annoying!

239
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,560
How do I turn off the sound?

240
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,040
What are you doing?

241
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,080
Why don't you answer your phone?

242
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,280
Doctor!

243
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,440
Where did she hide it?

244
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,120
Doctor.

245
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,480
What are you doing in my room?

246
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,960
I…

247
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,200
Don't tell me

248
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,480
that you're stealing something!

249
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,040
We really can't judge a book by its cover.

250
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,320
The boss can also steal from his maid.

251
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,160
This won't do.

252
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,080
Everybody! Everybody!

253
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,880
Come here and see!

254
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,000
The boss steals things from his maid!

255
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,200
Everybody! Everybody!

256
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,840
Come here and see!

257
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,840
- The boss steals from...! - Faidam's voice.

258
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,120
- Everybody! Come here and see! - What is going on?

259
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,440
- Everybody! - Faidam!

260
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,160
Everybody! Everyone...

261
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,960
Are you crazy?

262
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,080
Why would I steal from you? Huh?

263
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,480
I asked you why you're here

264
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,320
but you didn't answer.

265
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,200
You couldn't answer, am I right?

266
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,640
Doctor.

267
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,800
You must have indecent thoughts about me

268
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,760
or Taew, am I right?

269
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,560
Tell me, why did you enter my room?

270
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,280
Won't talk?

271
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,600
Then I'll do the talking.

272
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,680
Madam! Madam...

273
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,720
Faidam!

274
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You really want to know? Fine.

275
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,600
Then tell me, where did you hide

276
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,600
your tools for disguising yourself?

277
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,720
The wig.

278
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,000
The powder.

279
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,120
Tools for disguising myself!

280
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm so screwed!

281
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,400
Are you shocked that I know?

282
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
Doctor.

283
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,440
What do you mean? I don't understand.

284
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,120
Listen to yourself.

285
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,160
If you won't talk,

286
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,960
I'll make you talk.

287
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
Doctor, what are you doing?

288
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,680
Doctor.

289
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,840
Madam, help me!

290
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,720
Let me go, Doctor!

291
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,200
Madam! Help! Doctor is going to rape me!

292
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,080
Doctor!

293
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,320
What is all this noise?!

294
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,520
My goodness!

295
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,600
What is this, Param?!

296
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,320
He sneaked into my room, Madam.

297
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,520
I asked why he's here, but he won't answer.

298
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,040
She's right.

299
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,400
Why are you in Taew and Faidam's room?

300
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,600
I...

301
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,440
I suspect,

302
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,080
he's here to rape...

303
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,720
either me or Taew!

304
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,760
Is that true?!

305
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,200
Why won't you ask? We can make it a date.

306
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,560
It's not like that, Mom.

307
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,840
- I... - If that's not it, then what is about?!

308
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,880
What are you doing here in their room?

309
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,680
Faidam disguised herself to be here.

310
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,200
You're screwed.

311
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,920
Faidam disguised herself to be here.

312
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,320
No, Madam. That's not true.

313
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,440
Why would I disguise myself?

314
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,440
He's just accusing me!

315
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,480
If you won't believe me.

316
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,920
See this, right here.

317
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,400
This.

318
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,880
Let me go, Doctor.

319
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
Please let go of me, Doctor.

320
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,520
Faidam!

321
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,680
Param!

322
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,000
We're screwed!

323
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,200
That's enough! What is this about?!

324
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,560
I'm trying to show you

325
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,920
who Faidam actually is.

326
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,280
It's time to take this wig off.

327
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,960
- Doctor! - And scrub off that tan powder.

328
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
Come here.

329
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
Don't!

330
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,400
Hey! Come here, Faidam!

331
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
Param, Stop!

332
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,520
Why would she disguise herself?

333
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,560
That's right, Madam.

334
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,640
If she's going to disguise herself,

335
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,480
she should make herself pretty right?

336
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,960
Taew! Are calling me ugly?!

337
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,440
I'm just stating the truth.

338
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,120
Yeah! Who would want to be ugly?

339
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,000
That person behind you.

340
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,040
The wig, the mole,

341
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,680
and this dark skin tone, it's all fake.

342
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,200
The reason you're doing this

343
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,920
is because I happened to

344
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,320
see your stuff.

345
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,000
Your stuff.

346
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,240
Isn't that right?

347
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,320
What stuff?

348
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,720
You will know.

349
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
Here it is!

350
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,720
What's the meaning of this?

351
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,600
He's afraid that I'll tell you about this.

352
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,040
That's why he puts the blame on me.

353
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,240
This is the safest place to keep them.

354
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,480
Also...

355
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,160
There's more.

356
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,720
Here you go, an evidence.

357
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,160
What is this?

358
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:12,080
- What? - He's being like that because I found while organizing the closet.

359
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,560
And while I was cleaning up his room.

360
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,920
Doctor is probably scared

361
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,120
that I will tell everybody about this.

362
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,480
He's afraid I'll tell you

363
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,040
that Doctor

364
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,160
is a cabaret girl!

365
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,560
Oh my God!

366
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,360
I'm not, Mom.

367
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,560
If you're not, then what is this?!

368
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,840
Why did I never think that

369
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,840
you'll go down this path?!

370
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,000
Is this why you won't get married?

371
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,440
That Riga woman as well,

372
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,320
it's just pretending, isn't it?!

373
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,800
You actually like men don't you, Param?!

374
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,880
- Oh Madam! - Mom!

375
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,720
Taew, take me out of here.

376
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,800
Sure Madam!

377
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,600
Please don't die!

378
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,320
Don't think that you'll always win.

379
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,800
I will expose you by myself, Faidam!

380
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,240
I'm not scared, Doctor.

381
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,920
- Not scared? - Nope.

382
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,800
I'll be waiting!

383
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,840
Faidam!

384
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,720
- Phon. - Oab.

385
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,320
Why are you walking in the sun like this?

386
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,320
I actually took a taxi.

387
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,640
But it broke down in the alleyway,

388
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,600
so I walked since it's not too far.

389
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,760
Hop in the car, I'll drop you off.

390
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,040
Alright.

391
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,840
You said you'll take me home.

392
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,720
Why are we here?

393
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,640
I need some advice.

394
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,120
Must be a serious one,

395
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,920
since we've come all the way here.

396
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,040
It's about Doctor and Miss Riga.

397
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,560
So, it's about that news.

398
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,200
She told the media

399
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,040
that Brother proposed to her.

400
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,720
Yeah.

401
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,400
My family is very concerned.

402
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,680
And Doctor wasn't picking up my calls either.

403
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,480
He shouldn't have given the news.

404
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
But...

405
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,920
He didn't talk to the media.

406
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,400
Miss Riga is the one who talked about it.

407
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,600
If Doctor hadn't lead her on,

408
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,640
she wouldn't dare to say that.

409
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,960
Don't forget.

410
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,200
Your sister avoided and rejected Brother first.

411
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,720
Even if this is true, it's not his fault.

412
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,120
Since Miss Dao didn't want to marry him.

413
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,520
You're taking his side.

414
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,560
Yes.

415
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,400
He's my cousin and he did nothing wrong.

416
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,280
What do you want me to say?

417
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,360
- Phon. - Oab, let me go.

418
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,360
- Listen to me. - Oab, let me go.

419
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,800
Let me...

420
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Oab.

421
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,120
Oab.

422
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,160
You're crazy.

423
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,280
Oab.

424
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,800
Oab, let me go.

425
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,200
You won't let go?!

426
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,520
Let go!

427
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,080
Ouch!

428
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,560
Phon!

429
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,720
Faidam, you're really mischievous.

430
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,040
Why else would I be so fearless and

431
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,320
disguise myself to enter this house?

432
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,120
By the way,

433
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,000
where did you get those pictures?

434
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,520
Internet shop.

435
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,280
I made my friend photoshopped the pictures at the internet shop.

436
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,200
It was done in no time.

437
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,880
Knife shop? What does that have to do with it?

438
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,680
Let's just say.

439
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,640
I survived and Doctor got unlucky.

440
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,920
So mischievous! Mischievous! Mischievous!

441
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,200
Of course.

442
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,720
Those aren't my photos.

443
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,480
They're photoshopped photos.

444
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,640
Photoshopped?

445
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,040
Can it make your skin look so dark?

446
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,760
Don't try to fool me.

447
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,280
Jeez, Mom.

448
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,720
There are so many techniques to edit the photos.

449
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,560
Those pictures were done by Faidam.

450
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,600
Faidam?!

451
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,280
She's just a maid.

452
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,400
She only studied up to Fourth grade.

453
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,360
How can she know photoshop?

454
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,880
Don't try to make excuses.

455
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,320
I won't get mad with who you are.

456
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,840
But I'll be mad if you don't speak the truth!

457
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,880
It's fine if you are like that.

458
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,680
Just be straightforward with me.

459
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,200
Is this the reason why you won't marry Dao?

460
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,760
Phon.

461
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,000
Don't try to change

462
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,960
the subject by bringing Phon up.

463
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,400
The reason you won't marry Dao,

464
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,080
is it because you don't like woman?

465
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,240
You misunderstand, Mom.

466
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
I like woman.

467
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,400
And I'll get married, get a wife.

468
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,440
Just not yet.

469
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,240
Get a wife?

470
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,800
Would that "Wife" be a man?

471
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,320
Brother.

472
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,480
Not sleepy?

473
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,560
It's Faidam.

474
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,720
She made Mom thinks I'm gay.

475
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,760
What about you? How are you doing?

476
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,120
Since you got back, you look troubled.

477
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,120
Well, today...

478
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,000
Oab came to see me.

479
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,480
We talked about you and Miss Riga.

480
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,440
Is this about the news?

481
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,560
Is it true?

482
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,520
Is it true?

483
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,040
It's not.

484
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,440
It would be nice if it's true.

485
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,960
So, I won't have to marry

486
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,320
someone who doesn't want to marry me.

487
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,720
Miss Dao, isn't it?

488
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,800
How much does that doctor knows about me?

489
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,720
Why does it sound like

490
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,680
he knows who I really am.

491
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,920
What should I do with you, Dao?

492
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,200
Hey, Phon.

493
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,280
The napkin you used is still clean, don't throw it away.

494
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,720
Then... what should I do?

495
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,840
Just keep it.

496
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,040
Then use it to wipe the table,

497
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,720
the chair, or even the shoes.

498
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,400
Why throw it away?

499
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
Okay.

500
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,600
If you eat out at restaurants,

501
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,040
they put napkins on the table, right?

502
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,760
Take them home with you.

503
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Sure, Auntie.

504
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,840
Not many people use them, such a waste.

505
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,400
I'm leaving for work then.

506
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,280
Take lots of them.

507
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,600
It's been a while since we last bought napkins.

508
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,960
Be safe on your way to work.

509
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,120
Thanks.

510
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,760
Young people in these days don't know how to be frugal.

511
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,440
That's true, Madam.

512
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,120
What do we do about leftover water, orange juice,

513
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,400
rice porridge, and even

514
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,800
the spicy fish sauce, Madam?

515
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,240
Just pour these water and orange juice back in the container.

516
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,880
Put that in the fridge and serve it tomorrow.

517
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,040
Since it's in the fridge, it'll be fine.

518
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,080
Hey, Param! Param dear!

519
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,360
Come here.

520
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,240
What's this? You're not going to work.

521
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,560
I'm on vacation, Mom.

522
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,760
I don't want to stay home either.

523
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,080
I'm bored.

524
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,680
Let me join you then.

525
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,520
But I'm going to the beach.

526
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,360
Will you be okay

527
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,000
without Faidam's cooking?

528
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,240
Just take her along.

529
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,000
- Mom! - Madam!

530
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,120
If I let you go alone,

531
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,800
you might bring back some random guy to your room.

532
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,000
Or you'll dress up as cabaret girl and put on a show.

533
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,920
From now on, I won't let you go anywhere by yourself.

534
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,520
We all go together, it'll be fun.

535
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,680
Can I also...?

536
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,240
Yes, I said all of us!

537
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,240
Go pack your things.

538
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,080
We're going to the beach. Do you know it?

539
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,600
Go! Go! Hurry up and pack your stuff!

540
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,720
Madam... I don't want...

541
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,000
Just go!

542
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,160
Stop stalling.

543
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,120
Just go! Pack your clothes.

544
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,680
Or you will be left behind!

545
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,720
Faidam! I can't wait!

546
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,920
I'll go check on the rooms.

547
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,040
Alright.

548
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,960
Faidam.

549
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,880
Get the luggage.

550
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Yes.

551
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,160
Come on, Faidam!

552
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,600
Idiot doctor.

553
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,040
How could you use woman for labor?

554
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,880
What kind of man are you?

555
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,600
Not a gentleman like those from K-Dramas.

556
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,520
They're gentle and loving.

557
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,600
When they see the woman carry thing, they'll carry it for her.

558
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,200
But what's this?

559
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,880
"Faidam, get the luggage."

560
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,280
You're not the protagonist.

561
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,480
Stop whining, just carry it.

562
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,880
Look, I can carry a hundred if they wanted me to!

563
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,240
I'll do it for a trip to the beach like this.

564
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,960
The beach! The beach!

565
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,120
The beach! Here I come!

566
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,600
Taew, lower your voice.

567
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,560
Such a pretty looking beach.

568
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,520
It'd be nice if I get to marry Buab on the beach.

569
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,680
Have you thought of marriage yet?

570
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,640
I haven't.

571
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,440
If I don't get to marry the one, I won't do it.

572
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,840
Have you met the one yet? Have you?

573
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
Not yet.

574
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,160
I haven't met the one yet.

575
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,200
- Be patient if you're ugly.

576
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,800
Is no one going to stay and help me fix the problem?

577
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,680
I've helped far too much.

578
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,600
The more we fix, the more it messes up.

579
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,760
Grandma.

580
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,920
Dad?

581
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,480
You stopped me when I punched that doctor.

582
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,760
What do you want me to do?

583
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,040
Dad, I didn't want things to escalate.

584
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,560
Hey.

585
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,120
Oab.

586
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,680
Go take your sister home.

587
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,200
And call off the engagement!

588
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,400
Mom!

589
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,520
Hey! Hey!

590
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,400
Hey! Calm down first.

591
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,680
Don't say that. I don't feel good.

592
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,040
Hey!

593
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,560
What's wrong with her?

594
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,120
- Let's talk first. - Dad.

595
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,480
Dad!

596
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,880
Why are you here?

597
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,840
I need to ask you something.

598
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,960
You've come to the wrong person.

599
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,560
Let me tell you, no matter what, I'll always take Brother's side.

600
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,160
I'm not looking for a fight.

601
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,440
I just want to know where he is.

602
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,040
He won't pick up the calls and nobody's home.

603
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,760
I understand you.

604
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,560
If you were Dao,

605
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
how would you feel

606
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,400
when a woman announced that she will getting married to your fiance?

607
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,440
That's why I want us to talk.

608
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,440
I want to know what he thinks.

609
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,160
Auntie called to told me that they're at the beach.

610
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,160
I've answered your question.

611
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,520
Can I leave now?

612
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,200
Phon.

613
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,960
How is it, Taew?

614
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,000
You've never seen the beach before.

615
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,560
That's right, Madam!

616
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,480
- Over here! Look! - Yes?

617
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,760
An ocypode! Have you seen one before?

618
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,040
- What? Let me see! - So tiny! So many!

619
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,760
Here it is!

620
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,160
That's a huge one!

621
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,080
That way!

622
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,920
Not going to take a dip?

623
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,600
Scared your skin will fade?

624
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,720
My skin color is not going to fade.

625
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,000
- Are you sure? - Yes.

626
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,840
Shall we test it out?

627
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,480
Hey!

628
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,240
Stop it, Doctor!

629
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,040
Come here, Come on!

630
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,640
Hey, Taew!

631
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,680
What are they up to?

632
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,680
Playing tag!

633
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,200
Taew, tell me something.

634
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,480
What kind of man would play tag?

635
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,240
Or my only son...

636
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,560
really wants to be a woman?

637
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,680
I don't know either.

638
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,320
I'm going inside, it's hot.

639
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,560
You can keep looking for them.

640
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,240
Can I play in the water?

641
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,600
Go ahead, suit yourself.

642
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,880
Beach!

643
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,120
Here I come!

644
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,080
Get in.

645
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,720
Stop! Stop! Stop!

646
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,800
What are you afraid of?

647
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,880
Didn't you say your color won't fade?

648
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,480
I want to know...

649
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,960
if that's true or not.

650
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,560
Stop! Please stop, Doctor!

651
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,880
I can't swim.

652
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,560
Can't swim?

653
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,320
I'll teach you.

654
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,080
- Stop! Doctor! - Get over here.

655
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,720
- Get in, now. - No!

656
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,080
Doctor! I don't want to get in!

657
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,120
Come.

658
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,680
Doctor!

659
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,880
What would you do if I drowned?!

660
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,760
I said I don't want to.

661
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,200
Didn't you say your color won't fade?

662
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,280
Look at that.

663
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,480
Shoot!

664
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,480
Speechless?

665
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,800
Help!

666
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,640
Doctor! Taew is drowning! Doctor!

667
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,320
Hey, trying to escape?

668
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,880
You think I'll believe you?

669
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,520
- Fine, up to you. - Hey.

670
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,280
Hey! I'll take you to my mom. Come.

671
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,400
Let me go, Doctor! I need to help Taew!

672
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,680
Taew!

673
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,840
Same old tricks, scared that I'll catch you?

674
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,480
So, you escape to play with Taew.

675
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,120
I'll get you once you got out!

676
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,520
Taew! Wait!

677
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,160
Taew!

678
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,560
Taew!

679
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,120
Taew!

680
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,120
Help!

681
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,520
- Faidam! - Help!

682
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,560
Faidam!

683
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,760
Faidam, wake up!

684
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,880
Wake up, Faidam!

685
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,240
- I feel better. - Are you sure?

686
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,560
Yes.

687
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,360
Excuse me, how is she?

688
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,760
She's fine now.

689
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,640
I'm also a doctor.

690
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,960
I'll take care of her.

691
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,320
Doctor.

692
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,120
I'm sorry.

693
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,880
I made Faidam drown.

694
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,040
Don't blame yourself.

695
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,960
She's fine now.

696
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,280
Are you alright?

697
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,600
Yes.

698
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,600
Then go keep my mom company.

699
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,680
We've been gone for too long.

700
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,480
She'll be suspicious.

701
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,600
I...

702
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,360
I'm worried about Faidam.

703
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,400
Did you forget I'm a doctor.

704
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,800
I won't let anything happen to her.

705
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,760
Go and stay with Mom, okay?

706
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,600
Hey, Doctor!

707
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,640
What now?

708
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,240
I...

709
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,480
I think I should the one to take care of Faidam.

710
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,440
- Taew! - Yes?

711
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,880
Stay with Mom.

712
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,640
Go!

713
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,440
If he doesn't know now, when will he know?

714
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,360
Not only we lured Dao to meet Doctor.

715
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,360
We will need to make her admit

716
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,160
that she's Faidam.

717
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,600
Choose the celebrity you want to be.

718
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,640
(Next episode.)

719
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,040
Whose mask are you wearing?

720
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,160
- Doesn't suit Dao at all. - Didn't you say to wear a celebrity mask?

721
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,960
Look, It's "Ah Si from Krong Kam."

722
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,000
This party is going to be so much fun.

723
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,160
You're going to have a blast.

724
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,360
Dao.
