1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,840
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,160
(Previously...)

3
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,840
Dao! What are you up to?

4
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,240
I have to thank you for recognizing her.

5
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,360
I'll come back and apologize to Dao later.

6
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,760
If you insist on getting married,

7
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,680
then you and I as mother and son are over!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
She probably hates me now.

9
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,240
I don't know what else to do, Grandma.

10
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,280
We're already this old.

11
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,480
How long do we have left on this earth?

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,240
Why don't we live happily?

13
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,520
Excuse me.

14
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,120
I'm here to see Dao, is she here?

15
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,640
If Dao doesn't get with Dr. Param,

16
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,720
I'll happily welcome her.

17
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,240
Why can't you understand that Dao doesn't like you?

18
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,600
How many times do I have to tell you?

19
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,400
If you want to see Dao,

20
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
just wait here.

21
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,520
She'll be here soon.

22
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,960
How long has Dao disguised herself?

23
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,400
Ever since she came back.

24
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,600
Then

25
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,680
How long has Dao been in love with Dr. Param?

26
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,480
I'm not sure.

27
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
But

28
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,040
for a while now from what I see.

29
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,720
Hey, I'll excuse myself to talk on the phone with my client.

30
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
Dao.

31
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,040
Korn, when did you get here?

32
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,640
For a while.

33
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,320
Dao.

34
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,440
I'm sorry about the other day.

35
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,520
It's fine.

36
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,040
You didn't know.

37
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,520
But I got you in trouble.

38
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,080
It's alright.

39
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,800
It's in the past now, don't overthink it.

40
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,480
Dao.

41
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,400
I've loved you one-sidedly since sophomore.

42
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,160
I know it's impossible

43
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,440
and now you love Dr. Param.

44
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,320
Today I will get over you.

45
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,360
I will only think of you as a friend.

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Korn.

47
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,680
But can I ask something?

48
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,120
From today onwards,

49
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,440
don't try to avoid me anymore.

50
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,920
I'm sorry for what I did.

51
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,160
Dr. Param went to work today.

52
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,120
He wrote a letter of leave for two weeks.

53
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,640
He said he's getting married.

54
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,960
I wish you happiness.

55
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,120
To get married?

56
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,640
No matter what excuses you make for Lomdao,

57
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,920
I still can't accept it!

58
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,440
It doesn't matter how good she is to me,

59
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,720
she still can't change my mind.

60
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,880
It's best to just tell her

61
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,640
to stop doing this!

62
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,520
I just

63
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,080
want you to love

64
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,160
and adore Faidam like before.

65
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,080
But you're not Faidam.

66
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,240
You are not!

67
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,520
You're just a fraud who deceives others!

68
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,160
Did you think this ridiculous wig and this ugly mole

69
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,480
will soften me up?

70
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,880
Let me tell you right here,

71
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,200
no matter what you do,

72
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,280
you can never bring back my feelings that I have for Faidam!

73
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
Mom.

74
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,880
I got a wedding date already.

75
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,880
I reserved a venue and contacted everything already.

76
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,640
I wanted to let you know.

77
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,200
Auntie!

78
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,280
Hey, when did you handle all of this?

79
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,360
I went to turn in my letter of leave

80
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,880
this morning at the hospital

81
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,720
and I contacted everything already.

82
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,880
I'm scheduled to meet with your grandmother and the dress shop tomorrow.

83
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,440
Let's try costumes tomorrow.

84
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
I think

85
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,520
I need to talk to you first.

86
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,360
Are we going to get married

87
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,920
while your mom still doesn't accept me?

88
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,080
Can I ask you not to ask anything yet?

89
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
Trust me.

90
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,720
But...

91
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,760
No buts.

92
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,280
No why.

93
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,880
I just want you to believe me.

94
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
Please?

95
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,760
I will never make you sad.

96
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
I promise.

97
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,080
Hey, Dao.

98
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,560
I hope you get the dress you want.

99
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,320
I'll quickly finish my work.

100
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,720
So I'll have time to attend your wedding.

101
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,800
Oh, are you here to see Dao?

102
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,120
I came to say goodbye.

103
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,360
Me and my significant other is leaving for America.

104
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,040
You just broke up with Dao and you found someone new already?

105
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,280
This is Atsawin.

106
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,760
He's my boyfriend.

107
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
Boyfriend?

108
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
Yes.

109
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,360
This is Mr. Wat.

110
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,080
He is Dao's best friend.

111
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,120
- Hello. - Hello.

112
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,720
I have to get to work now.

113
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,840
Please go inside, Dao's there.

114
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,360
Thank you.

115
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,200
Oh, Dao.

116
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,280
Why didn't she tell me about this?

117
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,920
Totally my type.

118
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,960
Too bad he's taken, I'm so upset.

119
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
Oh.

120
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,960
How am I supposed to get out?

121
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,040
Auntie.

122
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,680
Brother, Auntie is...

123
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,560
Where are you going?

124
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,960
I'm going to the garden house.

125
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,120
How long are you staying there?

126
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,560
Until the wedding is over.

127
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,160
If you still want Lomdao to live in this house,

128
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,200
then I won't come back here again.

129
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,320
Brother, what should we do?

130
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,200
I'm sorry, Dao,

131
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,320
that I won't be at your wedding.

132
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,360
It's alright.

133
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,880
It's just a simple wedding.

134
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,320
We can meet later when

135
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,840
Doctor and I go to America.

136
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,520
Then promise me that you'll go on your honeymoon in America.

137
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,240
Yes.

138
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,280
Yes.

139
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,280
Safe travels, Mr. Win.

140
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,240
Thank you.

141
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
I wish you happiness.

142
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,440
I'll see you over there.

143
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,280
Yes.

144
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
Bye.

145
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,520
Let's go.

146
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,080
Max is leaving for America

147
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,520
so he came to say goodbye.

148
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,200
What about Mr. Win?

149
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,600
He is Max's boyfriend.

150
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,600
I wanted to give him a surprise

151
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,240
but I was the one surprised.

152
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,040
Do you know what I saw?

153
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,960
I saw a man.

154
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,800
My boyfriend's boyfriend.

155
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,760
A man?

156
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,600
Boyfriend's boyfriend?

157
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,880
We've dated for years but I had never suspected...

158
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,360
that my boyfriend was gay.

159
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,600
Max's boyfriend?

160
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,000
The one that you met?

161
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,720
Let's go, Grandma is probably waiting.

162
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
Let's go.

163
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,400
Go get blessings from Mom and Dad.

164
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,280
Thank you for giving me a chance to look after Dao, Mom and Dad.

165
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,360
I'm entrusting Dao to you.

166
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,600
And I'm sorry for punching you.

167
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,160
It's alright.

168
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,720
I'm leaving Dao to you.

169
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,960
If you're upset at each other,

170
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,440
you must forgive each other.

171
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,800
If you don't love her anymore, don't hurt her.

172
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,320
You can return her to me.

173
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,200
I will love and look after Dao as if she's my life.

174
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,800
The wedding next week,

175
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,360
what do we have to do?

176
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,480
Are you free?

177
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,040
You visit us so often.

178
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,360
I'm not so free.

179
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,960
Work is busy.

180
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,200
I have to film dramas, commercials and photo shoots every day.

181
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,800
There's also a movie.

182
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,760
That's a lot of filming. Where will it be premiered?

183
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,600
The moon?

184
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,960
How come I haven't seen any of your work?

185
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,280
I heard Dr. Param has a girl

186
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,680
leeching off of him and never lets go.

187
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,400
That must be you, isn't it?

188
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,520
I have money.

189
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,000
I can do it.

190
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,840
If you don't have any to help out,

191
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,240
shut your trap.

192
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,360
I'll be taking my leave.

193
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,480
Well, it's about time.

194
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,440
We're not dating.

195
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,800
I only hired her.

196
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,760
I already told you

197
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,360
that I never think of this as just an act.

198
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,080
Because my love for you is real.

199
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,760
Let's stop talking about this.

200
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,360
This is your last payment.

201
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,200
What made you say this?

202
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,240
Because you no longer need to be my fake girlfriend.

203
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,800
When you're in trouble,

204
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,200
you asked for my help.

205
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,720
I sacrificed my dignity

206
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,960
to pretend to be your fake girlfriend.

207
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,520
I let your mom insult and scorn me.

208
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,600
In the end, you don't see my worth and kick me to the curb like this?

209
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,880
I don't know how your parents raised you up

210
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,520
so you became a person like this.

211
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,920
You lack manner and can't sympathize with others.

212
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,360
You're essentially worthless.

213
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,160
I'm not surprised

214
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,600
that all you can ever be is a fake girlfriend that Doctor hired.

215
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,400
If you keep this up, no one can like you.

216
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,520
What's not good about me?

217
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,280
I did every single thing you asked.

218
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Is it wrong

219
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,320
that your fake girlfriend

220
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,960
ends up liking you for real?

221
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,600
Why didn't you give me any chance?

222
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,520
I'm not so stupid,

223
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,880
to be unaware of what you've been doing.

224
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,680
I know that when you meet someone better,

225
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,160
richer,

226
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,160
more interesting,

227
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,040
you will surely leave.

228
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,640
Because you are ambitious.

229
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,360
You lust for victory.

230
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,840
Riga,

231
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,720
you can't win when it comes to this kind of matter.

232
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,000
I don't love you.

233
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,160
No matter how good you are.

234
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,040
Let's see how they will get married.

235
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,400
(Param Monthianrak - Lomdao Ratrivichitr)

236
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,240
Madam, please stop being angry at me.

237
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,960
I love you, Madam.

238
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,560
I don't want you to be sad

239
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,120
or feel that I don't respect you.

240
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,840
I was wrong for lying to you.

241
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,640
I was wrong for making you sad.

242
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,400
You can insult me, scold me, however you like.

243
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,760
But please don't hate me.

244
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,560
I am willing to do anything.

245
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,080
Whether it's a cook, a maid, a confidant

246
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,560
or anything that you want me to be.

247
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,600
Back then she was in the wrong.

248
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,800
But she has repented and tried her best to apologize to you.

249
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,240
What more could you possibly want?

250
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,960
She probably hates me now.

251
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,200
She probably wants me gone.

252
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,800
I don't know what else to do, Grandma.

253
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,080
I got a wedding date already.

254
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,800
I reserved a venue and contacted everything already.

255
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,360
I wanted to let you know.

256
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,640
Then I apologize to you, Mom...

257
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,440
that I made my decision to get married.

258
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,160
We're already this old.

259
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,520
How long do we have left on this earth?

260
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,960
Why don't we live happily?

261
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,560
By spending our life watching our kids raise their family.

262
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,520
Have a family they cherish.

263
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,640
Have someone they love taking care of them.

264
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,480
Isn't that what

265
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,520
every mother wishes for?

266
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,400
Think about it, Pisamorn.

267
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,080
Even if you're angry at Lomdao

268
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,280
but you can't come to hate Faidam that you love, right?

269
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,680
Don't worry, Madam.

270
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,160
I know your motto really well,

271
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,040
"full stomach, full wallet"!

272
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,640
That's why

273
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,000
this meal will be my treat to welcome you home!

274
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,920
Let's go home together.

275
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
Then

276
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,000
I'll give you a raise.

277
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
1,000 baht.

278
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,160
You already had me at 500 baht.

279
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,680
Faidam.

280
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,960
Madam, I've got some gifts for you.

281
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,400
Thank you so much, Mr. Pon.

282
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,160
Doctor and his girlfriend didn't come?

283
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,000
They didn't.

284
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,040
They're having a wedding.

285
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,200
Why aren't you attending their wedding?

286
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,760
Then, I'll excuse myself.

287
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,360
How could I have overlook the happiness of the person I love?

288
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,240
If I go back now,

289
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,000
it's probably too late.

290
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,120
Excuse me.

291
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,160
Is the wedding for Dr. Param and Lomdao already finished?

292
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,280
The client canceled it this morning.

293
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
Excuse me.

294
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,080
Damn it!

295
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,720
Isn't today your wedding day?

296
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,160
Why did you come here?

297
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,560
I probably can't get married

298
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,680
if you won't give me my blessings.

299
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,200
The reason you broke up with Dao

300
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,320
and didn't get married...

301
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,240
is because of me.

302
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,440
It's because of me, isn't it?

303
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,960
It's because I said...

304
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,600
I will not step foot in your wedding.

305
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,880
Don't cry, Mom.

306
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,480
What if I were to marry someone else?

307
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,400
Someone who's not Lomdao.

308
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,760
What do you mean by that?

309
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,560
It's me, Madam.

310
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,480
I would like to apply for your new daughter-in-law.

311
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,080
I guarantee you, I have all the qualifications.

312
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,080
If you call to order now, there will be no need for dowry.

313
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,840
Plus, you'll get a maid, a cook, a housekeeper for free for the whole year!

314
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,200
Quickly call to order.

315
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,560
You already had me

316
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,200
at the "no need for dowry"!

317
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,680
Madam.

318
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,680
Madam.

319
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,640
I apologize

320
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,360
for making you sad.

321
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,760
Call me Mom now.

322
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,920
Mom.

323
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,640
I can't thank you enough for not being mad at me.

324
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,040
Let's not talk about the past on the day of a new beginning.

325
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,120
Just know that

326
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,200
the promise we made for each other

327
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,560
has been fulfilled is good enough.

328
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:24,320
From now on, our families will only have good things,

329
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,000
good luck and happiness.

330
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,200
Yes, Grandma.

331
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,040
Let's go. Let's have a good time with the kids.

332
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,120
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

333
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,480
- You both look pretty and handsome today. - Thank you!

334
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,280
Thank you.

335
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,880
Give me something to drink. I'm thirsty.

336
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,080
Here you go.

337
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,840
Here, Pisamorn, a glass of water.

338
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,760
- Good evening. - Here's some orange juice.

339
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,360
- Thank you. - No problem.

340
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:22,040
- Pisamorn, we've got so much food today. - Is that so?

341
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,960
They're all delicious. We brought them from Ubon Ratchathani!

342
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,880
You can't just tell her. Show her around and recommend her what's good.

343
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,600
Right, come this way.

344
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,920
Over here, please. This way.

345
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
So, Phon.

346
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,560
When will it be our wedding?

347
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,320
Oab!

348
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,440
Did you forget what I said the other day?

349
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,480
As soon as Doctor and Dao's situation is sorted out.

350
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,560
Does that mean...

351
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,560
Dad! Mom! Grandma!

352
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,960
I got myself a future wife!

353
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,800
That's great! We're happy!

354
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,960
This calls for a celebration!

355
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,320
What're you doing?

356
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,720
Happy for our daughter.

357
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,920
Leave the kids alone.

358
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,840
Congratulations.

359
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,480
Mom.

360
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,680
When will it be my turn?

361
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,760
A wife?

362
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
A husband!

363
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,120
Jeez! I don't want a husband anymore!

364
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,160
Mom!

365
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,680
What kind of joke is that?

366
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,160
Mom.

367
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,960
If the person next to Dr. Param were me,

368
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,560
we would look pretty cute.

369
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,360
Don't you agree?

370
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,440
- Mom! - Congratulations.

371
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,720
Mom!

372
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,480
You pranked me again!

373
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,800
- Buab! - Yes, baby?

374
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,680
I also want a wedding like this.

375
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,800
You want to get married?

376
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,040
Then close your eyes first.

377
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,040
Why?

378
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,680
Just do it. Close your eyes.

379
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
Can I...

380
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,920
Not yet.

381
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,000
- Can I open my eyes now? Ow. That hurts. - Okay. I'm sorry.

382
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,080
You can open your eyes now.

383
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,800
- You want to get married? - Yeah.

384
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,400
Then, let's get married today.

385
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,600
Here! Put this on for me as well!

386
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,760
- A bow tie? Sure. - Can you tie for me?

387
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,000
Buab! Turn around now!

388
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,560
Just a second.

389
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,680
Do I look handsome?

390
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,800
The most handsome!

391
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,840
Isn't it time to consummate our love?

392
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,800
No need to ask. Let's get going! Come!

393
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,280
Now you're my wife.

394
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,600
Can I ask something from you?

395
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,640
What is it?

396
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,040
I want you

397
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,200
to only be my Faidam.

398
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,400
Lomdao Monthianrak.

399
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,480
Oab come here, I'll take over.

400
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,800
You're the groom! Come here!

401
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,760
I got it! I'll do it.

402
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,400
Buab! This way!

403
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,080
I was kidding!

404
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,800
Alright, alright.

405
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,880
Can the bride make some space?

406
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,080
No, I can't.

407
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,760
Baby, that's enough! Go back to your spot!

408
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,000
Okay!

409
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,280
Is everyone ready?

410
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,560
One, two, three!

411
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,080
(After their wedding, Oab and Phon tried having babies.)

412
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,040
(They haven't been successful. Don't know if it's because of his "size S".)

413
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,080
(Buab and Taew continue to quarrel.)

414
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,680
(Because Buab likes to sneak out for some indecent fun.)

415
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,240
(But no one can hold a candle to Taew.)

416
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,560
(Songsawat is still single and ready to mingle.)

417
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,240
(Always looking for love.)

418
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,200
(He said as long as you know he's the one, just Direct Message him.)

419
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,240
(Mom and Dad's love is still strong.)

420
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,800
(Because once he goes on an escapade,)

421
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,560
(Mom makes sure to give him a good beating.)

422
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,600
(Grandma Pathum plans to live past a hundred years.)

423
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,880
(A healthy grandmother like her,)

424
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,840
(finally caught a cold at a hundred years old.)

425
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,040
(Madam Pisamorn is still as stingy as ever.)

426
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,160
(She continues to save up money and declares to stay beautiful,)

427
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,160
(free of wrinkles until death without paying for Botox.)

428
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,920
Wait! Hold on a second! What about my life story?!

429
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,120
(5 years later.)

430
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,040
Five years later, the times that I'm alone...

431
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,800
are extremely little!

432
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,320
I'm still a cook.

433
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,720
I don't get paid.

434
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,160
I only receive happiness

435
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,280
and a little bit of headache.

436
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,440
Ouch!

437
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,760
Ow! Dao! Help me!

438
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,560
Ouch!

439
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,640
Hold on!

440
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,480
Jeez!

441
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,000
I left the kids with you for a second. How come you look like a mess?!

442
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I wonder too.

443
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,920
Mafueng, Mafai, stop pranking Daddy okay?

444
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,480
He's so pitiful now.

445
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,560
Honey,

446
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,920
I'm tired.

447
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,120
Who do you think they take after?

448
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,720
Who else would it be?

449
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,160
Careful, don't trip!

450
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,960
They took after you!

451
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,240
No way! It must be you.

452
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,520
I'm rather well-mannered and gentle.

453
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,200
Sure you are!

454
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,360
Well-mannered and gentle.

455
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,920
Hey!

456
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,800
I'll take these two mischievous kids for their afternoon naps.

457
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,040
Then I'll come and handle you.

458
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,680
Didn't you say

459
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,360
these two are like me?

460
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,320
The next one should be like you, don't you think?

461
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,240
You!

462
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,840
- Go! Get them to bed. - Come on, kids!

463
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,920
Nap time, sleepy heads. Come on.

464
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,320
We're not sleepy!

465
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,040
Not sleepy at all?

466
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,480
Daddy can go to sleep. I'll sleep later.

467
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,080
Go rest up, alright?

468
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,800
Also...

469
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,400
Daddy needs to talk to Mommy about something.

470
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,280
Okay? Let's take a nap.

471
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,360
Be good kids. Let's go!

472
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,120
Good job.

473
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,440
You're the cutest!

474
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,960
Finished?

475
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,920
Yeah.

476
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,360
Did you forget what day it is today?

477
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,160
Of course I remember.

478
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,280
Our anniversary.

479
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,960
Then...

480
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,920
let's get on with our business.

481
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,080
What business?

482
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,560
Our personal business.

483
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,560
We've been together for many years.

484
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,280
You're still as cute as ever.

485
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,720
Sweet talk like this...

486
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,520
What do you wan...

487
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:04,720
Thank you everyone for your support up until now.

488
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,440
Doctor and I are very happy now.

489
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,080
For everyone that's in love right now, you have my support.

490
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,680
May everyone trust in their heart.

491
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,360
Because if he's the one,

492
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,040
your heart will tell you so.

493
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,520
Also!

494
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,480
I promise I'll take good care of your doctor here.

495
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,640
To make it worth the title of the Doctor's wife!

496
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,720
(The end)
