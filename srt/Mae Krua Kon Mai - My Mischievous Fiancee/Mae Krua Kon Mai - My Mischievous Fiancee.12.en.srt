1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,840
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,200
Regarding Riga, Grandma.

3
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,000
I think we can easily handle her.

4
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,120
How?

5
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,040
I plan to hire someone I know

6
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,280
to reclaim the debt and Aunt Pisamorn's house

7
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,360
until not a single baht is left.

8
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,640
But mom wants to eat with you tomorrow.

9
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
With me?

10
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,120
Can you do the cooking?

11
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,520
I will do my very best.

12
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,800
Prepare something nice for Miss Riga.

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,080
Buab, why do we have to talk over here?

14
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,440
We can talk over there.

15
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,400
Madam will scold me if I don't answer to her calls.

16
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,880
A flower.

17
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,120
For me?

18
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,120
Oh.

19
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,200
For anniversary.

20
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,360
Anniversary...

21
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,000
My dad's death anniversary.

22
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,880
Buab!

23
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
That hurts!

24
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,040
I just want us to pay respect to my dad together.

25
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,520
Do you want to share the death anniversary with him?!

26
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,960
- Huh?! - Taew, why are you mad at me?

27
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,240
I just want to introduce you to my dad.

28
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,040
Okay? Please.

29
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,360
You've ruined my mood.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,040
- Now I'm in a bad mood. - Baby.

31
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,520
- Baby! - Faidam!

32
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,720
- You're going to the market? - Yeah.

33
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,640
Baby. Want to go to the market?

34
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,640
No.

35
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,960
So you don't want to?

36
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,720
Correct!

37
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,080
Then I'll go with Faidam.

38
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,400
- Let's go. - Buab!

39
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,640
Are you coming?

40
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,200
I won't.

41
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,360
Then don't.

42
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,120
Buab! Buab! Buab!

43
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,400
I won't go home.

44
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,400
We'll go to the market.

45
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,520
That's it

46
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
What?

47
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,960
Wait.

48
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,000
What now Doctor?

49
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,800
I'm coming with you.

50
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,480
I need to buy stuff for Riga.

51
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,960
Get in.

52
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,800
Come. Get in the car, Buab.

53
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,120
Come on. Get in the car, Buab.

54
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,680
One seat, let's take the backseat so we can sit together.

55
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
Faidam.

56
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
Get in.

57
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,520
Come on. Stop stalling.

58
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
Let's go.

59
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,560
- Buab. - Yes?

60
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,520
Do Auntie Ranee and Mr. Wat allow you

61
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,680
to help Taew and Faidam buy groceries?

62
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,920
It's alright.

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,720
I told them already.

64
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,880
I'm here to buy a color TV to send home.

65
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,240
- I don't know if there's any. - There should be.

66
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,600
TV is everywhere these days.

67
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,960
Right, then I'll get a red one.

68
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,560
- You're funny! - Of course.

69
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,720
Jeez! Baby!

70
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,440
Cosmetics!

71
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,680
Let's check it out!

72
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,720
Doctor, can we check out the cosmetics?

73
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,880
- Let's go, Buab. You'll pay. - Me again?!

74
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,760
- Here! - Here, Thank you.

75
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,960
There're so many things!

76
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,960
This!

77
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,160
Oh, this!

78
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,000
Maybelline! Gives you the best looking lashes ever!

79
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,920
Best looking? Baby.

80
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,200
I don't think you need a Maybelline.

81
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,680
Formaldehyde is better, for your teeth.

82
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,960
Buab! I thought you like it!

83
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,240
Just kidding!

84
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,320
Calm down.

85
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
Hair clip!

86
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
How much is this?

87
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,240
199 baht.

88
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Long lasting and waterproof.

89
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,280
- I'll take it. - Okay.

90
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,160
It's for dark skin tone, why?

91
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,400
- Keep the change. - Thank you!

92
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,840
Why are you giving me this?

93
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
Thank you.

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,440
- That's enough, baby. - I want more.

95
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,520
Enough.

96
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,320
- I have no more. - Fine.

97
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,000
- Let's go. - Thank you.

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,040
What's wrong?

99
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,520
Huh?

100
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,760
Your face was dirty.

101
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,040
I wiped it off for you.

102
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,680
You must be referring to yours.

103
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,240
Come, I'll wipe it for you.

104
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,360
- No need, Doctor. - Let me!

105
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,920
I said I'll do it.

106
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
Here.

107
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,440
Take your hands off.

108
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,080
It's fine, Doctor.

109
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,000
Where are you going?

110
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,240
I...

111
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,920
Doctor!

112
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,600
Why are you yelling?

113
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,440
You fell into me

114
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,320
and made me drop my handkerchief.

115
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,600
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,080
Well, I noticed it's dirtied.

117
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,200
I'll wash it for you.

118
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,560
- Thanks. - Sure.

119
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,040
Do you think I wouldn't know?

120
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,160
Grandma!

121
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,520
Wait, Grandma!

122
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,040
Are you trying to kill me, Grandma?!

123
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,560
Who made you so angry?!

124
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,160
I'm irritated!

125
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,240
I can't sit still.

126
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,240
I don't know if Pisamorn managed

127
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,880
to get rid of that actress by now?

128
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,240
Why don't you handle it then?

129
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,240
What do you mean?

130
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,920
Go to Doctor's house.

131
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
Do you want to? I'll take you there.

132
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,440
Am I your buddy?

133
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,680
Sorry, Grandma.

134
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,760
I'm your senior!

135
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,760
Acting weak?

136
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,600
It really hurts, Grandma!

137
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,880
Take me to Dr. Param's right now.

138
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,480
Phon.

139
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,000
Grandma, wait!

140
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,120
Doctor.

141
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,760
Mom said you went out and buy groceries just for me.

142
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,480
You're so cute. Thank you.

143
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,880
I want to feed you good food.

144
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,280
Next time let me accompany you.

145
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,000
It's okay. I won't let you carry heavy things.

146
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,800
See? Faidam can handle it.

147
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
She's strong.

148
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,320
She could actually carry the whole market.

149
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,320
Breaking just a little sweat.

150
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,640
Let's go inside.

151
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,520
- Baby. - Hmm?

152
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,040
Doctor and Miss Riga is acting so sweet.

153
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,680
Holding hands and hugging tightly.

154
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,720
Yeah.

155
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,120
Doctor's fiancee is in trouble now.

156
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,640
- Faidam. - Hmm?

157
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,760
You put on whitening cream?

158
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,320
What do you mean?

159
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,040
It's working its miracle.

160
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,160
You’ve got some uneven blotches.

161
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,120
Shoot!

162
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
Buab!

163
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,920
Take this.

164
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,960
And this. Take it.

165
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,680
What the hell?

166
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,200
Wow.

167
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,400
Come. I'll help you.

168
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,240
Take too long and you'll get caught.

169
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,800
I still have to go out and endure that lovesick couple.

170
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,280
I want to feed you good food.

171
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,880
Bleh, I want to puke.

172
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,960
You're a maid.

173
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,720
If even if you want to, swallow it.

174
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,800
- Okay?. - Yes.

175
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,080
I swallowed it.

176
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,520
Hurry.

177
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,880
So in love, so sweet.

178
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,920
Let's see who's sweeter.

179
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,000
I'll make sure you choke on the sugar.

180
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,320
- Doctor. - Riga and I are already sweet enough.

181
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,040
You don't need to help.

182
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Besides,

183
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,600
if you don't want to eat it yourself,

184
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,480
don't do what you did yesterday.

185
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,640
I couldn't believe Faidam

186
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,080
is such a good cook.

187
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,120
These look better than her face.

188
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
Riga.

189
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,920
Delicious.

190
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,360
Taste is important.

191
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,600
Even more than looks.

192
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,160
Of course it is.

193
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,520
Why else would you come home to eat with us every day?

194
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,200
It's okay, I'll get it.

195
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
Yes.

196
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,640
They're making us wait.

197
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,960
How much longer?

198
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,280
Hello.

199
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,280
Hello!

200
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,320
- You're right on time. - Sure.

201
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,080
Give it all you got.

202
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,840
Fret not!

203
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,280
When it comes to debt collecting, Sis Kim and Sis Hong got your back.

204
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,880
Please, come inside.

205
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,920
Why are we both entering at the same time?!

206
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,920
Move!

207
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,360
Why are you like this?

208
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,000
Wow!

209
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,960
Shamelessly enjoying fancy food.

210
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,400
How could that debt be paid?

211
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,080
Interest rate is getting higher.

212
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,520
It's disastrous.

213
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,880
It will fu...

214
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,760
Why did you stop?

215
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,280
She stopped me.

216
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,000
No Likay play, please.

217
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,040
You've got much debt, why don't you pay that first?

218
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Debt?!

219
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,880
Move!

220
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,480
Go!

221
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,000
What debt, Mom?

222
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,640
"What debt?"

223
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,680
You sure have the nerves.

224
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,960
Did you not tell your own son?

225
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,120
That you own us debt.

226
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,320
Madam Pisamorn borrowed from us for gambling.

227
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,800
It's millions.

228
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,000
She even put a mortgage on this house.

229
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,480
Right.

230
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,160
Should I kick you out?

231
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,640
Should I do that and make you a homeless?!

232
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,560
I already told them you're receiving a guest

233
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,280
but they don't listen.

234
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,640
Looks tasty.

235
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,960
It's good.

236
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,800
Hey! What are you doing?!

237
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,520
This is to cover the interest.

238
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,800
You won't pay, we won't leave empty handed.

239
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,400
You guys are over dramatic with the act!

240
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,880
Auntie.

241
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,360
Give me back my food!

242
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,120
Did you forget? We're your creditor.

243
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,480
Yes.

244
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,760
Did you forget? We're your creditor?!

245
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,200
Right, They are the creditor.

246
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,760
Think of this as a small interest fee.

247
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,640
Fine! I owed you a debt!

248
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,280
However much interest rate is, just take them!

249
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,360
All done!

250
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,840
I'm leaving, see you next week.

251
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,960
If we don't get the money next week,

252
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,680
we'll seize this house for sure.

253
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,360
Dang it! So clumsy!

254
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,320
It's heavy.

255
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,000
Excuse me, until next time...

256
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,800
Auntie, it's okay.

257
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,120
It's alright.

258
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,720
Are they really going to seize the house?

259
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,440
That's right!

260
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,160
Next week, they'll probably come and take it.

261
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,880
Take your time, Auntie.

262
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,560
We can pay them bit by bit

263
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,720
then as to pay in installments.

264
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,800
A bit?

265
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,760
How much is a bit?

266
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,640
I don't have much to pay them!

267
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,000
Why are you saying that?

268
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,600
Because I don't have the money to pay them!

269
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,240
You two can do whatever you want.

270
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,280
- Yes. - Yes.

271
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,600
Mom, I don't believe that was real.

272
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,720
I'm sorry, Param.

273
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,240
But it is real.

274
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,320
Is it true?

275
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,240
Hurry, Oab.

276
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,080
I want to know so badly

277
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,120
if her plan is working or not.

278
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,480
I'll be flying if you want me to be faster.

279
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,600
Yeah, just hurry up! Stop talking!

280
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,760
- Why did you shut the door on me?! - Can't you open it yourself?!

281
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Dang it.

282
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,640
So those rumors are true!

283
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,240
How come you look so stressed?

284
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,800
Why shouldn't I be?

285
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,280
Madam Pisamorn's house is getting seized.

286
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,320
Don't tell me you're worried about her.

287
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,440
Who says? I'm just worried for myself.

288
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,240
You knew Grandma is forcing me to marry Dr. Param.

289
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,800
Not knowing this family has so much debt they put their house on mortgage.

290
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,080
Just like I expected.

291
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,040
They're after my money.

292
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,480
But they won't get a cent from me.

293
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,520
Why stress over such a small problem.

294
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,400
How much did you owe them? Tell me.

295
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,120
I'll lend you a hand.

296
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,680
I'll get you bags full of money.

297
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,160
I can do so without batting an eye.

298
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,600
That's right.

299
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,520
You two don't have to worry.

300
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,560
Tell us however much you need.

301
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,240
It's alright, Grandma.

302
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,480
I'll try to negotiate with Sis Kim and Sis Hong.

303
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,440
I agree.

304
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,360
I wouldn't want to bother Grandma.

305
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,720
It's too big of a problem.

306
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,200
Doctor, it isn't.

307
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,160
We've got no problems at all.

308
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,720
Because sooner or later

309
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,640
we'll become family anyway.

310
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,640
Do you think he's willing to marry your granddaughter for money?

311
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,680
I'm standing here as his girlfriend.

312
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,720
Yet you're trying to lure him away to your granddaughter, with money.

313
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,960
I have money.

314
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,600
I can do it.

315
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,280
If you don't have any to help out,

316
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,680
shut your trap.

317
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,080
Is your granddaughter so desperate in finding a man?

318
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,920
That's why you go around waving your money in front of them?

319
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,840
I won't let Doctor marry someone else.

320
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,360
Doctor.

321
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,240
Grandma is going to do something to me.

322
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,880
I need to stretch!

323
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,400
Sitting still for too long is making me feel stiff.

324
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Grandma.

325
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,040
I think you should take this outside.

326
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,040
Sounds good!

327
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,480
Let's go!

328
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,240
Doctor, why does everyone wants to chase me out?

329
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,840
I won't let anyone do that to you.

330
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
Doctor.

331
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,320
We need to talk.

332
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,280
I'll be back.

333
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,760
What's the meaning of all this?

334
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,960
What?

335
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,760
I'm talking about Miss Riga.

336
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,960
It's nothing.

337
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,600
What do you mean?

338
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,760
I can see clearly

339
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,320
that you are dating her.

340
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,960
And trying to get my sister out of the way.

341
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,200
Doing this,

342
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,280
can we still be friends?

343
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,080
Actually,

344
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,920
we're not dating.

345
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,240
I only hired her.

346
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,520
Why would do that?

347
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,600
I have my own reasons.

348
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,040
Miss Riga.

349
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,280
Where are you going?

350
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,920
I have something to attend to.

351
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,520
Please let Doctor knows I'm leaving.

352
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,120
Is this plan really this effective?

353
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,160
Trust me, Grandma.

354
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,040
I guarantee this plan to get rid of that shameless woman Riga will...

355
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,360
definitely scare her off.

356
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,000
I'll be taking my leave.

357
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,080
Well, it's about time.

358
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,280
Phon, where is Riga?

359
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,640
Oh.

360
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,600
She left right after she came to get her purse.

361
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,400
Oab.

362
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,120
I need to talk to Phon.

363
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,920
Go ahead.

364
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
In private.

365
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,880
I'm intruding?

366
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,720
See? I told you.

367
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,760
I can totally handle this!

368
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,440
That's what she get for clinging onto him like a leech.

369
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,560
But from what I can see,

370
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,680
I don't think that's the case.

371
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,840
It seems to me like Param...

372
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,920
actually cares for her quite a bit.

373
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,480
Pisamorn.

374
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,280
If he truly loves that woman

375
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,840
then I'm all for it.

376
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,520
Dao, my granddaughter is also a woman.

377
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,880
How would she feel

378
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,400
if she knows she's being forced to

379
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,640
marry a guy who doesn't care about her.

380
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,040
Even now she's already throwing tantrums at me.

381
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,760
Jeez! Grandma!

382
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,920
Param really isn't interested in that woman!

383
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,480
What is it, Doctor?

384
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,440
I'll be honest with you.

385
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,280
That story about Mom being in huge debt and the house is getting seized

386
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,440
doesn't convince me.

387
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,000
Did you know about this?

388
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,280
Not at all.

389
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,760
I think she has some kind of plan.

390
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,440
And why would she do that?

391
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,320
I wonder.

392
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,200
But a frugal and careful like Mom

393
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,480
will never let herself

394
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,040
be in so much debt.

395
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,120
And even put the house in mortgage.

396
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,240
Next door is Auntie Ranee's, our nice and kind neighbor.

397
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,840
She's the one who brought over Faidam.

398
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,280
It's also a place where she can escape and procrastinate.

399
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,320
- Really? - If I take my eyes off her for a second.

400
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,120
She'll disappear and already be over there.

401
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,760
I suspect this time as well

402
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,440
she must be having some fun.

403
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,000
Is this really okay?

404
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,760
Phon.

405
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,080
Go fetch Faidam for me.

406
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,000
I want Grandma and Oab to meet her.

407
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,080
I heard she's from Ubon Ratchathani, you might know her.

408
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,600
Oh, right.

409
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,080
Phon did mentioned before

410
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,920
that Faidam is from Ubon Ratchathani.

411
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,120
I still haven't seen her.

412
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,720
I want to know which family she's from.

413
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,920
I know literally everyone in Ubon Ratchathani.

414
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
All of them?

415
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,480
Of course.

416
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,000
There's no one I don't know

417
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,320
and there isn't anyone who doesn't know my name.

418
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,640
Oh.

419
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,200
Phon, go get her.

420
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,640
She'll have to cook for Grandma, too.

421
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,240
I'm so upset! Sis Kim and Sis Hong

422
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,240
took all of my food away!

423
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,320
Alright.

424
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,600
Then I'll accompany you.

425
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,360
It's this close. I won't be lost, Oab.

426
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,560
How many times until you're caught?

427
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,440
Oab. Why are you following me?

428
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,320
I told you.

429
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,440
There's no need. I will not get lost.

430
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
Hey, Phon!

431
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,600
I'm not following you.

432
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,920
If you're not. Then why are you standing here?

433
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,280
Well, I'm getting Faidam.

434
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,760
Get Faidam?

435
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,360
You think I'm following you?

436
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,880
Wrong.

437
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,160
Oab!

438
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,760
Wait!

439
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,840
Phon! Phon!

440
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,440
Actually, I was joking.

441
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,040
I am following you.

442
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,440
I didn't admit it because

443
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,960
you might feel humiliated.

444
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,160
Oh?

445
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,320
What's the hurry?

446
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,360
Where's Mr. Wat?

447
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,000
He's using the sauna spa in the living room, what is it?

448
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,520
Hey!

449
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,680
Is disguising oneself such a hard task?

450
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,720
Always running.

451
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,600
Everyday she's running away

452
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,360
from the troubles she caused!

453
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,720
What?!

454
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,680
I have none!

455
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,840
Bye.

456
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,480
Always calling to ask for some money!

457
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,840
Oh men.

458
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,440
Wat! Wat!

459
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,280
Big problem!

460
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,440
Wat!

461
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,600
Calm your horse! What is it this time? What kind of problem?

462
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,000
Dude, Oab is coming!

463
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,400
What?! Oab is here?!

464
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,480
What should I do?! What to do now?!

465
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,480
Help me think of a way! Help me! Think!

466
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,320
- Don't just stay silent! - That's Oab!

467
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,240
Scoot over!

468
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,120
Your butt!

469
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,680
Sorry!

470
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,320
Help.

471
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,320
Help me!

472
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,360
Hurry.

473
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,400
I almost couldn't breathe.

474
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,560
I think

475
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,120
we should go upstairs.

476
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,640
Great.

477
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,120
Dude!

478
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,520
Get in!

479
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,200
Get down.

480
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,160
Oh snap.

481
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,840
That was close.

482
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,800
What close?

483
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,720
You.

484
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,400
No one's home, Brother.

485
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,480
I think we should leave.

486
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,280
Then, I'll come back to meet Faidam

487
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,360
some other time.

488
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,200
If we stayed here.

489
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,840
when the owner comes back, they'll think we're robbing their house.

490
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,120
Unlike you, I don't look like a robber.

491
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,040
And Aunt Ranee wouldn't think so.

492
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,360
But if you want to leave first

493
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,320
then take Phon with you.

494
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,320
What about you?

495
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,200
I'll wait for Faidam here.

496
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,600
All because of you, Dao.

497
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,120
Instead of turning white like a Korean beauty

498
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,560
I'm going to dry up like a mummy.

499
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,800
Are you going to leave?

500
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,000
If you’re dried up, so am I.

501
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,920
Look at my skin.

502
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,440
Just like a roasted chicken.

503
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,600
I can't, too narrow...

504
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,600
It's hot.

505
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,760
We're getting cooked.

506
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,480
Brother

507
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,120
are you really going to wait here?

508
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,520
Are you sure?

509
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,880
Yes.

510
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,560
I want to know

511
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,040
where these folks took Faidam to.

512
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,200
Why hasn't Faidam returned yet?

513
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,640
I'm screwed.

514
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,840
Oab, bring Phon back with you.

515
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,880
I'll stay here and deal with Faidam

516
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,040
for ditching work.

517
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,720
Phon, let's go.

518
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
Oab.

519
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Let's go.

520
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,880
Why did you let go?

521
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,000
He told me to send you home.

522
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,640
Why do you need to hold my hands then?

523
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,880
If I don't hold your hands

524
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,960
you might get lost.

525
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,440
How would I get lost?

526
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,920
My house is right here.

527
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,760
Lost in my heart.

528
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,160
Come, quickly.

529
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,880
Let go.

530
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,280
Annoying.

531
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,840
Phon.

532
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,920
You'll probably be mean like Grandma Pathum when you're old.

533
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,760
Beautiful, fierce, mean.

534
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,400
I'll turn into a mummy for sure.

535
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,880
What's with you?

536
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,280
I'm all dried up.

537
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,560
- Doctor. - Buab, Go wherever you need to. Don't worry about me.

538
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,200
I can't do that.

539
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,080
I think you shouldn’t sit here

540
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,960
the atmosphere here isn't good.

541
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,280
I think you should sit in the yard.

542
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,840
Take a book to read with you.

543
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,480
I'll make a fresh juice and serve it to you.

544
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,680
Okay, Doctor?

545
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,400
Way to go, Buab.

546
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,480
Make it worth your salary.

547
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,560
That's alright.

548
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,600
I don't want to trouble you.

549
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,040
I'll wait for Faidam here.

550
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
But Doctor.

551
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,880
Yes sir, you wait here.

552
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,400
Wait here.

553
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,720
Why he is calling?

554
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,760
Let's see how long you'll last.

555
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,680
What is this psycho doctor going to do?

556
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,040
Faidam.

557
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,960
Oh gosh.

558
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,600
That Faidam.

559
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,920
She's always missing.

560
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,080
She's never here when I need her to do something.

561
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,160
Hey, Phon.

562
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,920
Do you think when she's back

563
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,840
should I cut her salary?

564
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,200
I guess Mr. Wat took her out somewhere.

565
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,440
Then I should tell Wat

566
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,880
not to invite her out ever again.

567
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,840
If she goes out often and become spoiled

568
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,800
because she got herself a boy

569
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,360
We'll lose a good cook like her.

570
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,160
Baby.

571
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,720
Come out here, Hurry!

572
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,160
Got my whole face.

573
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,560
It's about Faidam.

574
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,600
Madam.

575
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,720
What?

576
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,800
I need to pee.

577
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,960
And poop, too!

578
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,000
If you needed to go, just go.

579
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,400
Wash your hands when you're done.

580
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,400
I'll wash it sparklingly clean.

581
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,840
I'll take my leave.

582
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,320
Come here.

583
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,400
What is it, Buab?

584
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,560
Hey.

585
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,280
What's the matter, Buab?

586
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,280
You surprised me.

587
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,120
Baby, please take the doctor home.

588
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,800
He's just sitting there, refusing to go home.

589
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,120
If that's what he wants, then let him be.

590
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,680
That's not the problem!

591
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,360
- But... - But what?!

592
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,160
But Faidam and Mr. Wat...

593
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,360
They are inside the sauna spa getting smoked and cooked in there!

594
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,040
Shoot!

595
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,680
But if I help, I'll be caught by Madam!

596
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,640
Baby, just help me.

597
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,040
- Taew! - She's here!

598
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,520
Taew!

599
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,000
Yes, Madam?!

600
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,320
What are you doing?

601
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,720
If you're done, go back and help!

602
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,800
There's also a garlic to be smashed.

603
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,480
- Grandma is waiting... - Yes, Madam. I'm on it!

604
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,360
- Procrastinating. - Yes.

605
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,920
She's gone!

606
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,600
Buab. I'm really sorry.

607
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,480
I can't help.

608
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,080
- What?! - I'm sorry!

609
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,480
Bye, kisses!

610
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,480
I'm so sorry!

611
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,840
Always problem!

612
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,680
I'm melting.

613
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,560
What should we do?!

614
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
Wat.

615
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,360
Stick your head out and see if that ugly face of a Doctor is gone.

616
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,120
It's your mess, you do it.

617
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,680
- Just take a... - No!

618
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,440
Fine.

619
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,840
Ahem!

620
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,440
What?

621
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,120
- He's still there. - Huh?!

622
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,200
That guy just came back from the toilet.

623
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,680
- We're dead. - What do we do?

624
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,840
What now?

625
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,520
I got it.

626
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,720
What do I do?

627
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,320
Doctor refuse to leave.

628
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,640
If this goes on,

629
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,240
Mr. Wat and Faidam will turn into smoked meat.

630
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,440
Hello.

631
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,080
This is MCM: Mom calls me Sakdidet

632
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,480
- ...of Wattanawilairatchasak family. - Buab!

633
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,000
It's me.

634
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,960
Mr. Wat!

635
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,920
You got out of the sauna spa?

636
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,760
I haven't! That's why I'm calling you.

637
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,640
-So, what do you... - Quickly come and unplug the cord for me!

638
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,880
Why do you want me to unplug it?

639
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,400
If I wither and die

640
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,440
you won't get your pay!

641
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,560
Understood?!

642
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,840
Yes! Yes!

643
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,760
- Buab! - Yes?

644
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,520
What are you doing?

645
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,280
Well. Mr. Wat left and forgot to unplug it.

646
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,920
- So I'm unplugging it. - It's fine. I'll handle it.

647
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,480
Dang Doctor!

648
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,240
There's no need!

649
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,160
Mr. Wat will be mad if I were to bother the guest!

650
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,640
I told you

651
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,200
I'll handle it.

652
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,520
Buab.

653
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,080
Could you fetch me some juice?

654
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,800
Fresh one alright?

655
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,160
Fresh juice?

656
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,640
Yeah.

657
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,800
You said you were going to do that.

658
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,720
Fresh juice! Yes. I remember now! I forgot!

659
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,880
But Doctor. This house ran out of fresh fruits.

660
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,720
I also forgot about that.

661
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,200
We're completely out.

662
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,520
Then...

663
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,320
get it from my house.

664
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,320
- Your house? - Yes.

665
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,040
Quickly! I'm getting thirsty.

666
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,440
Right away!

667
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,120
- Buab. - Yes?!

668
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,960
You changed your mind?

669
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,840
I forgot my house just ran out.

670
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,760
Guess you'll have to get it from the market.

671
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,760
The market?!

672
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,480
I'll leave it to you.

673
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,680
Mr. Wat and Faidam, I'm so sorry.

674
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,120
Pisamorn.

675
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,480
Yes, Grandma?

676
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,040
I think I should head back

677
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,520
If I wait for Faidam's cooking,

678
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,680
I'll passed out before then.

679
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:33,360
Oh, Grandma, I'm picking up the pace here.

680
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,520
It's alright, I'll get something on the way.

681
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,560
You all cook for yourself then.

682
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:41,280
- I'm leaving. - I'll stay and eat Phon's cooking.

683
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,120
Who's going to drive?

684
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,400
Go!

685
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,640
- Grandma, I'll send you off. - Oh, Okay. Let's go.

686
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,600
Oh no.

687
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,560
No way.

688
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,240
All of this on my own?!

689
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,480
This is it Dao.

690
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,360
You know what?

691
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,840
All men in my catalog.

692
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,280
I'll give them all to you.

693
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,520
If you won't make it. How will I?

694
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,120
We'll be mummified in here together.

695
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,360
It's a pity.

696
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,520
It's a pity that I'm single

697
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,480
and a virgin to boot!

698
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,720
Dear God,

699
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,480
if there's a next life,

700
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,240
Please make sure I and Dao

701
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,040
be best friends in every life.

702
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,720
One life is enough.

703
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,520
I better not see you again, Dao. I beg of you.

704
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,320
No, you can't!

705
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,840
Wat! Wat!

706
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,800
Just leave me alone!

707
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,920
Trying to break my neck?!

708
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,120
Are you okay? Endure it! Endure!

709
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,760
Wat! Wat!

710
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:29,200
I have a way to get that ugly Doctor out of here.

711
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,600
(Next episode.)

712
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,240
The secrets might have already been out, don't you think so?

713
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,520
I'll make you admit it yourself.

714
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,040
You are Lomdao.
