1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,920
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,880
When are you going to accept that it’s not going to happen?

3
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,000
Then make it happen.

4
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,440
(Previously...)

5
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,680
Unless you already have a wife.

6
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,600
Why don't you be honest then?

7
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,520
Or is it that you have choices to pick from?

8
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,400
Why is she angry?

9
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,960
Your salary in advance.

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,840
If you pretend to be my girlfriend.

11
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,840
Why must I pretend?

12
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,240
When I'll gladly do it.

13
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,360
I just want it to be an act.

14
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,520
Madam! Why do you keep the containers if you don't use them?

15
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,960
You save things you don't even use.

16
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,000
Then, they became...

17
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,520
Hey! Why do you do keep the water running?!

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,080
Turn it off!

19
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,200
- Why are you being so wasteful?! - Yes! Yes!

20
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,160
Turn it off now! Such a waste!

21
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,080
And why are you using so many bowls to wash the vegetables?

22
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,600
One bowl is enough!

23
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,680
Wash them, take them out and use that water to wash the new ones.

24
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,640
- You don't have to... Gosh! You both are so wasteful! - I'm sorry, Madam.

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,440
Huh?! Why did you throw away my plastic containers?!

26
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,680
Oh no! All of them?!

27
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,040
You can still use it!

28
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,080
You can use it to store onion, garlic, and dried chili.

29
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,200
Don't you know that plastic these days are reusable.

30
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,800
Don't just throw them away right after!

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,160
Why are you being so wasteful?!

32
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,040
Madam! You see.

33
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,640
There's no bottom.

34
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,680
Then make one!

35
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,680
Where's the grocery bags?! Don't tell me it's also in the bin?!

36
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,760
Let me see. There! Found it!

37
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,920
Do this.

38
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,240
There you go!

39
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,560
There it is.

40
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,640
Now you can put in the onions, garlic, and all the dried stuff.

41
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,680
Don't just throw them away.

42
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,360
Who are you? A millionaire? Should I cut all of your pay?!

43
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,640
- Yes, Madam. Yes. - Let me see!

44
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,080
What else did you throw away?

45
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,920
Oh my God! You threw away my egg carton?!

46
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,640
Do you know how useful this is?!

47
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,520
- I... - It can use this to absorb the grease,

48
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,200
or use it as coasters.

49
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,640
Why do you throw away the good things.

50
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,080
Who's there?

51
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,880
Who's honking?

52
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,080
Param doesn't usually honk like this.

53
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,360
- Taew, go and check it out. - Yes, Madam.

54
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,480
Worried this might be about the debt?

55
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,760
Faidam!

56
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,600
It's none of your business!

57
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,600
You're the troublemaker! Go back to your job.

58
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,200
And put these away.

59
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,840
Huh?! Paper towel!

60
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,720
Hey! Here! This is paper towel?!

61
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,480
My good paper towel! What did you use it for?!

62
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,880
- To wipe the knife. - To wipe the knife?! Don't you throw this away!

63
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,600
Clean this up and use it to clean Param's shoes.

64
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,080
Why would you use it?

65
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,640
Phon as well!

66
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,440
- She always buy those expensive things at the market! - Alright, Madam.

67
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,880
I'll use the clean part to wipe his shoes.

68
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,680
Hey!

69
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,800
Why are you so slow? I waited for so long I had to open the gate myself.

70
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,680
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,040
- Doctor, my hands hurt. - Let me see.

72
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,360
Who's making that loud noise?! Who came?!

73
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
It's me and Riga.

74
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,800
I brought her over to join our meal today.

75
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,400
Hello, Mom.

76
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,480
Hello.

77
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,040
If you're inviting someone over, let me know beforehand.

78
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,320
Don't just show up whenever you want.

79
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,600
What would Miss Ega want to eat?

80
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,880
I'll make it for you.

81
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,640
My name is Riga.

82
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,560
From now on, I'll be visiting more often.

83
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,560
Do not mess up my name.

84
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,040
Excuse me, Madam.

85
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
Say what you want.

86
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,720
I only know...

87
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
that you...

88
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,800
came to...

89
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,680
...bite his lips in the front yard!

90
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,920
Faidam. This is none of your business.

91
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,640
I can also bite his lips whenever I want.

92
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,720
Because we are dating.

93
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,720
Hey! Riga!

94
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,640
When did he say you were his girlfriend?!

95
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,240
That's nonsense,

96
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,320
the man has yet to say so.

97
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,040
Don't go around entertaining yourself with such thought.

98
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,240
Others will think you're delusional!

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,240
Mom, she's my girlfriend.

100
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,880
Param. You.

101
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,640
When did you get together with this chick?!

102
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
You see?

103
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,440
I wasn't being delusional, Mom.

104
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,040
What's going on?

105
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,360
I would like to join you for a meal.

106
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,840
Beggar.

107
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:14,800
Well, we're dating. So, Doctor wants to officially let her know.

108
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,440
Sneaking around wouldn't look good.

109
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,560
It's obvious that she's desperate to be exclusive to Doctor.

110
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,960
She would already propose, if she could.

111
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,320
Faidam.

112
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,680
Taew.

113
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,480
Help me serve the dishes

114
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,160
to the beggar who came begging.

115
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,960
Miss Ega is Doctor's girlfriend.

116
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,880
We must welcome you with such honor.

117
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,720
Tell me what you want to eat.

118
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,080
I'll make it for you.

119
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
What are you doing?

120
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,840
Why are you cooking for her?!

121
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,760
Trust me, Madam.

122
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,480
What would you like, Doctor?

123
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,240
Whatever you want.

124
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,440
Tell her what you want to eat.

125
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,320
Today's dinner... I want to have a soup and a steak.

126
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,280
- You can do that, right? - Soup and steak?

127
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,680
Have you even heard of it?

128
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,600
Easy-peasy!

129
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,320
I eat it every day.

130
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,640
I'll make it for you.

131
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
Faidam.

132
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,560
It isn't hard to cook, Madam. It's alright.

133
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,160
She'll get to eat the fanciest soup and steak. I confirm it.

134
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,840
Not in my face!

135
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
Faidam.

136
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,040
What is it, Doctor?

137
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,200
Listen carefully. My girlfriend's name is Riga, not Ega.

138
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,800
And mind your manners.

139
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,680
Didn't you parents teach you that?

140
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,840
Sure thing, Doctor.

141
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,080
I'll call your girlfriend...

142
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,680
Miss Ga! Polite enough?

143
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,240
Faidam!

144
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,320
I'm so confused.

145
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,960
Why are you so mad?

146
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,480
I always address you as "Miss".

147
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,600
Miss Ega.

148
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,200
I wasn't vulgar. I didn't call you "Nang Eka"!

149
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,520
What do you mean I'm not polite?

150
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,360
Miss Ga! Caw! Caw! Caw!

151
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,240
Brought her here to make it official. You're too much!

152
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,240
What are you complaining about?

153
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,480
Nothing.

154
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,320
I pity his fiancee, though.

155
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,320
I don't know where she is.

156
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,440
But she doesn't even know he's cheating on her.

157
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,240
You're crying?

158
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,240
No! It's making me cry.

159
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
But I think...

160
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,360
his fiancee might not want to marry him.

161
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,800
No way.

162
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,400
Think about it.

163
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,760
Dr. Param is handsome, rich,

164
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,680
and smart.

165
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,680
Such a great family background.

166
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,400
He's so perfect.

167
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,400
It'll be stupid to reject him.

168
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,440
Stupid?!

169
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,720
Yeah! Either stupid or crazy!

170
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,040
Think about it.

171
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,080
He's that perfect!

172
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,920
No!

173
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,720
I think he looks like a squid.

174
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,280
No other expression.

175
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,000
So unattractive. Not my cup of tea.

176
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,320
But pairs well with that shameless woman, Miss Riga.

177
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,720
Oh!

178
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,720
Thanks for praising me even when you're cooking.

179
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,560
He's worried, that's why he came.

180
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,760
What do you mean, worried?

181
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,560
He thinks you can't do it.

182
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,080
Worried his girlfriend won't be able to eat?

183
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,840
Don't worry, Miss Phon.

184
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,000
Easy-peasy. It'll be like a breeze.

185
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,800
You really know how to make it?

186
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,720
We'll see.

187
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,040
Look at those moves! Whoa!

188
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,560
Here comes the food!

189
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,160
Are they look tasty?

190
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,080
Oh! It looks really good!

191
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,760
What in the world is this?!

192
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,760
Oh. This is "Soup Noh Mai" (bamboo shoot salad).

193
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,960
And this is, "Soup Ma Kue" (eggplant salad).

194
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,280
In front of you is "Soup Bak Mee" (jackfruit salad) and cicada steak.

195
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,360
Super delicious.

196
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,000
No Michelin star, but you'll see Faidam stars.

197
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,280
Please enjoy!

198
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,560
Who would eat this kind of food?!

199
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,720
Are you pulling a prank on me?

200
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,640
Miss Ga, why would you think that?!

201
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,760
I'm not pulling a prank.

202
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,320
Look, you said you wanted a "soup" and "steak", isn't that right?

203
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,640
So I did it. Doesn't the cicada steak look appetizing? Very plump.

204
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,040
Throw it away, right now!

205
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,560
You don't like it? They look so plump.

206
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,920
Look, Riga.

207
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,840
This is too much.

208
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,240
What right do you have to do this to my people?

209
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,320
It's my food.

210
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,040
It's my money.

211
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,200
If you're unhappy to eat it, then leave.

212
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
Faidam.

213
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,440
- Yes? - Put it back.

214
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,680
Right away.

215
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,000
Taew, get the rice.

216
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,120
I was waiting for that!

217
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,520
- Taew! - Yes?

218
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
Music!

219
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,960
How is it, Miss Ga? Free entertainment!

220
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,840
You couldn't eat much. Are you thirsty?

221
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,440
Thank you.

222
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,520
Faidam did it intentionally.

223
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,280
I won't let the workers hurt you.

224
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,000
Thank you for staying by my side.

225
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,360
I need to go to the restroom. I'll be right back.

226
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,680
Here.

227
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
Hey.

228
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
Riga.

229
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,720
Let's be honest.

230
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,320
You knew he already has a fiancee.

231
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,680
Why are you still messing around with him?

232
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,640
Because he doesn't have feelings for her.

233
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,920
You heard what he said.

234
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,760
I'm his girlfriend.

235
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,320
Even if you don't like me,

236
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,280
you shouldn't get in the way.

237
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,280
You should just be happy with whoever he loves.

238
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,720
One day,

239
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,680
you'll be gone.

240
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,600
Do you want him to be with someone he doesn't love?

241
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,440
Never!

242
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,080
A nobody like you can't compare to Dao.

243
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,120
Just be open-minded and accept me.

244
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,600
No matter what,

245
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,200
your daughter-in-law will be me.

246
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,160
Are you so sure

247
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:18,440
that his fiancee is prettier and better than me?

248
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,040
Because I don't think I'll lose,

249
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:31,200
unless it's because I'm not rich enough to buy myself a husband!

250
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,360
She didn't!

251
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,040
That's right! She didn't buy him!

252
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,240
I don't believe she'll come empty-handed.

253
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,640
She must bring some money with her.

254
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
And so?

255
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,240
So what if I want a rich daughter-in-law?!

256
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,520
If you don't have as much,

257
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,480
then you know you won't make it this far.

258
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,320
Is this your way of telling me

259
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,920
you sold off your son to that woman?

260
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,520
Because appears she got him with money.

261
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,800
I'll tell you right here right now,

262
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,480
I won't ever let him stay with that kind of woman!

263
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,120
Excuse me.

264
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,200
I think your mom likes her future daughter-in-law quite a lot.

265
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,640
That's why I hired you.

266
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,760
Though I wasn't acting, I was true to my feelings.

267
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,160
Riga!

268
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
We talked about this.

269
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,360
It's only an act.

270
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,160
I know.

271
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,760
Do you watch dramas where the male protagonist

272
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,480
hires the female protagonist to act as his fake partner?

273
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,720
At the end, they get together. The happy ending.

274
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,520
I do believe that the ending to our story will be just like that.

275
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,520
Am I asking for trouble?

276
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,720
Oh?

277
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,680
Madam.

278
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,880
Why are you still here?

279
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,520
Go take shower and rest.

280
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,240
You'll feel much better.

281
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,800
Not yet. I'm waiting for Param.

282
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,000
- Faidam. - Yes?

283
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,280
If I have that Riga as my daughter-in-law.

284
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,080
My soul won't rest in peace.

285
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,280
Is it because she's not rich, Madam?

286
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,040
Because she's rude!

287
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,000
Insolent!

288
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Acting all high and mighty!

289
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,320
Not humble at all!

290
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,800
Exactly, Madam!

291
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,720
I agree with you!

292
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,720
Not humble at all.

293
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,080
Acting all...

294
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,400
Hey. Did you see? When she saw the dishes you served...

295
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,640
She faked the screaming and yelling!

296
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,920
What do you know...

297
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,760
She might be eating fermented fish when she's by herself.

298
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,520
- Stuffing herself. - That's right, Madam!

299
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,000
My thoughts exactly!

300
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,680
Go at it with bare hands!

301
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,160
Yet, pretends to be screaming and yelling.

302
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,360
- Fermented fish... - Mom, you're still here.

303
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,680
Param. I don't know what you’re thinking.

304
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,640
But I'll say this.

305
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,080
I will not lose a daughter-in-law like Dao, ever!

306
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,640
I didn't bump into it!

307
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
Ouch!

308
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,160
If you really want to marry Riga, just call off the engagement.

309
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,400
So I can drop my crazy act!

310
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,080
Oh. Not sleepy?

311
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,280
Grandma.

312
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,640
Not really.

313
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Thinking out Phon?

314
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,880
Yes.

315
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,080
But...

316
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,080
Also thinking about Dao.

317
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,240
Why?

318
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,360
What's wrong?

319
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,280
Isn't it strange?

320
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,000
I found her notebook at Doctor's house.

321
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,440
When you called Auntie,

322
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,440
we also heard someone who sounds like Dao.

323
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,280
I agree.

324
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,520
But I need to clear up my schedule.

325
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,680
Grandma.

326
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,880
Let's go to Bangkok.

327
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,920
Don't wait for my mom and dad.

328
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,760
Shoot! I'm screwed!

329
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
Who was that?

330
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,760
She saw us and jumped into the house instead of opening the gate.

331
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,720
Hey baby.

332
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,040
Why did you let me by your love.

333
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,120
Because I don't know how to spell Nadech.

334
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,320
But I can spell Buab, Buab, Buab.

335
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,560
How cute!

336
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,000
- Hey! - Hey!

337
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,240
Where are you going?

338
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,280
- Faidam! - Wait! Wait! Wait!

339
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,120
Where are you going, Faidam?

340
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
Go home! That way!

341
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,480
- Go back! Over there! - Please, let me go.

342
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,360
No! Get out! Right now!

343
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,480
- Taew! - What?

344
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,880
- Hold him! - Okay!

345
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,280
Not like that!

346
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,280
Like this!

347
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,320
- Hug? - Yeah!

348
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,720
- Faidam! - Now!

349
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,440
Taew!

350
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,640
Let go!

351
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,040
Taew!

352
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,240
Why did you hold me back?!

353
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,360
She told me to!

354
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,040
Why do you listen to her orders?!

355
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,520
I panicked.

356
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,880
- Buab! Buab! - What now?!

357
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,480
She went into the house!

358
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,120
It's okay. I'll handle it!

359
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,760
I'll show what I can do!

360
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,480
Buab!

361
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,840
Faidam!

362
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,200
You should told me in advance that you're here to see me.

363
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,840
Otherwise, I would welcome you with some tasty food.

364
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,760
We're like family. No need to be so distant.

365
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,920
I just hire a new cook.

366
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,480
- Oh? - She's the real deal!

367
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,960
Since my grandchild will marry your son,

368
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,200
I'll be coming here more often.

369
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,760
- I'll get to taste her cooking. - Yes.

370
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,720
Pisamorn.

371
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,720
When I called you,

372
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,440
who answered the phone?

373
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,840
Doesn't sound familiar.

374
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,280
That was Faidam.

375
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,120
My new cook.

376
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,720
- Faidam. - Faidam.

377
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,880
Phon!

378
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,680
Thank you, girl.

379
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,960
Hello Grandma.

380
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,800
Faidam came from somewhere in Ubon Ratchathani.

381
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,120
But... you don't know her?

382
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,280
I don't know.

383
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,640
She has a big mole, just like her name.

384
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,560
She seems a bit weird.

385
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:25,080
If you meet her, she'll surely leave an impression on you.

386
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,920
Now, I want to meet her.

387
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,440
Can you call for her?

388
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,600
Of course.

389
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,160
Faidam!

390
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,440
Faidam!

391
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,160
No answer.

392
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,440
Phon, can you get her for me?

393
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,280
Okay.

394
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,440
- So fast! Stop now! - Buab.

395
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,960
Where are you going? You're fast!

396
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,600
Do you know who Michael Phelps is?!

397
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,400
- He's a swimmer! - Really?

398
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,120
- Swim, swim... - You're going the wrong way!

399
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,160
Back off!

400
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,480
Then, Michael Jordan!

401
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,560
- He's a basketball player! - Basketball?

402
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,760
No dunking! Stay there!

403
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,800
Any runner named Michael?

404
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,080
There's Usain Bolt.

405
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,440
Usain Bolt!

406
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,840
Jeez! Buab!

407
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,320
Why are you stopping me?! Let me see Mr. Wat!

408
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,920
- Please. - Stop! Stay where you are!

409
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,040
Look! Don't use Mr. Wat as an excuse!

410
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,360
You think you can fool me?

411
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,960
- Let me tell you, Michael. - Which Michael now?

412
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Michael Buab, then!

413
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,880
This Michael Buab won't let anyone sneak into the house!

414
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,440
Go back the way you came! Take the exit!

415
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
Tired?

416
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,360
Good.

417
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,680
- Buab. - What?

418
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,360
Do you know?

419
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,400
What?

420
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,840
- Do you know? - What is it?

421
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,120
- That one. - Who?

422
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,120
- That one... you know?

423
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,200
That one, that one!

424
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,160
That one!

425
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,080
Hey! Hey!

426
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,480
Man! What a cheap trick!

427
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,080
And that got me fooled?!

428
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,040
Fine! I'm coming for you. Faidam! I'm coming for you!

429
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,320
I can't find them.

430
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,240
Both of them. I don't know where they went.

431
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,360
These two...

432
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,960
Procrastinating.

433
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,400
Too bad I won't get to see her.

434
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,720
It's just a trick...

435
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,000
Faidam!

436
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,360
Buab!

437
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,640
Where are you going?!

438
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,640
Let me go!

439
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,720
Where are you going?!

440
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,480
Where are you going?

441
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,280
Buab!

442
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,320
- Come here! - Ah!

443
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,200
Buab! What are you doing?!

444
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,480
I got you now!

445
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,640
- What is it, Buab? - What's with all the noises?

446
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
What is that?!

447
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,640
Just a trespasser!

448
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,720
Huh?!

449
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,640
Buab! Be gentle! You're killing them!

450
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,360
It's alright! I got this!

451
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,240
My dad taught me well!

452
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,240
What's his job?

453
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,480
Mortician.

454
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,960
Are you crazy?!

455
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,560
I'm not a corpse!

456
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,360
Faidam!

457
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,960
Phon.

458
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,200
Try checking next door.

459
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,360
Maybe those two are chatting away with Buab.

460
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,480
Sure.

461
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Phon.

462
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,680
Grandma.

463
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,720
- Yes? - Where are you staying?

464
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,880
I could arrange for you to stay here.

465
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,440
That's okay.

466
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,760
I'll stay with Angkab.

467
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,560
Pisamorn.

468
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,680
How is Param?

469
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,160
Is he upset?

470
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,080
About that time Dao stood him up.

471
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,320
Not at all, Grandma.

472
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,360
He's very understanding.

473
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,120
He knows that as a woman, she'll need a bit more time.

474
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,280
I see.

475
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,080
By the way,

476
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
Dao...

477
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,720
didn't get kidnap, did she?

478
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,560
No!

479
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,960
She didn't!

480
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,760
Angkab even told me she often visit her.

481
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,640
That's great!

482
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,440
When you see Angkab, could you tell her that

483
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,360
when Dao is there, she can ring me up.

484
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,400
I'll take Param there ASAP!

485
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,760
- Sure. - I want to give her a surprise.

486
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,920
For a chat.

487
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,960
Nice.

488
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,400
- Smart, aren't I? - You are.

489
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,800
Thank you for understanding.

490
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,720
Of course, Grandma.

491
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,480
Phon.

492
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,080
Please stop sulking.

493
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,080
I was just upset at Dao

494
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,560
for rejecting Doctor.

495
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,400
I wasn't thinking when I called her foolish.

496
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,440
You sympathize with Doctor.

497
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,640
But not your own sister?

498
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,640
Phon

499
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,000
You can see it, right? Doctor is a good guy.

500
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,080
Yes.

501
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,560
Phon.

502
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
Am I wrong?

503
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,000
For wanting my sister to marry someone good?

504
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,720
Thanks.

505
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,040
If your grandma storms in this often,

506
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,920
your secret will be out in no time.

507
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,560
I know!

508
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,880
What should I do?

509
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,000
You've got to finish what you started.

510
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,680
Why does she have such privilege?

511
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,440
- Dude! Wat! - What?

512
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,640
Miss Phon and Brother Oab are here!

513
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,600
- Buab. - Yes?

514
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,560
- Was Faidam here? - Phon, what's that matter?

515
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,840
I'm looking for Faidam.

516
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,520
I wonder if she came by.

517
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,440
- Oh, She... - Buab.

518
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,120
She didn't. I haven't seen her today.

519
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,280
- But... - What?!

520
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,520
Faidam is...

521
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,640
What? Don't you have some work to do?

522
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,320
You can go back to your job now, Buab.

523
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,280
Yes, Madam.

524
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,880
It's alright, Auntie Nee.

525
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,120
I guess she probably went to the market.

526
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,160
If she comes over, I'll let her know

527
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,560
that you're look for her.

528
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,080
- Thank you. - No problem.

529
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,640
- I'll leave now. - Okay, bye.

530
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,800
- Goodbye. - Bye.

531
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,240
That was close.

532
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,040
Doctor.

533
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,680
Yesterday, something foul went into my mouth.

534
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,080
What did you do?

535
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,120
Well, I want your help to fix my foul mouth.

536
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,400
Have you tried oral disinfectant?

537
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,280
Not yet.

538
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,960
Because...

539
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,080
I want you...

540
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,320
to inspect it for me.

541
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,640
How about this,

542
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,320
I'll send you to the dentist.

543
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,680
Let them inspect, and we'll take it from there.

544
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,880
I'll do as you say.

545
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,240
But...

546
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,840
Please write down the number.

547
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,160
So I get the right person.

548
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,760
Right. I'll let the nurse handle it.

549
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,640
Follow instructions, alright?

550
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,360
Thank you, Doctor.

551
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,520
- He said to write down the number. - Yes.

552
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,840
Awesome!

553
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,640
What's taking so long?

554
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,480
Has she already swallowed him whole?

555
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,880
Eclair!

556
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,080
How did it go? Isn't he charming, like I told you?

557
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,600
Charming! Handsome!

558
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,760
- I want some of that! - I know right?!

559
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,600
And here...

560
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,680
Don't tell me...

561
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,760
Of course. His number!

562
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,200
You work fast!

563
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,640
- I can't. I have to give him a call. - Go for it.

564
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,440
He'll be mine.

565
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,000
Hey! Why are you calling me?

566
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,640
Why on earth?!

567
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,680
I gave this number to him long time ago! Bummer.

568
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,760
Did he trick you, girl?!

569
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,640
Yes, Mom.

570
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,360
Where did she go?

571
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,080
Taew.

572
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,320
Where is Faidam?

573
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,040
Faidam isn't home?

574
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,200
I thought she went to the market.

575
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,880
But if she did, she must be home by now.

576
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Well, Taew?

577
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,760
Well, Taew?

578
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,240
Well, Taew?

579
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,960
Enough!

580
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,240
I really don't know!

581
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,920
I saw her this morning.

582
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,240
But she was gone by the time I got back from shopping.

583
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,360
How could she disappear?!

584
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,440
Procrastinating again.

585
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,040
It's not like that.

586
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,520
She's not from here.

587
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,080
Maybe she got lost?

588
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,000
And couldn't find her way back.

589
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,840
That clumsy girl.

590
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,800
How is she going to find her way home?!

591
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,840
Faidam, did you cause another problem?

592
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,880
- Hello, Grandma. - Hello.

593
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,640
- Hello, Auntie. - Hello, Mr. Oab.

594
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,920
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

595
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,240
I could have prepared room.

596
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,760
What have you go there? You've got your hands full.

597
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,440
Just food and stuff.

598
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,800
We stopped by the mall and got some for you.

599
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,120
Thank you.

600
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,920
Still as clean as ever.

601
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,120
Look at how shiny it is.

602
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,520
I simply follow your orders.

603
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,760
How long will you be staying?

604
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,360
Until we see Dao.

605
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,360
Where is Dao, Angkab?

606
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,360
- Dao. - Yeah?

607
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,360
If Grandma Pathum knows you're hiding here, she'll definitely rip me apart!

608
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,440
The thought gives me the chills.

609
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,400
I can't see anything.

610
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,120
Do you think they left?

611
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,360
I don't know.

612
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,320
I can't see if the car's gone.

613
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,920
Wat.

614
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,040
- Can you lend me hand? - Nope.

615
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,320
Wat.

616
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,320
- Can you lend me hand? - No!

617
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,360
Wat!

618
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,800
Please help me! My good friend!

619
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,680
I beg you!

620
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,360
God! You're a nightmare!

621
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,440
- Please help me! - Hey!

622
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,680
If your grandma sees me

623
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,760
and knows I'm Doctor's neighbor,

624
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,560
she'll figure it out.

625
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,000
We'll be caught.

626
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,240
I'm asking you a small favor.

627
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,640
- How long have we been friends? - Is that relevant?

628
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:48,760
Wait. If your grandma and Oab stay a night at Madam Pisamorn's house,

629
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,560
what will you do?

630
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,360
I have no idea.

631
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,280
So?

632
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,960
Where is Dao?

633
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,560
I really don't know.

634
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,520
When she came over or stopped by,

635
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,360
she wouldn't tell me where she is.

636
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,840
I don't believe that you really don't know.

637
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,240
Why are you saying that?

638
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,360
Isn't it too much of a coincident?

639
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,360
Ever since she was forced to get married, she never came home.

640
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,040
But she came looking for you.

641
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,000
What did you say?

642
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,040
She was forced to get married?

643
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,600
I forced her to.

644
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,360
Why?

645
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,960
Just leave it. Don't ask me.

646
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,080
Right now, I want to know where Dao is.

647
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,240
Huh?

648
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,400
There's no point in covering for her, Auntie.

649
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,600
If you know something,

650
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,920
let me know.

651
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,560
I can help.

652
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,000
Mr. Oab, I know nothing.

653
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,840
But if she escapes her marriage.

654
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,800
She must have her own reasons.

655
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,440
What reasons?

656
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,680
Well...

657
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,400
Miss Dao is a drug addict.

658
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,880
What?!

659
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,360
She's a drug addict?!

660
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,320
Yes.

661
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,760
- Dao! - Hmm?

662
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,600
Honestly, are you out of your mind?

663
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,160
Don't you realize we are acting like lunatics.

664
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,640
- Remind me again why I'm friends with you. - Shhh!

665
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,760
What?!

666
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,240
- Look. - What?! They haven’t left?

667
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,760
Dao! I think they're staying the night.

668
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,880
You're screwed.

669
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,640
Both of them already left.

670
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,200
Then, what are you standing around for? Get down!

671
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,400
Oab's car is gone.

672
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,600
- But Doctor's car is here! - Shoot!

673
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,960
He's back?!

674
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,960
I'm dead meat!

675
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,560
I left for too long.

676
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,760
That idiot doctor is going to give me hell.

677
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,360
What should I do?

678
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,840
Hey. This is not looking good.

679
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,520
It's this late and still no signs of her.

680
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,920
Something might have happened.

681
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,320
I'll call the cops.

682
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,800
Mom.

683
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,400
- I think... - Hello.

684
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,920
I have an emergency.

685
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,200
Yes.

686
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,720
There's a missing person.

687
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,360
Well, since morning.

688
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,040
What?!

689
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,720
I have to wait for 24 hours before I could report a missing person?!

690
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,320
A person is missing?!

691
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,040
What if something happened?!

692
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,920
By the time we find her,

693
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,200
she might...

694
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,760
I don't want to say this, but she might be dead.

695
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,360
If tomorrow comes and she's still missing,

696
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,320
I'll see you at the police station.

697
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,400
Ridiculous?!

698
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,440
Someone is missing, but we have to wait for 24 hours.

699
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,760
If something happened, it'll be too late.

700
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,200
If you were out for some fun,

701
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,880
you're dead.

702
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,240
Doctor.

703
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,520
Don't be so pessimistic.

704
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Madam!

705
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,840
- I'm sorry. - What is it?!

706
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,600
Faidam is back!

707
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,920
All of them are waiting.

708
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,360
Where did you go, Faidam?

709
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,440
Who's that?

710
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,480
Taew. Faidam.

711
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,200
- Open the door. - Doctor.

712
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,400
Okay. Okay.

713
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,000
(Next Episode.)

714
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,160
Your hair...

715
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,080
Boo!
