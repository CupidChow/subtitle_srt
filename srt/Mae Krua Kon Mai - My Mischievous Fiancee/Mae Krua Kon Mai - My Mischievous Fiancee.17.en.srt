1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,840
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,560
Do you know where

3
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,000
my troublesome sister is?

4
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,240
Next door.

5
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,360
Can you go get her?

6
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,360
Go call Faidam for me.

7
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,800
The mole.

8
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,880
Is it real or is it dog's flea?

9
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
Buab baby!

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes, baby?

11
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,520
Why did you do that to him?

12
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,680
And I trusted you!

13
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,120
This is a misunderstanding!

14
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,720
Look! He's having a seizure.

15
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,640
Buab is having a seizure, please help him!

16
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,040
It's Faidam's scheme.

17
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,560
To avoid meeting you.

18
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,000
If she's not coming,

19
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,120
I'll go to her.

20
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,120
Oh, Mr. Oab.

21
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
But I think

22
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,680
you should head back and wait at home.

23
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,520
You are a guest after all.

24
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,800
That's alright, Taew.

25
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,280
In case I can be of help.

26
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,120
Yes.

27
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,560
- Let's go. - Yes.

28
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,480
What's going on?

29
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,320
- Taew said Buab is having a seizure. - Huh?

30
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,800
I'm going to check on him.

31
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,920
Please hurry up before Buab dies, Doctor.

32
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,960
Hurry, Doctor.

33
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,960
Buab is going to be fine.

34
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,160
Let's talk, Wat.

35
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,520
I have work.

36
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,520
Stop.

37
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
Drop the act.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,440
Buab!

39
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,320
Doctor, this way!

40
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,160
- Hurry up, Doctor! - He's still breathing.

41
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,320
Buab!

42
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,160
Hey, Buab!

43
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,440
Buab baby, I am here.

44
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,280
Oh, Buab.

45
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
Taew, move aside

46
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,920
so I can help him.

47
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,080
I refuse!

48
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,840
If anything were to happen to him

49
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,280
he must die in my arms.

50
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,240
Buab!

51
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,560
He's fine.

52
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
He's just sleeping.

53
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,200
Buab, baby.

54
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,960
Buab.

55
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,160
Hey!

56
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,440
Buab's awake.

57
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
Oh.

58
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,880
Is it nighttime already?

59
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,600
I can't see anything.

60
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,920
Buab.

61
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,680
I'm sorry, I'll never kick you again.

62
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,480
Taew, baby.

63
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Yes?

64
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,360
I love you more than anything, Taew.

65
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
Oh, Buab!

66
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,720
Buab is dead!

67
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
Doctor.

68
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,560
If Buab isn't dead yet...

69
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,720
then both of them have gone insane, right?

70
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,280
I'm not sure.

71
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,800
We'll have to test him out.

72
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,320
Buab.

73
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,160
Buab.

74
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,120
- What is this? - A shirt, Doctor.

75
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,120
- What is it for? - For wearing.

76
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,480
Buab.

77
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,560
What's this?

78
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,600
- A watch. - What is it used for?

79
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,720
For pawning.

80
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,800
What about this?

81
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,160
- What is this? - Money.

82
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,280
What is it used for?

83
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,760
To give to the ladies.

84
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,920
Ladies? To give to the ladies?!

85
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,320
Get up!

86
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,720
Everything’s worked out.

87
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,960
Let's return home.

88
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,440
What are you standing for?

89
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,280
Return home.

90
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,320
Taew!

91
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,680
Doctor!

92
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,680
Please don't recognize me, Oab.

93
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,840
Hey, what's with you?

94
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
You see...

95
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
I...

96
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,320
I am very cold, Doctor.

97
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
Cold?

98
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,480
Body heat for your body

99
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,760
so you won't feel cold.

100
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
Hey!

101
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,760
Are you still cold?

102
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,720
Do you feel better?

103
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,880
Hey!

104
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,160
Stop it this instant!

105
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,360
What are you guys playing, Param?

106
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Hey!

107
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,080
You too, Faidam.

108
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,880
What are you doing?

109
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,120
Mom.

110
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,520
What about Oab?

111
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,760
Oab came to say goodbye

112
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,160
and left immediately.

113
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,200
I don't know where he's rushing off to.

114
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,960
God truly exists.

115
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,840
Well?

116
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,160
Huh? Are you no longer cold?

117
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Well...

118
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,440
I feel hot and cold, Madam.

119
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,000
Hot and cold?

120
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,600
Or are you scared?

121
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,800
What are you guys playing around for?

122
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Let's go.

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Scared?

124
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,760
What are you onto?

125
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,400
Give it to me.

126
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,520
No need to hide from me.

127
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,840
Now tell me

128
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,120
what's going on?

129
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,720
Brother Oab, I didn't mean it.

130
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,720
No need to call me older brother, you're older than I am.

131
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,440
You keep changing major that you became my junior.

132
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,120
You don't need to mention that.

133
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,720
There are many successful peeps who took eight years to graduate.

134
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,360
Everything was a lie, right?

135
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,400
You see...

136
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,760
I just wanted to help Dao.

137
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,160
But from now on...

138
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,240
you must help me.

139
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,120
About helping,

140
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,040
I think...

141
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
What?

142
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,520
Are you going to cooperate with me?

143
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,600
- Yes. - Louder.

144
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,520
Yes, I'll cooperate with you.

145
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
That's all.

146
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
Come.

147
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
Taew.

148
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,040
You think

149
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,720
I...

150
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,120
and Buab

151
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,840
are secretly dating?

152
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,560
What are you laughing about?

153
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,200
Are you crazy?

154
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,240
Why would I think that?

155
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Then this afternoon,

156
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,040
why did you kick Buab like that?

157
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,880
It was a plan that Buab and I came up with.

158
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,920
In case you got in trouble,

159
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,520
this is how we will help.

160
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,280
Fine, you guys were real smooth.

161
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,160
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

162
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,240
It wouldn't look natural otherwise.

163
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Yeah.

164
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,840
Buab is so nice.

165
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,000
He listens to your every command.

166
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,160
Well...

167
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,320
Buab and I...

168
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,400
are soul mates.

169
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,760
Oh.

170
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,000
Hey, how do you know that?

171
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,440
This is top secret.

172
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,120
- Yeah. - I'll only tell you.

173
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,640
What is that?

174
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,920
I had fortune telling.

175
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,000
If you want to know

176
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,040
whether you and your partner are soul mates.

177
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,720
You just need to add up your birthdays.

178
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,240
Or calculate by your ID card.

179
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,800
Add them up and you'll get your fortune told.

180
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,280
Here, take a look.

181
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,880
It's accurate.

182
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,200
- No. - It's accurate.

183
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,280
No, keep it for yourself.

184
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,000
Then I'll put it over there.

185
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,080
In case you want to check it out.

186
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,880
Sure.

187
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,160
I'll go take a shower first.

188
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,760
And help with your makeup later.

189
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
Sure.

190
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,080
Get going.

191
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Hey!

192
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,720
I saw you peeking.

193
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,840
Yeah, yeah, just go take a shower.

194
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,440
Check your soul mate?

195
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,720
Nonsense.

196
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,600
I better dress up and go to Wat.

197
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
Hey!

198
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,400
Where have you been, Watsy?

199
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,760
What are doing, Dao?

200
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,720
You scared me, I already feel uneasy as is.

201
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
I'm sorry.

202
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,480
What's wrong?

203
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,480
I...

204
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,680
It's nothing.

205
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
Hold up.

206
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,960
You don't have a problem, but I do.

207
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,000
Did you know? I almost met with Oab today.

208
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,800
This time Doctor

209
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,720
intended to drag me to go see Oab.

210
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,720
But they didn't get me this time.

211
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,240
Aren't you curious as to why

212
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,000
he wanted you to meet with Oab?

213
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,960
Probably another one of his pranks.

214
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,240
But I think it's weird

215
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,520
that he wanted you to meet with Oab.

216
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,880
Dao.

217
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,080
I think you'd better stop.

218
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,800
And go back to Lomdao.

219
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,040
Don't wait until they catch you.

220
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,080
No.

221
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,240
I will not stop until I find evidence

222
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,960
that Dr. Param is going to be broke.

223
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,680
He has a girlfriend but deceive me to pay off his debt.

224
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,120
Up to you then.

225
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,360
I just don't want you to get caught

226
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,880
and end up looking like a fool.

227
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,280
What's with you?

228
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,720
Suddenly telling me to stop disguising myself.

229
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,720
I'm scared you'll screw up.

230
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,440
Oh!

231
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,640
Doctor!

232
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,000
- Where did you go? - Where go did you.

233
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,760
No need to play on word.

234
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,720
I said where did you go?

235
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,760
Oh!

236
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,280
I was just...

237
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,560
strolling around here, Doctor.

238
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,960
The weather is a little hot.

239
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,640
I saw you were talking to Mr. Songsawat.

240
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,160
Oh!

241
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,960
It's nothing, Doctor.

242
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,320
We were just saying hi.

243
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,240
Because I was out strolling

244
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,600
Mr. Wat was opening his gate

245
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,800
so we just greeted each other

246
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,960
like how a friendly person should be.

247
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,160
"Hello, Faidam."

248
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,120
"Hello, Mr. Wat."

249
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,560
Like this.

250
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,600
Did you take me for a fool?

251
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,600
I saw the way you talk to Mr. Songsawat.

252
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,080
It's closer than how a boss and his employee should be.

253
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,320
Yes.

254
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
Because...

255
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,480
Mr. Wat

256
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,800
isn't an arrogant person.

257
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,520
Like...

258
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,240
Like me, right?

259
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,320
I am not affected by what you said.

260
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,160
And I don't believe

261
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,280
that you're just an ordinary cook.

262
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,400
You're right, Doctor.

263
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,960
I am not an ordinary cook.

264
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,080
I am a special cook.

265
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,200
I put special care in food

266
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,360
but you can put special care in me.

267
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,960
I also want to know

268
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,280
how special you are.

269
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
Doctor!

270
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,200
What are you doing, Doctor?

271
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,040
Doctor, please don’t!

272
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,680
Doctor, please don’t!

273
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,000
Doctor!

274
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,840
Doctor!

275
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,880
You'd better catch me

276
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,400
if you think you're so smart.

277
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,840
Why does he always stare at me?

278
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,480
He came all the way here

279
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,520
but didn't even try to make up with me.

280
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,360
What's it going to be?

281
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,600
Should I call him and clear things up?

282
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,960
(Oab)

283
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,800
But if I call him,

284
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,520
I'll lose.

285
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,480
No way, I won't call.

286
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,560
Don't want him to get cocky.

287
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,200
Do not worry, Grandma.

288
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,440
There's no way Dao can win against us.

289
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,640
Why?

290
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,360
Because

291
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,960
I made Dao's best friend joined our side.

292
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,440
Really?

293
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,920
If that's the case

294
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,640
from now on whatever Dao does

295
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,440
we will know, right?

296
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,760
Yes, Mom.

297
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
Oh.

298
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
Where's dad?

299
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,040
I need to consult him about something.

300
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,640
Outside.

301
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,920
He went drinking with his friends.

302
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
Stop!

303
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,800
Stop your car!

304
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,160
Stop your car!

305
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,360
Stop your car!

306
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,560
Stop!

307
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,120
Stop your car now.

308
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
Hello.

309
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,280
Hello.

310
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,240
What's the matter, officer?

311
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,080
Why are you driving so fast?

312
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,160
It's dangerous.

313
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,840
Do you not see the sign?

314
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,240
Yeah, the sign.

315
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,440
Because I saw the sign

316
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,640
that's why I drive fast.

317
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,320
The sign says I have to drive fast.

318
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,560
Look again.

319
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,080
It says "drive slowly, dangerous"

320
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,280
Exactly.

321
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,760
It's dangerous to drive slowly

322
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,480
so I had to drive fast.

323
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,680
What should we do?

324
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,880
Do whatever you want.

325
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,560
I need to go home and get lectured.

326
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,840
It's already 2 am.

327
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,640
Who would give lecture right now?

328
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,840
Oh, officer. You're clueless.

329
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,400
At 2 am when I get home,

330
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,960
my wife will certainly give me lecture.

331
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,400
- Let's put it this way. - Yes.

332
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,760
I'll give you a lecture

333
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,920
at the police station.

334
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,200
At the police station?

335
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,240
Yes.

336
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,560
Where did my friend go?

337
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,200
He went to sleep.

338
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,320
Yes.

339
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,120
- Go to the police station? -Yes.

340
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,800
- What for? - For a lecture.

341
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,160
Still not home yet.

342
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,880
Just you wait.

343
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,160
When you get back,

344
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,240
I'll split your head open.

345
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,760
Must be a creep.

346
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,240
Yours is too tiny,

347
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,520
I thought it was a needle.

348
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,880
Excuse me.

349
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,680
Whether it's big or small, it can wait.

350
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,000
Mr. Ratt is being detained at the police station

351
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,520
for drinking and driving.

352
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,920
Huh?

353
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,480
What? At the police station?

354
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,200
Yes. Thank you so much, officer.

355
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,880
I'll head there immediately.

356
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,560
Who called this late?

357
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,640
What's the matter?

358
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,440
The police called.

359
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,520
Ratt got arrested for drinking and driving.

360
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,040
I'm on my way there.

361
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,040
No need.

362
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,960
For acting like a fool

363
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,880
let him return by himself.

364
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,440
I'll discipline him.

365
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,160
This is drinking and driving.

366
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,280
I'm no longer drunk.

367
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,920
Oh, inspector.

368
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,840
- I'm Major Police Sergeant. - Oh, Major Police Sergeant.

369
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,040
Why did you let my friend go home?

370
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,000
Because he didn't drive, only sat.

371
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,320
Oh, he didn't drive.

372
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,720
Then can I go sit and wait outside?

373
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,640
If no one comes to bail you out tonight,

374
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,960
you'll have to sleep in there.

375
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,240
We'll send your case to court tomorrow.

376
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,720
I promise I won't get drunk anymore.

377
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,840
Oh...

378
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,840
Director can you call...

379
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,440
Major Police Sergeant.

380
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,680
Major Police, did you call my wife yet?

381
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,640
I did just now.

382
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
Oh.

383
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,960
Then being in here is safer for me

384
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,600
when she's here, I'll be safer in here.

385
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,720
Yes, may you be happy in there.

386
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,240
- Thank you, Major Police Sergeant. - Yes.

387
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,960
I'll be in here.

388
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,200
When you arrived, I'll be safe in here.

389
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,920
Police Major Sergeant!

390
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,600
Finally, I got it.

391
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,280
Abracadabra!

392
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,920
I hope I'll get evidence for Grandma.

393
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,600
So she can finally know that

394
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,080
this family is only after our money.

395
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,200
Doctor.

396
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,960
What are you looking at me for?

397
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
Look?

398
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,160
Why would I look at you?

399
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,160
You're over thinking it.

400
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,000
Or did you do something wrong?

401
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,960
So you're scared of being looked at.

402
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,240
Doctor.

403
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,720
A person like me

404
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,080
doesn't have a hidden motive at all.

405
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,400
I'm fully innocent.

406
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,200
Then there's no need to be afraid.

407
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,240
You're so shady.

408
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
Am I shady?

409
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,960
He was obviously looking

410
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,080
but still denies it.

411
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,000
What an attention seeker.

412
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,600
But did he see anything just now?

413
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,720
Faidam.

414
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,720
Yes, Madam?

415
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,720
Did you buy potatoes?

416
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,760
No, I didn't.

417
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,560
Why didn't you buy?

418
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,680
I want to eat Massaman curry.

419
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,360
Why didn't you buy the potatoes?

420
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,840
How can you cook it then?

421
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,880
I didn't buy.

422
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,960
But I got them for free.

423
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,680
Hurry up and cook it.

424
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,440
Oh.

425
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,240
She's not happy about getting free stuff?

426
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,920
What's wrong with her?

427
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,320
Madam.

428
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,480
What's wrong, Madam?

429
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,120
You look worried.

430
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,000
I am worried.

431
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,480
Oab said,

432
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,280
the reason that Dao doesn't come home

433
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,720
is because she doesn't want to marry Param.

434
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,720
Do you still want them to marry?

435
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,600
Why are you so intent on

436
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,560
having Miss Dao as a daughter-in-law?

437
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,040
You wouldn't understand.

438
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
But...

439
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,240
but I heard that

440
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,600
the reason you want

441
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,240
Dr. Param to marry Miss Dao

442
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,000
is because she's rich, am I right?

443
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,200
What are you guys talking about?

444
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,240
Oh.

445
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,160
I was talking to Faidam about how worried I am

446
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
that the reason Dao doesn't come home

447
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,160
is because she doesn't want to marry Param.

448
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
Auntie,

449
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,640
you need to take it easy.

450
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,760
Don't over think it.

451
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,160
I didn't want to but I can't help it.

452
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,160
Tell you what,

453
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,000
do you want to go meditate at the temple?

454
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,120
I saw on the television that meditation

455
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,040
will help calm your mind.

456
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,880
- Sounds good? - Yes.

457
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,160
By the way,

458
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,280
are you free?

459
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,760
I see you looking down these days.

460
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,800
I also want to go

461
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,520
but I have class to teach.

462
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,680
Otherwise I would've gone with you.

463
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,560
Then I'll invite some friends to go with me.

464
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,640
Yes.

465
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,360
Madam...

466
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,120
I shouldn't have missed.

467
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,520
What's wrong with Miss Phon?

468
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,320
Miss Phon.

469
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,360
What's wrong? You're not smiling much.

470
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,160
I have some stuff on my mind.

471
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
What is it about?

472
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,240
Is it about Mr. Oab?

473
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,200
Oab?

474
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,640
What has Oab got anything to do with me?

475
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,080
Are you guys having a fight?

476
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
Yeah.

477
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,040
Usually, he will come directly to my house.

478
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,800
Or call endlessly.

479
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,000
But now, he came here

480
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,120
but didn't try to make up with me.

481
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,200
Perhaps he has changed his mind.

482
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,000
No way, Miss Phon.

483
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,960
I think

484
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,240
Mr. Oab will not change his mind from you.

485
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,280
You sure know so well.

486
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,680
If you don't believe me

487
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,720
do you want to try having your fortune told?

488
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,800
- Huh? - How about it?

489
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,840
Faidam,

490
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,080
not only you're a cook

491
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,040
you're also a fortune teller?

492
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,280
You're wrong, Miss Phon.

493
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,320
Taew has a fortune telling book

494
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,840
that can predict your soul mate.

495
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,960
Would you like to try, Miss Phon?

496
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,880
Hey.

497
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,000
It's alright.

498
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,120
Since he doesn't care about me

499
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,960
why should I care about him, right?

500
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,880
Wait here, I'll be right back.

501
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,480
Faidam, you don't have to do.

502
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,560
Just wait here, you don't need to say anything.

503
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,400
I'll be right back, wait here.

504
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,840
If it's really accurate

505
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,640
then please let Oab be Miss Phon's soul mate.

506
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,160
Amen.

507
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
Miss Phon.

508
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
Oh.

509
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Miss Phon.

510
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,720
Miss Phon.

511
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,520
Where did she go?

512
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840
Miss Phon.

513
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,440
What a pity.

514
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
Then,

515
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,560
I'll put it right here.

516
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,640
Accurate soul mate prediction book.

517
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,280
How to predict your soul mate.

518
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,960
Use the numbers on your ID card

519
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,320
to add it all up,

520
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,320
multiply by seven

521
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,760
and divide by nine,

522
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,360
use the result to see your prediction.

523
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,480
But I don't have his ID card number.

524
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,920
Would you like me to help you look for it?

525
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,440
Faidam.

526
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,640
It's okay.

527
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,840
We're women so we have the right to choose.

528
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,640
I'll help you find

529
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,920
Mr. Oab's ID card number.

530
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,160
- Faidam... - If he's not your soul mate, you can dump him.

531
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,560
- Faidam... - I'm going to cook now.

532
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,080
- I'll get going. - Faidam, I don't think that's a good idea.

533
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
Faidam.

534
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,360
Thank you, Faidam.

535
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,480
How are you going to get

536
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,760
Mr. Oab's ID card number and his birthday?

537
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,760
Easy, I remember it by heart.

538
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,720
- You remember it by heart? - Yes.

539
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,320
It's...

540
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,480
I mean...

541
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,960
I will go asking Doctor

542
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,960
and I'll remember it then tell Miss Phon.

543
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,320
Be careful.

544
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,960
That's a knife.

545
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,760
There's no need to ask.

546
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,120
You don't need a prediction to know that

547
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,800
light-skinned, Chinese looking, and kind like Mr. Oab

548
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,600
is definitely Miss Phon's soul mate.

549
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,240
Who's calling this late at night?

550
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,520
(Lomdao)

551
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,520
Hello.

552
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,680
Hello, Oab.

553
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,880
Can I have your ID card number?

554
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,000
310...

555
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,480
989675.

556
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,600
Why do you want it?

557
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,640
Hello?

558
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,720
Hello?

559
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,640
What's she going to do with it.

560
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,200
How did you find out?

561
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,640
Miss Phon better quickly get it checked

562
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,760
and see if Mr. Oab is your soul mate.

563
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,760
I'm going to go check on Doctor

564
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,880
before I get scolded.

565
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,720
Check it quickly.

566
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,000
Where are you going, Mom?

567
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,400
I was thinking of going to

568
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,280
practice Dhamma at the temple near

569
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,480
Chachoengsao with my friends for a few days.

570
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,920
Why are you going?

571
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,880
I'm worried about how

572
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,800
Dao wouldn't come back home.

573
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,760
I'm really worried.

574
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,440
I figured meditation

575
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,040
might help me calm my mind.

576
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
Sounds good.

577
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,360
In case you'll change your mind...

578
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,960
and don't make me get married.

579
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,560
Absolutely not.

580
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
Hey.

581
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,320
Take care of the house while I'm not home.

582
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,720
- Yes. - Yes.

583
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,000
I'll drop you off, let's go.

584
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,320
Let's go.

585
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,680
Hello.

586
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,480
Where are you guys going?

587
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,440
I can go anywhere

588
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,440
that allows me to not meet

589
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,960
someone I don't want to see.

590
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,080
Would you like me to go with you

591
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,400
so I can take care of you?

592
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,520
No need, I don't want to bother you.

593
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,960
Aren't you an actress?

594
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,240
Huh? You need to go to drama sets.

595
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,080
And you're not leaving yet?

596
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,960
The set will be waiting for you.

597
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,520
I don't have any filming today.

598
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,920
So I come to visit Doctor.

599
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,040
So would you like me to go with you?

600
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,080
I already told you

601
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,200
that's there no need.

602
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,720
That's alright.

603
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,440
Since I won't be here

604
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800
then I'll...

605
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,040
look after Doctor.

606
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,080
My friend is here.

607
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,440
Faidam, Taew, take care of the house.

608
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,920
And look after Doctor for me too.

609
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,880
- Yes. - I'll send you off.

610
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,000
You two just take care of the house.

611
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,720
As for Doctor,

612
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,760
I'll look after him myself.

613
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,760
Great.

614
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,000
Watch your front, watch your back

615
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,720
watch through each other.

616
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,320
Oh.

617
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,560
What a coincidence.

618
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,160
I have some clothes in my trunk

619
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,600
prepared for going out of town.

620
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,840
But I'll wear them now

621
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,880
because I'll have to stay and look after you.

622
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
Taew.

623
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,640
Bring my clothes from my trunk

624
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,440
and put it in Doctor's room for me.

625
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,080
- Let's go inside. - Let's go.

626
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,840
What a coincidence.

627
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,640
She happens to have clothes prepared.

628
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,440
I think

629
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,160
she had it prepared everyday

630
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,960
waiting for an opportunity.

631
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,320
Yeah.

632
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,920
How do I open?

633
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,880
Close it for me, Faidam.

634
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
All done?

635
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,640
Yeah.

636
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,720
I think once Madam isn't home.

637
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,400
Miss Riga will probably

638
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,560
make herself the madam of this house.

639
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,240
How do you know?

640
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,840
When I went to put her bag away,

641
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,720
I saw how she's always in Doctor's room.

642
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,640
Perhaps they're...

643
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,840
Oh!

644
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,120
Taew.

645
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,000
I'll be right back.

646
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,040
Oh, Doctor.

647
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,600
Move.

648
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,160
Oh!

649
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,680
Oh!

650
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,840
My teeth almost broke.

651
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,760
Sorry, I told you to move.

652
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
Aha!

653
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,720
When Madam isn't home,

654
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,560
you're stealing her orange juice.

655
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,200
A good tangerine must be from Bang Mot.

656
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,640
Kimberley chooses Bang Mot tangerine.

657
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,960
Bang Mot tangerine.

658
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,720
Hey, Riga.

659
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
Stay there.

660
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,840
Don't come.

661
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,560
Oh, Doctor.

662
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,600
Why do you act as if you're afraid of me?

663
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,640
What can I do

664
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,440
if you're not willing?

665
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,880
Doctor.

666
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,440
If you're afraid of me like this

667
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,800
how will our plan work?

668
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,400
You know very well that

669
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,600
a good source of gossip comes from maids.

670
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,320
If Faidam and Taew

671
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,400
know what happened between us.

672
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,200
Your mom will accept me as her daughter-in-law

673
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,520
instead of Lomdao.

674
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,880
But we're being in a room together like this,

675
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,280
others might already think we're doing something.

676
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,080
But...

677
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,080
But you need to make it convincing

678
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,520
for this kind of role.

679
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,720
Doctor!

680
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,960
What are you doing, Doctor?

681
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,040
Don't scream, Riga.

682
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,440
Doctor, don't do this to me.

683
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,840
Stay still, I'll take care of it.

684
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,320
Hey, Doctor!

685
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,280
What are you doing?

686
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,400
Doctor!

687
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,520
Doctor, don't do this to me.

688
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,600
You won't get away with this.

689
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,440
Faidam!

690
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,200
Stay still.

691
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,480
Great, I want to see you

692
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,000
before I head off to work.

693
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,840
I...

694
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,920
Faidam.

695
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,280
I got the result from the fortune telling.

696
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,400
What is the result, Miss Phon?

697
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,120
It says...

698
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,960
we're soul mate, destiny, fated.

699
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,560
Then you don't have to worry anymore.

700
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,120
If you guys are soul mates,

701
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,960
you can't separate from each other.

702
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,960
Then I'm off to work.

703
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,520
Yes.

704
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,480
Sister-in-law.

705
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,680
Bless me, I hope I'll get a special evidence.

706
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,280
Doctor!

707
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,960
Doctor!

708
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,680
You're a pervert, Doctor!

709
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,440
You're the pervert.

710
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,160
Secretly listening to Riga and me.

711
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,000
It's not like I want to stay here.

712
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,560
I'm scared that I'll have a stye.

713
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
Doctor.

714
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,000
Can you untie me now?

715
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,360
I better not.

716
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,400
I don't trust you.

717
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,400
But I'm hungry.

718
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,920
If you don't untie me,

719
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,720
how am I supposed to eat?

720
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,520
Don't make any excuses.

721
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,920
I know that you stopped

722
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,440
eating dinner for many years.

723
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,840
But I'm hungry today, I want to eat.

724
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,920
Please?

725
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,240
Then

726
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,240
I'll tell a maid bring it to you.

727
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,880
No way.

728
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,520
If anyone sees me

729
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,080
I'll be humiliated.

730
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,800
And the maids will think we...

731
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,520
Fine.

732
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,680
Riga.

733
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,600
Go downstairs and eat

734
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,480
then come up to sleep.

735
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,520
I'll be sleeping at Mom's room.

736
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,680
Doctor.

737
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,520
Did you think you can stop me?

738
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,000
I'll make everyone

739
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,320
aware of our relationship

740
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,600
no matter what.

741
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,440
What happened to your eyes?

742
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,120
I guess I saw something grotesque.

743
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,720
That's why I have stye.

744
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,080
Where's Phon?

745
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,800
She's off to work.

746
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,680
Faidam.

747
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,720
Yes?

748
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,000
Give me boiled eggs.

749
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,320
I want two of them.

750
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,360
Huh?

751
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,920
Two boiled eggs?

752
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,400
Give me big ones.

753
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,240
Bring them to me

754
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,600
before I'm late for work.

755
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,640
Yes.

756
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,520
I made the effort to make you repent

757
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,040
so you won't do anything wild.

758
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,560
But you didn't repent nothing.

759
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,520
So?

760
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,240
Are they both worn out?

761
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,880
I don't know, but he wants boiled eggs.

762
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,320
For nourishment.

763
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,680
Also

764
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,240
not just one,

765
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,520
but he wants two.

766
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,440
Two eggs.

767
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,840
They did it hard.

768
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,920
Must be the case.

769
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,680
Miss Riga hasn't come down yet.

770
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,840
Faidam.

771
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,600
You smashed the eggs!

772
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,320
Boiled eggs, Doctor.

773
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,920
Give me some, too.

774
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,760
For me I'll have...

775
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,520
three raw eggs.

776
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,040
Three raw eggs.

777
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,480
Huh?

778
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,680
Three raw eggs?

779
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,160
What's wrong, Faidam?

780
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,200
Nothing.

781
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,280
Three eggs it is.

782
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,920
I thought the guy was bad,

783
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,520
but the woman was worse.

784
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,920
Wow, raw eggs?

785
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,960
Yes.

786
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,800
That means...

787
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,400
they went hard.

788
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,400
The bedroom must've turned into a battlefield.

789
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,920
I don't want to imagine about it.

790
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,920
You don't need to imagine

791
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,280
because today

792
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,320
is your turn to clean up Doctor's room.

793
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,360
Hey...

794
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,880
It's...

795
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,400
What's wrong, Taew?

796
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,760
I'm not available today.

797
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,040
I have a date with Buab.

798
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,760
Can you go do it for me, Faidam?

799
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,680
- Me? - Yes.

800
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,280
Please, please go do it for me.

801
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,200
I really need to go with Buab.

802
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,800
Please.

803
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,160
Then...

804
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,840
what about other house chores?

805
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,800
You...

806
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,000
can you do it instead of me, Faidam?

807
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,800
Taew!

808
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,280
Hey.

809
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,080
I still didn't agree to it.

810
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,960
The maids must be gossiping happily.

811
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,040
This might not be enough?

812
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,880
So, it'll be talk of the town.

813
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,080
Where else can the daughter-in-law title go now?

814
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,920
My clothes that you must wash.

815
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,680
You're just a maid

816
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,200
it's you job to clean them.

817
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,920
No matter how much mess I made

818
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,320
- you still need to clean them. - Stop!

819
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:55,720
(Next episode.)

820
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,040
I don't know what's wrong with Faidam.

821
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,400
Apologize to Riga.

822
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,400
No.

823
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,560
I'm not wrong.

824
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,160
Apologize to Riga now.

825
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,160
No!

826
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,560
Just go wherever you want to!
