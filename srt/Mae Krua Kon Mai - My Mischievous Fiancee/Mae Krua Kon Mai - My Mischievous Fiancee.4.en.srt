1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,840
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,840
I am a superstar.

3
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,560
I don't even have time to eat or sleep.

4
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,080
Having to wait for a third-rate designer like you

5
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,240
is a waste of my time.

6
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,880
What happened? Why is there a white smudge on you face?

7
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,960
Look.

8
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,960
If he sees it, I'm in trouble.

9
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,320
(Previously...)

10
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,000
I found this at Dr. Param's house.

11
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,520
- What's that notebook? - It's Dao's recipe book.

12
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,080
What is it doing at Dr. Param's house?

13
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,840
That's right.

14
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,080
Is there something wrong?

15
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,520
There is!

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,080
I think mom isn't suspicious yet.

17
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,320
What about?

18
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,360
About Dao's weird scheme!

19
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,320
Honey.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,760
I'm a bit deaf, I can't hear you well.

21
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,240
Dao must be up to some kind of scheme.

22
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,720
She turned off her phone.

23
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,640
In that note, she wrote about exposing Dr. Param.

24
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,120
Oh, right!

25
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,080
I think, Dao is definitely up to something.

26
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,640
- But we don't know. - What's that?

27
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,840
Jeez, honey!

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,840
I said, Dao is definitely up to something!

29
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,920
But we don't know!

30
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,280
Right.

31
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,320
- Dude! - What?

32
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,400
He was almost...

33
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,480
naked right in front of me!

34
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,240
Huh?!

35
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,800
- Naked?! - Yeah.

36
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,160
I thought...

37
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,960
I was going to get lucky right then, right there.

38
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,080
I'm getting goosebumps!

39
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,080
If it was me,

40
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,160
I would have stripped down,

41
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,760
ready to get in action.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,760
A hot guy like Dr. Param is always welcome.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,480
I'm not like you!

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Hey.

45
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,560
Let me ask you.

46
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,080
How long do you think you can keep up your disguise?

47
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,280
Until I can tear off his mask.

48
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,040
I don't think he's hiding anything, you're over thinking.

49
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,160
Who told you?

50
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,600
I think, both the mother and son are weird.

51
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,680
I don't even know what I'll encounter next.

52
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,080
Today, he was half-naked.

53
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
Tomorrow,

54
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,080
wouldn't he be completely naked?!

55
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,440
How about this?

56
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,480
When he does take things off,

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,440
just give me call.

58
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,640
I'd love to see it.

59
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,760
Idiot!

60
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,040
Get off the bed!

61
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,480
Are you out of your mind?!

62
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,360
I was daydreaming.

63
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,360
He stripped...

64
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,680
Thinking about tomorrow makes me tired.

65
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,240
Thinking about when he strips...

66
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,760
Coming up with a menu

67
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,600
is way harder than designing.

68
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,600
So sleepy.

69
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,960
Oh, what?

70
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,280
I usually put it right here.

71
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,560
Or...

72
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,920
Did I leave it in the kitchen?

73
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,000
It's not in my room.

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,400
It's not in the kitchen.

75
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,760
Where else could it be?

76
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,480
The dining table.

77
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,960
What are you looking for, Faidam?

78
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,800
Nothing, I wasn't looking for anything.

79
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,280
I saw you.

80
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,080
Tell me, what are looking for?

81
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,720
I really wasn't looking for anything.

82
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
Liar!

83
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,080
Tell me, what are you looking for?

84
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,600
What's wrong with your face?

85
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,240
It's...

86
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,680
I was looking for my whitening cream.

87
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,160
I want my face to be as bright as Yaya's.

88
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,040
But I don't remember where I left it.

89
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,360
Now, my skin becomes uneven.

90
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,600
So ugly!

91
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,120
Do I look ugly?

92
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,960
Do I still look pretty in your eyes?

93
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,760
Whether your skin is fair or dark,

94
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,440
you'll always be ugly, Faidam!

95
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,080
If I find out you were looking for ways to carry out your wicked plans.

96
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,120
Otherwise, you'll be dead.

97
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,240
What's wrong with him?

98
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,040
Looking for ways to carry out my wicked plans?

99
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,240
What the hell?

100
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,840
The lights are off.

101
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,280
My face looks uneven, I still can't find my notebook.

102
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,480
Oh madam!

103
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,600
What does Madam Pisamorn has anything to do with it?

104
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,040
She told maids to turn off the lights at 9 pm.

105
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,120
We can turn it back at 5 pm.

106
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,080
Lights are on for only five hours a day.

107
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,760
Every morning, I struggle to put my makeup on...

108
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Wat

109
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm talking.

110
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,000
Every morning, I struggle to put my makeup on in complete darkness.

111
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,080
This morning,

112
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,040
I met Dr. Param while my makeup was incomplete.

113
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,280
I almost got caught!

114
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,320
You ought to be careful, Dao.

115
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,040
Where did your crazy notebook go?

116
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,600
I have no idea.

117
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,800
I couldn't find it.

118
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,480
Can I have a drink?

119
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,400
When I can, I'll look for it again.

120
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,280
It won't be difficult.

121
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,800
A new cook like me will be just fine.

122
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Thanks.

123
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,680
By the way, will you be okay if Madam Pisamorn knows you're here?

124
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,160
Disgusting!

125
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,560
I totally forgot.

126
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,360
Madam sent me to invite you to hang out at her house.

127
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,640
You sure it's just to hang out?

128
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,640
Pok! I won!

129
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,000
The dealer won so often.

130
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,640
If I wasn't going to win this round,

131
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,280
I was ready to become a nun.

132
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,800
Pok.

133
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,240
Anyone? Anyone else?

134
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,400
- I'm alright. - No.

135
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,840
Seven.

136
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,640
Pok nine, two Deng!

137
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,040
I'm sorry you got Pok eight.

138
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,440
May I collect the money?

139
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,320
- It's two Deng. - Two Deng.

140
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,040
All of it.

141
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,600
It's so hot in here.

142
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,480
Jeez, you're losing a bit.

143
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,840
That's why you're sweating.

144
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,400
It really is hot. I've been playing for a while.

145
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,160
I'm really sweating here.

146
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,120
I don't think the air conditioner is on, is it?

147
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,680
Oh really? I guess I forgot.

148
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,520
Should we turn on the air conditioner?

149
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,360
Yes, please.

150
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,880
Sure. I normally turn it on, but the air felt cool this morning.

151
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,120
The weather do change.

152
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,640
- Taew! - Yes?!

153
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,920
- Turn on the air conditioner. - The air conditioner?

154
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,080
Yes, the air conditioner.

155
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
Turn it on?

156
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,720
The thing that adjust the temperature.

157
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,960
- Makes it cool. - How do I turn it on when...

158
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,040
We do have one. You know where it is.

159
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,800
You've lived here for so long, how can you have forgotten?

160
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,280
It's okay, it'll be cool soon.

161
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,640
Let's continue, place your bets.

162
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,840
Place your bets.

163
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,920
Wait!

164
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,400
What kind of air conditioner is this? It's so cold!

165
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,400
I'm cold!

166
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,080
So cold!

167
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,720
- Cold? - I'm cold, my body's shaking all over.

168
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,440
I can't do this, I'm sorry.

169
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,760
May I turn it off real quick?

170
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,600
I can't stand it anymore, It's too cold.

171
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,680
Excuse me, let me turn it off just for a while.

172
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
Taew!

173
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,280
- Yes? - I have goosebumps.

174
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,440
Turn off the air conditioner.

175
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,680
- Huh? - I'm cold, it's like having a fever.

176
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,120
- Turn off the air condition? - Yes!

177
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
Go!

178
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,560
- You turned it on! - Okay! Okay!

179
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,680
So dumb!

180
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,200
She's so tolerant, turning the air conditioner on and off for you.

181
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,680
Yes, yes. She's been my maid for so long.

182
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,000
It's not about being tolerant.

183
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,360
This room doesn't have air conditioner.

184
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,640
What?!

185
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,720
No air conditioner?!

186
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,000
Hot... Hot...

187
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,280
It's hot.

188
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,720
There's no air conditioner.

189
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,000
It's hot.

190
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,320
What did I do, madam?

191
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,960
Let me go! You're hurting me.

192
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,640
You complained about being hurt.

193
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,680
When you humiliated me, you didn't think I would feel hurt?

194
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,320
Humiliated?

195
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,360
Where? Where does it hurt?

196
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,720
Jeez, Faidam!

197
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,720
You were being inconsiderate!

198
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,240
How could you tell them we don't have air conditioner?

199
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,240
Can't you be more considerate?

200
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,120
But that room really didn't have air conditioner.

201
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,920
You kept telling Taew to turn it on and off.

202
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,360
If I said so, it is so.

203
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,560
Our house is so grand and luxurious, but there's no air conditioner?

204
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,200
What will other people think?

205
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,280
They would think that you

206
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,480
are stingy!

207
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,400
You! Now, you're being disrespectful!

208
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,600
Remember,

209
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,040
from now on, my order is absolute.

210
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,120
You must obey them.

211
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,960
No argument.

212
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,760
If I don't want you to talk,

213
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,000
you will not talk.

214
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,240
Understood?

215
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,280
I'm asking, do you understand?

216
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,040
Faidam.

217
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,400
I ask you a question.

218
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,440
Speak!

219
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,240
Why are you pointing at me?

220
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,600
I ordered you not to speak.

221
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,840
You're getting on my nerves! Go back to where you belong.

222
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,120
Don't show your face.

223
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,720
Otherwise, I'll lose my patience and chop you up into little pieces!

224
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,840
You wouldn't dare, madam.

225
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,520
Why wouldn't I?

226
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,840
Because you never buy the black trash bags.

227
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,360
You can't use the grocery bags from the market for that.

228
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,480
Faidam! Get the hell out of my face!

229
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,120
- Put those away. - Huh?

230
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
Hey, Pisamorn!

231
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,800
- Come on. We've been waiting. - Yes, let's start.

232
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,960
Wasted electricity.

233
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,960
- Come! Pisamorn! - Yes, yes.

234
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,520
I went to the restroom.

235
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,800
- Place it. - Pass it.

236
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,720
- The same? - How much?

237
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,080
The same, the same.

238
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,480
Mrs. Pisamorn.

239
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,280
- Yes? - Isn't the bet too expensive?

240
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,600
And no air conditioning?

241
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,560
But I've already turned on all three fans.

242
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,240
Really?

243
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,880
Taew!

244
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,080
Where are you taking them?

245
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,560
I told you to turn on three fans!

246
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,880
Count!

247
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,160
One.

248
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,840
Two and three!

249
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,440
Why are you putting them away?

250
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
Yes.

251
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
This girl.

252
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,360
So tiring, she doesn't understand sometimes.

253
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,560
Told me to turn it on and then off. Back and forth.

254
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,720
- Hurry, Auntie. - My goodness.

255
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,440
Miss Dao, wait, wait!

256
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,600
Please wait!

257
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,200
You dragged me out, but where are we going?

258
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
Just follow me.

259
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,840
Help me first, and I'll drop you off.

260
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,840
Let's go.

261
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,320
Wait, Miss Dao!

262
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,360
Let me lock the door.

263
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,440
- Okay, Auntie. - Okay.

264
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,360
I'll help you.

265
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
Let's go.

266
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,320
Here, Mr. Nick.

267
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,640
The client I found in replacement of Miss Nattriga.

268
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,680
Miss Dao, I'm not here to build a house.

269
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,560
Auntie, Did you forget?

270
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,320
Yesterday, you said you wanted to.

271
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,760
It's alright.

272
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,080
I also didn't want to get involved with celebrities.

273
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,800
So complicated and annoying.

274
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,200
The always think they have special privileges.

275
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,440
Only some of them.

276
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,440
I often get those like Miss Nattriga.

277
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,320
Don't worry, Miss Dao.

278
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,840
I already have a new client for you.

279
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
Who?

280
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,760
You can contact her right away.

281
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,000
I guarantee you, this won't be like last time.

282
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
Sure.

283
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,280
I'll see you in thirty minutes.

284
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yes.

285
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,680
Now, do you believe me when I said I have a job?

286
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,800
Miss Dao, I do believe in everything you said.

287
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,120
By the way,

288
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,400
you told me about your therapy at Tham Krabok.

289
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,360
How was it?

290
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,120
I'll call a taxi to drop you off at home.

291
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,800
- So... - Oh, it's here.

292
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,440
Here you go.

293
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,720
Get home safely, okay?

294
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,720
I'll pay you a visit soon.

295
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,200
Go ahead.

296
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
Bye, Auntie.

297
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,840
- Miss Dao. - I'll talk to you later.

298
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,480
I have an appointment after this.

299
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,440
- Bye bye. - Miss Dao.

300
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,280
Go ahead, I'll catch the next one.

301
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,120
I didn't get the chance to tell her that her grandma will be visiting.

302
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,480
Thank you.

303
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,360
What made a busy woman like you join me at dinner?

304
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,600
I've got time.

305
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,200
A whole day's time.

306
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,840
Actually, I'm not getting any jobs.

307
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,000
That's why you were

308
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,720
trying to get the spotlight news and headlines with that rich doctor.

309
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,920
No jobs, no headlines.

310
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,320
Not in the spotlight.

311
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,080
People won't recognize me.

312
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,840
It's better to be visible on social media here and there.

313
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,560
Hey.

314
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,000
I've decided to really catch Dr. Param.

315
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,800
Well, does he want you?

316
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,280
I don't know.

317
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,800
He never said I'm his girlfriend.

318
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,960
But he also didn't refuse.

319
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,600
You used to work for him and maybe

320
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
that's why he's being nice.

321
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,600
Or he is afraid that rejecting you might lead you to suicide.

322
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,280
But

323
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,000
your suicidal trick,

324
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,600
I wonder how long that will last?

325
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
No idea.

326
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,480
But, even if he doesn't want me,

327
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,360
I won't let him slip away so easily.

328
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,560
Miss Ratchanee, where are you?

329
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,760
At the table next to the window.

330
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,840
Right.

331
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,920
Okay. See you, then.

332
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,520
- She's here? - Yeah. She said so.

333
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,920
Okay.

334
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,680
If she's any good. I'll hire her as well.

335
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,240
I'm looking for an interior designer for my new condo.

336
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,240
She's good, very smart.

337
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,000
She's won heaps of awards,

338
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,200
the international ones.

339
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Superb.

340
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,240
Miss Lomdao?

341
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,760
- Yes. - Have a seat.

342
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,160
Lomdao!

343
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,560
Miss Lomdao?

344
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,000
- Yes. - Have a seat.

345
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,760
Lomdao!

346
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,040
Are you really going to hire this person?

347
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,760
Well, Mr. Nick said Miss Lomdao is super talented.

348
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,320
She received lots of international awards for her work.

349
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,520
If you're hiring her.

350
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
I won't.

351
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,520
Go ahead, enjoy your talk.

352
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,360
Then you'll see how awful her work is.

353
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,360
Well, didn't you say you want to renovate your new condo?

354
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,120
I want someone else.

355
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
Not her.

356
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,720
I don't want her to taint my new condo.

357
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
Besides,

358
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,520
my future husband, Dr. Param,

359
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,560
is inviting me to move into his house.

360
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,440
Maybe I no longer need to renovate my condo.

361
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,640
Riga!

362
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,920
Where are you going?

363
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,800
What's with her?

364
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,160
Miss Lomdao.

365
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,680
If this woman moves in, she'll taint the whole house.

366
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,840
Is he going to have her move in

367
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,320
while he's about to be engaged to someone else?

368
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,480
This is too much!

369
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,720
Miss Lomdao.

370
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,960
Miss Lomdao!

371
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,360
Yes?

372
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,320
Please don't mind her.

373
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,520
She's always like this.

374
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,080
Have a seat.

375
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,840
I'm sorry.

376
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,880
Let me know which style do you prefer,

377
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,160
and we'll incorporate your lifestyle into it.

378
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,840
Make that house your own.

379
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,080
I already have a vision of what I want.

380
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,080
I want a modern style with Yin-Yang,

381
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,000
and a bit of Feng Shui.

382
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,920
But without gold color.

383
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,800
Where's Faidam?

384
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,960
Why is Phon cooking today?

385
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,360
I chased her away.

386
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,840
Why?

387
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,920
She exposed me in front of my friends.

388
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,600
And provoked me.

389
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,600
Even said I'm stingy.

390
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
Auntie.

391
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,080
That's how she is. Please don't take it to heart.

392
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,680
I know!

393
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,880
But...

394
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,960
I was furious!

395
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,040
It's alright, Mom.

396
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,680
She deserved it.

397
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,000
She'll learn how to behave like she should.

398
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,920
Even though she was scolded,

399
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,680
she still procrastinate.

400
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,160
I'll talk to her when she gets back.

401
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,880
Param.

402
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,480
I already said a lot.

403
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,440
When she gets back,

404
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,640
don't go punish her.

405
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,720
I pity her.

406
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,520
You can't be soft.

407
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,400
You need to be strict.

408
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,080
Otherwise, she'll be spoiled.

409
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,280
Dr. Param, it's all your fault!

410
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
Just you wait.

411
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,080
I'll give you headaches when I get back!

412
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,000
- Thank you. - Thank you.

413
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,160
Where did you go?

414
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,120
I'm asking, where did you go?

415
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,960
I was...

416
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,760
I was...

417
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,200
Procrastinating?

418
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,360
I wasn't, madam chased me away herself.

419
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,560
Mom told you to get away from her.

420
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,960
Not to go out and have fun.

421
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,560
What's this bag?

422
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,560
I'm asking, what's this bag?

423
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,080
It's nothing.

424
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,520
It's...

425
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,000
It's...

426
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,680
What's this bag?

427
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,240
It's...

428
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,040
Doctor!

429
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,560
Why are you being so petty?

430
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,960
Go and give your girlfriend, Miss Ega some attention.

431
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,480
Isn't she moving in here?

432
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,880
What?

433
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,160
Riga is moving into my house?

434
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
Who said that?

435
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,680
Well, I read it on social media.

436
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,360
In an interview, she mentioned moving in with you.

437
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,120
I have no idea.

438
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,000
What I want to know now is

439
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,480
what is inside

440
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,960
that bag?

441
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,640
You're getting too close!

442
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,400
Whose outfit is this?

443
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,560
Don't tell me it's yours.

444
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,160
I can tell, this outfit is not cheap.

445
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,760
You can't afford it.

446
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,640
- It's... - Who?

447
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,480
Who?

448
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,240
It's...

449
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,840
Buab.

450
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,720
I went to the movie with Buab.

451
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,920
I went to the mall on the way back.

452
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,600
So, he got it for me.

453
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840
Buab.

454
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,400
He has feelings for Faidam.

455
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,960
I made an effort

456
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
to buy this dessert.

457
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,120
I guess,

458
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,600
he doesn't need this anymore!

459
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,440
Faidam!

460
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,240
You're saying Buab has money to buy such expensive things?

461
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,760
That's right, Doctor.

462
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,120
Well, he makes a lot of money.

463
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,840
Mr. Wat pays him well.

464
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,320
He even gives him vacation leave.

465
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,480
He's got work-life balance.

466
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,720
Unlike certain employer.

467
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,280
They make workers work like slaves.

468
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,800
Mr. Wat is nice,

469
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,280
because Buab is a decent man.

470
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,920
Unlike certain cook and housekeeper.

471
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,000
Always AWOL.

472
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,080
Don't let me catch you

473
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,840
while you're procrastinating.

474
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,840
Or else, you'll be in trouble.

475
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,040
All you do is threaten me!

476
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,680
Housekeepers have feelings too!

477
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,920
I know you do,

478
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,520
but you must work.

479
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,880
And make it worth your pay.

480
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,480
Understood?

481
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,640
Alright.

482
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
From now on,

483
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,520
let's go by the Labor Law.

484
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,000
I'll only work from

485
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,160
8 am until 5 pm.

486
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,920
Other than that,

487
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,760
I'll consider it an OT.

488
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
How's that?

489
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,680
That's too much!

490
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,280
You were mean to me first.

491
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Fine.

492
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,120
You can pack your things

493
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,880
and find a new job.

494
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,360
Because I'm firing you.

495
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,560
Doctor!

496
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,880
You can't say that!

497
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,360
Doctor!

498
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
Doctor!

499
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,600
Doctor!

500
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,080
What do you want?

501
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
It's just

502
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,400
what I said earlier,

503
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,360
I meant the common Labor Law,

504
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,520
in general, not myself.

505
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Because

506
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,240
I can work 24 hours.

507
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,200
Call me at 11 pm, I'll get ready at 11 pm.

508
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,480
Call me at 2 am, I'll get ready at 2 am.

509
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,240
But if you want me...

510
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,960
as your pillow.

511
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,760
I am willing to sleep by your side.

512
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,200
Doctor.

513
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,680
I'm so sorry.

514
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,080
But I can really work 24 hours.

515
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,720
You can call me anytime.

516
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,960
Really?

517
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,560
Jeez!

518
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,800
Doctor.

519
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,440
I wasn't serious.

520
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,960
Just for laugh.

521
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,400
You're just afraid of becoming jobless.

522
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
No.

523
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,160
I'm not afraid.

524
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,560
Because I know you're not serious.

525
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,760
Quit rambling on

526
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,520
and get lost.

527
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Doctor!

528
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,160
Does this mean you won't fire me?

529
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,960
I'll give you one last chance.

530
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,560
If you do that again.

531
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,040
I'll fire you.

532
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,440
Thank you so much, Doctor!

533
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,480
Thank you so much!

534
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,960
You're so kind.

535
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,120
Thank you!

536
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,680
Thank you!

537
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,600
I'll work really hard!

538
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,640
That was close.

539
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,360
Taew.

540
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,760
What happened?

541
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,040
Why are you crying?

542
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,280
You know what you did.

543
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,640
What?

544
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,320
Hey.

545
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,040
What are you talking about?

546
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,440
- Jeez! - What happened?

547
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,840
Don't act like you're innocent.

548
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,280
I shouldn't have trusted you.

549
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,960
You backstabber?!

550
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,040
Taew?

551
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,880
What the hell?

552
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,600
Taew, baby.

553
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,760
Can you hear...

554
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,560
Babe.

555
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,960
What's wrong?

556
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,480
A way to a man's heart is through his stomach.

557
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,920
But when bored,

558
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,120
he'll want to taste something new!

559
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,000
Baby, what are you talking about?

560
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,320
I don't get it.

561
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,680
You don't get it?

562
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,400
You took Faidam to a movie,

563
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,120
did you get enough?

564
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,920
Wait, baby!

565
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,000
I never went on a date with her!

566
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,040
Wait, it's a misunderstanding!

567
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,320
Who? What? Where?

568
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,120
It was you!

569
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,960
You took her out on a date.

570
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,880
And even bought her new clothes!

571
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,120
No, baby!

572
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,160
I never did!

573
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,360
And never even thought about it!

574
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,960
Nonsense! she said so herself! She was with you!

575
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,160
Buab!

576
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,240
Baby.

577
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,680
Taew!

578
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,040
I'm so sorry! Don't cry!

579
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,720
I'm sorry!

580
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,200
- I didn't mean it! I'm sorry! - Wait.

581
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,200
I stopped crying already.

582
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,920
Here's what happened.

583
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,680
Earlier,

584
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,480
Doctor asked where I went.

585
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,000
I didn't know how to answer.

586
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,440
So I...

587
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,400
I kept thinking and...

588
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,880
I saw Buab so I used him as an excuse.

589
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,680
You see!

590
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,800
Baby!

591
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,720
I told you so, didn't I?!

592
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,480
Jeez.

593
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,280
You, Faidam.

594
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,920
You too.

595
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,320
I know you're attracted to my looks.

596
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,320
But I want to let you know, that my heart

597
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,800
belongs only to my baby, Taew.

598
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,360
I know I'm not pretty.

599
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,600
I'm not your type.

600
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,760
And I wouldn't dare think of you that way.

601
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,160
Let's just say

602
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,840
I'm sorry,

603
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,320
for causing you two to fight.

604
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,600
I'm really sorry.

605
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,360
Fine!

606
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,280
Next time, you should let me know beforehand.

607
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,120
The thought of him

608
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,880
having someone else.

609
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,720
It pains me right here.

610
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,720
You mean, Covid?!

611
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,120
What Covid?!

612
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,560
My heart hurts!

613
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,840
A heartache!

614
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,880
Baby, come here.

615
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,560
It's alright now. Don't you cry.

616
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,440
What are you staring at?!

617
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,440
I'm staring at heaven.

618
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,680
Idiot, don't be so pervy.

619
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,480
What's pervy?

620
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,640
Have you ever heard of this, Baby?

621
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,600
"Soft like heaven's touch."

622
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,800
Let's find out what heaven feels like.

623
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,920
Oh dear.

624
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,880
You wouldn't know how much I want to.

625
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,400
I'll give as much as you want!

626
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,000
You're making me crazy!

627
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,080
Then, I'll leave you two lovebirds.

628
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,400
I'm out.

629
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,880
Here? On the grass?

630
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,640
What about my back?

631
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,560
- Something exciting? - Alright. Let's go.

632
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,480
Doctor!

633
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,960
Why are you standing there?

634
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,160
So scary! You spooked me!

635
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,880
Are you capable of that?

636
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,680
Hey! Doctor!

637
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,160
What are you trying to say?

638
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,280
I heard what you said to Buab.

639
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,200
Now, will you confess

640
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,640
where you went and how did you get those clothes.

641
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,880
I just went on a little adventure

642
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,040
with that scooter taxi that dropped me off.

643
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,520
Then, why did you lie?

644
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,080
I didn't.

645
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,440
Because I wouldn't dare.

646
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,080
I'm scared madam will scold me.

647
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,200
You know I just started working.

648
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,680
Getting a boyfriend this quick won't look good.

649
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,280
Boyfriend?

650
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,360
Oops.

651
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,200
It slipped.

652
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,320
Well, not really. Celebrities like to call them

653
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,840
"close friend."

654
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,560
You know what?

655
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,840
What is it?

656
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,960
I don't believe anything you said.

657
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,840
I better not find out you're one of the thieves.

658
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,160
Or, I'll get the police.

659
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,640
Like I want to live here!

660
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,400
Once I expose the real you,

661
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,560
I'll happily leave!

662
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,080
Pick up the pace! You guys are strong!

663
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,720
We need to hurry up. There's more rice to carry!

664
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Hurry up!

665
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,800
You want this to be quicker?

666
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,520
Why don't you lend a hand yourself?

667
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,240
Stop standing around complaining!

668
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,320
Why are you in a bad mood, Mom?

669
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,560
Hey.

670
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,840
Why isn't Oab here yet?

671
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,280
Oab went to talk with the farmers next door.

672
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,880
He's trying to get them to grow organic rice.

673
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,760
Since they make more money and sell better.

674
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,880
Is that so?

675
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,760
How nice.

676
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,760
Worrying about farmers, worrying for everyone.

677
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,000
But no one seems to worry about Dao.

678
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,400
She's been gone for so long.

679
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,320
Do her parents not want to look for her?

680
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,520
Would you care if she were dead somewhere among the grass?

681
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,600
I'm sure she can manage on her own.

682
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,200
So confident.

683
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,520
Death is one thing.

684
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,960
But what I'm worried about is her schemes.

685
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,680
That girl is something.

686
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:02,320
If the notebook Oab found at Dr. Param's house is hers,

687
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,840
that means her whereabouts is easy to guess.

688
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,360
But whatever she's up to

689
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,880
Right.

690
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,800
Grow, grow faster.

691
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,040
Isn't she a diligent one.

692
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,160
Not bad.

693
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,720
Faidam.

694
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,880
Madam!

695
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,720
What's wrong with you?!

696
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,480
Why are you standing there?

697
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,600
Showering and water the plants

698
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,480
is going too far to save water.

699
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,600
I'm afraid the scene will be too horrifying.

700
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,560
Madam, do you know no shame?

701
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,880
I came to tell you Param isn't home.

702
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,840
So, just cook for me and Phon for today.

703
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,600
Why would you go and give me a shower?!

704
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,600
Right away, madam.

705
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,160
There's a soap if you'd like.

706
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,720
- Oops - Are you serious?!

707
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,800
See?

708
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,800
Didn't I tell you to turn the water on gently.

709
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,320
And you didn't turn it off when you're done.

710
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,520
How long do you intend to leave it on for?

711
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,000
Is there something going on?

712
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,840
To call me here so early in the morning.

713
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,760
I'll be frank with you.

714
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,360
What is it?

715
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,560
I don't want you to give the media news about me.

716
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,440
Especially false information.

717
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,080
For instance, when you said you're moving in with me.

718
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,520
But I didn't say it to the media.

719
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,800
I was only joking around with Ratchanee.

720
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,360
Did she leak it to the media?

721
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,960
The thing is...

722
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,120
We're not an item.

723
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,480
I didn't want to so tactless about it.

724
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,120
You could get upset.

725
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,920
But if false news were to spread,

726
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,840
I could tarnish your reputation.

727
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,320
I don't wish for that.

728
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,760
I understand.

729
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,040
Thank you for understanding.

730
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,520
Then, I'll be taking my leave.

731
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,080
What news?

732
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,600
How come I never seen it?

733
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,200
Last night, Ratchnee went overseas.

734
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,480
When could she tell the media?

735
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,320
Mom

736
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,000
let's not do this.

737
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,280
If she really is at that house.

738
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,600
She's probably trying to uncover something.

739
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,440
What is there to uncover?

740
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,120
Dr. Param is a nice guy like no other.

741
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,560
He might already have a girlfriend.

742
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,040
He didn't seem so eager to get married.

743
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,040
What do you mean?

744
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,720
Pisamorn kept calling me every other day,

745
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,160
asking when she'll meet Dao.

746
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,840
My Goodness, I don't know whether to smile or cry.

747
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,600
We never asked

748
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,720
if Dr. Param wants to marry her.

749
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,520
If he doesn't love her.

750
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,480
Dao won't be happy with her marriage.

751
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,880
Well.

752
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,880
Get married first.

753
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,960
And break up if it doesn't work.

754
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,480
Mom.

755
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,520
Let her be. Please don't put any pressure on her.

756
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,400
The more you push,

757
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,320
the more she pulls away.

758
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,000
Please, be patient.

759
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,200
- Doctor. - What is it?

760
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,480
What did you wait out here?

761
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,600
And not inside?

762
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,280
I rather wait here, it might be inconvenient for your mom.

763
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,960
What are you here for?

764
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,200
Well...

765
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,400
I don't want you to think that I gave the false news.

766
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,680
Ratchanee went overseas last night,

767
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,600
so it couldn't be her.

768
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,320
I'm just letting you know, it wasn't something serious.

769
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,600
But I'm serious.

770
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,400
I don't want any misunderstanding.

771
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,840
I also did some research.

772
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,880
No media or website published the news.

773
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,240
That's good, then.

774
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,320
But I'm curious.

775
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,880
I recall someone else at the scene.

776
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,760
If it wasn't Ratchanee nor me, it had to be her.

777
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,480
Who?

778
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,840
That foul mouth interior designer, Lomdao.

779
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,280
She must know you.

780
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,200
Otherwise, this wouldn't reach your ears.

781
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,560
Who has a foul mouth?!

782
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,480
What are you waiting for?

783
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,600
He told you to leave.

784
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,040
Trying to bite his lips again?

785
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,280
(Next episode.)

786
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,880
Please don't be mad at her.

787
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,640
She might have her own reasons.

788
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Honestly,

789
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,080
I don't want to marry her.

790
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,560
Of course.

791
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,000
You've already got a woman.

792
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,760
I'm sure you're not just an ordinary cook.
