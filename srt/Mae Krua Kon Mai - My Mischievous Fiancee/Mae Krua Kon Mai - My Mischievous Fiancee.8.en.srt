1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,840
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,600
Where are you guys having dinner? Can I tag along?

3
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,680
(Previously...)

4
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
Sure.

5
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,120
It's not far from here.

6
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,120
I am going to have dinner with Riga.

7
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,200
I want to go buy some stuff

8
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,480
and would like to borrow

9
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,640
Faidam to go help me out.

10
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,680
Going out again, Faidam?

11
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,040
Wat.

12
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,440
You go ahead, I'll use the restroom.

13
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,080
Okay, I'll order first.

14
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,280
Okay.

15
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,960
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

16
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,320
- Let me help you. - It's okay.

17
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
Miss?

18
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
I'll help.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,720
- Let me... - That's okay.

20
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,680
Are you alright?

21
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,200
- Yes. - Here.

22
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,080
Your purse.

23
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
Doctor.

24
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,200
Who were you talking to?

25
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,200
She dropped her purse.

26
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,720
I was just helping her.

27
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,880
Looks like she's in a hurry, she's already gone.

28
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
Not even a "thank you".

29
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,040
Probably in a hurry.

30
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,360
How rude.

31
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,440
Someone helped her, she should at least say "thank you".

32
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,720
We should get going, Dr. Korn is waiting.

33
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,760
Right.

34
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,120
- Welcome. - Hello.

35
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,120
- For two. - A moment, sir.

36
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,920
Hey! Wat!

37
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,960
Here for dinner?

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,720
Is Dao here with you?

39
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,840
She is.

40
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,080
But after seeing you, I think I'll change the place.

41
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,760
Why?

42
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,600
I don't want Dao to be annoyed.

43
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,520
Dao.

44
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,840
It's like we have telepathy.

45
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,400
Looks like we have a lot in common.

46
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,120
It won't be long before

47
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,640
you become infatuated with me.

48
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
Da...

49
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,880
We should leave.

50
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,680
Why? We haven't eaten yet.

51
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,840
That's right.

52
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,960
We should eat together.

53
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,120
Let's just do as I say.

54
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
Jeez.

55
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
Why?

56
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,880
We don't get to do this often.

57
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,120
Why should we head home?

58
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,760
I met Doctor.

59
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,720
Doctor? Dr. Korn.

60
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,080
Dr. Param!

61
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,840
Yes! Can we leave now?!

62
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,600
Shoot! What are the odds?

63
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,200
Fine! Let's go!

64
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,800
Wait, Dao!

65
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,000
It's been a while.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,960
- Where are you going? - I've got work, Korn.

67
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
- I have to go. - But...

68
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,720
Dao! Wat! Dao!

69
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,680
Dao! Wat! Wait for me!

70
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,800
Dao, what's the rush?

71
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Dr. Korn.

72
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,720
I made you wait.

73
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,080
It's you.

74
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,480
What are you doing here?

75
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,800
Don't tell me you got no work

76
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,040
that's why you're here hunting for one?

77
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,120
I'm having a meal with my friend.

78
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,320
You, on the other hand

79
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,480
you look like you've brought your own meal with you.

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Hey.

81
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,800
You two know each other?

82
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,840
Yes.

83
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,760
She's a third-rate interior designer at Mr. Nick's company.

84
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,160
I rejected her.

85
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
As I recall

86
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,320
I refused to work with a client like you?

87
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,960
How about this?

88
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,960
If you two know each other

89
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,080
I'll just introduce Param.

90
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,760
Sure.

91
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,800
Dr. Param.

92
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,600
This is Lomdao.

93
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
My friend.

94
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,040
This is Watsy.

95
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
Songsawat.

96
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,200
Dao, this is Dr. Param.

97
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,920
Lomdao.

98
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,720
That sounds familiar.

99
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,960
I don't think so, she just got back from America.

100
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,080
I don't think you've met.

101
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
Right.

102
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,760
Now that everyone is acquainted

103
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,920
let's all enjoy a meal together.

104
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
What do you say?

105
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,280
The more, the merrier.

106
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,680
- I actually have to... - Dao!

107
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,480
Save the work for later.

108
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,800
He's not as handsome as I am.

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,960
It's just a meal, I don't mind.

110
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,960
That's not the point.

111
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,920
Well, if you all don't mind having a meal together.

112
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,600
But if Miss Lomdao and Mr. Songsawat

113
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,480
has somewhere else to be,

114
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,240
we shouldn't bother them.

115
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,280
They might be overwhelmed at the thought

116
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,800
of having a meal at a fancy hotel restaurant.

117
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,080
Have you reserved your table?

118
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,680
If you haven't.

119
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,600
I suggest you take my usual spot, I don't mind.

120
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,360
Please don't mind her.

121
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,240
I reserved a table.

122
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,040
If you have the time, let me treat you.

123
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,120
She had spoken out of turn so I'd like to apologize.

124
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,480
- Fine, Doctor. - Please.

125
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,680
Please Doctor, Miss Riga, Wat, and Dao as well.

126
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
Wat!

127
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,000
- What?! - Why did you accept his invitation?!

128
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,960
That chick insulted me!

129
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,280
She said I'm poor I never eat at fancy restaurant!

130
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,840
Who cares!

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What if we ended up getting caught?!

132
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,160
We've come this far, you should know the risk!

133
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
Go!

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,880
- Come on! - Wat!

135
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,760
Alright?

136
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
Dig in!

137
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,880
Did you know?

138
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,640
Back in university, Dao...

139
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,320
She was the star and popular.

140
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,560
Beautiful and smart.

141
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,520
She's a proper straight A student.

142
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,640
Brilliant!

143
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,520
A woman like her, is totally my type.

144
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,880
- Korn was also a star. - Stop it.

145
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,800
A fallen star, he failed every class.

146
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
Wat.

147
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,080
It took me seven years to graduate.

148
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,960
By the way, Dao.

149
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,000
You're not very talkative.

150
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,000
Excuse me for a moment.

151
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,400
This is your chance, go!

152
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
Now.

153
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,480
Dr. Korn is right.

154
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,360
You don't seem as talkative.

155
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,240
Usually you won't shut your trap and look like a fool.

156
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,240
It's because I don't want to waste my breath on people like you.

157
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,120
Always put on an act.

158
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,120
Even your real life is fake.

159
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,440
I wonder what Dr. Param sees in you.

160
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,840
He sees I'm better than other woman.

161
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,200
That's why he chose me!

162
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
Go!

163
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,560
- She insulted me. - Screw her.

164
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,880
Leave while you still can, go!

165
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,200
Where are your manners?

166
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,880
Only a fool would wear sunglasses at dinner table.

167
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,880
You know what? The least you should know, is some manners!

168
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,120
I wear them so I can protect my eyes from such a dirty.

169
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,080
But right now I think they are useless.

170
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,880
Because I feel still as disgusting

171
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,280
as when I see with my own eyes.

172
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,200
Miss Riga.

173
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,160
It won't look good if he comes back

174
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
to see his girlfriend out of character.

175
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,000
Besides, they're staring.

176
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,720
You're an actress!

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Act.

178
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,960
Right, have a seat.

179
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,160
Sit down, sit down.

180
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,600
Sit down please.

181
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
Excellent.

182
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,280
Eat up, it's delicious.

183
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,520
Wat, eat up.

184
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,840
So delicious.

185
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,840
Doctor! How could an educated man like you

186
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,160
be interested in that woman?!

187
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,200
Go for the looks, not the brain, isn't it?!

188
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,880
Increase the dosage during the evening.

189
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,520
Okay, thank you.

190
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
You.

191
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,520
- Ouch. - I'm sorry.

192
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,600
I'm sorry.

193
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,360
- Your sunglasses. - Thank y...

194
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,760
I'll help you.

195
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,120
It's okay.

196
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,920
Really, it's okay.

197
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,200
It's fine.

198
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,640
I'm okay.

199
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
Ouch!

200
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,480
Your ankle...

201
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,360
Did you twist it?

202
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
No.

203
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,440
It's fine.

204
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,040
Thank you.

205
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,240
Does he recognize me?

206
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
Let me go.

207
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,000
Hey, don't move.

208
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,280
You're so stubborn.

209
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,080
You can't walk with a twisted ankle, I'll help.

210
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,200
You! Let go!

211
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
You.

212
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
Let go!

213
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,800
Let me down! I said let go...

214
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,280
Let me check.

215
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,760
It's alright, let me.

216
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,680
How can you walk with such swollen ankle.

217
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,400
Sit right here, don't try to do anything.

218
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,360
But I'm fine.

219
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,560
But I'm a doctor.

220
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,360
You're an interior designer.

221
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,880
Treating people is my job, not yours.

222
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,640
Just sit here and wait.

223
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
Excuse me.

224
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,400
Do you have muscle relaxant?

225
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,840
- Yes, we do, one moment. - Alright.

226
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,280
So what?

227
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,920
I still need to get away from you.

228
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
- Here. - Thank you.

229
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,920
Ouch.

230
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,800
This hurts.

231
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,400
How do I call a taxi?

232
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,200
Are you taking a stroll?

233
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,840
I'm not taking a stroll, I'm escap...

234
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,480
Why are you carrying me?! Let go!

235
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,360
- Let go! - Stay still, or you'll fall.

236
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,200
Just let me go! I can walk!

237
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Let go!

238
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,520
How many times do I have to carry you?

239
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,440
It's alright, I'll do it.

240
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,680
You.

241
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,720
Hey.

242
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,200
Don't be stubborn.

243
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
I'll do it.

244
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,280
Why is he on the phone for so long? Why isn't he back yet?

245
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,200
Miss Riga, you should eat!

246
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,320
Don't wait.

247
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,800
Dr. Param will be here.

248
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,160
Doctors are like this.

249
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,640
Always so busy.

250
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,480
I guess I'll be on my way.

251
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,560
What about Dao?

252
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,600
Well, If she comes back, you can take care of her.

253
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,600
Of course!

254
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,440
I'll take good care of her.

255
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,680
She'll come to like me!

256
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,000
I'll go check on Dr. Param.

257
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,400
It's so tasty.

258
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,560
- I'm leaving. - Okay.

259
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,800
Hey Wat!

260
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,200
Be safe on the road!

261
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
How is it?

262
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,080
Better?

263
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,200
Thank you.

264
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,080
Miss Dao.

265
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,280
What is it this time?!

266
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,240
Yes?

267
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,760
You forgot your purse.

268
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Right.

269
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,480
You look familiar.

270
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
Doctor.

271
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,480
That line only works with someone our parents' age.

272
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,680
I'm not being flirty.

273
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,600
I just feel like I've seen you from somewhere.

274
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,600
A psychiatrist like you sees countless patients.

275
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,640
I must look like one of them.

276
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,640
If you'll excuse me.

277
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,360
How did she know I'm a psychiatrist?

278
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,400
Hey you!

279
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,920
How did you know I'm a psychiatrist?

280
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,760
Hey...

281
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
So...

282
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,520
are you going to stare until you remember?

283
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,680
Yes.

284
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,000
It's not just the face.

285
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:55,280
It's your personality that made me so sure I'm not mistaken.

286
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,640
But

287
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,680
I don't know you, I've never even met you.

288
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,560
- Hey. - What now?!

289
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,640
I have seen you before.

290
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,440
It's...

291
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,320
I have seen you before.

292
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,920
It's...

293
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,720
I didn't mean...

294
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,840
Doctor. I...

295
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,320
At the airport, you humiliated me.

296
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,160
- The airport? - Yes.

297
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,880
Our luggage were swapped.

298
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,360
And made me a laughing stock.

299
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,880
Oh!

300
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,680
That was you.

301
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,400
I remember now.

302
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,320
I thought you meant someone else.

303
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,640
What do you mean?

304
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,400
What do you mean by someone else?

305
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,480
I wouldn't know.

306
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
But

307
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,920
I'm not interested in you.

308
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,840
And if you're still mad about that day, I'm sorry.

309
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,480
Excuse me.

310
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,480
Oh!

311
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,880
Also

312
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,680
thank you for today.

313
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,200
I hope we don't ever see each other again.

314
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,040
If I knew she's that kind of person

315
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,440
I shouldn't have helped.

316
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,800
(Lomdao)

317
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,680
Did you leave?

318
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,360
Yeah, I'm heading home.

319
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,520
What?!

320
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,360
How could you do this to me?!

321
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,000
I've been waiting for you in front of the hotel!

322
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,600
How will I get home?!

323
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,480
No idea, not my problem!

324
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,240
You...

325
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,520
Come on, I'm not leaving you behind.

326
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,640
Hop on!

327
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,120
Where's Dr. Param?

328
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,440
Can't find him.

329
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,480
Actually, you should become an eater rather than a doctor.

330
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,920
No, I don't like eating.

331
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,600
- Seriously?! - Yes.

332
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,240
This

333
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,360
is free food.

334
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
Worth it.

335
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,680
But if I can choose.

336
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,400
I'd rather be a fortune teller.

337
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
Fortune teller?

338
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,040
- You want to give it a go? - Sure.

339
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,560
What?!

340
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,000
You fell for it!

341
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,560
Think about it.

342
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,280
What kind of doctor has 50 percent chance of making mistakes

343
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,760
but hasn't been fire yet!

344
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,880
- Funny. - It's funny, right?

345
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,880
What's so funny?

346
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,240
Here.

347
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,440
Eat as much as you want.

348
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,880
I'm leaving.

349
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
Miss Riga!

350
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,520
Miss Riga, wait!

351
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,240
They all left.

352
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
If Dr. Param doesn't come back

353
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,240
I'll have to pay.

354
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,720
I thought It'll be a free meal.

355
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,280
Ouch!

356
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,520
Ouch!

357
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,280
It hurts!

358
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,400
You were asking for trouble.

359
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,280
Instead of living a normal life

360
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,000
you choose to do this.

361
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,120
Only the crazy ones and you would do it.

362
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,280
It's that idiot doctor's fault.

363
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,320
Nonsense, I don't see him doing anything.

364
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,720
You're the one picking a fight with him!

365
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,400
Hey, what's that face?

366
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,800
You should be thinking about an excuse to give your grandma.

367
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,520
What's so bad about your fiance?

368
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,760
Easy.

369
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,080
First off, he has a girlfriend.

370
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,960
So

371
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,160
if he breaks up with Riga

372
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,320
problems solved, isn't it?

373
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,600
Are you nuts?

374
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,880
I won't ever marry him.

375
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,120
Sure!

376
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,440
What a beauty! the most beautiful!

377
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,320
Hey.

378
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,880
Is there other reason

379
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
you disguised yourself as Faidam

380
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,200
and entered Dr. Param's house?

381
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,440
What plan?

382
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,640
The plan to get close to Dr. Param

383
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,320
I mean

384
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,760
he's so cute

385
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,320
handsome,

386
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,400
kind and charming.

387
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,520
Plus, he's super friendly.

388
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,280
Doesn't everyone want a piece of him?

389
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,680
Doctor.

390
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,840
You want a piece of him, don't use me as an excuse!

391
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,480
Did that trigger you?

392
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,080
You're interested in him.

393
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,600
Admit it.

394
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
Never.

395
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,160
I would never want that psycho doctor!

396
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,680
Psycho! Psycho!

397
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,080
Hey.

398
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,320
What's important right now is coming up with an excuse.

399
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,840
Dr. Param will be suspicious about Faidam's twisted ankle

400
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,120
just like Lomdao.

401
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,920
Isn't it strange?

402
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,200
And he's not stupid, Sis!

403
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,680
Doctor.

404
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,400
Be mine instead!

405
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,480
Don't, Dr. Param! Don't! I'm scared! Be gentle!

406
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,840
Look at this!

407
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,280
How many times have I told you

408
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,320
to wrap up mushrooms and tomatoes with a newspaper

409
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,120
before you put them in the fridge?!

410
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,080
Otherwise, they'll rot!

411
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,440
A newspaper?

412
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,920
Yes, a newspaper!

413
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,920
Okay.

414
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,040
You never learn, look!

415
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,080
They're going to rot, wrap them up!

416
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,000
Does money grow on trees?

417
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,160
Of course not, Madam.

418
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,040
Where did Faidam go?

419
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,280
Hasn't she come back from the market?

420
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,360
Not yet.

421
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,360
Hey, I gave her extra twenty.

422
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,840
She's probably buying so much stuff.

423
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,080
What can twenty buy?

424
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,160
Yes Madam?

425
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,640
I can't walk and I still have to carry the groceries.

426
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,480
Oh no...

427
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,120
He'll notice if I walk like a cripple!

428
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,640
I'll be caught, like Wat said!

429
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,120
What to do?!

430
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,480
Fine! Que Sera, Sera.

431
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,120
Faidam!

432
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,240
I'm sorry Faidam!

433
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,760
Recently, I kept bumping into people, what's wrong with me?

434
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,160
I'm sorry.

435
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,120
Are you hurt?

436
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,080
Did you hit your face on the ground?

437
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,440
No, No, No.

438
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,560
- It's fine, Doctor! - Let me see!

439
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,880
Let me see...

440
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,760
Oh! What's that?!

441
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,840
There's nothing.

442
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,040
Really?

443
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,960
But I thought I saw something.

444
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,880
Something black went by behind you.

445
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,080
There's nothing.

446
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,880
There's just you.

447
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,040
- Faidam. - Yes?

448
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,800
Why does you mole...

449
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
It's....

450
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,280
Ow! Ow!

451
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,000
My leg hurts, Doctor!

452
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,200
- Your leg? - Yes!

453
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,920
This one?

454
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,520
Right there, Doctor.

455
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,520
Ow! Ow!

456
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,480
Right there.

457
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,840
Try standing up.

458
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,960
Get up.

459
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,600
What are you waiting for?

460
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
Get up.

461
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,920
Well...

462
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,880
I've never held hands with a guy.

463
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,680
It's fine, I'm only helping you.

464
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,520
Come, here you go.

465
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,560
Doctor!

466
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,920
"It's fine" and yet you always seize the chance to touch me.

467
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,160
Are you sure?

468
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,360
Why did you let go of me Doctor?!

469
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,680
So dramatic, you can walk home yourself.

470
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,080
That's not difficult.

471
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,240
Ouch!

472
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,720
Ow!

473
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,040
My legs hurt Doctor!

474
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,480
- Did you break my leg? - Hey.

475
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Get up.

476
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,360
- I can't, it hurts. - I said get up.

477
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,280
Are you sure you can't?

478
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,800
I'm sure.

479
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,040
Fine.

480
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,400
Come here.

481
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,040
- Doctor! - Be still!

482
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,160
Let me go! Doctor!

483
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,200
You can't walk.

484
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,960
How could I let you down?

485
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,640
I can walk now, my leg isn't broken.

486
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,280
Next time don't be so dramatic.

487
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,560
I'm a doctor.

488
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,920
I know what could cause a fracture.

489
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,680
Even so, it's your fault.

490
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,920
Good.

491
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,160
You won't be so clumsy in the future.

492
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,760
Not even an apology.

493
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,720
Wait Faidam.

494
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,120
What is it Doctor?

495
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,840
You fell on your right.

496
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,640
Then why does your left hurts.

497
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,720
Ouch! Ow! They both hurts.

498
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Right hurts.

499
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,720
Left hurts.

500
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,240
It hurts all over.

501
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,360
It hurts even more to close the door.

502
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,720
Weirdo.

503
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
Faidam!

504
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,320
What's wrong?

505
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,440
I bumped into her so she sprained her leg.

506
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,000
Oh dear, Param!

507
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,920
How can you be so clumsy at this age?

508
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,600
I can't believe you.

509
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,280
See if it's serious.

510
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,440
Taew, go fetch something to rub on it before it swells.

511
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,440
Okay.

512
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,720
Are you two kids?

513
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,320
And why standing around?

514
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,560
Param, get her to sit on a chair.

515
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,680
Yes! Help her to it.

516
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,240
Slowly.

517
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,240
Just do it.

518
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,440
How are the both of you feeling?

519
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,840
Were you not focused or something?

520
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,160
Won't you be mad?

521
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,240
The vegetables got bruised because of me.

522
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,040
It so happens that

523
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,200
I'm more worried about you.

524
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,240
But it's not an excuse to procrastinate, alright?

525
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,880
Because last night you were with Wat the whole night.

526
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,760
What did you say?

527
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,600
Yesterday

528
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,520
she went out with Wat?

529
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,880
Yeah.

530
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:43,840
He got my permission to borrow Faidam to help carry his things.

531
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,960
Lomdao.

532
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,960
That sounds familiar.

533
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,280
I don't think so, she just got back from America.

534
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,000
I just feel like I've seen you from somewhere.

535
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,720
Ow! Ow! Doctor!

536
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,760
Be gentle! I'm hurt!

537
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,480
Does someone like you knows pain?

538
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,520
What are you talking about?

539
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,800
I know now

540
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,920
why Miss Dao seems familiar.

541
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,080
Because she looks like you.

542
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,840
Miss Dao?

543
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,720
Who's that?

544
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,160
I don't believe you.

545
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,880
What do I have to do to convince you?

546
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,720
Which Dao are you talking about? There're many Daos out there.

547
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,080
You think I know your Dao?

548
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,520
Are you sure

549
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,480
you don't know Miss Dao?

550
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,880
Miss Lomdao

551
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,600
Mr. Songsawat's friend.

552
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,160
Shoot!

553
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,120
Buab!

554
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,800
There's a problem! Get Mr. Wat!

555
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,000
Taew, Yo! Yo! What's the problem?

556
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,280
I got no problem with loving you too much! Yo! Yo!

557
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,400
Buab! Now is not the time?!

558
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,200
It's about Faidam.

559
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,800
What trouble could she stir up?

560
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,680
She's just a tiny bean sprout!

561
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,320
Sure, if it's just Faidam.

562
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,400
But right now, she and Dr. Param...

563
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,840
What?!

564
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,960
There's no time! They're in trouble!

565
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,160
I'm off!

566
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,840
Wait for me, baby!

567
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,200
He's interrogating her right now.

568
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,280
What should we do?

569
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,440
I knew

570
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,720
that someday it would come to this!

571
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,800
Dao!

572
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,760
What should we do, Wat?

573
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,400
So

574
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,280
if she gets fired

575
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,840
she can't finish her report.

576
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,360
The problems between the boss and the maid won't come to light?!

577
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,120
Man, someone like me won't get to be famous!

578
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,320
Wait, what do you have to do with it?

579
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,560
Babe, I'm also one of the maids.

580
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,320
I want to be part of exposing the boss as well.

581
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,040
That has nothing to do with you.

582
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,360
- Think about it! - It has nothing to do with you.

583
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,600
- Really? - Really.

584
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,160
Alright, stop talking.

585
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,880
Just do as I say.

586
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,640
- Do what? - Do what?

587
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,200
Doctor!

588
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,440
What a coincidence, you were also with Mr. Songsawat last night.

589
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,880
Hey.

590
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,040
Last night

591
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,440
Miss Dao was also with Mr. Songsawat.

592
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,080
She twisted her ankle.

593
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
Today

594
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,400
you twisted your ankle too.

595
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,800
Indeed a coincidence Doctor.

596
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:23,560
You bumped into me this morning, that's why.

597
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,720
I was fine before that.

598
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,800
Is it not true?

599
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,800
Look.

600
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,800
- I'll tell you... - Faidam! Fai...

601
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,640
What is it?

602
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
It's just

603
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,240
Mr. Wat's friend, Miss Dao is coming over

604
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,800
so he wonders if you will let Faidam cook for them.

605
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,920
Dao?

606
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,640
Lomdao?

607
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,040
That's right.

608
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,600
What's with your eye?

609
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,720
I can't stop winking.

610
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,720
- Huh? - Huh?

611
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,000
If you don't believe me.

612
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,440
You can see for yourself.

613
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,920
Whether or not I look like Miss Dao or Lomdao.

614
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,240
I apologize for bothering you for two days straight.

615
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,320
Dao...

616
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,040
Wat's friend came back from America.

617
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,440
She loves Thai food.

618
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,040
I heard Faidam is a great cook so I want her help.

619
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,440
Sure, not a problem.

620
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,640
I also have thank you for helping Dao when she fell.

621
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,840
She later told me how grateful she is.

622
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,800
My pleasure.

623
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,800
So how is she?

624
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,680
She just woke up, probably in the shower.

625
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,960
We stayed up and chat until late.

626
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,920
How was last night Faidam?

627
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,520
You got lost.

628
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,280
You got lost!

629
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,200
What do you mean?

630
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,960
When you got lost!

631
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,200
Got lost!

632
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,240
No! No!

633
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,080
I didn't!

634
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,880
When you dropped me off

635
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,760
I took the bus and go straight home!

636
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,440
Yesterday, I was going to take her with me.

637
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,840
But then Dao called so I had her go home on her own.

638
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,920
I'll take you out another day, okay?

639
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,520
Alright Mr. Wat.

640
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,360
No problem!

641
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,120
- Doctor. - Yes?

642
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,400
Would you like to join us?

643
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,280
Sounds good.

644
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,640
I'd like to check on Miss Dao's condition.

645
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,240
- Join us?! - Join us?!

646
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,760
Then I...

647
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,000
I'll get Faidam to start cooking.

648
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,840
- Come here. - Sure.

649
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,720
- Doctor, please come and sit down. - Okay.

650
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,480
Dao! Where are you going? Come back!

651
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,360
Cook.

652
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,880
No need! Get the clothes! Get changed!

653
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,880
- Alright. - Hurry!

654
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:59,080
When I went back yesterday, both of you were already gone.

655
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,360
Well, I had places to be.

656
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,480
- Miss Dao is taking quite a while. - Yes.

657
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,400
Is there anything you'd like to eat?

658
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,080
I can let Faidam knows.

659
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,600
- I'll tell her myself. - It's okay!

660
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,240
- Why? - Sit down first.

661
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,200
Just relax and sit down.

662
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,040
Mom and Faidam

663
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,240
can handle the stuff in the kitchen.

664
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,920
Alright.

665
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,480
She always takes long showers.

666
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,120
Finally.

667
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,680
Doctor.

668
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,880
Hello, Miss Dao.

669
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,040
Here to claim the purse?

670
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,320
I want to see

671
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,240
if your ankle is better.

672
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,000
If yes, I will go.

673
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,280
Are you really worried?

674
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,720
Or it's an excuse to see me?

675
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,560
I want to know something.

676
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,080
That's all.

677
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,720
I didn't want to see you.

678
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,720
Doctor!

679
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,600
Aren't you going the wrong way?

680
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,840
That's the kitchen.

681
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,520
Yes, that's where I'm going.

682
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,920
- Auntie. - Are you already hungry?

683
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,480
Where's Faidam?

684
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,440
Doctor.

685
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,960
What do you need?

686
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,000
I'm here to tell you

687
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,720
I'm leaving.

688
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,920
I remembered I have work.

689
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,680
I'll be leaving now.

690
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,320
You won't stay?

691
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,120
Maybe next time.

692
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,080
- Have a good day. - Okay, bye.

693
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,080
How did you do that?

694
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,520
Get me some kind of evidence!

695
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,760
And you'll know I'm a cop in disguise!

696
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,960
Dao.

697
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,560
I'm coming for you.

698
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,440
(Next episode.)

699
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,880
Dao, you're so screwed!
