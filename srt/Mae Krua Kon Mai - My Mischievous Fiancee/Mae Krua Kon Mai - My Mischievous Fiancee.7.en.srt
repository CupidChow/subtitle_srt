1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,800
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,120
(Previously...)

3
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,200
Shoot!

4
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
Faidam!

5
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,200
Faidam isn't home?

6
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,920
Both of them already left.

7
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,520
It's this late and still no signs of her.

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,840
Something might have happened.

9
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,400
All of them are waiting.

10
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,440
Where have you been, Faidam?

11
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,520
You got lost.

12
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,640
I got lost, Madam.

13
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,120
I fell asleep on the bus.

14
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,480
When I realized it

15
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,360
I don't know where the bus was at.

16
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,320
By the time I reached home

17
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,280
it's already late at night.

18
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,640
I knew it.

19
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,480
But

20
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,480
I didn't forget food.

21
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
Here.

22
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,080
I look after it with my life.

23
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,520
I'm very sorry, Madam.

24
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,960
The vegetables are a little bruised

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,360
but they're still edible.

26
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,280
As long as you can find your way home

27
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,760
I'm already happy.

28
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
And you...

29
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,680
are you alright?

30
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,880
She's fine.

31
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,040
Her face is her weapon.

32
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,200
Who would dare to harm you?

33
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,880
Brother!

34
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,680
Why did you say that?

35
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,640
She's already disheartened from getting lost.

36
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,640
That's right.

37
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,360
I was very shocked.

38
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,720
Earlier, when I was walking into the alleyway

39
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,440
there was a guy who ran after me.

40
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,880
I quickly ran away

41
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,920
but the situation doesn't look good

42
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,960
so I stopped.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You stopped?

44
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,040
Why did you stop?

45
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,160
I stopped

46
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,400
so I can negotiate with him, Miss Phon.

47
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,920
I learned it from a movie.

48
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
Then I

49
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,720
told him that...

50
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
That?

51
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,640
If you don't use violence

52
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,280
I will give in willingly.

53
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,040
And

54
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,360
what did he say?

55
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,120
He took off his pants.

56
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,840
Then you shag him?

57
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120
You're nuts.

58
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,200
Think about it

59
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,080
a person with their pants on

60
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,640
and another with no pants

61
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,720
who can run faster?

62
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,720
You're right.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,240
That's right, he didn't wear any pants.

64
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,040
You're correct!

65
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,720
How hilarious.

66
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,320
Hilarious, indeed.

67
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,960
See? Everyone's laughing.

68
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,760
Isn't funny?

69
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,240
It is funny.

70
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,280
Hey, seeing your cheeky act like this

71
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,200
I am already at ease.

72
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,320
Come here.

73
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,640
- Get a pen and a paper, Taew. - Yes.

74
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,280
What's wrong, Madam?

75
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,440
Bring it here.

76
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,160
I'll give you a spell to use for when you see him strip down again.

77
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
Here.

78
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,000
Keep it with you.

79
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,840
A phone number?

80
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,360
I am not trying to courting you, Madam.

81
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,840
Why are you giving it to me?

82
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,160
Keep it for some other men, Madam.

83
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
You idiot.

84
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,560
This is this house's phone number, keep it.

85
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,440
The other number belongs to Dr. Param.

86
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,960
In case you can't find your way back

87
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,920
just give me a call and I'll go fetch you.

88
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,480
Do you understand?

89
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,600
I was nearly done for.

90
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,520
In case you can't find your way back

91
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,360
just give me a call and I'll go fetch you.

92
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,120
Do you understand?

93
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,280
(House, Uayphon, Param's phone number)

94
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,520
Even though she looks mean, she's actually kind.

95
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,480
What is the Madam actually like?

96
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,240
But I'll say this.

97
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,680
I will not lose a daughter-in-law like Dao, ever!

98
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,840
Why is she so fixated on Lomdao?

99
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,120
What's so good about that woman?

100
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,120
Hello.

101
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,520
Yes, Mr. Nick?

102
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,240
Mr. John just texted me

103
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,760
that he wants to talk to you.

104
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
Right now?

105
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,120
Are you free?

106
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
Yes.

107
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,640
Please forward me his number.

108
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay.

109
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,280
Yes.

110
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,040
Whose voice was that?

111
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,480
Taew, Faidam, open the door.

112
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,520
Doctor!

113
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,360
Faidam.

114
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,360
Doctor is calling.

115
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,400
Faidam, Taew.

116
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,040
Okay.

117
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,240
Open the door, now.

118
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,040
A moment please, Doctor.

119
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
Hey.

120
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,920
I have something to talk about.

121
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,120
Go open the door, I'm sleeping.

122
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
Hey.

123
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,200
- I forgot the mole. - What's wrong with you?

124
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,440
I told you to open the door.

125
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,760
Faidam, open the door.

126
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,720
Faidam.

127
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,000
Okay.

128
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,440
Open the door for the doctor.

129
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,520
I'm sleeping.

130
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,680
Open the door.

131
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,280
Is there fire? What's the rush?

132
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,640
Faidam, quickly.

133
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,160
What were you doing?

134
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,160
Does it smell?

135
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,000
I went to wash my mouth.

136
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,440
I'm scared my breath will stink.

137
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,040
Who was speaking English just now?

138
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Who?

139
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,640
I said who spoke in English?

140
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,040
I asked you who?

141
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,480
Taew is clearly sleeping.

142
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,480
It's just you and Taew here.

143
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,200
Therefore it can only be you.

144
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,400
Me? I speak English?

145
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,200
I don't know, Doctor.

146
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,560
How can you not know?

147
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Hey.

148
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,160
Huh?

149
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,960
Could it be a ghost?

150
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,520
Stop changing the subject.

151
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,760
I heard it from your room.

152
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,440
Why don't you admit it's you?

153
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,160
Keep your voice down, Doctor.

154
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,720
Can't you tell she's sleeping?

155
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,240
Then come out and talk.

156
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,320
- Come here. - Doctor!

157
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,760
- Let me go, Doctor! - What?

158
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,440
Doctor!

159
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,520
What's going on with Faidam and Doctor?

160
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,160
Oh, Faidam.

161
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,640
Leaving things around.

162
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,640
Hey.

163
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,320
Faidam?

164
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,720
What's with Faidam?

165
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
Doctor!

166
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,280
Let go.

167
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,000
Why do you have to be so rough?

168
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,520
Could it be

169
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,240
you want to assault me?

170
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,760
I want to know if that was you

171
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,280
that was speaking English.

172
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,880
I don't know.

173
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,760
You were in that room

174
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,320
how could you not know?

175
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,520
Why did you lie about it?

176
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,800
It was you, am I right?

177
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,080
What are you laughing about?

178
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,320
I am laughing at you, Doctor.

179
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,400
How could you think I was speaking English?

180
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,320
I didn't even go to school.

181
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,360
How can I speak English?

182
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,680
Don't make excuses.

183
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,080
I saw you taught Taew English the other day.

184
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,720
Oh, if you mean teach with my hands then yes.

185
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,680
Oh.

186
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,000
Like this, right?

187
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,680
- What's wrong with you? - That's how I talk to foreigners.

188
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,240
I use my hands to communicate.

189
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,480
I'm off to bed.

190
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,520
Enough.

191
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,920
Just go wherever you need to.

192
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Then

193
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,920
I'm going to sleep now.

194
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,920
See you.

195
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,800
Oops! My shoes.

196
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,320
See you.

197
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
Annoying.

198
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,720
Faidam.

199
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,720
Yes, Doctor?

200
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,040
Doctor?

201
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,480
Why are you getting so close to me?

202
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,960
Your face is about to touch mine.

203
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,720
Doctor! What are you doing?

204
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,120
Hey, did you think I was going to do something to you?

205
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,680
I'm not going to assault you.

206
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
Then

207
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,880
why are you getting close to me?

208
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,880
Your hair is...

209
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,680
Oh.

210
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,560
You see, I didn't comb my hair.

211
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,560
Since it's this late

212
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,000
This is how it is at night, Doctor.

213
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,600
I am going to bed now.

214
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,680
Hey.

215
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,960
This weirdo is so fast.

216
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,760
Where did this dark stain come from?

217
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,640
That was so close.

218
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,440
Both the wig and the mole.

219
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,320
I'm so confused.

220
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,520
How many times will I get away with it?

221
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,360
But this time

222
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,720
you won't get away with it!

223
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,240
What's wrong, Taew?

224
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
Tell me

225
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,000
who are you?!

226
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,240
I...

227
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I...

228
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,320
I am Faidam, Taew.

229
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,040
Did you forget about me?

230
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,800
But I found this.

231
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,000
How was that?

232
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,280
Powder.

233
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,880
I...

234
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
Bag.

235
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
I...

236
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,600
Wow! Black mole.

237
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,280
I...

238
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,280
And this!

239
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
I...

240
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
Huh?!

241
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,280
What are your excuses now?

242
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,760
Come here.

243
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,080
Taew!

244
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,920
What are you doing? I'm Faidam! Taew!

245
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,080
Look at this!

246
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,560
Caught you red handed.

247
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,520
What are your excuses now?

248
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,560
Huh?!

249
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
I...

250
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,080
Still at it?

251
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,440
Peekaboo.

252
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,240
You're a spy for criminal, right?

253
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,600
Who's your boss?

254
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,880
When are you guys coming to rob?

255
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,640
Do you have morals?

256
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,440
Robbing others is sinful, you know!?

257
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,440
Huh?

258
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Enough.

259
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,360
You're going too far.

260
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,320
I'm not a criminal.

261
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,920
To go beyond goodness

262
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,320
principals, and ethics.

263
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
Gosh.

264
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,800
Look.

265
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,600
Look.

266
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,720
What?

267
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,080
Look.

268
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,840
Do I look like a criminal?

269
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,360
Fine.

270
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
I'll tell you.

271
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,040
But you need to promise me

272
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,880
that you won't tell anyone.

273
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,960
Sure, I promise.

274
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,880
Just give me

275
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,520
half of the sum you robbed.

276
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,040
Sure, I'll give you half.

277
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,160
Hey!

278
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,440
I told you I'm not here to rob.

279
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,800
Okay, fine, I'm kidding.

280
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,720
I promise you I won't tell anyone.

281
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Tell me.

282
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,600
Faidam is a student disguised as a maid?

283
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,000
That's right.

284
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,280
She told me herself.

285
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,960
What I'm going to tell you is like a work of fiction

286
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,880
Actually I am a student studying my masters.

287
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,040
I'm working on my thesis on

288
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,520
coexistence behavior of people in society.

289
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,800
What? Thesis, what?!

290
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,160
To put it simply

291
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,760
I am writing a report on

292
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,760
coexistence behavior of people in the house.

293
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,120
To understand how they coexist.

294
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,040
But if

295
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,040
it's the parents and children

296
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,560
it's too basic.

297
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,960
Because they love each other anyway, right?

298
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,280
Right.

299
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,320
But if it's

300
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,560
boss and their employee

301
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,120
what's it going to be like?

302
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,680
Oh, Faidam!

303
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,720
Yeah!

304
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,440
That's why I disguised myself as a maid.

305
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,800
To learn the behavior of

306
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,160
a boss like Madam Pisamorn

307
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,920
on how she acts with the maids in the house.

308
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,400
Wow!

309
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,760
That's amazing

310
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,960
just like a drama I've watched before.

311
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,320
The heroine disguised herself as a maid

312
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,480
and the hero is the son of the house owner.

313
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,120
They got together and the truth is revealed.

314
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,040
Bullseye!

315
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,280
Hey.

316
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,000
You usually look dumb

317
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,920
but when you speak like that

318
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,440
you sound so smart.

319
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Yeah.

320
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,880
Now

321
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,640
do you understand

322
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,520
why I have to disguise myself?

323
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,520
Wait, Faidam.

324
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,320
What, Taew?

325
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,960
And why

326
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,120
do you have to avoid Mr. Oab?

327
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,480
Hmm?

328
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,520
Oh!

329
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
Mr. Oabboon.

330
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
Oh!

331
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,120
Here's the thing.

332
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,520
Mr. Oabboon is my senior at my university.

333
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,320
He's close with my advisor.

334
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,840
So I don't want him to see me.

335
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,600
- No more question, right? - Yeah.

336
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,920
I'm going to bed now.

337
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,520
Wait.

338
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
What is it?

339
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,480
So you go to a university in Ubon Ratchathani?

340
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Why?

341
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,320
Because Mr. Oab is from Ubon Ratchathani

342
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,120
and you're his friend

343
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,280
so you guys go to the same university.

344
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,840
I'm smart, huh?

345
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,880
Oh, You're correct!

346
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,600
I go to a university in Ubon Ratchathani.

347
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,640
Okay.

348
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,640
Yeah.

349
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,880
Wait, Taew.

350
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,800
What is it?

351
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,520
- Hay. - Hmm?

352
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,200
Don't forget the promise

353
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,720
that you won’t tell anyone.

354
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,840
What?

355
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,920
I promise not to tell anyone.

356
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,200
At all!

357
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
That'll be 500 baht.

358
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
Forget it.

359
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,640
Madam!

360
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,680
Taew!

361
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,880
500 baht it is.

362
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
I accept.

363
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,000
I will help you keep the secret.

364
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,800
I promise with my life.

365
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,680
No wonder

366
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,880
that's why she's close to Mr. Wat.

367
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,360
She's in disguise.

368
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,800
Just like a drama, huh?

369
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,920
Speaking of which,

370
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,040
you should disguise yourself sometimes.

371
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,080
Disguise myself as what?

372
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,840
As a nurse

373
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,320
or a high school student.

374
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,160
Silly baby!

375
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,080
And what about you, Buab?

376
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,600
Are you going to disguise as

377
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,560
a teacher or a dentist?

378
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,600
You naughty patient.

379
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,840
By the way,

380
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,240
if Madam and Doctor find out that

381
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,080
Faidam is in disguise,

382
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,280
what will...

383
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,000
Buab! You must never tell anyone.

384
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,640
I already promise Faidam

385
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,560
that I'll keep it a secret.

386
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
Of course.

387
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,960
I know, baby.

388
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,840
I'm just curious.

389
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,160
I'll help you keep the secret.

390
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,440
Don't worry.

391
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,120
I'll never tell a soul.

392
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,160
You're hungry.

393
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,480
Your teeth is sexy.

394
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,200
Who called? Don't let me catch you.

395
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,520
What's wrong, Buab.

396
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,840
Hey.

397
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,120
Why are your face and ear red?

398
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,160
When I was ironing the clothes

399
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,560
someone gave me a call.

400
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,120
I accidentally put the iron on my face.

401
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,320
But both sides are red.

402
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,600
That idiot called me again

403
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,320
so I answered on the other side.

404
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,960
What if they call again?

405
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,280
Of course I'll answer.

406
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,200
Mr. Wat, please don't joke around.

407
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,560
I'll lose my vanity.

408
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,280
Oh.

409
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,880
Mr. Wat.

410
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,280
Mr. Wat.

411
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,320
What?

412
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,960
Faidam is a student in disguise...

413
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,480
at Dr. Param's house?

414
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,760
Covered my whole face.

415
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,520
Who told you?

416
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,440
Well, Faidam told Taew

417
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,840
then Taew told me

418
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,280
and I just told you.

419
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,840
And what of it?

420
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
So I can help keep the secret.

421
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,320
And Faidam can finish her report.

422
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,720
Don't act like you can keep a secret.

423
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,240
I can.

424
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,440
Go iron the clothes, go.

425
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,320
- I... - Go!

426
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,000
A lot of people know your secret.

427
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,240
How long will you keep this up, Dao.

428
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,440
Your hair is...

429
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,120
What are you cooking for breakfast, Faidam?

430
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,520
Shrimp congee, Doctor.

431
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,840
Can you make fried rice with chicken and basil for me?

432
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,880
Sure.

433
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,520
Please wait a moment

434
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,240
I'll cook something delicious for you.

435
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,120
Hey!

436
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,240
What are you doing, Doctor?

437
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,880
Oh.

438
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,800
I was shooing the fly away for you.

439
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,200
I was being nice.

440
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,440
Nice?

441
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,720
But that wasn't just shooing.

442
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,600
You pulled my hair, Doctor!

443
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
That hurt.

444
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,280
Hey!

445
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,920
That's inappropriate, Doctor!

446
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,160
What?

447
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,160
My mom said

448
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,920
"Hold hands, you lose a chicken.

449
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,280
Hold the shoulders

450
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,480
you lose a pig's head."

451
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,160
But when you hold me, you lose...

452
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,600
Lose what?

453
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,280
Sorry! But you won't get to touch me.

454
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,000
Just because you're a doctor, you think you can touch maids all the time?

455
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,080
I'm not easy like Miss Ega.

456
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,960
Who bites your lips.

457
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,840
Who pulls you in.

458
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,200
Enough.

459
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,040
I'm not interested in you

460
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,600
and I won't touch you either.

461
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,360
Wait, Doctor.

462
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
What?

463
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,960
Do you want to know...

464
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,680
when you hold me, you lose...

465
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,440
Lose what?

466
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,320
Lose nothing.

467
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,040
Is he suspicious of me?

468
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,160
I don't think so.

469
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,320
It's not a wig.

470
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,320
Then was that black stain?

471
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,400
That's impossible!

472
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,600
I don't believe it.

473
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,640
How can Dao become a drug addict?

474
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,120
Exactly.

475
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,400
I don't believe it either.

476
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,600
There's no way Dao is a drug addict.

477
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,240
But that's what she told me

478
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,680
and she's at Tham Krabok for her therapy.

479
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,520
- Huh? - No way.

480
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,920
My sister, Dao

481
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,320
would never become a drug addict.

482
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,480
She told me that

483
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,880
so I believe her.

484
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,120
But think of what you will, Mr. Oab.

485
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,800
What should we do, Grandma?

486
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,080
Since we can't contact Dao

487
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,440
call her best friend, then.

488
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,680
Sure.

489
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,720
Call now.

490
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,720
I made a deal with this client already.

491
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,520
Have the manager confirm and we can go in and work on it.

492
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,920
Okay, Mr. Wat.

493
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,800
(Oab)

494
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,600
Oab!

495
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,080
Why did he give me a call?

496
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,760
How was it?

497
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,720
No one pick up the call.

498
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,720
Call them until they answer the call.

499
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,560
Call now.

500
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,520
What?

501
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,160
Oab called you?

502
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,760
Yeah, since you changed your phone number so he called me instead.

503
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,480
He keeps calling.

504
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,320
What do you want me to do?

505
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,840
Just tell him I'm at Tham Krabok for therapy.

506
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,320
Don't worry about me, I'll return when I'm all cured.

507
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,720
Therapy at Tham Krabok?

508
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,520
It's better than having him

509
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,080
knowing what I am up to.

510
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,240
Hey.

511
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,880
You can tell him you have Covid or therapy

512
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,640
at Tham Krabok, that's up to you.

513
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,160
But if he went to find you at Tham Krabok.

514
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,800
You're screwed, Dao.

515
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,040
Hello.

516
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,760
Hello, Oab.

517
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,960
Do you have time to come meet?

518
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,040
Tell him you'll drive there.

519
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,000
I'll drive to you there.

520
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,720
Hey, why did you whisper?

521
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,920
Say it louder.

522
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,880
I'll drive to you there.

523
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,920
Where, Wat?

524
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,880
I'm near a shopping mall

525
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,800
let's meet there.

526
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,600
You got it.

527
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,440
- Well? - All done, Grandma.

528
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,560
Dao is a drug addict.

529
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,960
Really?

530
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,400
Auntie Angkab also said Dao told her that.

531
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,960
But I don't believe it.

532
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,200
Where is she getting her therapy?

533
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,560
Just spill it out, Wat.

534
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,640
At this point

535
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,880
I can accept anything.

536
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,120
I don't really want to talk about it.

537
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,040
Just tell us, I want to know

538
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,560
so we can solve the problem together.

539
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,960
Hurry.

540
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,440
She's at Tham Krabok.

541
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,480
Huh?

542
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,440
My goodness, Angkab.

543
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,080
Dao is indeed at Tham Krabok.

544
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,800
You didn't believe me.

545
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,920
I told you so.

546
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,320
I can't believe it either.

547
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,880
How is that possible?

548
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,480
Grandma.

549
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,400
What should we do?

550
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,840
I also don't know what to do.

551
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,800
Dao, how did it come to this?

552
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,560
Did it work, Wat?

553
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,720
Why hasn't he arrived?

554
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,080
I need to know.

555
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,560
When he is coming?

556
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,760
Hey, he's here.

557
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,200
Hey, quickly.

558
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,440
Hurry!

559
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,800
Hey, what took you so long?

560
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,000
What did Oab and Grandma say?

561
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,160
They're going to visit you at Tham Krabok.

562
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,280
Huh? What?

563
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,000
They made you take them

564
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,680
to see me at Tham Krabok?

565
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,880
That's right

566
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,840
they also told me not to tell you.

567
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,840
They're scared you'll run off.

568
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,480
Your brother and grandma is

569
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,000
probably using me as a blocker.

570
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,040
What are you going to do now?

571
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,560
You have so many plans.

572
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,280
What should I do?

573
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,600
Hurry, what are you going to do?

574
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,240
Wait a moment, I am thinking.

575
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,360
You.

576
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,800
You need to stall time.

577
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,120
Don't let Oab finds you.

578
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,120
He probably won't.

579
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,880
He told me to pin the location but I told him I don't know how.

580
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,600
He told me to draw a map

581
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,160
but I said I had clients.

582
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,120
That's how he let me leave.

583
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,280
But I still need to draw and send the map

584
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,480
on Line messenger.

585
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,240
My Line messenger is blowing up.

586
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,960
Why don't you give him the wrong direction?

587
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,960
Huh?

588
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,720
Where is his house?

589
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,920
Why is it so difficult to find?

590
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,520
You're right, Grandma.

591
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,640
At first, it says to go to Phutthamonthon.

592
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,160
Then find a way to Din Daeng.

593
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,320
But when we reached Din Daeng, it says to go to Bang Pra.

594
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,080
So where exactly is Suwinthawong road?

595
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,280
It doesn't matter where it is.

596
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,240
Just take me home immediately.

597
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,960
Before I die in the car.

598
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,320
Grandma? Aren't we going to look for Dao anymore?

599
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,360
At this rate

600
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,880
I might die here before then.

601
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,040
Let's go back right now.

602
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,240
I can't take it anymore.

603
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,000
We're lost.

604
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,280
I don't know if I can find the way home.

605
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,800
Oab!

606
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,880
You're getting on my nerves right now.

607
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,200
Take me home this instant!

608
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,280
Riga

609
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,160
you don't need to act at the hospital.

610
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,560
No way.

611
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,480
If an acquaintance saw us

612
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,960
they might tell your mom.

613
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,360
Besides

614
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,960
we can get used to it this way.

615
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,160
Hello, Riga.

616
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,760
Where are you taking Dr. Param?

617
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,320
Out for dinner.

618
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,760
Wow.

619
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,920
Isn't it nice to have a girlfriend?

620
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,080
You can have someone to go eat with.

621
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,560
I'm hungry as well.

622
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,520
Where are you guys having dinner? Can I tag along?

623
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,280
Sure.

624
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,640
It's not far from here.

625
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,120
Great! Let's go.

626
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,240
I also want to consult with you about picking up women.

627
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,520
I would like to have a girlfriend too, so I don't have to eat alone.

628
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,880
You don't have to consult me about that.

629
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,560
I'm not good at it.

630
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,240
You're kidding, Doctor.

631
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,840
If you're not good at it

632
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,600
how else would you get with Miss Riga?

633
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,840
Let's go.

634
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,200
Please.

635
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,760
Dr. Korn.

636
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,200
What's the matter?

637
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,120
The patient's relative is here to pick up

638
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,120
the pomelo that they left here.

639
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,520
Really?

640
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,720
What's wrong, Doctor?

641
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,320
I already ate it.

642
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,400
They never came to take it.

643
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,520
They left it here for so long, I thought they don't want it anymore.

644
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,520
Then what should I tell them?

645
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,840
Tell them it tastes bad

646
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,920
so I threw it away.

647
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,000
What if they ask

648
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,800
how did you know it tastes bad?

649
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,200
Because I tasted it.

650
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,560
If you tell them that, they'd know that you ate it.

651
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,240
Oh, right.

652
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,320
I think...

653
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,720
How about this?

654
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,760
Can you get them a new one?

655
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,280
I don't think they can tell it's a different one.

656
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,360
Yes, I'll leave it to you.

657
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,760
Pomelos look the same anyway.

658
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,000
Let's go, I'm starving.

659
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,280
- Let's go. - But from what I see, you don't need an advice.

660
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,440
You just want to go eat for free

661
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,480
that's all.

662
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,320
You're so funny, Miss Riga.

663
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,560
Spot on, then?

664
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,160
You head there first, Riga.

665
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,760
I'll tell my family

666
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,320
that I won't be home for dinner.

667
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,440
Yes, I'll wait inside the car then.

668
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,400
- Sure. - Let's go. After you.

669
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,760
Hello, Monthianrak residence.

670
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Who's that?

671
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,840
I said who's this?

672
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,080
It's Faidam, Doctor.

673
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,960
What's matter?

674
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,760
Why did you change your talking tone?

675
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,920
I...

676
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,120
I am practicing my central Thai dialect.

677
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,800
So I can use it with Miss Riga

678
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,840
when she becomes your wife.

679
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,160
Alright.

680
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,520
Then tell my mom

681
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,440
I won't be coming home to eat.

682
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,440
I am going to have dinner with Riga.

683
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,760
I want to puke.

684
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,440
Tom Yum Goong

685
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,080
the thick and creamy kind, see?

686
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,840
Not the light kind.

687
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,640
Also

688
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,760
another dish.

689
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,920
Stir-fried crab in curry powder.

690
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,280
Here.

691
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,840
These dishes are Dr. Param's favorite.

692
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,320
When there's a special occasion

693
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,480
you should make these two dishes.

694
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,920
Understood?

695
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,120
You like stir-fried crab in curry powder, huh?

696
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,680
Thick and creamy Tom Yum Goong.

697
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,440
You're not here, so don't eat it.

698
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,040
(Oab)

699
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,680
Yes, Oab?

700
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,600
Did you find my house?

701
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,000
Tell me right now, Wat.

702
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,920
Where do you want me to pick you up?

703
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,200
It's...

704
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,560
No fooling around like this morning.

705
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,640
I drove so many hours and couldn't find it.

706
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,920
If you don't tell me.

707
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,440
I'll tell the police

708
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,760
for kidnapping and holding Lomdao prisoner.

709
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,320
You'll be locked up for many years.

710
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,520
If Oab catches me lying

711
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,000
Dao will surely kill me.

712
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,040
What should I do?

713
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,000
Whatever happens, happens.

714
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,720
Please don't be angry at me.

715
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,320
I didn't lie, I'm just not good with directions.

716
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,680
But not remembering your own house

717
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,200
isn't that too much?

718
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,880
Oab.

719
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,320
I'm really not lying.

720
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,920
If you're angry

721
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,040
you can punish me however you see fit.

722
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,080
I'll concede.

723
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,800
It's okay, Wat.

724
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,680
Oab, I'd feel bad otherwise.

725
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,360
How about this.

726
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,600
When we're home

727
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,360
I'll give you a massage.

728
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,480
Okay?

729
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,560
Okay?

730
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,160
Oab, what's wrong?

731
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,840
Oh, you see...

732
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,120
I just remembered I have an urgent matter to do.

733
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,320
Let's go look for Dao another time.

734
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,240
Oab.

735
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,320
Go drop me off.

736
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,000
I don't want to take the cab.

737
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,840
You can't, Wat. I really have to go.

738
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,560
Aww, Oab.

739
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,080
How about I go wait until you're done?

740
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,280
Sounds good?

741
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,560
Wat.

742
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,560
You really can't.

743
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,080
I need to spend the night there.

744
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,360
You catch a ride.

745
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,640
I'll call a cab for you.

746
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,680
Oh, taxi!

747
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,720
Oab.

748
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,840
- I'll call a cab for you please wait a moment, Wat. - Oab.

749
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,680
It's that simple.

750
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,120
Come, Wat, I called a cab for you.

751
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,680
See you later, Oab.

752
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,480
Oh, Wat...

753
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,320
You're just not my type.

754
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,560
Hey, you need to see your brother's face

755
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,080
when I was caressing his leg.

756
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,400
Like... wow!

757
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,680
Thank you so much.

758
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,720
Sure.

759
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,240
Hey.

760
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,000
Tonight we need to celebrate

761
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,280
for getting away with it.

762
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,280
Hold on.

763
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,720
Don't you have to cook?

764
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,160
I already cooked.

765
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,240
Hey, hopefully Dr. Param

766
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,600
doesn't ring my door bell.

767
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,640
He's not home today.

768
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,560
Why am I crossing over? I'll sit here.

769
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,920
Why are you upset?

770
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,200
Well...

771
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,360
I'm bored.

772
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,760
I wanted to go celebrate but I couldn't.

773
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,640
- That's all? - Yeah.

774
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,240
Auntie, I want to go buy some stuff

775
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,560
and would like to borrow

776
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,800
Faidam to go help me out.

777
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,320
Going out again, Faidam?

778
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,360
I actually don't want to go.

779
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,000
But he's asking for my help.

780
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,640
Hey, make sure you follow

781
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,560
behind him when you go.

782
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,880
Understood?

783
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,480
You're not right in the head

784
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,680
you might get lost like last time.

785
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,800
Be careful, too.

786
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,200
Yes.

787
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,320
Please take a good care of her.

788
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,480
She likes to get lost.

789
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,720
Last time she was lost

790
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,920
I was so startled.

791
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,840
Not to worry, Madam.

792
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,320
I'll keep an eye on her.

793
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,280
Then get going.

794
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,440
Bye, Madam.

795
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,680
Thank you.

796
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,880
Oh, Faidam!

797
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,240
Hold on, come here.

798
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,400
- Yes? - Don't forget to carry the phone numbers that I gave you.

799
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,760
You can call home when you're lost.

800
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,160
Yes, Madam.

801
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,760
I won't forget.

802
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,720
She's worried you'll get lost.

803
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,120
Hey.

804
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,600
Actually Wat

805
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,600
should be paying half for Faidam from me.

806
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,800
Always calling for her.

807
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,920
So true, Madam.

808
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,120
Oh.

809
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,760
I agree, Madam.

810
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,320
Always taking her away.

811
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,360
Kids these days.

812
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,440
Hey.

813
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,560
Go back to your original position, you're nosy.

814
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,000
Come back and massage me.

815
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,680
Oh! Sorry, Madam.

816
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,480
Wat, you go ahead, I'll use the restroom.

817
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,200
Okay, I'll order first.

818
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,560
So we don't waste time.

819
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,560
Sure.

820
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,720
- Sorry! - Sorry!

821
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,200
Here, let me help.

822
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,240
No, that's okay.

823
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,880
(Next episode.)

824
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,640
It's alright, I'll do it.

825
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,120
You look familiar.

826
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,080
Are you going to stare until you remember?

827
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,480
Yes.

828
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,800
It's not just the face

829
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,520
but your personality that made me so sure I'm not mistaken.
