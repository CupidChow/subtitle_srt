1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,800
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,480
Drowning in debt, are you going to break up with him?

3
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,680
Of course, I want to

4
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,520
but I still haven't found the next prey.

5
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,240
Would you like me to drop you off?

6
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,560
I have money.

7
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,280
I don't need to depend on anyone.

8
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,200
(Previously...)

9
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,080
Today, I have a meal with my juniors from college.

10
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,840
You know all of them

11
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,280
Wat, Ji, Su.

12
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,640
You're burning!

13
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,680
But I think you should take her

14
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,320
for a mental health evaluation.

15
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,280
I don't know why she applied black paint on her skin.

16
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,400
Never mind her.

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,880
Let her do whatever she wants.

18
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,080
It's not like we're going exclusive or anything.

19
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,320
Dr. Param would invite me over often.

20
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,680
His mother is especially nice.

21
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,960
I'm actually thinking of visiting again.

22
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,880
To talk about marriage.

23
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,080
I mean, letting the man handle this

24
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,240
would seem more appropriate.

25
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,760
Does that mean you're getting married?

26
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,240
There's a talk about it.

27
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,000
About how to deal with this.

28
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,920
But we agreed not to talk about it yet.

29
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,480
Well, I think you should ask Doctor yourself

30
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,080
about what's going on.

31
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,120
Then I'll take my leave now.

32
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,840
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

33
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
Nonsense.

34
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,600
Why don't you tell them you're dating?

35
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,080
- Should we call? - Sure.

36
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
Oh.

37
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
What's up?

38
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,000
Took you long enough.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,960
You could come after the place has closed.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,600
We haven't ordered anything.

41
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,240
You sound like a grandma.

42
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,400
Hey, the reason I was late

43
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,960
because I saw Riga putting on a show for the reporters.

44
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,680
Wat, where's Dao?

45
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,880
She's sick.

46
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,880
Jeez.

47
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,360
Aren't we pretty enough?

48
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,760
Cheer up.

49
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,000
I don't fancy you.

50
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
I like Dao.

51
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,240
This guy!

52
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,920
Hey, you like her but she doesn't like you.

53
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,320
Can't you just move on?

54
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,120
Out of sight, out of mind.

55
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,480
But I still have my sight.

56
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,680
I can't help wanting to see her.

57
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,160
So cringey.

58
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
Wat.

59
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,480
What was that interview about?

60
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,800
About Dr. Param!

61
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,840
Give me the juicy details!

62
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,680
The reporters asked her

63
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,320
what's going on between them.

64
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,360
She dared fake it and say

65
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,440
"Well, we're close."

66
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,600
"We did talked about going exclusive."

67
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,360
- Going exclusive? - Yeah.

68
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,320
- Sounds like they're already dating. - I know.

69
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,920
- Oh my God! - That's my line.

70
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,040
It's mine.

71
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,240
Just kidding.

72
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,640
I wanted to say I saw Riga visits

73
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,880
the hospital to see Dr. Param quite often.

74
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,880
They're probably dating.

75
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,880
See?

76
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,240
Make it official then.

77
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,040
But she acted hesitant about it.

78
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,760
Like she wants to get their interests and stay in the news.

79
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,240
She wants the spotlight.

80
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,520
She as in "her".

81
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,440
Don't, just keep that joke to yourself.

82
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,400
I think she wants to be famous.

83
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,760
Because this event is full of socialites.

84
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,560
She must be looking for a new prey.

85
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,040
A woman like her is liked and courted by men.

86
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,960
So why does someone like me who's beautiful,

87
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
rich,

88
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,680
well raised,

89
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,800
and a baby face to boot

90
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,200
is still single?

91
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,240
Like baby snake?

92
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,880
Yeah baby snake, slithering along

93
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,280
Aren't I your friend?

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,520
- What a foul mouth you have. - I agree!

95
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,840
Where's La Creme event?

96
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,280
This way, please.

97
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,040
- Really, really handsome! - Really, really handsome!

98
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,600
I'm going to greet my future husband now.

99
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,280
- Just up and grab him home? - First come.

100
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,040
Watsy! Get him.

101
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,120
- Yes. - Grab him right!

102
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
Thank you.

103
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
Oh.

104
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,680
I'm sorry, are you hurt?

105
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,920
I'm fine.

106
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,280
Are you okay?

107
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
I'm alright.

108
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,680
Thank you for helping me.

109
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,960
Not a problem.

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Ew.

111
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,360
I think you should sit down.

112
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,400
- That would be great. - I'll help.

113
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,680
Careful.

114
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,560
Oh my.

115
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,960
I really want to slap that face

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,280
with durian peel.

117
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,840
Where does it hurt?

118
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,520
Just a bit at the ankle.

119
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,840
Win! Win!

120
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,960
Then I'll excuse myself.

121
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,640
Sure.

122
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,440
I even bumped into him but he doesn't care.

123
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,880
I thought there would be other choices besides Doctor.

124
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,160
One day I head into the woods.

125
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,400
You don't seem bothered, honey.

126
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,280
Not worried about your children?

127
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,040
Are they worry about me?

128
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,800
Both of them, where have they gone to?

129
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,720
I think I should go to Bangkok.

130
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,840
To find them.

131
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,600
To find them?

132
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,920
See, even Oab and Mom can't find her.

133
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,040
How are you going to do it then?

134
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,120
Dao went missing,

135
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,240
Dr. Param is still as calm as ever.

136
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,840
He doesn't seem to care.

137
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,040
How are they going to marry like this?

138
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,960
That's true.

139
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,440
Hello everyone, it's "Daily Variety".

140
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,440
Today we've got news on a love life

141
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,440
of a charming actress, Miss Nattriga.

142
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,960
She finally opened up

143
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,440
about her getting exclusive.

144
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,520
Her sweetheart Dr. Param

145
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,560
has already invited her home a few times.

146
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,400
It's not like we're going exclusive or anything.

147
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,800
Dr. Param would invite me over often.

148
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,080
His mother is especially nice.

149
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,440
I'm actually thinking of visiting again.

150
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,400
To talk about marriage.

151
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,720
Does that mean you're getting married?

152
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,280
There's a talk about it.

153
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,760
About how to deal with this.

154
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,720
But we agreed not to talk about it yet.

155
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,840
Well, I think you should ask Doctor yourself

156
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,280
Hey, this damn actress.

157
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,680
Even my dog knows better.

158
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,920
How dare she said that?

159
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,600
- I'm going to faint. - Honey! Calm down!

160
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,000
Maybe it's just rumors.

161
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,520
Giving an interview like that,

162
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,360
it probably isn't just rumors.

163
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,720
If this isn't true.

164
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,600
She must be extremely desperate!

165
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,040
All done.

166
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,480
Jeez!

167
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Shameless!

168
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,040
Grandma!

169
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,360
Give me that!

170
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,120
Why are you trying to throw it?

171
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,680
Hey.

172
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,040
Oh!

173
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,880
Another broken TV.

174
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,240
Weren't you smashing some garlic and peppers

175
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,720
for stir fried basil as lunch.

176
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,200
Why smashed the TV instead.

177
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,560
Well shouldn't I be?!

178
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,760
Let me do it again.

179
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
Grandma!

180
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,480
Grandma!

181
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,000
What did I do to you?!

182
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,360
Why are you angry?

183
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,920
I didn't mean it.

184
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,560
I was going to smash it into that actress, not you!

185
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,680
- Grandma! - Grandma!

186
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,320
- Which actress?! - Let go!

187
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,960
Grandma, seriously.

188
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,440
Which drama got you hooked?

189
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,960
Sounds like you want this?!

190
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,040
Okay! Okay!

191
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,520
Okay, Grandma.

192
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,640
Jeez, I'll behave.

193
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,360
Which actress made you so irritated?

194
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,240
Who else besides that Riga! Didn't you see?

195
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,400
In that interview she said she's marrying Dr. Param.

196
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,280
- What did you just say? - What did you just say?

197
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,040
This woman said in the interview she's going to marry Dr. Param!

198
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,320
- What?! Really? - What?! Really?

199
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,160
Jeez! Do you really need to yell?!

200
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,760
This Riga still hasn't given up on him.

201
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,400
She might gave an interview ahead of time.

202
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,280
If we're taking our time,

203
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,760
Grandma might change her mind

204
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,040
and break off the marriage.

205
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,560
Auntie.

206
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,560
If Brother and Riga loves each other,

207
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,160
we probably shouldn't get in the way.

208
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,520
Miss Dao did refuse us first.

209
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,080
About this matter,

210
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,200
I want to hear from Dao herself

211
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,400
that she doesn't want to marry Param.

212
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,400
Her going missing isn't what I consider an answer.

213
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,160
Oh, you're awake.

214
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,520
I...

215
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
I mean...

216
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,600
What's wrong with me?

217
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,680
You had high fever

218
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,040
and went unconscious.

219
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,680
How do you feel?

220
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,440
Acting cocky.

221
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Doctor, you're teasing me?

222
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,080
I'm not mocking you.

223
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,360
But if you weren't cocky

224
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,080
and wanted to walk home yourself.

225
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,920
You wouldn't end up in this state.

226
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
I'm fine.

227
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,160
But you should feel guilty.

228
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,000
Because of you, I had to walk home.

229
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
You wanted to walk home.

230
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,320
You chased me out of the car on the way to the market.

231
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,280
You wanted to get out of the car.

232
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,320
Oh!

233
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
Are you okay?

234
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,800
Go back to sleep.

235
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,600
Rest up.

236
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,640
And get well soon.

237
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,080
You couldn't believe...

238
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,920
that I'll be kind.

239
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,920
I simply don't want you to procrastinate.

240
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,080
That ugly doctor!

241
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,440
Dao, why did you call me?

242
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,200
Jade noodles.

243
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,760
Wat!

244
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,120
It's just noodles, why call me?

245
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,560
You know it's my favorite.

246
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,680
So what?

247
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,080
Dr. Param bought it for me!

248
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,600
Coincidence, maybe?

249
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,880
I don't know.

250
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,240
Look.

251
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,600
How could he find out?

252
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,560
Right?

253
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,240
I'm always cautious.

254
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,440
No matter how much I wanted this,

255
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,720
I couldn't bring myself to buy it.

256
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,920
Wat.

257
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,760
I...

258
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,320
I have a bad feeling about this.

259
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,680
I have been thinking as well.

260
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
Thinking what?

261
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,960
I think Dr. Param cares for you more than

262
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,120
the boss should for his employee.

263
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,920
Huh?

264
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,680
Hey.

265
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,000
You're saying...

266
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,240
he's in love with Faidam?

267
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,160
Impossible!

268
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
You.

269
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,920
You freaked me out when you said that.

270
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,120
And I wondered what

271
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,440
that Doctor would think.

272
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,040
I'm already freaked out.

273
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,000
It might seem impossible

274
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,800
for him to fall for Faidam.

275
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,800
But what if it's Lomdao?

276
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,600
You really think he knows?

277
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,880
I believe he knows

278
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,240
that Faidam is actually his fiancee, Lomdao.

279
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,480
Doctor had met Lomdao only once or twice.

280
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,640
Plus passing by.

281
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,160
Could he recognize her?

282
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,440
Looking in the mirror, I almost couldn't recognize myself.

283
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,280
There's no way he could.

284
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,280
What's that psycho doctor thinking?

285
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,680
Why are you standing in the balcony?

286
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,080
You feel better now?

287
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,400
You'll get the fever again.

288
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,120
I'm totally fine, Doctor.

289
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
Right.

290
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,800
You're a healthy one.

291
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,920
You could endure the sun, the rain,

292
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,960
and the heat.

293
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,560
Endure all kinds of situation.

294
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,480
Right.

295
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,080
Endure all kinds of situation.

296
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,280
Then...

297
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,000
When can I go home, Doctor?

298
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,840
You can do that tomorrow.

299
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Don't worry.

300
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,120
Can't let you procrastinate too long.

301
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,880
You have to make me work and make it worth your money.

302
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,640
- I know that. - Correct.

303
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,920
I did told my mom to cut

304
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,000
your salary to pay for medical fees.

305
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,160
There's also the food,

306
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,040
the gas for the car today,

307
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,400
and also the gas for

308
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,360
picking you up tomorrow.

309
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,800
Never mind, Doctor.

310
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,480
If you're going to be stingy, I can just walk home myself.

311
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,920
Okay, no problem.

312
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,360
Doctor!

313
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,960
Psycho doctor!

314
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,800
What kind of manly man can be this petty?

315
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,280
Don't you think I'll let myself be on the receiving end.

316
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,240
I'll get my revenge.

317
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,000
What's the matter, Madam and Miss Phon?

318
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,400
What is this, Faidam?

319
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,280
What is this, Faidam?

320
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,360
And this!

321
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,960
Brother said these were yours.

322
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,680
What's going on?

323
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,320
Don't tell me

324
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,800
that you're actually a thief in disguise?!

325
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,360
No. No, Madam!

326
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,960
It wasn't like that!

327
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,320
These things, they belong to...

328
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,240
to Doctor!

329
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,360
I don't believe you!

330
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,560
How could he have something like this?

331
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,080
Please believe me, Madam!

332
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,960
These things belong to Doctor!

333
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,480
If you don't

334
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,560
you can go up and check out Doctor's room.

335
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,000
Let's go!

336
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,120
Come along.

337
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,560
Faidam!

338
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,440
If this is false accusation,

339
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,200
I'll really fire you.

340
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,640
Follow me!

341
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,680
Param!

342
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Mom!

343
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Brother!

344
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,960
Why are you dressed like this?

345
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,640
Don't I look pretty?

346
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,720
See? These things really don't belong to me!

347
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,280
They belong to your son, Madam.

348
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,120
He's been hiding this for a long time!

349
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,200
But! He's busted, thanks to me!

350
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,720
Param!

351
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
- Mom! - Auntie!

352
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,640
Taew! Help!

353
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,600
Taew! Taew!

354
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,640
Taew! Help!

355
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,280
How about it, Doctor?

356
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,200
Pay back for what you've done!

357
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,320
Even if it's a dream, it's still funny.

358
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,120
If I really see him in drag,

359
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,880
I'll probably die from laughter.

360
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,480
You gay doctor!

361
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,360
So satisfying!

362
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,480
Just wait, if you bully me again,

363
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,720
I'll give a grand opening to hell!

364
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,280
What's she thinking?

365
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,640
Must be the fever.

366
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,760
Hey.

367
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,840
Finished packing?

368
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,280
Yes.

369
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,200
All done, Doctor.

370
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,200
Shall we go?

371
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,120
You think I'm picking you up?

372
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,480
Not picking me up?

373
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,080
What's going on?

374
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,600
Yesterday you said you'll go home on your own.

375
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,800
I'm only here to pay the bills.

376
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,080
Then I'll head back.

377
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,480
Hey.

378
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,000
You have to come anyway.

379
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,400
You're still charging me the gas?

380
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,720
How can you be so stingy?

381
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,240
Doctor.

382
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,240
Doctor.

383
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
Doctor.

384
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,760
Doctor, Doc...

385
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,360
Thank you.

386
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,960
Faidam!

387
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,840
I'm very happy!

388
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,680
I miss you so much!

389
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,760
I didn't go to visit you yet.

390
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,920
How do you feel?

391
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,080
Enough.

392
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,320
Really.

393
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,520
I'm worried.

394
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,720
Madam was also worried about you.

395
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,600
She always check with Dr. Param

396
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,280
about your conditions.

397
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,680
What would you get from a guy like him?

398
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,680
Hey.

399
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,920
Did you know? When you were sick,

400
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,800
Madam told Dr. Param

401
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,440
to take you to the hospital.

402
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Madam is really kind to you.

403
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,280
What kindness?

404
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,760
Do you know?

405
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,560
Madam and Doctor will cut my salary.

406
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
Seriously?

407
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,440
Seriously.

408
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,560
The food, the water, the gas for the car,

409
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,360
his round trip, Doctor will charge me.

410
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,240
I came back on my own because

411
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,000
I don't want to be charged anymore.

412
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,920
Madam and Doctor are stingy.

413
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,800
But I think you're even worse.

414
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,280
Look at what you said, so detailed!

415
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,160
Not missing anything.

416
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,600
Fight fire with fire, you know?

417
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,680
Can't let them take advantage of me.

418
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,520
You're right.

419
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,080
- Right? - Yes, yes.

420
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,800
Hello.

421
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,240
Hey.

422
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,400
Faidam.

423
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,520
All better now?

424
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,080
Why did the hospital release you?

425
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,120
Not all better.

426
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,600
But I couldn't take too many days off.

427
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,880
I'm afraid someone

428
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,120
will say I'm procrastinating.

429
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,680
It's good that you know your job.

430
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,040
Now that you're better.

431
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,040
You can start cooking.

432
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
Brother.

433
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,720
She just got better.

434
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,800
She got released.

435
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,720
Which means she's fine.

436
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,720
Go and start cooking.

437
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,240
I've got a special guest today.

438
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,800
What special guest?

439
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,440
Why haven't I heard?

440
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,360
She's not really a guest.

441
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,840
Riga is joining us today.

442
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,760
She's my girlfriend, Mom.

443
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,920
It won't be long until we got married.

444
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,120
She'll be your daughter-in-law.

445
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,280
We should call her

446
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,520
"family".

447
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,840
I wonder what Grandma sees in him.

448
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,880
Why doesn't anyone see how mean,

449
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,200
stingy, disloyal and sly that ugly man really is!

450
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,520
Said he doesn't have a woman when he has one.

451
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,840
It would be over if you say so!

452
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,800
What's over?

453
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,120
Tell me.

454
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,040
Now you're speechless?

455
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,320
Well, what's over?

456
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,360
Over.

457
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,120
The drama!

458
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,400
The drama.

459
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,320
And "ugly man"?

460
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,960
Who?

461
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,440
Oh.

462
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,320
The motorbike taxi, my boyfriend.

463
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,240
- Really? - Really.

464
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,760
You're such a popular girl.

465
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,800
That motorcycle taxi,

466
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,040
plus a foreign boyfriend.

467
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,360
- Foreign boyfriend? - Yeah.

468
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,120
Foreign boyfriend.

469
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,200
You were writing to on the dating page.

470
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,400
Don't you remember?

471
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,680
Oh.

472
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,720
You're right.

473
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,880
My boyfriend.

474
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,960
What a player.

475
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
Doctor.

476
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,040
Are you into something different?

477
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
Doctor.

478
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,720
You like me, don't you?

479
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
Or

480
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,960
you've actually fallen for me?

481
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,280
That's right!

482
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,640
You've really fallen for me.

483
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,280
If not, you wouldn't be

484
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,720
chasing after me like this.

485
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,920
Diverting your eyes.

486
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,520
I must be right.

487
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,240
Why didn't you tell me

488
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,160
you're in love with me?

489
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,160
Doctor!

490
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,920
Why are you surprised?

491
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,840
I thought you want me to do this.

492
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,840
Don't you want to hear it?

493
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,560
I wish to know

494
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,960
how I feel about you as well.

495
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,360
Don't, Doctor.

496
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,040
Doctor! Doctor!

497
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,120
Here you are, I couldn't find you inside.

498
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,800
Were you two talking?

499
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,280
It's nothing.

500
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,800
Doctor just gave me an order

501
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,600
to make a special meal for Miss Ega.

502
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,240
It's Riga.

503
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,680
Yes.

504
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,440
Miss Riga.

505
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,240
Very cute, thank you.

506
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,240
Then you should start, I'm quite hungry.

507
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
Hello.

508
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,120
You dare stepping here again?

509
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,160
Why can't I?

510
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,800
Well.

511
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,720
My boyfriend lives here.

512
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,560
As Miss Riga knows.

513
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,560
Our family is no longer the same.

514
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,760
Love isn't about the wealth.

515
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,280
I love him because he's nice.

516
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,720
If he's poor, I'll still feel the same.

517
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,320
Oh oh.

518
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,680
What's wrong?

519
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,040
I'm exhausted.

520
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,000
Sit down, rest your legs.

521
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,320
I'm exhausted.

522
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,160
Exhausted, tired, exhausted, tired, which is it?!

523
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,400
Just serving water make you this tired?

524
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,360
Alright, I'll serve the food then.

525
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,520
Take a rest.

526
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,240
Exhausted, tired, exhausted, tired, which is it?!

527
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,200
So confusing.

528
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,720
I made it that clear to her.

529
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,160
Do you think your mom

530
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,200
will cancel the marriage?

531
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,280
I'm not so sure.

532
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,560
She loves and adores Dao quite a lot.

533
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,000
No problem, I'll do my best.

534
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,360
I won't ever let you marry that

535
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,400
boring face of a fiancee.

536
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,200
I'll head back now.

537
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Faidam!

538
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,480
What is it, Miss Ega?

539
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,200
Could you open the gate for me?

540
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,240
See you later.

541
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Yes.

542
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,840
Drive safely.

543
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Hey, you.

544
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,080
Come here.

545
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,760
Didn't you hear me? Come here.

546
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,480
You called?

547
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,920
Yes, I called you.

548
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,800
You were standing there

549
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,200
of course I'd call you.

550
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,680
I wouldn't know that you were calling me.

551
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,640
I only heard you go "You".

552
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,800
I was looking

553
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,160
but I don't see anyone named "You".

554
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,200
I called you, Faidam.

555
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,680
You don't even realize it, how stupid.

556
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,160
Here.

557
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,600
What's this?

558
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,040
I'm hiring you

559
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,920
to chase relatives of doctor's fiancee away.

560
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,160
How stupid? The guy doesn't even want her, they're still shameless.

561
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,880
The whole family is shameless

562
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,120
that Lomdao, too.

563
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,200
Hey.

564
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,200
Take it, this is 3,000 baht.

565
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,680
It's a lot, huh?

566
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,480
This is probably your first time

567
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,640
seeing this much money.

568
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,680
Take it all.

569
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,880
Sorry, Miss Ega.

570
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,920
I've watched many dramas since I was young.

571
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,400
You can't do this.

572
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,760
Because I am the heroine.

573
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,200
I'm not a villain like Miss Ega

574
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,440
That either dies

575
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,160
or goes to prison in the end.

576
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Hey!

577
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,480
You've insulted me and jinx me as well?

578
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,520
Yes!

579
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,520
Actually, you might be even more stupid

580
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,880
than doctor's fiancee.

581
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,040
If they're engaged

582
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,360
that can only mean

583
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:24,440
Miss Ega shamelessly stole her boyfriend.

584
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,200
How was that, Miss Ega?

585
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,160
Faidam! You're asking for it.

586
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,320
I'll tell Doctor

587
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,240
that you insulted me and kicked me.

588
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,920
Please do.

589
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,000
So I can tell Madam that

590
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,000
you hired me to chase away

591
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,200
Miss Lomdao's relatives.

592
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,000
Faidam!

593
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,960
Once I get married to Doctor

594
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,600
I'll fire you first!

595
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,480
I'll be waiting.

596
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,880
Oh.

597
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,920
Don't make me wait too long.

598
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,200
Faidam!

599
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,320
Remember!

600
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,360
You're dead.

601
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,400
Sure.

602
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
Doctor.

603
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,760
You should've listened to Riga

604
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,560
because I'll never marry my fiancee.

605
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,120
She probably doesn't want to marry you too.

606
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,000
Why do you seem like you understand her well.

607
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,280
Who exactly are you, Faidam?

608
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,680
Oh, Doctor.

609
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,040
Who else could I be?

610
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,200
I am Madam's cook.

611
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,840
You're talking weird, Doctor.

612
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,400
Weird?

613
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,560
Yes.

614
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,080
I think it's your behavior that's weird.

615
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,840
You think for

616
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,280
and get angry for my fiancee.

617
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,360
I can't help but think...

618
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,640
that you're actually Lomdao.

619
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,800
Doctor.

620
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,200
You and your crazy talk.

621
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,760
If not.

622
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,560
Then you must be close to her.

623
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,640
You're...

624
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,080
You're wrong, Doctor.

625
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,920
I have never met or seen her at all.

626
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,360
What a pity.

627
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,640
Maybe if you know Lomdao

628
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,480
you might be able to tell her on my behalf

629
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,320
that I'd never leech off a woman.

630
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,120
Hello.

631
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,600
Hello, Auntie.

632
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,960
Miss Dao?

633
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,520
Yes, it's me.

634
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,560
Miss Dao, please come back.

635
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,280
Did you know that

636
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,520
you've made everyone's head spin.

637
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,640
If Grandma still insists on the marriage

638
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,600
then I still can't return.

639
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,480
Please tell me,

640
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,560
what's not good about Dr. Param?

641
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,760
Grandma.

642
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,600
Stop hiding from me.

643
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,320
And tell me truthfully.

644
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,600
What's not good about Dr. Param.

645
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,360
If you can tell me,

646
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,240
I'll call off the marriage.

647
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,640
He's selfish,

648
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,320
sharp tongue, look down on others.

649
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,960
And he already has a girlfriend.

650
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,680
Besides he insists that he will never ever marry me.

651
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,520
You've spoken with him before?

652
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,480
Even if I never talked, I still know.

653
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,960
He announces about his girlfriend on TV.

654
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,040
That's humiliation on our part.

655
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,560
Do you still want me to marry him?

656
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,880
And how did you know that?

657
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,000
Oab, the signal is terrible.

658
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,760
Hello?

659
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,760
Dao?

660
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,680
I can't hear you.

661
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,960
I have to go now.

662
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,720
I can't hear you, goodbye.

663
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,240
She hanged up.

664
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,120
The same old trick.

665
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,680
It's really suspicious.

666
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,320
She acts as if she has spoken to Dr. Param before.

667
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,760
You're right, Grandma.

668
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,080
Could it be

669
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,360
there's a spy?

670
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,200
Oh, you're right.

671
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,840
Otherwise she wouldn't

672
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,240
have known in details.

673
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,600
Yeah.

674
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,520
Grandma.

675
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,160
I must warn Doctor.

676
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,720
Angkab.

677
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,200
Yes.

678
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,680
Yes, Grandma?

679
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,160
You called me, Grandma?

680
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,200
Stop acting as a spy for Dao.

681
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,120
No, I didn't.

682
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,640
I never told her.

683
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,200
I was never a spy for Miss Dao at all.

684
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,280
- Never! - Do you expect me to believe that?

685
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,920
You must believe me.

686
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,000
I'm begging you, Angkab.

687
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,160
Yes, Grandma.

688
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,760
Stop telling Dao what I'm about to do.

689
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,920
Unless you don't want her to get married.

690
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,240
And have a good person to look after her.

691
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,320
I'm already old.

692
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,560
Huh?

693
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,960
How much longer can I take care of her?

694
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,760
Hey, I'll be honest with you.

695
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,600
Grandma and I

696
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,440
are suspecting Dao of sending a spy into your house.

697
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,960
Otherwise,

698
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,720
there's no way she could've known our actions.

699
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,080
Be careful, alright?

700
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,240
You just found out?

701
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,240
What do you mean?

702
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,120
There's no spy or anything.

703
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,320
Your sister...

704
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,960
disguised herself and enter my house.

705
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,080
Wait up, Doctor.

706
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,200
Don't tell me

707
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,400
that Dao

708
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,560
is already in your house under a disguise?

709
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,560
That's right.

710
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,360
What made you so sure?

711
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,400
What is this wallet?

712
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,880
Don't tell me this belongs to Dao.

713
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,920
You know my sister is a socialite.

714
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,120
There's no way she'll use this.

715
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,920
Right, Dao won't use it.

716
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,720
But my cook named Faidam uses it.

717
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,720
So, what are you trying to say?

718
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,000
I'm getting more confused.

719
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,720
Your sister...

720
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,600
disguised herself as a cook at my house.

721
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,880
This would be a hard evidence.

722
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,960
To prove that your sister

723
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,120
and my cook, Faidam,

724
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,360
is the same person.

725
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,160
But why would she do this?

726
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,720
That's something

727
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,200
you'll have to ask her yourself.

728
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,520
I'll drag her out and have a good talk.

729
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,800
Wait.

730
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,080
Don't tell her yet.

731
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,600
I don't want her to find out yet.

732
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,080
I'm curious about what she has planned.

733
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,880
Is that a good idea?

734
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,360
Sure.

735
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,440
Why does she have to

736
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,720
do something like this.

737
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,440
It's alright, just pretend you're clueless.

738
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,920
Also, don't let your family knows.

739
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,920
I don't want them to be worried.

740
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,320
Another thing.

741
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,560
I also want to know what's

742
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,400
going on inside your sister's mind.

743
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,800
Are you sure this is a good idea?

744
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,360
Of course.

745
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,800
I'm your sister's fiance.

746
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,680
I have the right to get to know her before marriage.

747
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,440
To see if we're compatible or not.

748
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,480
- Take good care of the house. - Yes.

749
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,280
Let's go, honey. We're taking too long.

750
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,880
Oh, that's Oab!

751
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Mom!

752
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,680
Why are you suddenly back?

753
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,640
We're about to go Bangkok.

754
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,280
Why?

755
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,040
To punch that Dr. Param.

756
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,440
He already has a woman and dares to ask for Dao.

757
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,800
Jeez! Stop it right there, there's no need to.

758
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,880
Your daughter is a troublemaker.

759
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,480
I'm so tired.

760
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,760
What trouble Mom?

761
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,680
She disguised herself as a cook at Doctor's house.

762
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,960
- What?! - What?!

763
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,160
What's your feeling towards Dao.

764
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,200
(Next episode.)

765
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,080
I'm going to Ubon Ratchathani.

766
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,160
What?!

767
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,960
I want to talk to her.

768
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,520
- About the marriage. - Doctor.

769
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,640
I'm glad to see you again.

770
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,200
You sound as if

771
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,800
we've known each other before.

772
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,280
Only one glance...

773
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,600
and I recognized you.
