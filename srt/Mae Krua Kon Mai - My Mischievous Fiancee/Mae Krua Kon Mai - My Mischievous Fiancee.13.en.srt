1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,920
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,640
Big problem!

3
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,800
What kind of problem?

4
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,720
- Oab is coming! - What?!

5
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,600
(Previously...)

6
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,240
I'll wait for Faidam here.

7
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,240
Please take the doctor home.

8
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,520
Buab. I'm really sorry.

9
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,240
I think I should head back.

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh.

11
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,360
All of this on my own?!

12
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,200
I have a way to get that ugly Doctor out of here.

13
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,160
Hello.

14
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,040
Taew, help me.

15
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,520
You see...

16
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,560
- I'm stuck in the sauna spa - Huh?

17
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,880
and can't go anywhere.

18
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,160
Dr. Param is guarding like a dog.

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,080
I can't get out, please come to help me.

20
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,840
What should I do then?

21
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,200
Doctor!

22
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,200
Doctor.

23
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,400
It's terrible, there's a big problem.

24
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,600
What is it, Taew?

25
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,960
The hospital calls that there's an emergency case. They need you to go.

26
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,760
Please get going, Doctor.

27
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,600
Usually, the hospital will directly call to my cellphone.

28
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,000
Perhaps it's prank call.

29
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,960
I don't think it's from the hospital.

30
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,240
I guess so...

31
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,680
Then, I'll return first...

32
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,320
Okay, Doctor?

33
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,360
You're doomed, Faidam.

34
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,480
- What did you just say? - Huh?

35
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,440
- Oh no, I left the water boiling. - Oh.

36
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,520
I need to get going now.

37
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
- Okay, Doctor? - Yes.

38
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
Mr. Wat.

39
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,120
Faidam.

40
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,520
Oh! Baby.

41
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,320
I thought you said you can't come?

42
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,720
When grandma Pathum left...

43
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,520
Blend peppers.

44
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,720
Oh! The vegetables!

45
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,080
I haven't done washing them.

46
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,560
Taew.

47
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Taew!

48
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,720
Pisamorn, turn off the water.

49
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
Hey, stop!

50
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
Madam!

51
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,920
- Madam. - You don't have to cook them anymore.

52
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,080
Put everything in the freezer and cook them when she comes again.

53
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,760
Now, you just cook two dishes of...

54
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,560
Stir-fried pork with basil and fried egg for me and Phon.

55
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,040
Stir-fried pork with basil and fried egg...?

56
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
Hello.

57
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,080
Taew, help me.

58
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,920
But Doctor didn't buy it.

59
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,320
What should we do?

60
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,960
Those two will end up being dried meat in the spa sauna.

61
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,560
They're as good as dead!

62
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,320
Oh! Mr. Wat.

63
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
Hey!

64
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,960
Madam.

65
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,680
Baby, I have an idea.

66
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,920
- Madam - Buab.

67
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
Here.

68
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,200
- Madam. - Hi.

69
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,840
Take the stuff out from the car.

70
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,080
- Madam - Hurry, before the food spoils.

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh, Madam!

72
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,280
Why didn't I say it?

73
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,600
Oh no!

74
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Wat!

75
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,800
Why didn't you unplug when you go outside?

76
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,080
The house will be on fire!

77
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,320
Oh!

78
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
- Doctor. - Yes.

79
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,960
Are you here to see Wat?

80
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,120
Yes, but it's fine.

81
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,720
- I'll come back another time. - Okay.

82
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,920
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

83
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,600
Do you want to leave Wat a message?

84
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,920
No, thank you.

85
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,320
Dr. Param has finally left.

86
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,640
Buab!

87
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,240
Buab come here, hurry!

88
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,360
- Come and help me. - Madam!

89
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,160
Buab, come here!

90
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,120
Faidam! Come out.

91
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,360
Wat!

92
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,240
What are you guys playing?

93
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,840
You almost died.

94
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,080
Yes, Mom.

95
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,160
Buab, hurry up!

96
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,680
Yes, Madam, I'm here.

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,280
Here, Madam.

98
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,680
Sorry!

99
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,680
Sniff it, Wat.

100
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,760
I'm so sorry!

101
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,760
Sniff it.

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,800
Can you get up?

103
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,560
Wow...

104
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,480
I think Doctor is...

105
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,600
Buab, go put the stuff away.

106
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,120
You're on your own.

107
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,400
- I'm going to put the stuff away. - Okay, Buab.

108
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,400
Sorry, Faidam!

109
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
How clumsy!

110
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:17,040
Hey, I think Doctor probably knows.

111
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,320
That's why he sat there guarding you.

112
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,440
You're right, Mom.

113
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
Hey.

114
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,200
I think he's toying with you.

115
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,560
He's trying to get back at you.

116
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,000
Trying to get back at me...

117
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,280
Why would he try to get back at me?

118
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,480
When he's only met Lomdao for a few times.

119
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,000
There's no way he knows

120
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,120
that Faidam and Lomdao are the same person.

121
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Yeah.

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,800
But why would he pull a prank like that?

123
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,760
Why wouldn't he?

124
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,840
He hates me too much.

125
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,240
If it was on purpose,

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,960
that means he knows you're in here.

127
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,400
I think we need to be extra careful.

128
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
Seriously.

129
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
Hey.

130
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,200
You're right.

131
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
Hey, Dao.

132
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,240
You'd better head back now.

133
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,840
Go.

134
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,280
- Oh, Mom, I'm going to faint again. - Oh, Wat!

135
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,360
Oh, come, give me the fan.

136
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,800
Oh, gosh.

137
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,000
Auntie, I'm going to go prepare lessons

138
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,320
for tomorrow's class.

139
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,360
Sure, I'll have Taew come clean here.

140
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,840
What is it, Param?

141
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,160
I want to know what you're up to.

142
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,080
I'm up to what?

143
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,240
About your debt that will get our house seized.

144
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,400
Oh! That?

145
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,480
Well, I owe money in the card ring.

146
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,480
Hold on, let's talk later.

147
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,440
I'll call Taew to take the plates away.

148
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,400
This was actually your plan, right?

149
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,960
What plan?

150
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,040
I am a naive person,

151
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,040
why would I be scheming anything?

152
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,560
Riga and I will not break up so easily.

153
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,440
Do you want to bet?

154
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,000
If she dumps you because of the debt

155
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,480
you must marry Lomdao.

156
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,480
How about that?

157
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,000
If Riga stays with me

158
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
what will you do?

159
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,800
If Riga still insists on staying with me

160
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,320
even though I have a huge debt.

161
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
What will you do?

162
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,320
Nothing.

163
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
Mom.

164
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,240
The reason I didn't answer you is because I am confident

165
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,920
that a woman like Riga

166
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,080
will never marry a penniless man.

167
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,200
Plus a huge debt

168
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
I guarantee you she'll sprint away.

169
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,680
Just break up with her, son.

170
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,280
And marry Lomdao.

171
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,680
A good woman like Lomdao

172
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,840
isn't there for a choice.

173
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Huh?

174
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,800
Drowning in debt?

175
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,840
Are you going to break up with him?

176
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,880
Of course I want to,

177
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,560
but I still haven't found the next prey.

178
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Besides,

179
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,480
I spent tons of money creating

180
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,600
sensational news of me dating a socialite.

181
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,080
What a waste of money.

182
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,320
You had a paparazzi follow your every step.

183
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,480
Sending photos to every gossip news coverage.

184
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,640
I surrender to you.

185
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,160
You know so well.

186
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,320
No need to go in every detail.

187
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,040
Thanks for the compliment.

188
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,600
So, you're not going to break up then?

189
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Yeah.

190
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,280
Then why do you look upset?

191
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,720
I'm not going to break up

192
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,600
but his mom is trying to break us up.

193
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,080
She hates my guts.

194
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,440
She won't accept me as a daughter-in-law.

195
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,160
Winning over a mother-in-law's heart

196
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,240
is very easy.

197
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,080
- How? - You've been acting for too long,

198
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,360
even if it's just playing as a supporting actress but you already know

199
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,160
that everyone likes the heroine.

200
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,640
No one likes the villain.

201
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,760
You're beautiful and have a good figure.

202
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,160
All heroine's qualities.

203
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,000
Try acting prim and proper

204
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,960
create a heroine's image,

205
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,240
your mother-in-law will surely warm up to you.

206
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,880
Most importantly,

207
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,240
you must quickly release news

208
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,640
that you and Dr. Param are dating with marriage in mind.

209
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,160
Why does he never sleep?

210
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,160
I was going to sketch in Wat's room

211
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,200
but I have to see his stupid face again.

212
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,280
Faidam.

213
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,160
Yes, Doctor?

214
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,880
Where are you going?

215
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,640
I'm out for a stroll.

216
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,000
I also workout just like you.

217
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,040
But I don't have exercise machines like you do.

218
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,040
So I can only work out like this.

219
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,440
So, why are you out here, Doctor?

220
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,960
I got tired from working out

221
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,080
so I came to get some air.

222
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,440
Then, go ahead and get your fresh air.

223
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,000
As well as PM 2.5 pollution.

224
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Faidam.

225
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,160
Yes, Doctor?

226
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,000
Where are you going?

227
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,800
I am meeting my boyfriend.

228
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,440
We plan to have a hot pot dinner.

229
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,280
You have a foreign boyfriend,

230
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,480
a motorbike taxi boyfriend,

231
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,080
and now you have another one?

232
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Why do you have so many boyfriends?

233
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,880
What about you, Doctor?

234
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
Have you chose who to love yet?

235
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
Between

236
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
your fiancee

237
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,200
or

238
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,400
Miss Ega.

239
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,720
If I chose my fiancee

240
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,200
do you think she'll agree to marry me?

241
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,400
Does she want you, Doctor?

242
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,520
Did you ask her yet?

243
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
Not yet.

244
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,400
But I think I would like her.

245
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
Like...

246
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,560
Like who?

247
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,920
Lomdao.

248
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,400
You should go.

249
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,080
Your boyfriend is waiting.

250
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,520
Hey!

251
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,320
I'm alright, Doctor.

252
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,000
I can walk by myself.

253
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,400
Faidam.

254
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,160
I was going to ask you since last night.

255
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,120
Why does your skin look a little dry?

256
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,600
Are you going to the market?

257
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,440
Get in the car, I'll drop you off.

258
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,280
That's okay, I can go by my own.

259
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,400
That's not okay, I want to drop you off.

260
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,840
But I don't want to go with you.

261
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Why?

262
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,360
Are you afraid that your motorbike taxi boyfriend will misunderstand?

263
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,040
I'm afraid that Miss Riga will misunderstand.

264
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,200
The way you say that is as if you were Lomdao,

265
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,920
my fiancee.

266
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,440
You're talking nonsense, Doctor.

267
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,760
I'm going to the market.

268
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,600
What I said just now

269
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,120
do you have feelings for me?

270
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,880
I wouldn't dare have feelings for you.

271
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:02,120
I'm not Miss Lomdao or Miss Ega that you're fooling around with.

272
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,480
That's true.

273
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,480
Why would you be jealous

274
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,680
if you're not Lomdao?

275
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,320
Spouting nonsense again, Doctor.

276
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,880
Miss Lomdao is a socialite who grew up overseas.

277
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,440
I'm Faidam, grew up in the fields.

278
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,040
There's no way we're the same person.

279
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,000
How did you know

280
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,160
that Lomdao is a socialite who graduated overseas?

281
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:51,080
I'm just blabbering random stuff.

282
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,560
Madam wouldn't accept a daughter-in-law without money, right?

283
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,000
You're right.

284
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,320
Mom wouldn't choose a poor person.

285
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,440
Let's stop talking about this now.

286
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,720
Let's go, get in the car.

287
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,960
I'll drop you off.

288
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,560
Why are you standing still?

289
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,200
Get in the car.

290
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,840
I still haven't opened the gate.

291
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
How else are you going to get out?

292
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,720
Then open it.

293
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,760
Why are you looking at me, Doctor?

294
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,520
I just think that it would be nice if you were Miss Dao.

295
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
What?

296
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,240
So I can tell her directly that she doesn't need to hide.

297
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,800
I also don't want to get an arranged marriage.

298
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,760
Especially with someone,

299
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,600
who isn't willing like her.

300
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,200
Of course.

301
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,120
Because you want to marry Miss Riga.

302
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,440
Yes.

303
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,880
How could you know?

304
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,720
My mom still can't know.

305
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,800
My mom doesn't understand

306
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,320
that I want to marry Riga.

307
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,040
Not Lomdao.

308
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,280
Why didn't you tell Lomdao's family directly then?

309
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,200
I tried.

310
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,120
But no one listens.

311
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,240
That's why I want to meet Dao.

312
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,360
I want to tell her directly that

313
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,520
I don't want to marry her.

314
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,840
Not too long. I think,

315
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,360
you will definitely meet Miss Lomdao soon.

316
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,760
Stop the car, I'm getting down.

317
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,320
Thank you so much, Doctor.

318
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,360
For letting me catch a ride with you.

319
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,000
It's alright, it's just a passageway.

320
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,320
Who would've thought he'd really mean it.

321
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,280
How cruel.

322
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,040
I'll have to crawl my way there.

323
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,560
Faidam.

324
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,080
You don't have to call me.

325
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,400
I won't get in your car, no matter what.

326
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,280
You dropped me here.

327
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,640
You're cruel and heartless.

328
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,320
There's no need to feel guilty.

329
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,400
It's useless.

330
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,400
When you want to do something,

331
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,000
you should think it through.

332
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,400
Because time, opportunity and words

333
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,400
have already passed.

334
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,200
So you can't get it back.

335
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,800
What are you saying?

336
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,640
The reason I called you is to tell you that

337
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,080
your mole looks bigger.

338
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,400
I think you should get it operated.

339
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,120
If it gets bigger,

340
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,680
it might become cancerous and be terrible.

341
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
That's all.

342
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,360
It looks the same.

343
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,520
Squid-face doctor.

344
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,600
Doctor just left me there.

345
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,360
I'm starving.

346
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,560
I haven't eaten anything today.

347
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,280
What should I do?

348
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,680
Would you like to buy a hot dog? Only 20 baht per piece.

349
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,120
Hi, our hot dog is only 20 baht per piece.

350
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
I'll take one.

351
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
Sure.

352
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Thank you.

353
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,240
If that doctor was a hot dog, I'd bite his head off.

354
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,840
So tired.

355
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,960
So tired, brother. I was running away from a crazy man.

356
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:23,160
Just ask if you want to eat. I was so scared.

357
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,720
Are you okay?

358
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,360
Why are you sitting down here? Aren't you embarrassed?

359
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,480
Get up.

360
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,520
I'm not embarrassed.

361
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,040
Why did you had me walk you to your car?

362
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,120
I wanted to ask if you'd like me to drop you off.

363
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,520
If not, I'll get to work now.

364
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,920
That's it?

365
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,120
Yeah.

366
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,760
No, I'll return by myself.

367
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,680
I still haven't bought anything.

368
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,440
And I don't want to be dropped during on the way.

369
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,280
- Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure.

370
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,920
I have money. I don't need to depend on anyone.

371
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Be my guest then.

372
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,080
What?

373
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,720
Have you changed your mind?

374
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,440
No, I meant every word I said.

375
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,240
But you should stop laughing at me already.

376
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,120
It's bad to laugh at others.

377
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,760
Faidam.

378
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,240
What?

379
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,960
Help me watch the back.

380
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,960
I want to back out.

381
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,760
Fine, just get inside the car.

382
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,320
No car in sight. Back up.

383
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,120
Hey.

384
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,560
- Are you sure you don't need my help? - Yes.

385
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,920
I have money, I don't need to beg you.

386
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,440
Where is my money?

387
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,040
Hey!

388
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,320
Where is my money?

389
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,800
Why am I so unlucky?

390
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,560
Sure.

391
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,000
If it's your treat, I won't miss it.

392
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,840
Tell Su, too.

393
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
Sure.

394
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,280
Yeah, see you soon.

395
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,760
Doctor.

396
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,320
You look happy today. You've been smiling from afar.

397
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,800
You also look happy, Doctor.

398
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,840
What's up?

399
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,960
Today, I'll have a meal with my juniors from college.

400
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,640
You know all of them.

401
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,080
Wat, Ji, Su.

402
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,640
But this time, Lomdao will be there.

403
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,960
Lomdao?

404
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,760
She is my special person.

405
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,760
Is that so?

406
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,880
But...

407
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,920
she doesn't feel the same way about me.

408
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,520
Why?

409
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,200
As I've said,

410
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,000
She is my special person but she doesn't feel the same way.

411
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,640
Lomdao is a very popular girl.

412
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,720
She found a boyfriend in America.

413
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,920
His name is Max.

414
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,880
When she came back here,

415
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,760
I thought I had a chance.

416
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,040
Did you pursue her?

417
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,720
How could I?

418
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,760
Su and Ji said the reason she returned

419
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,920
is to get married.

420
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,840
But I still have a chance

421
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,480
because she doesn't like her fiancee.

422
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,000
She seems hates him so much, and doesn't want to see him.

423
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,000
If I had to guess Dao's fiance.

424
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,280
He must be ugly,

425
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,480
selfish,

426
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,880
hideous,

427
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,240
has bad odor,

428
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,240
and his face must be awful.

429
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,280
Otherwise she wouldn't be so disgusted

430
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,760
and not wanting to meet him.

431
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,720
His face must be...

432
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,200
I'm sorry.

433
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,840
I have to meet my patient. See you later.

434
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,880
Oh!

435
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,360
Doctor.

436
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,040
Did you say all those crap about me?

437
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,720
Good thing I left her walk on her own.

438
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,000
She needs to learn her lesson.

439
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,400
Goodness, Faidam.

440
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,880
Why are you so unlucky?

441
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,000
You wallet is missing.

442
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,880
You didn't take taxi to home and get the money from us for the fee.

443
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,840
There's no...

444
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:04,080
Sorry, none of them will let me take a ride.

445
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,000
They said I smell bad.

446
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,080
They're afraid I will dirty their cars.

447
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,520
So you walk home under this sunny weather?

448
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:22,240
The market is very far from home.

449
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,600
Walking home from that distance is tiring.

450
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,000
You look all messy.

451
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,920
Go take a shower so you can feel refresh.

452
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,480
Aren't you going to scold me, Madam?

453
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,120
That I lost the money

454
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,840
and can't buy groceries.

455
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,920
I feel bad that the money was lost.

456
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,640
But it can't be helped.

457
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,600
You didn't do it on purpose, right?

458
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,360
This is why I always keep telling you two

459
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,200
that you need to spend wisely.

460
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,200
And don't spend extravagantly.

461
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,560
But when I say that,

462
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,640
you two gossip about me.

463
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,360
Go on, Faidam.

464
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,080
Go take a shower before I deduct your salary.

465
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,640
Yes, Madam.

466
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,240
Faidam.

467
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,280
Are you alright?

468
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,280
Yes.

469
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
Okay...

470
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,800
Faidam.

471
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,560
It's okay, Taew.

472
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,960
Okay...

473
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,880
She crawled like a reptile, Madam.

474
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,520
Taew, I think you should go check on her.

475
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,480
She doesn't look like she is alright.

476
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,400
(Tia Charoen Pharmacy 15 drug store)

477
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,800
I'll close the door.

478
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,120
Yes, Ji?

479
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,680
A banquet?

480
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,840
Of course.

481
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,280
I'll bring Dao there, don't worry.

482
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,160
Wat, you're still unwell. Are you going out again?

483
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,760
Mom, I need to let loose.

484
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,400
I nearly died in the spa sauna yesterday.

485
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,800
I need to chill for a bit.

486
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,720
Who are you calling now?

487
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,680
Calling Dao, Mom.

488
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,280
You're asking for trouble.

489
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,920
If Madam Pisamorn knows that we invited her maid out again,

490
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,520
we'll get in trouble again.

Faidam.

Faidam.

494
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,400
You were told to take a shower but you're sleeping.

495
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,640
Look at her.

496
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,040
The phone is ringing and you're not picking up. Sleeping like a log.

497
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,080
Faidam.

498
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,240
Hey.

499
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,560
Faidam.

500
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,640
You're burning up!

501
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Faidam!

502
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,280
Madam!

503
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,960
No one opens the gate.

504
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,480
Hello, sister.

505
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,080
I made dessert for you.

506
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,880
I cooked it by myself, sister.

507
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,960
- Thank you so much. - Yes.

508
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,520
Sister, there's something troubling me.

509
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,520
What is it?

510
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,000
You see, sister...

511
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,160
for the past few days,

512
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,320
my head itches so bad.

513
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,800
It itches like...

514
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,600
Did you know what I did?

515
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,320
I went to see a doctor.

516
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,680
Did you know what he said?

517
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,120
What did he say?

518
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,000
I got lice from someone close to me.

519
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,680
And what did you do?

520
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,440
Sister, I...

521
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,240
I went to my husband's room.

522
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,480
I checked his pillow

523
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,800
and I saw lice on his pillow.

524
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,680
That means you got it from your husband?

525
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,040
Yes, sister!

526
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,680
There's more...

527
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,640
my servant also has lice, sister!

528
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,240
That means the two of them...

529
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,080
They are having sex together, sister.

530
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,800
Women are scary these days.

531
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,240
Sister.

532
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,400
My servant is a man.

533
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,440
Madam!

534
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:21,280
There's a problem. Faidam is sick, she's sleeping like this.

535
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,800
Goodness!

536
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,480
Let's talk another time, okay?

537
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,400
Please go check on Faidam.

538
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,040
Madam, hurry up!

539
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,240
Quickly check on her.

540
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,320
Madam, hurry!

541
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,560
Hey. Taew, this isn't looking good.

542
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,120
Call Param.

543
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,520
Sure, Madam.

544
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:54,000
- Give the usual prescription. I won't change the medication yet. - Yes.

545
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,000
What is it, Taew?

546
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,680
Faidam has a fever?

547
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,600
She can't get up?

548
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,000
Okay, I'll hurry to go home.

549
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,840
What is it, Buab? Huh?

550
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,320
You look so surprise.

551
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,520
Taew just told me that Faidam got sick.

552
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,440
No wonder she didn't pick up the call. Thanks for telling us.

553
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,120
Oh, Wat.

554
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,920
Aren't you going to check on her?

555
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,600
She's fine.

556
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,760
She's so strong, stuff like this is nothing.

557
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,360
Mr. Wat, I know that Faidam can get away many times.

558
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,640
But she's seriously ill this time.

559
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,360
Buab.

560
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,000
If you're worried about Faidam like this,

561
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,920
Taew will be upset.

562
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,360
Let her be upset then.

563
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,280
Faidam is really sick this time.

564
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,680
Dr. Param is taking her to the hospital.

565
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,480
Huh?!

566
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,600
It's because she walked under the blazing sun for too long this morning.

567
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,320
That's why she's like this.

568
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,120
This is all because her wallet is missing.

569
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,920
- Doctor. - Yes.

570
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,200
Let me take Faidam to the hospital instead.

571
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,600
It's okay. Faidam belongs to this house, I'll take her to the hospital.

572
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,560
Mom.

573
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,360
Buab.

574
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,440
Do you think they'll end up

575
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,920
together like in dramas?

576
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,800
I also don't know.

577
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,840
I only know

578
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,120
that you and I

579
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,680
will end up together.

580
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,160
Up and down.

581
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,080
You're talking nonsense.

582
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,040
Mom.

583
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,520
At the hospital, they put saline on you,

584
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,840
wipe alcohol,

585
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,120
Dao's makeup will come off.

586
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,120
Goodness.

587
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,480
The secrets might have already been out, don't you think so?

588
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,400
Didn't you notice?

589
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,200
Dr. Param seems to be very concerned about Faidam more than he should.

590
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,400
I've already given her a shot,

591
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,800
she should feel better soon.

592
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,520
Thank you, Doctor.

593
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,200
Who is she?

594
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,640
My house's maid.

595
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,520
A maid from your house.

596
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,160
Is that all?

597
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,320
Why do you look so concerned?

598
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,960
I'll tell you later.

599
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,160
It's a long story.

600
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,040
Okay.

601
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,760
But I think you should have her

602
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,360
take a mental health evaluation.

603
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,360
I don't know why she applied black paint on her skin.

604
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,120
And then there's this mole.

605
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,000
Never mind her.

606
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,640
Let her do whatever she wants.

607
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,760
- Oh, Doctor. - Huh?

608
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,680
Please don't tell her anything.

609
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,880
Let her think that we're still clueless.

610
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,520
Fine.

611
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,640
I'll go check up on other patients.

612
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,720
Thank you.

613
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,160
I'll make you admit it yourself.

614
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,720
That's you are Lomdao.

615
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,120
Wrong side.

616
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,800
Cold.

617
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,840
I'm cold.

618
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,440
Mom.

619
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,120
Mom.

620
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,160
Or... you've actually fallen for me?

621
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,840
I wish to know...

622
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,840
(Next episode.)

623
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,600
how I feel about you as well.

624
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,880
Are you okay?

625
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,680
Thank you for helping me.

626
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,240
What is this, Faidam?

627
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,000
And this!

628
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,960
Brother said these were yours.
