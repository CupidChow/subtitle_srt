1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,880
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
(Previously...)

3
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,080
Is this how you'll play,

4
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,080
Lomdao?

5
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,760
Show everyone that I'm going to marry you.

6
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,760
Sure.

7
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,200
I will not let go of Doctor.

8
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,640
Because we are both so in love with each other.

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,320
There must be an evidence

10
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,080
of the debt or something that I can use as proof.

11
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,760
Shoot! He's here!

12
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,280
Hey!

13
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,160
How did you enter my room?

14
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,760
Doctor, please put on your shirt.

15
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Why?

16
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,440
This is my room

17
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,560
whether I wear something or not

18
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,680
is my business.

19
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
Hey.

20
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,200
Stop, Doctor.

21
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,680
You are crazy, Doctor!

22
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,200
Hey.

23
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,040
You're the crazy one.

24
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,600
You came in someone else's room and you keep screaming.

25
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,200
Why did you enter my room?

26
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,040
Doctor, please put something on first.

27
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,600
Please put something on first.

28
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
Why?

29
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,960
Does it make you heart beat?

30
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,760
Yes.

31
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,640
My heart shakes and I feel hot...

32
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
Huh?

33
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
Huh?

34
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,080
Hot tempered that's what!

35
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
Hey.

36
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,160
Why did you enter my room?

37
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,520
Miss Phon told me to come

38
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,920
put your clothes away.

39
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,280
So, I'm following orders.

40
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,280
Why do you keep asking me questions?

41
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,200
Hey.

42
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,240
Let me go, Doctor.

43
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,600
I'm going to leave.

44
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Fine.

45
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,480
I'll let you go.

46
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,320
Oh!

47
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,760
Doctor!

48
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,960
What are you doing?

49
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,200
Hey! Doctor!

50
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,360
Please don't do this!

51
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,600
Do you want to try something new?

52
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,640
Fine.

53
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,960
Come!

54
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
Hey!

55
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,200
I wanted to ask you

56
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,080
when are you going to leave my room?

57
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,960
Huh?

58
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,960
Didn't she said she was putting clothes away?

59
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,640
Nothing's changed.

60
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,840
There're no new clothes.

61
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,200
What are you up to, Lomdao?

62
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,960
You take off your shirt whenever you feel like it.

63
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,440
It's stuck on my mind now.

64
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
Doctor!

65
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,480
What are you doing?

66
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,880
Doctor!

67
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,040
Please don't do this!

68
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,080
You're just teasing me.

69
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,720
Crazy doctor.

70
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
Doctor.

71
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,920
Are people without lovers

72
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,960
considered mentally ill?

73
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,280
If they're not preoccupied by it or it doesn't affect their daily life

74
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
then no.

75
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,040
It depends on each individual.

76
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,800
But it does affect my daily life.

77
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,960
Because my mind is preoccupied by you.

78
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,440
Did you guys run out of water?

79
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,880
You guys seem a little thirsty.

80
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,920
- Riga. - I'll go buy some water for you.

81
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,120
Keep it for yourself.

82
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,960
Your parents send you to study not to hunt for husband.

83
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,080
Riga, stop it.

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,040
They're just kids.

85
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
But...

86
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,440
It's alright.

87
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,120
Let's go grab something to eat.

88
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,840
Fine, do you need me to help?

89
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,600
No, it's fine.

90
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
Okay.

91
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,760
This month's salary for you.

92
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,240
I really don't want to accept it.

93
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,000
But if I don't accept it

94
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,080
you'll hire someone else.

95
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,440
Consider it as a reward

96
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,200
for fighting with my mom.

97
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,720
Oh, by the way.

98
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,520
How did it go yesterday?

99
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,920
What did you mom say?

100
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,400
She's still not convinced that we're dating.

101
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,040
Is my acting no good?

102
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,680
I think

103
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,400
she just refuses to believe

104
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,880
that we would suddenly date.

105
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
That's okay.

106
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,040
I'll find a way to make her believe

107
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,680
that we're in love.

108
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,680
But Mom wants to eat with you tomorrow.

109
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
With me?

110
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,520
She's probably trying to find some kind of fault.

111
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,840
Because

112
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,160
she still insists on my arranged marriage.

113
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
This time

114
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,720
I will not fail for sure.

115
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Baby.

116
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,240
Are you mopping?

117
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,240
Let me help.

118
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Baby.

119
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,440
I already apologize.

120
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,440
I really didn't mean

121
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,960
to call you a floozy.

122
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,440
Wait, enough.

123
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
How about this

124
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,280
just tell me what you want, baby.

125
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,320
I'll get it for you

126
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,320
so you can stop sulking, okay?

127
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,520
I already told you

128
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,000
S size for shirt

129
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,440
L size for diamond ring.

130
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,080
Baby.

131
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,280
You know I would give you anything.

132
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,720
But the problem is that I don't have money.

133
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,440
Of course you wouldn't.

134
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,200
You used up money to buy alcohol, gamble

135
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,440
and this doesn't include going to soap land.

136
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,320
Almost hit my face.

137
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
Who told her?

138
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,520
- Hold on, Taew. - What?

139
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,080
- Come with me for a second. - Where to?

140
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,760
- Come with me. - Where are you taking me?

141
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
Be careful.

142
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,200
Where are you taking me, Buab?

143
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,280
Young man

144
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,720
how did you get in here?

145
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,800
This is a dead end.

146
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,880
Didn't the security guard chase you out?

147
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,120
My dream woman.

148
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,800
Look at those upper teeth.

149
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
Sister.

150
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,760
Please give me 20 baht.

151
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,240
I haven't ate yet.

152
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
Please.

153
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,400
Are you guys siblings?

154
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,440
Hey! Watch it.

155
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,320
Watch it.

156
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,840
Hey brother, you don't need 20 baht.

157
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,200
Come drink with me, it's my treat.

158
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,280
No, thank you.

159
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,760
I don't drink.

160
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,000
He doesn't drink.

161
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,360
Hey, brother.

162
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,800
I think you have a good physical attribute.

163
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,160
If you go play cards with me.

164
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm sure you'll earn more than 20 baht.

165
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,040
Let's go.

166
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,160
No, thank you.

167
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,480
I also don't gamble.

168
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,400
He doesn't gamble.

169
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,560
How about this.

170
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,440
Let's go to soap land with me.

171
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,840
You can wash up and make yourself clean.

172
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,040
You'll feel fresh.

173
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Okay?

174
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,760
No, thank you.

175
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,600
I also don't go to such place.

176
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,120
He doesn't go to such place.

177
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,400
Baby, look.

178
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,200
Let me touch you.

179
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
Baby, look.

180
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,400
He doesn't drink,

181
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
doesn't gamble,

182
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,200
doesn't go to soap land.

183
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,240
Look at his sorry state

184
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,120
and look at me, all clean and smell nice.

185
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,960
I also have a six pack, how's that?

186
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,920
Is this what you like, I have it too.

187
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,200
- Six pack? - Ringworm.

188
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,240
How about that, baby?

189
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,080
How about that?

190
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,920
How about that?

191
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,320
How about that?

192
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,360
I don't need money.

193
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,280
Please continue fighting, bye.

194
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,480
Yeah.

195
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,600
Do you still have the nerves to talk?

196
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,000
Drinking, gambling, going to soap land.

197
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,160
Come, I will arrange one for you.

198
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,120
Take that!

199
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,840
All in all!

200
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,160
I'm so sorry.

201
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,880
I'll never do it again.

202
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,840
Next time you go to soap land, tell me.

203
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,720
I'll let you swim in a bucket in the backyard, understand?

204
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,080
Yes.

205
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,040
Wait up, baby.

206
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,880
Baby, are you still sulking?

207
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,080
Hmm?

208
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,040
I told you, if you want to beg

209
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,680
S size for shirt

210
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,520
L size for diamond ring.

211
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,360
Baby.

212
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,640
You know I give you my everything

213
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,800
But I don't have money right now.

214
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
Buab!

215
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,160
Hey! How long are you going to keep at it?

216
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Long.

217
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,480
Then pack your belongings and

218
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,000
leave my house immediately.

219
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,040
Madam, I'm sorry.

220
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,480
You're always away when I call you.

221
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,200
Faidam, too, I don't know where she went.

222
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,520
Go, go watch the house

223
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,800
I'm going outside.

224
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,840
Yes, Madam.

225
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,960
Don't invite her out again.

226
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,920
Auntie, taxi's here.

227
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Oh!

228
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,640
Who did...

229
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,520
Oh! Grandma.

230
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,520
Grandma, why are you throwing cans?

231
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,520
It hurts.

232
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,880
Great!

233
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,760
So you can remind yourself not to act

234
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,600
like a dog craving for canned food.

235
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,520
Grandma called me a dog?

236
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,840
Yes, you little puppy.

237
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,520
Why did you call me a dog?

238
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,960
Is it not true? Huh?

239
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,040
Once you knew that Uayphon was coming

240
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,280
you're waiting in the front porch drooling.

241
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,160
Better than you, Grandma.

242
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,760
Once you knew that Auntie was coming, you were flapping your wings

243
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,520
If you were chewing betel nuts, you would be drooling, too.

244
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,680
Oab!

245
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,080
You smart-ass.

246
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,880
If you're so tough then quickly win over Uayphon.

247
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,240
You're so tough, huh?

248
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,320
Grandma, that's going to hurt!

249
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,960
That was lucky, Grandma.

250
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,120
Uayphon used to be a drum majorette before.

251
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,600
- Auntie! - Pisamorn!

252
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,560
Auntie.

253
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,880
Grandma.

254
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,120
Auntie.

255
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,800
Acting like you're not doing to make it

256
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,880
don't be a such scaredy cat.

257
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,640
Who can endure ten rings of tiles

258
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,040
and feel nothing like you, Grandma?

259
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,760
You missed, Grandma.

260
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,800
Please don't blame Oab, Grandma.

261
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,120
How about this.

262
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,240
Let's just say I will act like

263
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,480
T-A-O.

264
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,360
What's TAO?

265
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,560
TAO is

266
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,080
Lasting beauty.

267
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,400
Forever beauty.

268
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,480
A beauty that will never die

269
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,960
or perish, Grandma.

270
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,600
- Oh! Faidam. - Huh?

271
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,120
No need to cook a lot.

272
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,120
Madam and Miss Phon isn't home today.

273
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,120
Huh?

274
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,600
Madam and Miss Phon aren't home?

275
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,200
That means

276
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,120
that psycho doctor is alone.

277
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,840
Huh? What?

278
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,560
I mean the doctor.

279
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,840
He's mentally ill.

280
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,640
One minute he's nice, then he's mean.

281
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,040
Just you wait.

282
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,040
I'll make a unforgettable meal for...

283
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,440
What, Taew? I'm not done speaking.

284
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,920
Hey, I'll make a unforgettable meal for that crazy doctor!

285
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,520
I guarantee you the menu I'm about to make

286
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,160
no one can ever forget it.

287
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,760
I confirm.

288
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,840
Eat up, Doctor.

289
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,840
I did my best.

290
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,160
They look delicious, Faidam.

291
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,880
I'll eat all of them.

292
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
Excellent.

293
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,120
Fish ball.

294
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,000
Why is it so spicy, Faidam?

295
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,080
Perhaps my cooking skill got worse.

296
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,840
Please try the fried pork with garlic instead.

297
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
I'm sorry.

298
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
It's okay.

299
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,120
This is also spicy, Faidam.

300
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,720
Oh!

301
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,800
Please try the vegetable stir fried.

302
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,280
It'll soothe the spiciness.

303
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,680
- It helps? - Yes.

304
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,480
I'll support your hand.

305
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,960
Definitely delicious.

306
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,760
It's so bitter, Faidam.

307
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,160
How can it be bitter, Doctor?

308
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,760
Please try this.

309
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,160
Red curry, Doctor.

310
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,960
I assure you it's rich and creamy.

311
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,040
What's wrong, Doctor?

312
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,520
Why is it so sour, Faidam?

313
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,920
Doctor, please don't drink the water yet.

314
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,920
I think you should try this dessert.

315
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,600
Let me feed you, Doctor.

316
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,960
Are you sure it's dessert?

317
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,320
Yes.

318
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,200
It's sweet like me, Doctor.

319
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,560
How is it?

320
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,360
Why is it so salty, Faidam?

321
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,000
It's like a bucket of salt.

322
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,120
Oh, Doctor.

323
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,160
Please eat these fruits.

324
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,840
These sweet fruits will

325
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,400
erase the saltiness away.

326
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,440
No.

327
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,040
It's going to...

328
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,120
- I can't hold it anymore. - What's wrong, Doctor?

329
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,760
Oh, Doctor!

330
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,000
Where are you going?

331
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,720
Come sit down first, Doctor.

332
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,440
You still haven't try the fruits yet.

333
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,920
I even peeled it for you.

334
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,000
It's going to...

335
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,880
What's wrong?

336
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,240
It came out...

337
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,360
Am I right?

338
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,280
This will surely cure you

339
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,360
of your psychopath.

340
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,240
Let's begin.

341
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,280
Vegetable soup needs a bit of vinegar!

342
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,120
Taew, hand me vinegar.

343
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,760
Taew, mustard.

344
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,840
This is delicious for sure.

345
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,960
Thank you.

346
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,720
Taew, bring the salt.

347
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,960
You'll get kidney disease, Doctor.

348
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,480
And this

349
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,680
secret recipe from the palace

350
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,920
from lonesome kitchen.

351
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,120
Laxative.

352
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,680
Deliciousness not guaranteed

353
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,520
but I guarantee your butthole with burn.

354
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,320
I confirm.

355
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,040
This is going to be good.

356
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,280
Food is served, Doctor.

357
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,520
I assure you this meal

358
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,080
will totally be to your liking.

359
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,240
I confirm.

360
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,240
Looks delicious.

361
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,960
Then please eat a lot, Doctor.

362
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,280
Faidam.

363
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,240
Yes?

364
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,560
What else do you need?

365
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,360
Join me.

366
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,280
Faidam.

367
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,640
- Yes? - Join me.

368
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,320
Join you for what?

369
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,440
There's no one home today.

370
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,160
Come and eat with me.

371
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,640
Sit and eat with you, Doctor?

372
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
Yes.

373
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,040
Taew, grab a plate for Faidam.

374
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
A plate?

375
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,400
Oh, doctor.

376
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,680
I'm not hungry, it's okay.

377
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,000
Taew, bring a plate.

378
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,200
Yes, a plate.

379
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,920
- Faidam. - Yes?

380
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
How long are you going to stand there?

381
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,040
Sit.

382
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,680
On the chair.

383
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,720
Hurry.

384
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
Doctor.

385
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,440
You see,

386
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,160
I am not hungry, doctor.

387
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,960
And I wouldn't dare

388
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,280
act equal to my boss.

389
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,200
It's okay, I don't mind.

390
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,840
Boss or servant, we're all humans.

391
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,440
Taew, bring a plate.

392
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,400
- Plate. - Here it is, Doctor.

393
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
A plate.

394
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,720
The other plate.

395
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
Plate.

396
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,840
Serve the rice, hurry.

397
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,920
- Faidam. - Yes?

398
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,320
Sit.

399
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,360
Or I'll fire you.

400
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,320
Fire this, fire that.

401
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
Enough.

402
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,840
Eat a lot.

403
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,640
You said it's delicious.

404
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,760
Come here.

405
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,120
I'll serve it for you.

406
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,840
That's too much, Doctor.

407
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,680
Is it too little?

408
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,680
This is enough, Doctor.

409
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
Eat up.

410
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,960
Or would you like me to feed you?

411
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,920
Didn't your parents teach you?

412
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,560
You shouldn't suck on your food.

413
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,840
Chew.

414
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Chew it.

415
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,400
All gone, Doctor.

416
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,880
Eat more.

417
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,280
Eat all of them if it's delicious.

418
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,800
I'll serve them for you.

419
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,040
Vegetable soup.

420
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Fried pork.

421
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,320
Eat up.

422
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,200
Is it good?

423
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,640
Hold on, Faidam.

424
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,160
- Yes. - Where you go?

425
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
Sit first.

426
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,240
You haven't finished your food.

427
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,520
I am full.

428
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,360
Don't waste your food, Mom will scold you if she sees.

429
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,200
I'll feed you.

430
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,760
A big mouthful, open up.

431
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,400
Not going to open up?

432
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,520
Open up, now.

433
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
Delicious?

434
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,360
Vegetable soup.

435
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,600
I can't hold it anymore.

436
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,800
Where are you going, have another bite.

437
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,520
I can't hold it, I have to go.

438
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,080
Faidam.

439
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,040
Faidam.

440
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,720
The medicine is in the cupboard, Faidam.

441
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,360
Your butthole will surely burn.

442
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,840
- Here you go, Auntie. - Thank you, Oab.

443
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,520
Riga

444
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,960
is always around Dr. Param, Pisamorn.

445
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,760
There's gossip about them all over the internet.

446
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,880
There are photos of them going out to eat, watch movie together

447
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,680
and meet at the hospital.

448
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,520
What would you like me to think?

449
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,520
Param and that woman are not dating.

450
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,600
That woman just sticks around

451
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,360
for spotlight, Grandma.

452
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,480
She used to be a nurse.

453
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,600
So they used to hang out for some times.

454
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,720
But they're not dating.

455
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,000
What she said isn't true at all, Grandma.

456
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,320
How should we handle that Riga woman?

457
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,760
In case you want more

458
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,040
I put it in a flash drive.

459
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,480
Thank you.

460
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,480
I'll let you know where I'm going next.

461
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,000
Stand by and wait.

462
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Alright.

463
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Yes?

464
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,360
Please help me publish the photos

465
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,120
you can write whatever you want for the content.

466
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,040
Yes.

467
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,040
I'll bring you some snacks.

468
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,040
Thank you so much.

469
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,520
Yes.

470
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,160
I can get attention

471
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,720
as well as the doctor.

472
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,360
This is totally worth it.

473
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,040
You see

474
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,080
regarding Riga, Grandma.

475
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,880
I think we can easily handle her.

476
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
How?

477
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,360
I'll have Phon deal with it.

478
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,440
How is Phon going to deal with her?

479
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,040
I plan to hire someone I know

480
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,280
to reclaim the debt and aunt Pisamorn's house

481
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,760
until not a single baht is left.

482
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,040
Are they up to the task?

483
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,920
When it comes to acting

484
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,000
rest assured

485
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,880
she was a former musical folk drama actress.

486
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,920
Oh.

487
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,840
If Riga doesn't truly love Brother.

488
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,200
I don't think she can stay with a penniless man.

489
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,960
I can't believe that a beautiful and sweet girl like Phon

490
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,440
can come up with an evil plan.

491
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,480
Oh?

492
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Hey.

493
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,320
Did you just insulted me?

494
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,120
No, Phon.

495
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,320
I was complimenting you.

496
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,880
Then you'd better compliment Auntie

497
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,000
because this whole plan

498
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,840
Auntie came up with it herself.

499
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,320
You're talking off the top of your head.

500
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,120
Phon.

501
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,960
What is Grandma up to?

502
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,800
It seems the prey

503
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,680
is actually Miss Dao.

504
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,000
Can I sit here?

505
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,680
Sure.

506
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,360
Phon.

507
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,080
I'm glad that I get to see you.

508
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,200
But I'm not.

509
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,120
What can I do to get to see your smile?

510
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,720
Easy.

511
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,480
Once you leave, I'll smile.

512
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,960
Phon.

513
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,400
Why did you say that?

514
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,800
I want to stay with you.

515
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,800
I want to spend my life with you.

516
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,200
Sorry

517
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,640
but I don't think of you that way.

518
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,520
You can say whatever you want to me.

519
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,560
You can be sarcastic all you want.

520
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,520
But I want you to know that

521
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,880
I can do anything for you.

522
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,440
Is that so?

523
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,480
Then can I have an unlimited amount of a credit card with the pin number?

524
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,520
Sure.

525
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,120
But under one condition.

526
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,480
You must change your surname to mine.

527
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
Oab!

528
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,600
Is that okay? If you agree

529
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,560
I would need a deposit.

530
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,440
Tomorrow we'll register our marriage.

531
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,640
Grandma!

532
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,600
What are you doing?

533
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,440
She's a woman.

534
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,600
Acting like a player like this

535
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,160
are you asking for trouble?

536
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,240
Grandma.

537
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,120
This is between young adults.

538
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,400
- And? - Not someone in her 60s like you.

539
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,040
- 60s? - Grandma.

540
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,560
Let me drop you off, Phon.

541
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,960
No, thank you.

542
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,680
- I came here on my own I can go back on my own. - Phon.

543
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,000
Why did you say that? Go back on your own?

544
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,360
Taxi fee is expensive.

545
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,360
It's better to let him drop us off.

546
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,120
Thank you so much.

547
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,240
How about this?

548
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,160
Can you please drop Phon and me off?

549
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Gladly.

550
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,080
It's our pleasure.

551
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,280
Hey!

552
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,840
What's the problem?

553
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,920
What's with the car?

554
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,360
A car is a car, Grandma.

555
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,120
Still making jokes at this hour?

556
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,600
Look at where your shortcut led us to.

557
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,000
What are we going to do now?

558
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,480
I thought it would be closer, Grandma.

559
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,000
Do something then.

560
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,640
Okay, I'll go check it out.

561
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,800
Where are we?

562
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,560
It's dark and remote.

563
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,080
Gosh, not a single car in sight.

564
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,600
Well?

565
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,400
I don't know, either.

566
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,680
I don't know how to check.

567
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,680
You little...

568
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,960
Why did you come to check then?

569
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,560
I thought I can help.

570
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,720
Look at where your idea has brought us to.

571
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,120
Do you even know where we are?

572
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,680
Grandma.

573
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,160
The atmosphere is quite scary.

574
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,800
Yeah, I know.

575
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,320
It's isolated.

576
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,800
It's...

577
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,960
as if...

578
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,720
like there's...

579
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,800
ghost!

580
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,760
I'm a human, not a ghost.

581
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,120
A human?

582
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
Damn.

583
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,640
Scared me to death.

584
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,600
Well...

585
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,240
It's good that you came by.

586
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,600
Can I ask you something?

587
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,760
Is there a car repair shop around here?

588
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,360
- Yes. - Where?

589
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,360
You'll have to walk pass the cemetery and you'll reach the shop.

590
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,520
Cemetery?

591
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,280
Yeah, cemetery.

592
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,680
Get going

593
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,920
or else the shop will close before then.

594
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,000
Thank you very much.

595
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,320
Shouldn't have come here.

596
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,360
How are we going to get there, Grandma?

597
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,160
You're right.

598
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,640
You guys staring at me like this

599
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,960
everyone except Oab is going, right?

600
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,040
You're the one who has to

601
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,520
go get the repair man.

602
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,560
Get going.

603
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,600
Grandma!

604
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,840
We came together, we should go together.

605
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,000
The more the merrier, Grandma.

606
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,480
You scaredy cat.

607
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,160
You haven't left?

608
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,360
Why did you come back?

609
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,080
I came to tell you that the car repair shop is closing soon.

610
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,280
Thank you so much.

611
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,120
Please go back.

612
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,640
You don't have to come back.

613
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,680
Fine.

614
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,320
Whatever happens, happens.

615
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,840
Let's go.

616
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Come.

617
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,640
Is that your fingers or a bear's claw?

618
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,000
- What?! - What?!

619
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,200
The purse is in the car.

620
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,400
Go get it.

621
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,040
Auntie, you're worrying about your purse now?

622
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,640
- How can I not worry? - Easy there.

623
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,680
Bring it here.

624
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,120
Come quickly.

625
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,280
That was so scary, Grandma.

626
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,120
We're deep in the forest, Grandma.

627
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,440
Why did you stop, Grandma?

628
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,520
What's that noise?

629
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,160
Let's go take a look.

630
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,000
(Mr. Khao Sam...)

631
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,840
Wait, what's that noise?

632
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,400
Grandma.

633
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,360
We've probably got cursed.

634
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,360
I don't think so, keep calm Pisamorn.

635
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,720
Let's take a good look.

636
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,440
What's that noise?

637
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,640
Hey.

638
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,840
It's a human, look.

639
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,480
- Since it's a human, I'll lead the way. - Okay.

640
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,120
Uncle.

641
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,440
Do you know where the car repair shop is?

642
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,680
In front up ahead.

643
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,680
Is it far?

644
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,240
We've been looking for it for so long.

645
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,600
We couldn't find it.

646
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,800
It's not far, I come here every day.

647
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,040
Really?

648
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,080
It's late

649
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,600
why are you still working?

650
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,760
It's because of those scoundrel.

651
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,760
They misspelled my name on my grave.

652
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,680
(Mr. Khao Sam-Ang)

653
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,280
They've misspelled his name.

654
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,560
Misspelled on your grave?

655
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,960
Yes.

656
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,560
Ghost!

657
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,440
Oh.

658
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,440
He's not a ghost.

659
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,080
Oh, well.

660
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,280
Thank you so much.

661
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,200
We've been trying to catch this person.

662
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,760
He likes to come and steal money

663
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,440
from the corpse's mouth every night.

664
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,640
Oab! Why are you so close to me?

665
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,960
I am already scared.

666
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,400
Sorry.

667
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,240
I am scared.

668
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,840
Easy there.

669
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,960
How are you?

670
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,720
You're still asking.

671
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,840
My butthole was destroyed.

672
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,040
See? As they say

673
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,400
"what goes around, comes around."

674
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,160
How about that?

675
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,200
Oh!

676
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,760
Hey!

677
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,400
It's here again.

678
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,200
Faidam.

679
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
Oh!

680
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,600
Faidam.

681
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,880
Faidam.

682
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,720
Faidam.

683
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,880
Faidam.

684
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,400
One, two, three.

685
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,400
This is your first lesson.

686
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,480
For you

687
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,280
there will surely be next time.

688
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,960
Faidam.

689
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,040
Luckily, he was just a thief stealing money from corpse's mouth.

690
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,760
Otherwise I would have died from shock.

691
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,120
Walk slowly.

692
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,720
Hey, Faidam.

693
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,440
What's wrong now?

694
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,520
You're all exhausted.

695
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,440
Could it be that when I wasn't here

696
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,200
you secretly went out?

697
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,440
I wouldn't dare do such thing, Madam.

698
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,880
Are you sure?

699
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,800
It's true, Mom.

700
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,240
She stayed at home all night.

701
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,560
Not even a step out of her room.

702
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,520
She only stayed in the toilet.

703
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,520
Why did you only stay in the toilet, Faidam?

704
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,440
Oh!

705
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,000
The breeze was a little chilly.

706
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,040
Oh!

707
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,040
Taew!

708
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,320
Hey, the other day

709
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,320
why did you obey Riga's order?

710
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,720
Because Miss Ega is Doctor's girlfriend.

711
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,000
So, I had to listen to her.

712
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,840
Faidam's right.

713
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,240
Riga is my girlfriend.

714
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,600
Faidam should listen to her.

715
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,800
You're right, Faidam.

716
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,760
Faidam, today Brother invited Miss Riga over for a meal.

717
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,480
Can you do the cooking?

718
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,400
Of course, Miss Phon.

719
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,840
I will do my very best.

720
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,600
But don't cook yesterday's dishes.

721
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,600
Yeah, sure...

722
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,680
The food served here is too normal.

723
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,000
It's not suitable for socialites.

724
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,000
How about this, Faidam.

725
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,520
Prepare a special meal for Miss Riga.

726
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,720
Of course, Madam.

727
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,520
And what would you like me to cook, Madam?

728
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,520
Anything that's expensive.

729
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,080
Around 20 baht.

730
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,400
Huh?

731
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,840
20 baht?

732
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,400
Someone like that

733
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,960
only 20 baht should be more than enough.

734
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,120
But if you want her to eat something nice

735
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,240
do it yourself.

736
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,640
I don't know why I would need to

737
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,280
spend anything on Riga.

738
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,840
Faidam.

739
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,640
Prepare something nice for Miss Riga.

740
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,160
Yes, Doctor.

741
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,600
By now

742
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,200
the award winning Oscar actress

743
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,480
from the moon still hasn't arrived.

744
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,080
Right.

745
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,320
Then

746
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,840
I'll go ask Brother.

747
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,640
Hello, Mom.

748
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,720
Did you finish filming your drama?

749
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,240
Yes, I'll be a little busy these days.

750
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,880
Oh.

751
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,440
What work?

752
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,560
I've never seen any.

753
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,800
I'm planning to go to London for a fashion show.

754
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,280
London?

755
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,760
Oh my.

756
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,840
They hired you?

757
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,720
Yes, something like that.

758
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,480
I'm thinking of going there to build my image.

759
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,000
And where's the doctor?

760
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,120
He went to the market.

761
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,960
He went to buy ingredients for your meal.

762
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,800
The doctor is so cute.

763
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,000
He takes such a good care of me.

764
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,960
He also asked me to take a good care of you.

765
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,720
Come inside, it's hot here.

766
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,160
Why are we talking here? Let's go.

767
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,880
Make yourself at home.

768
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,120
Yes.

769
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,280
Wow!

770
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,280
(Next episode.)

771
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,520
Shamelessly enjoying fancy food.

772
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,640
How could that debt be paid?

773
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,080
What debt, Mom?

774
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,440
Madam Pisamorn borrowed from us for gambling.

775
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,840
It's millions.

776
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,520
Next week,

777
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,920
they'll probably come and take it.
