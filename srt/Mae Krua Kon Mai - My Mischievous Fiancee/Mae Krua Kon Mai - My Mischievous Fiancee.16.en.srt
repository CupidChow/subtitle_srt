1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,840
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,440
Just be honest with me

3
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,440
how do you feel about Dao?

4
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,840
Can't you tell?

5
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,440
- I want to see evidence that Param's family tries to cheat ours - Sure.

6
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,880
- Ouch! - I'll take you to see a doctor.

7
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,520
(Previously...)

8
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,000
I actually live in this neighborhood area, too.

9
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,880
- Really? - Yes.

10
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,600
"Yes".

11
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,000
Speaking in Northeastern dialect, he's obviously flirting her.

12
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,480
You can speak Northeastern dialect.

13
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,720
But it's strange that I've never seen you around here.

14
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,120
My family runs a spa business.

15
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,920
Please stop by whenever you want to relax.

16
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,480
I'm merely a cook.

17
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,760
I don't have enough money for luxurious spa.

18
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,640
I'll do it for free.

19
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,920
Thank you.

20
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,080
- So, I'll walk you to the door. - Yes.

21
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,840
You're so nice, Mr. Atsawin.

22
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,880
I'll open it.

23
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,640
Can you manage it?

24
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,640
Sure.

25
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll be off then.

26
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,720
Yes, thank you so much.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No problem.

28
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,840
- Please get inside. - I will, you can get in the car.

29
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,920
- Go inside first. - Get in the car the first.

30
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,120
- Go in... - Get in...

31
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,760
How about this? You go inside and I'll get in the car.

32
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,920
- Otherwise, we won't go anywhere. - Right, let's do that.

33
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,320
- Get well soon. - Thanks, drive safe.

34
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,200
- Until we meet again. - Yes.

35
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,440
Faidam.

36
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,120
Yes, Doctor?

37
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,880
Why don't greet me when you see me?

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,720
What do you need me for, Doctor?

39
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
Nothing.

40
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,480
I just want to know.

41
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,960
If the one week you were home,

42
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,120
it wasn't just to visit your grandma.

43
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,960
You said you have boyfriends.

44
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,840
The foreign and the motorbike taxi boyfriend.

45
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,320
In the end, you go for the rich man.

46
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,240
What's your problem?

47
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,240
I saw a Benz man dropped you off.

48
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,920
"Please go inside the house."

49
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,320
"Please get in the car."

50
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,880
You weren't eavesdropping on me right, Doctor?

51
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,040
Right.

52
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,120
Mr. Atsawin...

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,040
He owns a spa home in this village.

54
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,880
He's handsome and rich.

55
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,480
Most importantly,

56
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,120
he's not stuck up.

57
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,720
Even when he knows that I'm just a poor cook.

58
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,200
Carefully, you'll be deceived.

59
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,160
There are lots of criminals.

60
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,000
They wear suits now.

61
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,040
You can't separate if anyone is rich or a criminal.

62
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,000
But I think I know that

63
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,560
who's honest,

64
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,240
and who's not.

65
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,960
Don't worry about me, Doctor.

66
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,280
I think you should worry about yourself first.

67
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,720
Between Miss Ega and your fiancee, who will you choose?

68
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,280
You don't trust what I told you.

69
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,600
Up to you then.

70
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,200
Are you a ghost?!

71
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,720
Keep disappearing on me.

72
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,800
Talking all smart.

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,440
Criminal in suits.

74
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,920
You're the criminal.

75
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,720
Trying to rob my family.

76
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,360
Faidam!

77
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,960
- Ouch! - Ow!

78
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,480
What's wrong?

79
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,840
A bit of an accident.

80
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,120
- Oh no, I'm sorry. - It's alright.

81
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,480
So, how was your grandma?

82
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,520
She's fine.

83
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,400
She just wanted some attention.

84
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,080
She must've missed you so much.

85
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,640
Have you greeted Madam?

86
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,920
She keeps saying how much she misses you in every day!

87
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,080
Also, complains that my dishes

88
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,280
shouldn't be considered as human food.

89
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,720
But she still...

90
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,800
eats them all up.

91
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,880
- Does that mean she's a... - Oh! Shh!

92
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,720
Not good, not good.

93
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,040
Don't say it.

94
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,360
Then I'll go to greet her.

95
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,080
Alright, I'll also tell Buab you're back.

96
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,120
Okay.

97
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
Miss Phon.

98
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,080
- Hello. - Faidam!

99
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,560
How are you? Have you greeted Auntie?

100
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,280
- Not yet. - Phon!

101
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,840
Don't make too much...

102
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,120
- Madam! Hello! - Faidam!

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,400
How's your Grandma?

104
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,720
When did you arrive?

105
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,080
Why didn't I see you?

106
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,120
I just arrived.

107
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,400
My grandma is feeling better now.

108
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,040
That's why I'm here.

109
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,040
I don't want you to think that I'm procrastinating.

110
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,560
Someone is sick.

111
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,840
I won't say you're procrastinating.

112
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,000
But what if it's to fool around with men.

113
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,880
Who's fooled around with men?

114
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,800
It's your favorite cook.

115
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,720
My favorite cook is fooling around?

116
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,040
My goodness.

117
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,760
Hey, her Grandma was sick.

118
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,160
She was caring for her Grandma.

119
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,640
Don't go spouting nonsense, alright?

120
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,360
- Faidam. - Yes?

121
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,080
Good thing you're back.

122
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,360
I'm sick and tired of Taew's and Phon's cooking.

123
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,440
Today, you should cook for us.

124
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,720
Of course, Madam.

125
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,480
I'll do it, easy-peasy!

126
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,880
So, Madam and Miss Phon can wait for me at the table.

127
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,080
The dishes will soon be done and served.

128
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,680
- Okay, okay. - Go on, Madam.

129
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,240
So lucky!

130
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,200
I'll hand this over.

131
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,280
Alright, I'll take it from here.

132
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,560
Don't think you can do anything because she likes you.

133
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,120
I know what you're doing.

134
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,120
You know what I'm doing?

135
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,400
Enjoy your food, excuse me.

136
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,960
So delicious.

137
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,320
Hey, Taew.

138
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,320
Yes?

139
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Faidam's cooking tastes and looks better than yours.

140
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,840
What? It's still here.

141
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,120
He probably hasn't figured it out.

142
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,440
Then, what does that ugly doctor think he knows?

143
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,320
I haven't worked for several days,

144
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,120
there are lists of unfinished works.

145
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,520
What unfinished work?

146
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
Doctor.

147
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
Doctor!

148
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,120
Is there nowhere else to stand?

149
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,280
Earlier, you were standing by the door.

150
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,360
Now, you're standing against the pillar.

151
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,760
Which one are you between a doctor or a thief?

152
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
Why?

153
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,600
It's my house.

154
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,920
I can stand or sleep wherever I want.

155
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,760
You got a problem?

156
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,280
You said there's work at Mr. Wat's house.

157
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,480
What is it?

158
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,440
Well, work...

159
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,200
What will you do?

160
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,280
I'll do...

161
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,440
Well... I'll do some house chores.

162
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,840
I took part time job at Mr. Wat's house.

163
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,520
And it's been a few days since I last worked.

164
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,160
So, I should do it before he says I'm not doing my job.

165
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,360
- Really? - Yes.

166
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
Go then.

167
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Faidam.

168
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
Yes?

169
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,440
The gate is that way.

170
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
Right.

171
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,600
Oh, I'm walking around to the gate.

172
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,680
- Is that tiring? - What?

173
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
Rambling on.

174
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,920
I won't let you live in peace, Dao.

175
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,680
I'm all done here.

176
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,520
I'll be there in two hours.

177
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
Bye.

178
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
Faidam's medicine.

179
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,840
Maybe it dropped yesterday.

180
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,040
Did she have other one to take?

181
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
Mr. Atsawin.

182
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,800
How's the wound healing?

183
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,480
All healed, it's nothing.

184
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,840
This morning I can start work just fine.

185
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,440
Are you sure?

186
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,080
You forgot this whole bag.

187
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,280
I can't lie.

188
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,800
I was wondering where it went.

189
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,320
Put on the ointment and take the meds.

190
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,480
Sure.

191
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,720
Thank you.

192
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,360
You're handsome and very nice.

193
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,800
Thank you.

194
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,520
Are you okay?

195
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,040
That is the guy from the event.

196
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,400
Does he know Faidam?

197
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Faidam!

198
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,320
You're so ready to make me work, Miss Ega.

199
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,520
I will call you whenever I want.

200
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,440
Because I am your boss.

201
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,280
Last time I checked.

202
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,760
My salary comes from Madam and Doctor.

203
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,680
Not you.

204
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,080
Whoever pays you is your problem.

205
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,400
But I'm Doctor's girlfriend,

206
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,560
which means I'm your boss.

207
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,680
A girlfriend not a wife.

208
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,920
You can talk once when you become his wife.

209
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,800
After I marry him,

210
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,240
you'll be the first one who I'll fire!

211
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,640
All you do is slapping people.

212
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,680
So not creative.

213
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,280
You've said this before

214
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,200
but I haven't seen it happen yet.

215
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
Wait.

216
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,560
Just now, who were you talking to?

217
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,040
I can't tell you.

218
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,840
I'm a bit possessive.

219
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,760
And I don't go around pestering people like you do!

220
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,560
Faidam!

221
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,920
Hello, Mom.

222
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
Hey, you.

223
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,360
You're so early.

224
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,240
Don't you have your own house?

225
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,640
Is that why you're here every day?

226
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,560
Well.

227
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,520
Dr. Param called me over, Mom.

228
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,160
I did call her.

229
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,240
I want to go out and eat something nice.

230
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,440
Is Faidam's cooking not so delicious to you?

231
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,480
Faidam.

232
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,760
Open the gate for me.

233
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,720
Let's go.

234
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,320
Latching onto him like a tick!

235
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,960
She wasn't just trying to slap.

236
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,240
But also threatens to fire me when she becomes Doctor's wife.

237
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,760
My God!

238
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,520
Her mouth's like a sewage.

239
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,560
She needs proper cleanse.

240
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,520
Was she asking you about Mr. Atsawin?

241
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
Yes.

242
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,520
From what I'm hearing,

243
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,320
he sounds like a handsome and rich man.

244
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,040
Yes, he is.

245
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,920
Wat, are you thinking what I'm thinking that Riga is looking for

246
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,480
a new prey to leech off?

247
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,920
No way, she's so in love with him right now.

248
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,080
This morning they went out on a date.

249
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
So sweet.

250
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,840
I wanted to puke.

251
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,360
Yes, I have already sent you the work.

252
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,480
If you have anything else, please email me.

253
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,680
I'll resend it as soon as I can.

254
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,040
Yes, I'm sorry it was late.

255
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,320
Sure.

256
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,560
Let’s have a meet up sometimes.

257
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,160
Yes.

258
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,160
Riga's car.

259
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,160
That's obviously fake.

260
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,880
Thank you.

261
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,360
I like being like this with you.

262
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,800
To be honest,

263
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,600
I don't want to go on with anymore.

264
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,600
You want to stop?

265
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,080
No.

266
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
But I…

267
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,520
want it to be real your lover.

268
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,760
I...

269
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,200
But...

270
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,440
I know.

271
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,200
You're going to say that it's impossible.

272
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,040
I just want you to know

273
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,360
that I really truly love you.

274
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,040
I will keep telling you

275
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,680
until you sympathize.

276
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,320
And understand that I love you.

277
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,360
Even if I'm broke.

278
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,600
With a huge pile of debt?

279
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,240
Yes.

280
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,800
I mean it.

281
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,760
I'm sorry, Riga.

282
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,680
I have to say

283
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,880
that it's impossible between us.

284
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,360
I do not love you.

285
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,200
Both of us can only be friends.

286
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,840
Never mind.

287
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,520
I'll wait for you anyway.

288
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,160
Evidence.

289
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,040
No! Why now?!

290
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,880
If the battery hadn't gone empty,

291
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,680
I would've exposed this ugly doctor's nature.

292
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,480
Pretending to be nice in front of Grandma to see.

293
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,880
But behind her back,

294
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,480
you're not just ugly face.

295
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,160
You've also got dirty mind.

296
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,080
Making out like horny dogs in the middle of the street.

297
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,640
I want to grab you and get you neutered.

298
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,920
Ouch! Ow!

299
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,440
Ow!

300
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,720
Ow!

301
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
Ow!

302
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,440
What's wrong, Faidam?

303
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
This…

304
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,560
I accidentally pressed too hard on the wound.

305
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,560
Here, give it to me.

306
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,280
Let me see, I can do it for you.

307
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,600
Your hand's also injured.

308
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,400
How would you do it by yourself?

309
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,600
It's alright, Madam.

310
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,160
I can do it by myself.

311
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,360
Just let me do it, come on.

312
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Ouch! Ow!

313
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,800
Why are you so clumsy?

314
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,960
What happened to you in these days? Bad luck?

315
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,480
You got sick and now you got injured.

316
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,520
Be more careful, alright?

317
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,360
Look at this, see?

318
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,840
Good thing it's not serious.

319
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,400
Mom is so good to you.

320
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,160
How could you think she's aiming for your money?

321
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
Hey.

322
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,120
It looks like Madam is concerned about you.

323
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,160
Right?

324
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,560
I never thought she would be this generous.

325
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
Look.

326
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,440
When I went to Ubon Ratchathani the other day,

327
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,360
she even gave me 5,000 baht for Grandma's treatment.

328
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,600
It's 5,000 baht?

329
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,320
That's more than your salary.

330
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,120
I know, how could that be possible?

331
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,200
There's more.

332
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,080
Whenever I leave,

333
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,080
she made sure I have her phone number with me.

334
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,240
Why?

335
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,480
As an amulet?

336
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,240
Shut up.

337
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,280
She said

338
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,480
when I'm lost I could call her to pick me up.

339
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,800
So generous, it's unbelievable.

340
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,640
Dao.

341
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,240
From now on, you should stop teasing

342
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,400
and challenging her.

343
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,840
That's my intention.

344
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,040
Hey, how were you able to come out today?

345
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,880
You also invited me to dinner as well.

346
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,720
Miss Phon is teaching.

347
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,280
Doctor is at the hospital.

348
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,760
Also, Madam is meeting up with her friends.

349
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,480
It's strange.

350
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,320
She made me prepare a bento for her.

351
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,440
Here.

352
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,080
Isn't the atmosphere really nice?

353
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,480
Is today Magha Puja day?

354
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,680
What do you mean by Magha Puja?

355
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,080
A gathering without prior notice.

356
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,960
Over there.

357
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,040
Isn't it nice

358
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,840
to change it up every now and then.

359
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,400
- It's great. - I agree.

360
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,320
Thank you for inviting me over.

361
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,960
My pleasure.

362
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,120
We'll take some time, come back later.

363
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,200
Yes.

364
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,280
What should we order?

365
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,400
Well, I won't order any dish.

366
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,560
Because I command my cook prepares a bento for me.

367
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,440
- I also did. - Me too.

368
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,920
Are they really dining out?

369
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,120
Excuse me, Madam.

370
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,200
We forbid bringing in food from outside.

371
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,640
Oh, this isn't mine.

372
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,960
It's hers.

373
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,680
My friend's bento.

374
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,280
This is my friend's bento.

375
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,960
Yes, all from a friend.

376
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,880
So, I should order drinking water.

377
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,200
Me too.

378
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,440
Yes.

379
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,560
How adorable.

380
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,760
Why does it feel so hot today, Doctor?

381
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,440
If you feel hot, turn on it up.

382
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,400
But if you need someone take care, just ring me up.

383
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,680
These are the prescriptions, and tell the patient takes enough.

384
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,400
You observe when she swallows.

385
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,880
Don't let her spit it out.

386
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,880
- Got it. - Okay.

387
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,080
Doctor.

388
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,720
Where were you these past few days?

389
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,560
I went out of town.

390
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,640
A trip?

391
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,760
To see my fiancee.

392
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,400
Is Riga working away from the city?

393
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,240
That's nice of you.

394
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,720
Following your girlfriend along.

395
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,080
I went to see my fiancee in Ubon Ratchathani, her name's Lomdao.

396
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,320
Ubon Ratchathani.

397
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,240
Lomdao.

398
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,040
Why her name is as same as Dao's name? Hey! Doctor!

399
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,200
Is she the same Lomdao?

400
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,360
Hey, Wat and Dao.

401
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,360
- Is everything alright? - Yes.

402
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,000
When I get clients next time,

403
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,720
I'll leave the meeting room to you.

404
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,720
Of course.

405
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,960
- Then we'll be leaving now, see you later. - See you later.

406
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,760
Why is Korn calling me?

407
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,400
He must have something to talk about.

408
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,760
Yes, Dr. Korn.

409
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,800
Wat, I want to know the name of Dao's fiance.

410
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,760
Why are you suddenly asking about her fiance?

411
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,160
Well, I met Dr. Param today.

412
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,960
He said he went to see his fiancee in Ubon Ratchathani.

413
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,400
Her name's Lomdao.

414
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,560
I just wonder if she's the same one.

415
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,360
- Because Dao's house is at Ubon Ratchathani. - That's crazy!

416
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,120
She's not the only Dao out there, I don't think so.

417
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,720
She's also right here with me.

418
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,440
She didn't go neither anywhere nor Ubon Ratchathani.

419
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,720
That's a very good news, Wat.

420
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,120
Wat…

421
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,920
Can you tell Dao...

422
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,240
that I miss her?

423
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,120
Tell her by yourself.

424
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,720
I can't! I'll get embarrassed.

425
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,920
That's it, bye.

426
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,040
Bye.

427
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,920
What did he say?

428
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,360
That your ugly doctor said

429
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,840
he will see Lomdao, his fiancee in Ubon Ratchathani.

430
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,720
Why would he tell Korn about who his fiancee is?

431
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,200
Why are you concerned?

432
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,200
He might mentioned it.

433
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,360
Let's go.

434
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,320
What are you making for dinner?

435
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,480
Sweet and sour pork, shrimp paste chili sauce,

436
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,480
fried mackerels and boiled vegetables.

437
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Doctor.

438
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,000
Is there anything you want to eat?

439
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,160
I can make it.

440
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,040
Whatever you're making, I'll eat it.

441
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,600
Doctor.

442
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,600
What?

443
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,480
What is it?

444
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,640
If you won't say it, I'll go take a shower.

445
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,400
I will, Doctor.

446
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,760
Have you ever talked to someone about your fiancee?

447
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,000
Why are you interested in my fiancee?

448
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,480
Well.

449
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,560
I…

450
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,960
I heard you went to see her.

451
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,920
So, I want to know what she's like.

452
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,320
She'll become my boss as well.

453
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,000
I did mention her to a colleague.

454
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,880
Because...

455
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,760
I know he likes her.

456
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,640
So...

457
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,320
If you actually love Miss Riga.

458
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,600
Why didn't you let your friend approach your fiancee?

459
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,720
How do you know that I don't like my fiancee?

460
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,280
Anything else?

461
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,600
No.

462
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,840
You can head upstairs now.

463
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,560
I'll go back to cooking.

464
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,160
Go to take a shower.

465
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,520
Take a shower, Doctor.

466
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,400
Otherwise, you'll be late for dinner.

467
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,440
Madam.

468
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,080
I don't see you whining

469
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,040
when you play cards with friends.

470
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,240
Well, I was focused then.

471
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,240
But why am I so tired today?

472
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,240
Good, right there.

473
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,280
Hey.

474
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,160
Such a nice weather today.

475
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,040
If I listen to something,

476
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,320
I think I would be fast asleep.

477
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,840
Shall I sing for you?

478
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,920
Later.

479
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,400
- Really? - Yeah.

480
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,640
Then I'll tell have a story to tell.

481
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,200
Go on.

482
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,320
Let's say you're an owner of a restaurant.

483
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,400
Yeah.

484
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,480
There are three groups inside.

485
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,520
Yeah.

486
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,720
Table one just ordered.

487
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,760
Yeah.

488
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,840
Table two already paid the bills.

489
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,080
Table three dashed.

490
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,800
What will you do?

491
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,920
I'll call the cops to arrest them.

492
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,800
That's right, Madam.

493
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,000
You're very smart.

494
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,400
- They dare dine and dash. - Arrest them!

495
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,400
Madam.

496
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,040
Why do you need the cops?

497
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,120
Table three dashed.

498
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,120
We just need to customize it, Madam.

499
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,560
- Oh, right. - That's true.

500
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,760
Oh.

501
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,520
The table dashed so just catch it?

502
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,840
Exactly.

503
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,200
Alright, my turn.

504
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,480
How do you know when

505
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,680
something hits someone's head?

506
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,160
Any idea?

507
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,280
I don’t know, Madam.

508
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,480
You don't know?

509
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,960
I'll tell you.

510
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
- Knock! - Ow!

511
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,720
- Knock! - Ow!

512
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,880
Hear that? Now you know.

513
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,240
Phon.

514
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,000
Is there a problem?

515
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,400
Your face shows it all.

516
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,400
It's your friend, he ghosted me.

517
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,520
Oab?

518
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,720
Who's else?

519
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,200
Should I call him?

520
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,960
No need.

521
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,760
Are you sure?

522
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,280
He doesn't want to come, then don't.

523
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,040
No phone calls, then no phone calls.

524
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,520
Do you want me to drop you off?

525
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,600
It's alright.

526
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,640
The taxi's here.

527
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,240
I'll be leaving now.

528
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,720
Where are you, Oab?

529
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
My home.

530
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,400
It's been a while.

531
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,080
You know, someone here misses you.

532
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,160
Is it Phon? She misses me?

533
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,200
Yeah!

534
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,040
She looks like a sad puppy now.

535
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,960
Alright, thanks man.

536
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,200
Let me open the door for you.

537
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,560
Mind your steps.

538
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,320
- I'll leave them to you, Miss Shin. - No problem.

539
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,160
Drive safely.

540
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,040
- Yes. - Everyone, please sit down.

541
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,640
Looks like you're waiting for a call.

542
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,400
Oab.

543
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,520
Phon, wait! Phon!

544
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,160
I drove for eight hours just to see you, won't you talk to me?!

545
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,680
Woman is so complicated.

546
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,680
She sulks whether or not I'm here to see her.

547
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,560
Flowers, just for Phon.

548
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,280
I don't want it.

549
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,280
Phon.

550
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,120
I had to leave because of Dao.

551
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,120
I want my sister to get together with Doctor.

552
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,160
I didn't say anything.

553
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,480
Whether you stay or leave,

554
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,560
it's up to you.

555
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,560
You should go wherever you need to, I don't want to see your face.

556
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,080
Okay.

557
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,040
I'll leave.

558
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,760
My flowers...

559
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,960
probably doesn't deserve you.

560
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,560
How about this?

561
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,280
You're really leaving?

562
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,840
Are you not going to chase after me?

563
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,000
Not begging!

564
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,440
Not chasing!

565
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,160
I'm sulking!

566
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,680
What kind of book are you reading?

567
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,400
Jokes and riddles.

568
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,960
Good timing, let me give a guess question.

569
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,360
What's guess question?

570
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,120
What is every builder afraid of?

571
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,560
- People? - Wrong.

572
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,520
- Offices? - Wrong.

573
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,560
What is it?

574
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,440
Buildings are afraid of fire!

575
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,080
Fire?

576
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,640
The fire escape!

577
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,400
Oh.

578
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,240
See?

579
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,120
There's more.

580
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,800
Which soup has the most benefits?

581
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,880
- Vegetable soup? - Wrong.

582
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,520
- Chicken soup? - Wrong.

583
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,280
- Crab soup? - Wrong.

584
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,320
Prawn soup?

585
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,240
It's supermarket!

586
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,400
- Supermarket? - You can get anything useful there.

587
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,200
- Um... - It's enough, Mom.

588
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,240
I can't do it.

589
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,880
What gives you the idea?

590
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,440
Reading this stuff.

591
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,520
It's actually quite fun.

592
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,920
I'll use these with Faidam.

593
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,960
Faidam?

594
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,360
So, where is she now?

595
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,800
I don't see her anywhere.

596
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,440
She went to eat with Taew and Buab at Wat's house.

597
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,960
Procrastinating again.

598
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,040
Tasty! Very tasty!

599
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,920
Even more tasty than the papaya salad would be my Taew.

600
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,280
Hey, will you cut it out, Buab?

601
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,560
Always flirting.

602
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,200
Let's eat the papaya salad first.

603
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,920
I just can't miss the good timing.

604
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,360
Plus, my baby is super hot.

605
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,240
- Idiot. - Cute.

606
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,400
- Sticky rice. - Thanks.

607
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,120
You disappeared.

608
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,800
When I sulk, you don't start begging.

609
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,960
Just you wait!

610
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,400
If you beg now, I'll ignore you!

611
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,240
Who's that?

612
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,920
Miss Phon.

613
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,680
Wonder who made her so upset.

614
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,440
Lately I don't see Mr. Oab.

615
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,120
I wonder where he went.

616
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,120
She's probably sulking at him.

617
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,960
Let me take a look.

618
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,000
He almost saw me climbing up.

619
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,560
Good thing I dodged in time, I'll go to the front yard.

620
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,680
Alright.

621
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,280
Soon, that ugly doctor will come calling for me.

622
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,840
He's already keep tabs on me!

623
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
How should I do?

624
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,680
What are you complaining about?

625
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,160
Nothing.

626
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,720
His hearing is too sharp.

627
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,920
What's wrong?

628
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,760
It's nothing.

629
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,440
I know what's her problem.

630
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,120
What is it then?

631
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,160
Hello, Auntie.

632
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,760
Oh, hello Oab.

633
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,480
- Hey, Doctor. - Scoot over.

634
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Well...

635
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,840
I'm here to bring news about Dao.

636
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,080
Oh really?

637
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,680
How is she?

638
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,520
She still doesn't understand why

639
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,560
she has to marry this Doctor here.

640
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,200
I don't feel great either

641
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,760
that Dao has disappeared just like this.

642
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,600
I feel like I'm to blame

643
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,040
that made her run away from home.

644
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,200
It's not like that, Auntie.

645
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,520
Dao...

646
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,640
She has always been pretty stubborn since she was young.

647
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,960
It's not right to blame only Miss Dao.

648
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,880
She's a woman.

649
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,280
She has to choose the best option.

650
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,040
Because as time goes by, men change.

651
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,280
But Param isn't that kind of man.

652
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,920
Exactly.

653
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,600
Brother is a good guy.

654
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,680
He wouldn't be like that.

655
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,320
But as for someone else...

656
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,440
Who knows?

657
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,160
Why did you come so fast?

658
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,360
I got in the car as soon as I hung up from your call.

659
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,880
I'm afraid she'll sulk for too long.

660
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,560
- Why haven't you reconciled? - I tried.

661
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,960
Then?

662
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,600
Still sulking.

663
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,840
So I try not begging her.

664
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,920
- How was it? - Even worse.

665
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,120
Do you know where this troublesome sister of mine is?

666
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,200
Next door.

667
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,960
Can you go get her?

668
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,240
I really want to see her disguise.

669
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,800
It won't be easy.

670
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,320
Wait and see how mischievous she is.

671
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,800
Taew!

672
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,760
Taew!

673
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,320
Yes, Doctor!

674
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,840
Yes, I'm here.

675
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,760
Go call Faidam for me.

676
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,880
I want her to cook the food for Mr. Oab.

677
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Move along.

678
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,320
Yes.

679
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,240
If Mr. Oab meets Faidam...

680
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,200
She's in big trouble.

681
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,440
Wait! Wait!

682
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,000
I'm still eating.

683
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,240
What's wrong with you?

684
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,920
Don't tell me you need to

685
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,240
defecate from the salad?

686
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,880
No!

687
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,080
Buab.

688
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:44,440
Do you remember Mr. Oabboon knows my advisor?

689
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,520
Doctor will come to take me home soon.

690
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,800
If that's the case,

691
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,720
I'll be caught for disguising as a housekeeper.

692
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,760
Then, escape like you always do.

693
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,080
The same plan doesn't always work, Buab.

694
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,000
Last time I almost died in that sauna spa.

695
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,680
Right.

696
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,720
Still...

697
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,400
Your skin hasn't gotten brighter.

698
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,200
One more thing, I really want to know.

699
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,680
The mole.

700
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,960
Is it real or is it dog's flea?

701
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,840
A mole!

702
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,600
Stop playing around at times like this, I'm all stressed out.

703
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,240
Fine, it's a mole.

704
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,640
Sure?

705
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,960
Yeah!

706
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,240
A mole or a raisin?

707
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,760
So huge! Look!

708
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Look here!

709
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,120
Buab!

710
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,360
Buab!

711
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,440
Buab baby!

712
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,440
Yes, baby?

713
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,560
Taew?! Why did you that to him?

714
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,840
And I trusted you!

715
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,600
What are you talking about?

716
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,120
This is a misunderstanding!

717
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,280
Look! He's having a seizure, like he's dying!

718
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,800
Buab! Buab!

719
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,120
Buab!

720
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,560
Taew! Go get Doctor!

721
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,000
Doctor! Doctor!

722
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,440
Buab.

723
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,720
Will I get kicked as well?

724
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,280
Buab.

725
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,680
Doctor!

726
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,160
Doctor!

727
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,920
Taew?

728
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,680
I told you to get Faidam, why do you have to be noisy?

729
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,400
Buab is having a seizure, please help him!

730
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,760
I'm talking business here with Oabboon.

731
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,360
Doctor, please help him.

732
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,360
His seizure looks serious.

733
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,480
It's like he's dying!

734
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,360
Doctor should go, we can talk later.

735
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,320
You go ahead, I'll be there soon.

736
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,640
Please hurry up.

737
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,560
I don't want to become a widow.

738
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,920
Why are you smiling?

739
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,320
A patient's waiting for you!

740
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,120
Buab is fine.

741
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,200
It's Faidam's scheme.

742
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,680
To avoid meeting you.

743
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,720
Is she really that much of a schemer?

744
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Fine.

745
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,280
If she's not coming,

746
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,880
I'll go to her.

747
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,160
Take care of the house while I'm not home.

748
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,280
And look after Doctor for me too.

749
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,720
You two just take care of the house.

750
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,120
As for doctor, I'll look after him by myself.

751
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,320
Doctor.

752
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,120
Doctor, don't do this to me.

753
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,000
- Faidam. - Yes?

754
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,000
- Give me boiled eggs. - Huh?

755
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,280
Two eggs, they did it hard.

756
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,760
(Next episode.)

757
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,080
For me, I'll have...

758
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,320
three raw eggs.

759
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,560
Three raw eggs?
