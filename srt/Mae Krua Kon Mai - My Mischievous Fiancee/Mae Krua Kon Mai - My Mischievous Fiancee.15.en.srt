1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,880
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,320
Your sister...

3
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,800
disguised herself as a cook at my house.

4
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,360
She disguised herself as a cook at Doctor's house.

5
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,400
- What?! - What?!

6
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,560
You're actually Lomdao.

7
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,040
I'm begging you, Angkab.

8
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,160
Yes, Grandma.

9
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,040
Stop telling Dao what I'm about to do.

10
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,520
I'm your sister's fiance.

11
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,560
(Previously...)

12
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,960
I have the right to get to know her before marriage.

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,360
To see if we're compatible or not.

14
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,840
Isn't that too cheesy?

15
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,840
That a heroine who disguised herself as a maid

16
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,200
would end up marring her handsome boss.

17
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,440
Hey.

18
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,480
If you don't believe it, don't disrespect it.

19
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,240
That movie that was aired on channel 3

20
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,520
that... mai-maid...

21
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Gosh.

22
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,440
That maid got together with her boss.

23
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,680
That's a foreign movie,

24
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,480
reality isn't like that.

25
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,320
Say whatever you want.

26
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,600
If Buab didn't court me first,

27
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,640
the doctor...

28
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,200
might have already been mine.

29
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,520
So cute.

30
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
This is why

31
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,160
Oab and I had to retreat back

32
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,520
to Ubon Ratchathani to figure this out.

33
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,720
She is eccentric.

34
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,480
What is Dao thinking?

35
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,120
She's trying to find evidence

36
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,200
that shows how the doctor's family is bad.

37
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,440
Thinking they're after our family's fortune.

38
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,640
What made her think so?

39
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,040
Monthianrak is a well-known family

40
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,280
and rich to boot.

41
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
Exactly.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,960
Or is she challenging the elders

43
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,880
for forcing her to get married?

44
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,880
Oh?

45
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,760
Then you're referring to me?

46
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,920
Grandma.

47
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,400
It's nothing like that.

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,160
You know very well that Dao is stubborn.

49
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,840
She doesn't give in to anyone.

50
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,080
Once she was forced to get married,

51
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,160
she wants to rebel.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,200
Or you can try telling her that

53
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,360
she no longer has to marry the doctor.

54
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,200
She might not run away anymore.

55
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,480
If that's the case

56
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,000
we fight fire with fire.

57
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,960
What do you mean?

58
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,560
It means we need to discipline her, honey.

59
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,720
Discipline her?

60
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,800
Yes.

61
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,840
How?

62
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,320
Like how I disciplined you.

63
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,560
Oh, really?

64
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,560
You're dirty again.

65
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
Fine.

66
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,120
Do as you like.

67
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,800
I only ask you not to tell Pisamorn.

68
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,840
I don't want to be humiliated.

69
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,560
Dao has already disrespected me enough.

70
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,640
You've been gone for many days.

71
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,280
You usually come to see Phon every week.

72
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,120
You've just completely disappeared.

73
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,680
Aren't you scared she'll sulk?

74
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,440
I returned to Ubon Ratchathani.

75
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,680
Sorry, I didn't tell you.

76
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,120
It's fine if you didn't tell me.

77
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,880
Did you tell Phon, though?

78
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,320
She doesn't care if whether I'm here or not.

79
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,640
She doesn't even answer my call.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,160
So why did you called me here?

81
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,360
I want to know

82
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,440
how you feel about Dao.

83
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,000
Do you like it?

84
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,800
Drinking freshly squeezed guava juice

85
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,120
is so delicious and refreshing.

86
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,720
- Smells nice, too. - Yes.

87
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,080
Speaking of which

88
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,560
to be able to squeeze this much juice to fill this glass,

89
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,960
you must've used a lot of guavas.

90
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,200
You're so wasteful.

91
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,880
I didn't buy it, Madam.

92
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,360
I got it for free.

93
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,440
The shop owner said that it was rotten.

94
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,240
So she gave it to me.

95
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,560
Madam.

96
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,480
Some pieces even have caterpillars crawling

97
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,520
like this.

98
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,840
Madam.

99
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,520
I was thinking of frying those caterpillars.

100
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,560
Do you want to eat them? I'll make it for you.

101
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,840
They say caterpillars have a lot of protein.

102
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,680
Making a face like that

103
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,240
you must want some, Madam.

104
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,280
Madam, I was just pulling your leg.

105
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,760
Mr. Wat gave me those guavas.

106
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,840
- Really? - Yes.

107
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
You little...

108
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,400
Just kidding, Madam.

109
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,120
Here.

110
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,120
All fresh, none of them are rotten.

111
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,360
There are more, do you want some?

112
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,520
Why are you telling me now?

113
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,000
I threw up a lot, how wasteful.

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Doctor.

115
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,000
Exactly, how do you feel about Dao?

116
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,040
What do you want from me?

117
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,160
You keep asking.

118
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,160
Hey.

119
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,200
As your future big brother

120
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,960
shouldn't I know

121
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,320
whether you like my sister or not.

122
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,360
I'll tell your sister later myself.

123
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,360
Just be honest with me.

124
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,360
How do you feel about Dao?

125
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,280
Can't you tell?

126
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,880
Stop asking me already.

127
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
Fine.

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,680
It's fine if don't want to tell me.

129
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,160
But I need to tell you something.

130
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,680
If you make Dao sad,

131
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,320
you'll be facing me.

132
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,960
You think for

133
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,160
and get angry for my fiancee.

134
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,000
I can't help but think

135
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,920
that you're actually Lomdao.

136
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,440
Can't help but think

137
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,840
that I'm actually Lomdao?

138
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
Here.

139
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,040
The most dangerous place

140
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,520
is the safest place.

141
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,440
Who is calling me right now?

142
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,400
Auntie Angkab.

143
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,800
Yes, Auntie?

144
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,560
Miss Dao, there's a problem.

145
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,000
Grandma is gravely ill.

146
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,080
- Huh? Grandma is gravely ill? - Yes.

147
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,680
She keeps calling out your name.

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,560
Mr. Oab took her back to Ubon Ratchathani already.

149
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,680
He said he'll take her to her regular doctor.

150
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,640
Then I'll hurry back to Ubon Ratchathani.

151
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,280
Talk to you later.

152
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Yes.

153
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,240
I'm so sorry, Miss Dao.

154
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,080
I choose to be on Grandma's side.

155
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,680
Because I want you to settle down already.

156
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,680
Where are you going packing your stuff like that?

157
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,160
My grandma is sick.

158
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
Dead...

159
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,000
Not yet.

160
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,120
Is it critical?

161
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,960
I also don't know, Madam.

162
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,360
But my family said she gravely ill.

163
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,280
So I want to ask for your permission

164
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,080
to go to Ubon Ratchathani for a week.

165
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,560
Go ahead.

166
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,680
An elderly person is close to...

167
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,920
She's sick.

168
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,520
- Yeah, she's sick. - Yes.

169
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,520
She would want to see her grandchild

170
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,960
so she can have moral support.

171
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes.

172
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,680
Thank you so much, Madam.

173
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,320
I'll take my leave now before I miss my bus.

174
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,520
Please go ahead.

175
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
Yes.

176
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,880
I'm off then, Madam.

177
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,080
Don't miss me too much...

178
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,920
Dead!

179
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,720
Not dead yet.

180
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,440
You're so clumsy.

181
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,520
Faidam, wait up.

182
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,680
- Yes? - Come here.

183
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,760
What is it, Madam?

184
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,760
Here.

185
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,760
I'll give this to you in case you need it

186
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,600
or for your grandma's treatment.

187
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,560
If this isn't enough just call me,

188
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,120
I'll transfer more to you.

189
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,240
Here, take it.

190
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,080
That's okay.

191
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,720
You don't have money

192
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,000
and you have a huge debt.

193
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,520
Please keep it for yourself.

194
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,360
Actually, about that...

195
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Faidam.

196
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,360
Where are you going?

197
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,000
My grandma is sick, Miss Phon.

198
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,240
So I asked Madam to let me go home.

199
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,800
Oh, Faidam, you've just got better and now your grandma is sick?

200
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,760
That's right.

201
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,800
That's why I told you to carry the money

202
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,360
in case you need to use it.

203
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,240
Just take it.

204
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,080
Madam...

205
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,560
Just take it.

206
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,120
So you can treat your grandma with it.

207
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
Yes.

208
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,440
Thank you so much, Madam.

209
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,760
When I come back,

210
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,560
I'll let you cut my salary.

211
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,840
I will spank you.

212
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,960
Whatever I can help with, I want to help.

213
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,600
If we don't give each other a hand

214
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,840
during hard times.

215
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,400
When will we give then?

216
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,200
Thank you very much, Madam.

217
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,360
I will keep it safe.

218
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,520
Oh.

219
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,120
Mom, where's Faidam?

220
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,480
Why are you cooking?

221
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,560
Faidam said her grandma got sick

222
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,040
so she asked to go home for a week.

223
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,040
Do you want to eat anything in particular?

224
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,080
I'll cook it for you.

225
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
Mom.

226
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
I...

227
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,680
will go to Ubon Ratchathani.

228
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,680
Huh?

229
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,080
You're going to Ubon Ratchathani?

230
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,080
Oh.

231
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,800
Hey, Taew.

232
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,080
Come fry that for me.

233
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,280
- Hurry. - Yes.

234
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,840
Come, son.

235
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Come here.

236
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,960
What are you going to do in Ubon Ratchathani?

237
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,520
I...

238
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,400
want to go talk to Lomdao

239
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,520
about our marriage.

240
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
Hey.

241
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,160
Does that mean you decided to marry her?

242
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,040
There's no need to be shy about it.

243
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,680
Hey, how about this.

244
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,680
I'll have Taew help you pack your luggage.

245
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,840
- I'll do the cooking, okay? - Yes.

246
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,320
Go son, hurry.

247
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,000
Bring a lot of nice clothes.

248
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,800
Taew.

249
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,640
Hey, go and help Dr. Param pack his stuff.

250
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,600
I'll cook.

251
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,440
Where is the doctor going?

252
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,080
He's going to Ubon Ratchathani.

253
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,160
Are you going as well?

254
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,000
Why would I? The plane ticket is expensive.

255
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,560
So true.

256
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Yeah.

257
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,680
At least Dao is still worried about me.

258
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,080
See? Once she found out that I'm sick

259
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,480
she hurried back here.

260
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,960
Maybe she's scared that

261
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,560
she won't get your inheritance.

262
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,760
Watch your mouth.

263
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,920
Serves you right.

264
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,360
It's you who's afraid of not getting my inheritance.

265
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,040
Dao would never think like that.

266
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,840
Hey.

267
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,480
When Dao's back,

268
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,360
I have to put on a great performance.

269
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,440
If she sees me dancing Zumba,

270
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,680
she'll know that I'm healthy.

271
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,000
She'll be furious.

272
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,640
Which Zumba move, Mom?

273
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,080
Did you forget?

274
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,640
It's this one.

275
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,040
Here, remember it.

276
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,960
One, two, three

277
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,560
four, five, six.

278
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,440
One, two, three, oh!

279
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,480
One, two, three, oh!

280
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,600
One, two, three, oh!

281
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,640
One...

282
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,840
Grandma!

283
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,160
Dad, catch her.

284
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,080
What's going on?

285
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,760
Why is Grandma...

286
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,160
Grandma was dancing Zumba

287
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,360
and now she has a seizure.

288
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,640
One, two, three!

289
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,160
She's having a seizure dancing, her muscles are used to her dancing Zumba.

290
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,520
So she's having the seizure in Zumba.

291
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,400
Massage her!

292
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,080
Are you guys having fun?

293
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,400
You've arrived there, Son?

294
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,960
You must bring her back no matter what.

295
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,840
See you later.

296
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,760
Doctor went to Ubon Ratchathani to get Miss Dao.

297
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,960
Oab didn't tell me anything.

298
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,400
That Miss Dao is home in Ubon Ratchathani.

299
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,240
Geez.

300
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,320
He has visited you many times already.

301
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,640
But you're always grumpy.

302
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,440
Always playing hard to get.

303
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,600
No guys would try to come make up with you.

304
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,400
If his love is real,

305
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,040
he would never give up.

306
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,360
At any rate, save your problems with Oab for later.

307
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,400
Let's watch Param and Dao first.

308
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,800
If they got together,

309
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,280
Riga will forever be away from our lives.

310
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,720
Madam!

311
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,000
What is it, Taew?

312
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,200
Miss Riga is here.

313
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,240
Huh?

314
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,280
Hey.

315
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,360
Is she a human or a spirit?

316
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,440
I was just talking about her

317
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,480
and suddenly she shows up.

318
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,960
My mood is now ruined.

319
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,760
Oab is backing down so easily,

320
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,600
it goes to show his love isn't real.

321
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,040
Hello, Mom.

322
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,560
Why are you here, Riga?

323
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,280
I'm here to see Doctor.

324
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,880
You've got the wrong place.

325
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,560
This isn't a hospital or a clinic

326
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,080
for you to come see a doctor.

327
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,960
I meant Dr. Param.

328
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,360
Oh.

329
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,280
Hey, what's going on, Riga?

330
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,120
You announced to everyone

331
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,760
that you're Param's girlfriend.

332
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,200
That you guys are getting married soon.

333
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,760
And what have we here?

334
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,280
How did you not know that Param isn't here?

335
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,640
Right.

336
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,080
Doctor told me that he won't be home.

337
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,640
How did I forgot?

338
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,280
Exactly.

339
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,680
How did you forget

340
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,320
something this important.

341
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,200
Even when I heard it once,

342
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,440
it's glued inside my brain

343
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,400
that Param won't be home today.

344
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,600
What do you mean, Mom?

345
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,360
You're so forgetful.

346
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,040
Then I'll have to remind you again.

347
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Param

348
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,520
said he won't be home

349
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,360
because he will go meet his fiancee

350
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,760
at Ubon Ratchathani.

351
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
So?

352
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,800
Do you remember now? Huh?

353
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,480
You need my help to remember?

354
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Baby.

355
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,240
Yes?

356
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,320
I have something to ask you.

357
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,040
What is it?

358
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
It's...

359
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,600
what

360
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,720
has four feet

361
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,960
and a roof over them?

362
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,480
Buab!

363
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,600
- Smells good. - If I answered correctly, what do I get?

364
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,280
If you guessed correctly,

365
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,440
you get to kiss my cheeks.

366
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,120
Dummy!

367
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,600
What if I get it wrong?

368
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,320
If you guessed wrong,

369
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,320
I will

370
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,760
kiss your cheeks.

371
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,120
Well then

372
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,120
can you answer me now?

373
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,240
Buab, dummy!

374
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,600
That's easy.

375
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,320
Four feet walking with a roof over them...

376
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,040
D-O-G.

377
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,760
A dog!

378
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,920
You guessed wrong!

379
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,160
It's a turtle.

380
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,640
Oh, I guessed wrong?

381
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,080
Now then

382
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,720
lend me your cheeks so I can kiss it.

383
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,200
No! I'm being forced!

384
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,880
It's Miss Riga.

385
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,200
Hide!

386
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,000
When will you die, you old hag.

387
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,440
You're just in the way.

388
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,800
If it weren't for my sweet girl act,

389
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,800
I'd slap you all over

390
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,720
and we'll see if it'll fix your attitude.

391
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,560
So annoyed!

392
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,000
Slap all over...

393
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,880
This woman is bad news.

394
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
That's true, baby.

395
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,680
Let me hit one of the windows.

396
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Oh.

397
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,760
She didn't say whose windows.

398
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,840
What goes around

399
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,800
comes around.

400
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,160
Serves her right.

401
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,960
Hurray!

402
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,040
It's finally done.

403
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,600
How long did it take?

404
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,240
Only a week, Dad.

405
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,600
Is one week fast or slow?

406
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,000
Of course it's fast.

407
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Here.

408
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,000
Look at the back, it says

409
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,080
"suitable for three to five years..."

410
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,640
You had it coming.

411
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,840
They meant the player's age.

412
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,240
That's not even funny.

413
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,280
What's wrong? Why are you in a bad mood?

414
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,520
Is Grandma actually really sick?

415
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Honey, the rice that was delivered today...

416
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,920
-I think... - Mom.

417
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Huh?

418
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,360
- I'm busy discussing about rice with your dad. - Yeah, that's right.

419
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,400
- Where were we? - The rice that was delivered...

420
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
Oab!

421
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,800
Who in the right mind would jinx Grandma?

422
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,480
How come Grandma

423
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,280
looks normal when I got here?

424
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,600
Didn't you see her get a seizure?

425
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,400
Oab!

426
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,320
Why are you walking away?

427
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,400
To put my jigsaw puzzle together.

428
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,640
Oab!

429
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,920
Oab!

430
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,080
Oab! Stop.

431
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,680
You guys tricked me into coming home, huh?

432
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,200
You saw Grandma having a seizure.

433
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,800
Why are you still doubting us?

434
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,680
I am not stupid.

435
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,080
Who would have a seizure in Zumba?

436
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,120
Well, there's Grandma.

437
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,560
You better not let me find out

438
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,360
that you guys are tricking me.

439
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,800
Doctor.

440
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,640
Doctor!

441
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,040
Hey.

442
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,720
Thanks for coming to visit Grandma.

443
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,160
I'll take you to go greet my parents first.

444
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,080
Let's go.

445
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,160
Why is he here?

446
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,600
- Hello. - Hello.

447
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,880
Hello.

448
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,520
Oh, Doctor!

449
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,080
Oh, hello, Grandma.

450
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,720
How are you, Grandma?

451
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,040
I feel tired and weak.

452
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,040
I am no longer young.

453
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,040
Are you hungry?

454
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,080
I'll bring you something to eat.

455
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,040
It's fine, I already ate.

456
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,320
Why did he come here?

457
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,240
Dao!

458
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,560
Where are you going? Come here.

459
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,200
What is it, Mom?

460
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,560
Hey.

461
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,640
Why didn't you come greet Doctor?

462
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,920
This is Dr. Param.

463
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,480
Your fiance.

464
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,760
This is your plan to make us meet, right?

465
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,520
Don't call it a plan.

466
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,400
Call it a meeting without swiping Tinner.

467
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,240
Tinder, Dad. Not Tinner.

468
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,680
The dating app?

469
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,920
Oh, yeah it's Tinder.

470
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
That's it.

471
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,640
But I don't want to see him.

472
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,080
Oh.

473
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,640
Oh.

474
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,560
Doctor.

475
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,720
Follow her, go.

476
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,760
Yes.

477
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,440
- Hold on, Dad. - Huh?

478
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,680
How did you know about Tinder?

479
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,920
Chat app...

480
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,200
What? Tinder?

481
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Thinner, honey.

482
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,080
Lacquer Thinner.

483
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,400
- It's used on wood. - Yeah!

484
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,120
Giving each other a hand, how smooth.

485
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,040
Yes, it is smooth when you apply it.

486
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,800
What are you guys talking about?

487
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,680
I don't get this Tinder thing.

488
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
Hello.

489
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,960
I'm glad to see you again.

490
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,680
You talk as if

491
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,880
we've know each other before.

492
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,600
Because we know each other before.

493
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,920
Only one glance

494
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,520
and I recognized you.

495
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,120
Will they get it on tonight?

496
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,520
Mom!

497
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,920
Dao is a girl.

498
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,320
What of it?

499
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,520
Yeah, this is her first time meeting him.

500
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,560
That's right.

501
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,720
Did you think I didn't know?

502
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,080
The first day you met Ratt,

503
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,120
you guys...

504
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,160
- What? - What?

505
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,880
- What, mom? - Do you want me to say it?

506
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,760
- Just say it then. - Oab.

507
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,160
- What did you want to say? - The day you were conceived...

508
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,640
Mom, enough!

509
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,800
I am leaving.

510
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,240
I don't want to be a third wheel for Dao.

511
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,200
I feel sticky.

512
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,880
I'm going to take a shower, Mom.

513
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,200
Only shower, okay?

514
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,720
Of course, I'll only shower.

515
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,600
Pa honey.

516
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,120
Oab.

517
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,800
Let's give those two an opportunity.

518
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,000
Perhaps tonight

519
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,400
I'll get a grandchild.

520
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,040
- Grandma. - Yes?

521
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,400
If those two got together,

522
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,120
don't forget to ask Phon for me, okay?

523
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,240
Look at you.

524
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,720
Well, if I get a grandchild,

525
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,800
I'll go ask for you.

526
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,880
Let's go.

527
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,320
I recognize you, Dao.

528
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,600
You've got the wrong person.

529
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
I don't know you.

530
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,680
You're really forgetful.

531
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,880
We've met before.

532
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,720
At the hotel,

533
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,640
you fell and sprained you ankle, don't you remember?

534
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,360
Oh!

535
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,680
You're...

536
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,560
Dr. Korn's friend.

537
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,880
Sorry, I didn't remember.

538
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,120
But...

539
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,000
it's good that we met again.

540
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,200
So I can finally tell you directly.

541
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
About what?

542
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,320
About our marriage.

543
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,560
It's...

544
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,240
the elder's business.

545
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,440
But in reality, it's impossible.

546
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,320
I'm sorry.

547
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,240
You already have a girlfriend,

548
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,240
it's all over social media.

549
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,200
As for me...

550
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,800
in a few months

551
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,680
my boyfriend, Max, will be back.

552
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,000
I don't want to say much.

553
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,680
You should understand by now.

554
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,360
I understand.

555
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,400
But I don't know if

556
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,960
the elders will understand or not.

557
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,560
What do you mean?

558
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,280
Our marriage

559
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,040
was arranged by the elders.

560
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,360
If anything happens

561
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,040
they will need to be informed as well.

562
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,360
You mean

563
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,560
you will not call off the wedding?

564
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,480
I told you

565
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,880
everything is up to the elders.

566
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,560
Even though you know very well

567
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,160
that I don't want to marry you.

568
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,840
Do you still want to marry me?

569
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,280
Everything

570
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,000
depends on the elders.

571
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,600
Why do you need to use them as an excuse?

572
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,320
It's obvious that you want to marry me.

573
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,080
You want my family's fortune

574
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,520
to pay off your mom's debt.

575
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,440
Miss Dao, you've greatly disrespected me.

576
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,160
You and your mom are greedy.

577
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
Lomdao!

578
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,160
I never want a single baht from you.

579
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,520
I only listened to the elders

580
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,000
is because I have my own reason.

581
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,920
Reason?

582
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,560
All the reasons

583
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,760
are about money, right?

584
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,080
Why are you silent?

585
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,160
If you really had other reasons

586
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,840
then surely you can answer me.

587
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,200
Tell me truthfully,

588
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,840
what is your reason?

589
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,960
A reason that an unreasonable person like you will never understand.

590
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,040
What rights do you have to call me unreasonable?

591
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,840
Hey, you!

592
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,760
I will never let you marry me

593
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,200
to pay off your debt.

594
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,280
I will never go broke from a man like you.

595
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,920
What made her think that I wanted to marry her for money?

596
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,640
Even if we don't get married,

597
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,120
she still needs to apologize for saying that.

598
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,360
Who'd want to marry a guy that called a woman unreasonable?

599
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,760
What kind of person is scared to lose his benefit

600
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,240
and refuse to call of the wedding? Damn it.

601
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,360
What a doctor.

602
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,240
If I see him one more time,

603
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,880
I'll tell him I won't marry him!

604
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,040
My money is for spending

605
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,640
not for a man to trick me for it.

606
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,600
Elder this, elder that.

607
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,760
Are you going to use my money on Riga?

608
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,360
In your dreams.

609
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,320
Nim.

610
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,880
- Please set the table. - Yes.

611
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,320
Oh! Why are you up so early today?

612
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,680
I couldn't sleep.

613
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,400
What are you cooking, Mom?

614
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,520
Anything I can help you with?

615
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,240
Help me pick the leaves off from the basil stem.

616
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,640
I'm making many dishes today.

617
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,480
There's congee, steamed rice,

618
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,360
stir-fried morning glory and

619
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,120
fried shrimp with garlic.

620
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,040
Just tell me what you want to eat, I'll cook it for you.

621
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,160
That's okay, Mom.

622
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,280
I'm not hungry yet.

623
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,760
You're awesome, Mom.

624
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,280
You're good with house chores and cooking.

625
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,960
You're perfect in every way.

626
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,120
Oh you...

627
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,880
You're a sweet talker.

628
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,760
How about I teach you?

629
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,080
So Madam Pisamorn will adore you.

630
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,360
Hey.

631
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,520
First,

632
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,120
you need to know how

633
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,520
to stay humble and modest.

634
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,760
Respect elders.

635
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,880
Secondly,

636
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,400
you need to be diligent and be kind.

637
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,840
Quickly do whatever needs to be done.

638
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,160
Do not wait until your mother-in-law tells you.

639
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,320
She'll get upset.

640
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,520
Thirdly,

641
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,960
You need to be frugal and save up.

642
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,800
Don't spend extravagantly.

643
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,760
Your mother-in-law won't be pleased.

644
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,080
Fourthly,

645
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,640
this one is very important.

646
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,000
- Here, let me tell you. - Yes.

647
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,920
When you want to please you husband

648
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,440
don't do it in front of your mother-in-law.

649
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,440
She'll get annoyed.

650
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,480
If you can do all these four points,

651
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,480
I am certain that Madam Pisamorn

652
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,840
will love you until death.

653
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,680
Mom.

654
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,120
I don't think I will

655
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,320
easily become anyone's daughter-in-law.

656
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,240
I plan to live with you for a long time.

657
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,960
Dao.

658
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,000
Dr. Param came here for you.

659
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,360
You guys were talking for a long time last night.

660
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,320
I thought you two were going to

661
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,640
get to know each other.

662
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Huh?

663
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,280
I...

664
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,960
broke off with Dr. Param.

665
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,200
And I told him

666
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,720
I have no interest in marrying him.

667
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,480
What?!

668
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,560
You broke off with Dr. Param?!

669
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,680
No wonder.

670
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,320
Doctor had Oab drop him off

671
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,720
at the airport this morning.

672
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,200
Goodness.

673
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,960
How could you do this, Dao?

674
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,480
That's easy.

675
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,400
I was just honest with him.

676
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,200
Since I don't love Dr. Param.

677
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,360
He also doesn't love me.

678
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,360
How can we get married?

679
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,480
It's only right to break it off with him.

680
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,040
Oh.

681
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,280
I want to die right here right now.

682
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,760
Why don't you ever listen to me, Dao?

683
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,920
How stubborn will you be?

684
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,720
I didn't find an awful person for you.

685
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,920
Dr. Param is a good person.

686
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,560
He has a good family.

687
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,320
And also has a good job.

688
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,240
But he already has a girlfriend and a huge debt.

689
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,880
He's only willing to marry me to use my money to pay off the debt.

690
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,680
Who is the one that isn't listening here?

691
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,120
Me or you, Grandma?

692
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,480
Look at her.

693
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,600
Who did she get her stubbornness from?

694
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Huh?

695
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,120
- Hey. - Dao.

696
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,560
Dao.

697
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,680
How about this?

698
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,880
What did Dr. Param say last night?

699
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,280
Nothing.

700
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,680
Grandma's good person refuses to give up.

701
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,840
He probably really wants our family's fortune.

702
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,600
His creditors invaded his house, asking for the payment.

703
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,800
If I don't marry him his house will get seized.

704
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,240
What are you saying, Dao?

705
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,440
I'm speaking the truth.

706
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,520
Listen, everyone

707
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,360
right now the Mothianrak's house

708
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,560
is about to get seized.

709
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,680
Madam Pisamorn and Dr. Param

710
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,440
are about to go penniless.

711
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,880
That's not true.

712
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,640
That's impossible.

713
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,280
It has already happened.

714
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,520
I want to know why everyone

715
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,200
is insisting on this marriage?

716
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,800
Even though you now know

717
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,560
he's just after our money.

718
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,120
You guys still want him?

719
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,520
You're insane.

720
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,720
- You don't know... - Quiet.

721
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,520
If you don't want to marry then don't.

722
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,720
No!

723
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,480
Why don't you want to marry him?

724
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,640
Where else can you find

725
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,240
a better man than Dr. Param?

726
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,120
Grandma.

727
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,280
You will get married to Dr. Param.

728
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,160
I will not marry him.

729
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
You must!

730
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,840
Dao!

731
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,680
Wait, Mom.

732
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Hey, Dao.

733
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,560
How about this?

734
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,600
If you don't want to marry him...

735
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,640
Pa!

736
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Mom.

737
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:49,320
Go find evidence of what you claimed.

738
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,880
I want to see the evidence

739
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,320
that shows Dr. Param's family

740
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,440
is actually only after our family's fortune.

741
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,600
Sure.

742
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,920
I will definitely find the evidence.

743
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,360
But let me tell you one thing

744
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,480
no one knows the Monthianrak better than I do.

745
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,400
Look at her.

746
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,760
How would you know better than I do?

747
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
Param.

748
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,680
- Yes? - How long did you get back?

749
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,760
For a while.

750
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,600
What did Dao say?

751
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,800
I didn't see her.

752
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,720
Oh.

753
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,080
Why?

754
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,120
She probably changed her mind.

755
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,320
That's why she wasn't there in Ubon Ratchathani.

756
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,640
What did her family say?

757
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,320
Everyone said

758
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,840
Dao won't come back

759
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,000
if she's still being forced to marry me.

760
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,240
Oh.

761
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,960
Why did she say that?

762
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,040
Since she has never met you yet.

763
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,360
That's right.

764
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,240
Why did she judge you so easily?

765
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,160
She hasn't met you yet.

766
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,040
Mom.

767
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,480
If she doesn't want to get married,

768
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,280
we shouldn't be forcing her.

769
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,240
Grandma Pathum has gratitude over me.

770
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,760
I need to pay back her gratitude.

771
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,880
You need to look after Dao.

772
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,280
So Grandma Pathum can be at ease

773
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,240
that her only granddaughter

774
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,840
is being taken care of.

775
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,880
But she doesn't want me to take care of her.

776
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,520
Because she has never met you.

777
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,960
So she doesn't know

778
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,400
how good of a person you are.

779
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,440
Param, I believe that

780
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,720
if she gets to meet you

781
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,040
and talk to you once.

782
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,400
Her answer

783
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,960
will not turn out like this.

784
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,280
I went to see you the other day.

785
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,560
Mom said you went to see your fiancee?

786
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,160
What did she say?

787
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,760
Why isn't she back with you?

788
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,640
She refused to marry me.

789
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,880
That's great!

790
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,680
Now you're free at last.

791
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,920
Since she doesn't want to marry you

792
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,960
then there's nothing your mom can do.

793
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,240
It's not that simple.

794
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,120
What's the problem?

795
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,800
My mom and her family won't allow it.

796
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,120
What if...

797
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,720
I got pregnant.

798
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,440
What will they say?

799
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,840
You don't need to go that far.

800
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,360
Our relationship is a lie.

801
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,880
I just

802
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,880
don't want to marry that woman.

803
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,960
So I had to hire you.

804
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,920
And if you have to be pregnant.

805
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,720
I think that's going too far.

806
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,320
I already told you

807
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,920
that I never think of this as just an act.

808
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,640
Because my love for you is real.

809
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,320
Let's stop talking about this.

810
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,400
Fine.

811
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,880
But you should know

812
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,400
that I won't give up so easily.

813
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,200
I will win over everyone's heart.

814
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,040
Especially yours.

815
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,720
Watch where you're going!

816
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,360
I was walking normally.

817
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,760
It was you who drove without watching.

818
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,520
Are you trying to pick a fight?

819
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,720
And are you trying to hit and run?

820
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,080
Is there a problem here?

821
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,360
I saw everything.

822
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,720
I can be your witness.

823
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,960
Watch the road carefully next time.

824
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,720
Hey.

825
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,440
You, are you going to run after you hit me?

826
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,480
Hey!

827
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,520
Are you okay?

828
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,360
I'm alright.

829
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,840
I'll help.

830
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,040
I thought you said you were fine.

831
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,200
You are hurt, right?

832
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,480
I'll take you to see a doctor.

833
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,640
- Let's go. - Oh, it's alright.

834
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,360
I can go by myself.

835
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,280
No need to be scared of me.

836
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,160
I won't do anything to you.

837
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,640
There's a clinic nearby.

838
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,760
I'll take you there.

839
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,280
Let's go.

840
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,240
Come.

841
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,320
Hey! What are you doing?

842
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,280
Get on my back, I'll take you there.

843
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,880
Hurry up.

844
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,840
You'll get infected.

845
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,280
Okay.

846
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,400
Come.

847
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,480
Let's go.

848
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,560
- Thank you. - No problem.

849
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,640
What's taking her so long?

850
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,360
Please.

851
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,920
- Thank you. - I'll help you carry.

852
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,920
Oh.

853
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,560
It's actually you

854
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,120
who wants a rich man.

855
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,520
I actually live in this neighborhood, too.

856
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,880
Really?

857
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,160
Yes.

858
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,560
"Yes".

859
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,280
Speaking in Northeastern dialect...

860
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,560
he's obviously flirting.

861
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,400
I saw a Benz dropped you off.

862
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,040
(Next episode.)

863
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,480
"Please go inside the house."

864
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,880
"Please get in the car."

865
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,280
You weren't eavesdropping on me right, Doctor?

866
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,480
Right.

867
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,880
If you actually love Miss Riga

868
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:22,160
Why didn't you let your friend approach your fiancee?

869
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,200
How do you know that I don't like my fiancee?
