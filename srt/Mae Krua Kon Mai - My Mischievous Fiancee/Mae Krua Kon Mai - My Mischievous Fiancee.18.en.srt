1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,840
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,560
Usually, he will come directly to my house.

3
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,440
Or call endlessly.

4
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,400
But didn't try to make up with me.

5
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,280
Perhaps he has changed his mind.

6
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,000
Take care of the house while I'm away.

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,040
(Previously...)

8
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,640
And look after Doctor for me too.

9
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,800
Doctor, don't do this to me.

10
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,360
The bedroom must've turned into a battlefield.

11
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,480
I don't want to imagine about it.

12
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,720
You don't need to imagine

13
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,080
because today

14
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,120
is your turn to clean up Doctor's room.

15
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,480
I'm not available today.

16
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,600
Can you go do it for me, Faidam?

17
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,400
Go get it!! Come one!

18
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,080
Hurry! Hurry!

19
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,640
Hurry! Hurry!

20
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,200
Fighting! Fighting!

21
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,400
Go for it! Fighting!

22
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,720
They are adorable.

23
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,800
Can I join in?

24
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
No.

25
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,480
Perhaps your kid can join.

26
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,760
I guess I'll have to ask the mother.

27
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Phon, wait!

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,320
I need your advice.

29
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,680
I'm a teacher, not a consultant.

30
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,400
I want to talk about Dao and Doctor.

31
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,760
Phon.

32
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,480
If not for my sake,

33
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,880
do it for Doctor.

34
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
Alright.

35
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,200
Then I'll wait when school's over.

36
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,760
Bye bye.

37
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
Kisses.

38
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,360
Have fun kids!

39
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,040
See you later, everyone.

40
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
Bye bye.

41
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,640
Bye.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Shall we go?

43
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,600
Just a second.

44
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,520
Hello this is Madam Pisamorn's.

45
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,120
I won't be home tonight.

46
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,400
No need to cook for me.

47
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,560
Where are you going, Miss Phon?

48
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,600
Oh, I'll eat out with a friend.

49
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,440
Okay.

50
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,080
Friend…

51
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,760
When celebrities date,

52
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,760
they also use the term "friends".

53
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,240
That means…

54
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
Hey.

55
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
Here.

56
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,920
What is it, Miss Ga.

57
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,160
My clothes that you must wash.

58
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,920
Hey.

59
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,360
You stayed for one day.

60
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,360
Why are there so many clothes?

61
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,120
That doesn't matter.

62
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,440
Take it and wash them

63
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,000
together with Doctor's clothes.

64
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,880
Take it.

65
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,520
I...

66
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,520
Do I have to wash this filthy panties?

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Faidam!

68
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,840
My underwear costs thousands.

69
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,560
How can you do this?!

70
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,200
You should wash them by hand.

71
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,600
What is this, Miss Ga?

72
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,600
Hands, why?

73
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,680
Yes.

74
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,320
I used my hands to pick up your panties

75
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,480
and throw them in the washer.

76
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,840
Isn't that correct?

77
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,960
And here is your bra

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,960
- in the washer. - Hey, Faidam!

79
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,480
Hey! Stop! Stop it!

80
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,840
Come here!

81
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,360
My underwear aren't cheap.

82
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,240
They cost me thousands each.

83
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,480
Wash them like this, got it?

84
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,680
You can't just throw them into the washer.

85
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,640
Do you understand me, Faidam?!

86
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,920
Don't you trick me into doing it.

87
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,800
Wash it yourself.

88
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
Come here.

89
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,920
The clothes you have to wash

90
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,920
have to be separated into colors and fabrics that go together.

91
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,600
Make sure to separate them all.

92
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,120
Do you know each of my clothes costs more than your entire salary.

93
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,160
And you should know by now

94
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,160
that I'm Doctor's wife,

95
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,960
you will do as I say.

96
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Otherwise,

97
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,240
I'll have him fire you.

98
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
Oh.

99
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,480
By the way,

100
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,840
after you're done with that.

101
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,000
Go make up the room for me.

102
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,440
Last night Doctor and I...

103
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,480
We had a really rough night.

104
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,840
If it wasn't for finding the evidence,

105
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,800
I wouldn't have let her do this to me.

106
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,600
Serves you right!

107
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,480
This is what you get for not siding with me.

108
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,600
I'll make sure you suffer until I'm satisfied.

109
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
Oh!!

110
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,600
What are you looking at?

111
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
Do your job.

112
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
Miss Ga.

113
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,240
Can you throw it away properly?

114
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,960
Here's the trash bin.

115
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,920
So what?

116
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,160
I want to throw it here.

117
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,920
I want to throw it away, like this.

118
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,280
What are you going to do about it?

119
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Mi...

120
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,840
This is what you get for not siding with me.

121
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
Here.

122
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,120
Two trash bins.

123
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,680
Faidam!

124
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Faidam!

125
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,440
Hey!

126
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,840
Why did you walk away?

127
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,160
What now, Miss Ga?

128
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,480
You're just a maid.

129
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,880
You'll never get any further than this.

130
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,840
Always doing us rich people's bidding.

131
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,560
Hey.

132
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
Faidam!

133
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,880
You did it on purpose!

134
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
You fell on your own.

135
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,280
Don't blame others.

136
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,600
I didn't even blame you.

137
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,640
Blame me?

138
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,840
What did I do to you?!

139
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,120
Here.

140
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,400
The water spilled over.

141
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,960
Right here, here and here.

142
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,360
How many times do I have to mop

143
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,120
until it's dried, dried, and dried!

144
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,400
You're just a maid.

145
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,320
It's you job to clean them.

146
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
No matter how dirty I make it,

147
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,000
- you still need to clean them. - Stop!

148
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,560
Stop it! Miss Ga!

149
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,760
If you have so much free time,

150
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
do your make up, your hair, or bathe!

151
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,480
Don't create more work for me.

152
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
I will.

153
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,440
So what's it for you?!

154
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,760
Faidam!

155
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,560
I'm all wet.

156
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,400
You did it on purpose.

157
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,600
You do it to yourself.

158
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,840
Come here! Here!

159
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,960
Here!

160
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,920
Miss Ga!

161
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,040
Stop creating troubles, Miss Ga.

162
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,480
Know that I don't want troubles with you!

163
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,400
Don't want trouble?

164
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Sure.

165
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,360
You don't want problems with me

166
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,960
but I want problems with you!

167
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,080
Faidam!

168
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
You...

169
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,440
Miss Ga!

170
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,560
What's this pricking in my thumb.

171
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
They said

172
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,960
"I think it's some sort of

173
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,440
superstition, a bad omen."

174
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,280
I can feel it for the whole day.

175
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
Honey.

176
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,040
It's happening to me too.

177
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,160
Really?

178
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,200
Please tell me you won't leave me in jail again.

179
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,440
Had enough?

180
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
Yes.

181
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,880
I'll leave you there

182
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,680
if you drunk and drive again.

183
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,480
You'll be left rotten in jail

184
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,240
and I won't do anything to help.

185
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,840
Mean.

186
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,520
I have a bad feeling about this.

187
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,200
This pricking on my thumb

188
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,080
tells me something bad is happening.

189
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
Pa.

190
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,880
Call Oab for me.

191
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,520
I'm worried about Dao.

192
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,880
Alright, I will do that.

193
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,440
It's so annoying.

194
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
Faidam.

195
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,280
Still not done with mopping?

196
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,720
You're getting really lazy.

197
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,680
What problem are you asking for this time?

198
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,040
I'll do it until you're finally fired.

199
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,080
Have you taken my clothes down?

200
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,120
You've been using me nonstop.

201
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,760
Cook, wash the dishes, clean up, mop the floor,

202
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,760
clean up again, and mop again!

203
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,160
I'm busy doing work like this.

204
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,320
I've got no time to take them down.

205
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,320
You're lucky, I've got time to wash and dry it.

206
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,800
You dare argue with me?!

207
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,080
It's your job so do it!

208
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,720
Go get my clothes!

209
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,800
If the dew falls and my clothes smell,

210
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,320
you'll wash it again tomorrow!

211
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,440
Why do I have to do it for

212
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,080
some who doesn't have manners?!

213
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
Doctor.

214
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,520
Look at this.

215
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,360
She did this to me.

216
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,520
Mom spoils her too much.

217
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,200
She needs to be warned.

218
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,360
It's alright.

219
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,960
I don't want people

220
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,080
in the house to hate me more than this.

221
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,840
Especially since she's your mom's favorite.

222
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,560
I don't want any problems.

223
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,040
No, Riga.

224
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,520
It's still wrong.

225
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,960
If you let her do this, she'll do it again.

226
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,720
Forget it, it's alright.

227
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,560
You must be tired.

228
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,400
You should rest.

229
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
I'll get you fresh orange juice.

230
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
Let's go.

231
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,760
Have a seat.

232
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,840
I'll have Faidam serve the orange juice I prepared.

233
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,720
What about you?

234
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,640
I'll go pack my things first.

235
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,560
Faidam refused to do it for me.

236
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,680
Faidam.

237
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,960
What is it, Miss Ga?

238
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
Faidam.

239
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,480
Serve him the freshly squeezed juice that I prepared.

240
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Okay.

241
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,760
I'll head upstairs now.

242
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,280
Suddenly talking nice.

243
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,000
What is she up to now?

244
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,400
Faidam.

245
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,640
I'll take it to Doctor.

246
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,080
Okay.

247
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,960
Hey! I'll take it to Doctor myself.

248
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,040
Hand it to me!

249
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,960
I'll take it.

250
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,920
Faidam! What are you doing?

251
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,360
What is this?!

252
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,640
What did I do?

253
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,800
I knew it! You're up to something!

254
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,560
I just asked for a bit of your help.

255
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,560
Why start troubles with me?

256
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,360
I was also being nice to you.

257
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,640
What is this?!

258
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,560
I don't know what's wrong with Faidam.

259
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,400
I don't know why she's mad at me.

260
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,960
She suddenly come up to me

261
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,240
and splashed the orange juice all over me and my clothes.

262
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,480
- I... - Hey!

263
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,760
I don't know what you're mad at me about but

264
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,560
I'm sorry, Faidam.

265
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,280
I didn't do anything to you!

266
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,600
The juice, you did it to yourself!

267
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,880
I already apologized.

268
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,920
Why are you say I'm lying?

269
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,240
Hey, I never thought you'd be this kind of person.

270
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,040
Not admitting your own fault

271
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,640
and even blaming it on me!

272
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,520
My clothes are expensive.

273
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I wouldn't go around splashing orange juice on them.

274
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,720
Stop shedding crocodile tears.

275
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,040
All day long you've been causing me troubles.

276
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,160
How far will you keep this going?

277
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Faidam.

278
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,880
Come with me.

279
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,000
Don't, Doctor.

280
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,880
Don't be rash.

281
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,680
It's my fault

282
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,880
for using her.

283
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,640
Faidam.

284
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,800
I'll apologize again

285
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,120
for bothering you.

286
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,280
I won't bother and mess with you again.

287
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,080
Why are you apologizing?

288
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,840
It's obvious she's started it.

289
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,920
Apologize to Riga.

290
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,520
No.

291
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,840
I'm not wrong.

292
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,880
How are you not?

293
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,880
I stand here, I can see what you did and say.

294
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,960
Stop lying!

295
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,640
Apologize to Riga now.

296
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,680
No!

297
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
Faidam!

298
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,960
This is too much.

299
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,240
I'm your boss.

300
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,720
You'll do as I say!

301
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,440
So what if you're the boss?

302
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,920
Need me to repeat that again?

303
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,840
A maid must obey the boss.

304
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,120
So a maid doesn't have a heart?

305
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,320
And have to tolerate for boss's scolding?!

306
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,320
If so,

307
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,800
I won't stay at this house anymore!

308
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,040
If all this time,

309
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,240
my family make you

310
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,920
work more than you can take it.

311
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,120
Then leave!

312
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,880
I'm so hungry!

313
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,920
I know.

314
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,080
Your treat, Buab.

315
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,240
- I'll take two rice porridge, auntie. - Sure.

316
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
Thank you.

317
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,400
Buab!

318
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,800
Eating hot porridge

319
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,040
at night is pure bliss, isn't it?

320
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,280
Especially when eating with a significant other.

321
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,160
- Buab! - You'll see after we're done with porridge.

322
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,480
Buab, we should order one for Faidam.

323
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,320
Today she's doing all my chores.

324
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,960
Sure.

325
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,880
Auntie, one more porridge with egg.

326
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
A special.

327
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,120
You're the cutest!

328
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,280
Of course!

329
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,480
- Buab. - Yes?

330
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,600
We shouldn't be home so late.

331
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,680
They said

332
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,440
"A construction worker fell off the building and died near the alleyway."

333
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,000
Whoever walk pass will a ghost

334
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,800
with bulging eyes and sticking its tongue out.

335
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,520
So scary you'll be forever haunted!

336
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,160
I'm so scared! Scary!

337
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,280
Why are you telling me this now?

338
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,040
I just remembered!

339
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,120
But I think

340
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,720
nothing beats your face.

341
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,280
Just kidding.

342
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,400
Hurry up!

343
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,120
- Auntie, is it done? - Yes.

344
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,360
Thank you.

345
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,080
Buab, I'm scared.

346
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Me too.

347
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,600
Did you see something?

348
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,920
Your voice is trembling.

349
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,400
I don't see anything.

350
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,760
You must see something

351
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,360
your voice is trembling.

352
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,480
Don't lie to me.

353
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,720
My voice is like this because you put

354
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,880
the hot porridge right by my side.

355
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,200
My side is all burned now!

356
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,320
Why didn't you say so!

357
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,000
- Here I thought you saw a ghost! - Not yet.

358
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,160
- Not yet? - Why don't you take it away!

359
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,920
I'm sorry, Buab!

360
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,920
- Isn't that Faidam? - Right!

361
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,520
Where are you going, Faidam?!

362
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,000
- Follow her! Hurry!

363
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,600
Faidam!

364
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,000
Where are you going?!

365
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,040
Faidam!

366
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
- Faidam! - Faidam!

367
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,680
Why are you crying?

368
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,680
And where are you going?

369
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,160
I'm fired.

370
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,800
- Huh?! - Huh?!

371
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,880
Fired?

372
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,800
Doctor just fired me.

373
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,280
Was he joking around?

374
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,080
He wasn't joking.

375
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,640
Sit down first.

376
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,440
Sit, sit here.

377
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,480
Calm down Faidam.

378
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,320
Calm down.

379
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,840
Where are you going?

380
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,160
I don't know.

381
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,680
Wait! hold on.

382
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,480
Calm down first.

383
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,760
It's already late, where are you going?

384
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,480
Calm down Faidam, okay?

385
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
Okay?

386
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,920
No matter what, I won't go back

387
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,800
to work at that house ever again.

388
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,200
Faidam!

389
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,280
Are you going to leave me?

390
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,680
Stay with me, please.

391
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,760
Faidam.

392
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,440
Calm down first.

393
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,440
It's already late now.

394
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Besides,

395
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,920
this alley is haunted by a vicious ghost.

396
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,880
If we don't go back, we'll all be haunted by it.

397
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,560
Faidam.

398
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,080
Aren't you close with Mr. Wat?

399
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,120
How could you forget him?

400
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,520
Let's head over to see Mr. Wat first.

401
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,440
Please, don't go anywhere alone.

402
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,040
Let's go there.

403
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,120
Buab.

404
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,120
- Take her to see Mr. Wat. - Let's go.

405
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,600
- Come with me. - Let's go.

406
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,760
Hurry up.

407
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,120
Faidam isn't coming back?

408
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,480
You already fired her.

409
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
She went to stay at Mr. Wat's house.

410
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
Good.

411
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,760
She can go wherever she wants.

412
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,160
Excuse me then!

413
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,760
I'm sorry.

414
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,120
I didn't think things will escalate like this.

415
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,480
It's fine.

416
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,360
It's not your fault.

417
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,480
But she's your mom's favorite.

418
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,520
But right now

419
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,400
you should leave.

420
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,960
Why?

421
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,920
If my mom comes back and sees you but not Faidam,

422
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,040
it'll cause a huge problem.

423
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,600
I'll have Taew wash your things.

424
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,880
You can come and get them later.

425
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
Alright.

426
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,120
I'll go get my keys and my bags.

427
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,240
You probably want to go anyways.

428
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,160
Good.

429
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,280
Let it end this way.

430
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
And then?

431
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,080
Then he kicked me out!

432
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,200
My god!

433
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,120
That Riga isn't an ordinary person.

434
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,760
What a good acting skills.

435
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,640
Not surprised even Doctor is fooled.

436
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,200
Of course, who else would he believe if it not his wife?!

437
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,880
- Wife? - Yes, wife.

438
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,040
I saw with my own eyes.

439
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,280
They shared the room.

440
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,280
When morning comes,

441
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,960
they were doping on boiled eggs and raw eggs!

442
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,080
Moreover,

443
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,320
that woman had me wash her filthy panties from last night.

444
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,960
That's harsh.

445
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,200
What will you do now?

446
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,640
Nothing.

447
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,160
I think ended this way is fine.

448
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,160
What if he wants to reconcile?

449
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,760
There's no way I'm going back.

450
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,080
Can you stop staring at me?

451
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,520
Sure.

452
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,040
Thank you.

453
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,880
(Grandma)

454
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,960
Would it be okay if I come to you

455
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,440
for advice about Doctor again?

456
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,920
Today you said you need advice about Brother.

457
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,240
But during the dinner,

458
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,720
you didn't mention him at all.

459
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,400
Oab.

460
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,200
Was the advice an excuse?

461
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,600
Well, if I hadn't done that,

462
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,520
will you talk to me then?

463
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,400
I just wanted to see you,

464
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,200
take you out for dinner,

465
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,960
chase after you.

466
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,400
Actually,

467
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,320
you can just be honest with me.

468
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,880
I also wanted to...

469
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,120
Miss Phon!

470
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,280
Doctor kicked Faidam out of the house!

471
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,360
- What?! - What?!

472
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,240
Brother.

473
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,160
Hey, Phon, Oab.

474
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,480
Why did you kick Faidam out?

475
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,240
When Auntie comes back,

476
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,080
how are you going to tell her?

477
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,920
It's not a big deal.

478
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,080
She's just a cook.

479
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,080
If she's gone, we just need to replace her.

480
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,360
But Auntie doesn't see her as just a cook.

481
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,960
If you don't want to hear her lecture,

482
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,600
then find her now!

483
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,600
How could you do this?

484
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,240
- I... - And you knew...

485
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,880
that Faidam is my sister, Lomdao.

486
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,720
You still kicked her out.

487
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,040
And let her run away!?

488
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,000
I thought you were

489
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,560
going to tell her how you feel.

490
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,640
Or this is what you wanted to tell her.

491
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Answer me.

492
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,600
You won't answer?!

493
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,640
I really regret that I entrusting Dao to you.

494
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,880
(Grandma)

495
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,840
Yes, Grandma.

496
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,560
I've been calling you for a long time.

497
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,200
Why won't you answer?!

498
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,240
There's a bit of a problem.

499
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,600
The reason I called is because I'm concern.

500
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,120
All day long, I felt the pricking on my thumb.

501
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,760
I called you but you won't pick up.

502
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,720
Let me hear what this problem is.

503
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,240
Doctor kicked Dao out of the house.

504
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,440
What?!

505
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,000
So where is she now?!

506
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,160
I don't know.

507
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,520
Useless, you don't know anything.

508
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,520
Pack up.

509
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,800
We're going to Bangkok.

510
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,680
That's why I kept feeling

511
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,440
the pricking on my thumb all day long.

512
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,280
So a maid doesn't have a heart?

513
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,600
And have to tolerate for boss's scolding?!

514
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,480
If so,

515
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,920
I won't stay at this house anymore!

516
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,200
If all this time,

517
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,520
my family make you

518
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,960
work more than you can take it.

519
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,280
Then leave!

520
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,240
I'm sorry, Dao.

521
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,640
I must've been too harsh on you.

522
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,480
I'm gone.

523
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,240
But no one seems to be bothered by it.

524
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,400
Are you complaining?

525
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,760
No, it's nothing.

526
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,960
I'm getting my work.

527
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,920
Were you peeking on him?

528
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,400
Why would I do that?

529
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,840
How would I know?

530
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,160
Wat.

531
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,800
What's that supposed to mean?

532
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,960
What is it?

533
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,600
Dr. Param is here.

534
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,200
Doctor's coming.

535
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,520
Alright, I'm coming.

536
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,480
What do we do?

537
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,640
What?

538
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,840
Are you coming with me?

539
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,640
He's here to see you.

540
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,440
That has nothing to do with me.

541
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
Doctor.

542
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,720
- What's the matter? - Mr. Wat.

543
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,680
Faidam is here, isn't she?

544
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,440
I'm sorry

545
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,560
if she's bothering you.

546
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,240
Oh, no, it's fine.

547
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,600
She's well acquainted with everyone here.

548
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,480
Could you please let her know that

549
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,080
I'm here to take her home.

550
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,640
Take her home?

551
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,120
But she didn't spend a night here.

552
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,520
Didn't spend a night here?

553
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,640
That's right.

554
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,840
I can't hear what are they talking about?

555
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,040
What are you doing here?

556
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,760
Working.

557
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,440
Oh, working.

558
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,320
Not eavesdropping?

559
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,160
Then you probably don't want to know

560
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,920
why Doctor's here.

561
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,240
I do!

562
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,640
Wat!

563
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,080
Wat!

564
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,320
Wat!

565
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,120
Hey, why's he here?

566
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,480
He asked me to find him a new cook.

567
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,280
What? Find them a new cook?!

568
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,240
He said you quit.

569
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,040
He must be happy that I'm finally gone.

570
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,160
Hey!

571
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,360
Stop assuming things.

572
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,400
He didn't say that, I swear.

573
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,200
Hey.

574
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,600
Then, why was he here?

575
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,120
He's here to take you home.

576
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,920
Did you...

577
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,800
Did you tell him I'm not going?

578
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,200
Hey, you're not his girlfriend.

579
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,360
You don't get to play hard, okay?

580
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,000
Right now, you're just a cook!

581
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,520
Not his fiancee, Lomdao,

582
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,400
that he has to reconcile with.

583
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,960
You're lucky enough he wants you back.

584
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,720
But that Riga was pretending.

585
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,320
Doctor think she's a good person.

586
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,760
She did it intentionally.

587
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,640
What's wrong with not letting her do that to me one-sidedly?

588
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,720
Doctor is wrong.

589
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,280
Why didn't he listen to me?

590
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,800
He listened only to Riga.

591
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,000
Stop whining.

592
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,960
You need to realize where you stand.

593
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,880
He's the boss and you're just a maid!

594
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,720
And you told me yourself that she's his wife.

595
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,480
If he sided with his wife instead of you,

596
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,800
I don't think it's strange.

597
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,120
(Max)

598
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,560
Yes, Max?

599
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,240
I miss you too.

600
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,240
Yes.

601
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,560
Dao.

602
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,920
I think your heart isn't with Max anymore.

603
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,160
Where could she be if not at Wat's house.

604
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,680
Oab, where's your sister?

605
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,200
I don't know, Mom.

606
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,760
Doctor called and told me

607
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,120
that she went to Wat's house.

608
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,800
But then Wat told him she's not there.

609
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,560
Right now he's looking for her.

610
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,560
How could this doctor boy do this to her?!

611
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,400
Honey, calm down first.

612
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,000
I won't let some random boy

613
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,320
make my precious baby girl sad!

614
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,400
Why let him marry her

615
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,080
when he can't take care of her?!

616
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,040
Excuse me.

617
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,320
Have you seen a woman with bangs, a mole, and dark skinned?

618
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,560
I haven't.

619
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,640
Thank you.

620
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,920
Faidam!

621
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,680
Hey.

622
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Faidam!

623
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,280
Faidam!

624
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,840
Faidam!

625
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,280
Did you call me?

626
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,240
No, I'm sorry.

627
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,960
Would you spare me some change?

628
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,360
Thank you!

629
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
I'll leave first.

630
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,760
I'm running late.

631
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,160
Let me know if you find Faidam.

632
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,760
I don't know where else to find her.

633
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,280
I wonder that she's okay or not.

634
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,120
Doctor!

635
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,360
Someone's here to see you.

636
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,600
He said he's Miss Lomdao's father.

637
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,480
Hello.

638
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,760
Please come inside.

639
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,920
No need.

640
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,120
I'm here to ask about my daughter.

641
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,760
Why did you kick her out?!

642
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,280
I…

643
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,720
- Just "I..." ?! - Dad!

644
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,800
- Dad, don't! - Let me go, Oab!

645
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,120
That's not enough!

646
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,600
Please hear me out.

647
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,200
Hear you?! Hear you?!

648
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,240
Dad!

649
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,760
That's enough, Dad!

650
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,440
Remember this.

651
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,640
No matter how much

652
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,240
my mom wants you to marry Dao.

653
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,040
But I

654
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,440
strongly disagree!

655
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,560
And I won't let her marry you!

656
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,160
Let go.

657
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,680
You should hurry and fix this, Doctor.

658
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,800
If you still couldn't find her.

659
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,360
Not only I won't stop my dad,

660
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,160
but I will join in and beat you up.

661
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,600
I don't know what problems

662
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,600
that Doctor has with his fiancee's family.

663
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,320
Miss Dao's father came and

664
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,000
started punching Doctor.

665
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,160
He fell to the ground bleeding

666
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,720
and breathing heavily.

667
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,760
As if he's about to die!

668
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,000
I don't know what's the problem.

669
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,280
For real?

670
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,440
What are they talking about over there?

671
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,320
Nosy!

672
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,480
It must be about me, Wat.

673
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,600
I agree.

674
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,200
Dao, I think you should stop this.

675
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,480
I also want to stop.

676
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,200
But as I told you,

677
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,720
I still don't have the evidence to expose them.

678
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,120
If that's the case,

679
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,200
everyone will force me to get married.

680
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,200
I had Taew washed and ironed it for you.

681
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,440
Thank you.

682
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
Your face.

683
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,240
Doesn't it hurt?

684
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,880
I was worried thinking it was serious.

685
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,840
Seems just fine.

686
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,360
And still have someone to take care of you.

687
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,040
Probably look at every nook and cranny!

688
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,600
What?

689
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,080
Nothing.

690
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,520
Where did you go?

691
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,840
It was just a little peek.

692
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,480
Then?

693
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,400
It doesn't seem serious, he already has someone by his side.

694
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,920
Hey! aren't you curious who this person is?

695
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,800
But you want to talk.

696
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,880
Tell me.

697
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,680
It's Riga!

698
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,240
Rubbing his face practically possessing him! but I walked back.

699
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,200
Right now they're probably getting it on!

700
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,840
Jealousy?

701
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,880
No way!

702
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,160
Jealous of what?

703
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,080
I wanted to know so I went ahead and check.

704
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,840
Whoever he sleeps with is his business.

705
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,360
It has nothing to do with me.

706
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,440
Let's go back to our home, Faidam.

707
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,920
(Next episode.)

708
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,680
I'll give you a raise.

709
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,840
For 500 baht.

710
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,360
Faidam!

711
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,200
It's good that you're back.

712
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,400
Quickly go cook something for me.

713
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,880
You stupid doctor!
