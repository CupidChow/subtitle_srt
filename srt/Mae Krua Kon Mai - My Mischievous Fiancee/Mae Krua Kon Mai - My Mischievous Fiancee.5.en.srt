1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,960
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,360
I'm sure she can manage on her own.

3
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,960
But what I'm worried about is her schemes.

4
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,680
That girl is something.

5
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,480
My future husband, Dr. Param

6
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,480
is inviting me to move into his house.

7
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,640
(Previously...)

8
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,840
Isn't she moving in here?

9
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,320
I don't want you to give the media news about me.

10
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,200
Especially false information

11
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,320
but I didn't say it to the media.

12
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,000
Is there a problem, Doctor?

13
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,240
I have something to tell you.

14
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,720
What is it?

15
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,880
There's a guy who came to see me.

16
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,200
He asked me to perform an appendectomy on his wife.

17
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,640
but I'm sure I already performed it a week ago.

18
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,640
And she came back for more?

19
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,520
I remember only seeing one

20
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,440
when I performed a surgery on her.

21
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,000
I was the one who cut it.

22
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,680
And the guy said

23
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,520
his wife only had one appendix

24
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,800
but he has two wives.

25
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,480
He's a player, Doctor.

26
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,120
What's wrong?

27
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,520
Why aren't you laughing?

28
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,320
Dead silent.

29
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,040
Doctor, Come on.

30
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,520
The more you smile

31
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,160
the happier you are.

32
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,320
Oh, Doctor. Are you going anywhere after work?

33
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,480
No, I'll head straight home.

34
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,600
If didn't know you

35
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,880
I'd think you're hiding your lover at home.

36
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,760
Always home for dinner.

37
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,080
Is the food back home better than other places?

38
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
Hey, Doctor.

39
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,640
Can I come over and have dinner at your place?

40
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
Sure.

41
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
We'll schedule it.

42
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,480
Then I'll head home now.

43
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,280
A bonding moment between doctors. Nice!

44
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,120
- Doctor. - What's the matter?

45
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,080
Why are you waiting for me here? Why don't you come inside?

46
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,360
I'm fine with waiting outside, your mom might not be happy if I entered.

47
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,040
Why did you come see me?

48
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,840
I don't want you to think

49
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,440
I'm not the one who leaked the news.

50
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,240
Ratchanee didn't leak it either

51
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,800
since she already went overseas yesterday evening.

52
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,080
I was just warning you it's nothing serious.

53
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,640
But I am serious.

54
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,320
I don't want you misunderstand me.

55
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,640
Also, I've already checked.

56
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,760
The media didn't publish this news.

57
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,120
That's good then.

58
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,000
You said you guys aren't a thing

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,240
but you're flirting right in front of the house.

60
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,880
But it bothers me.

61
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,480
I recall someone else at the scene.

62
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,360
If it's not Ratchanee and me

63
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,560
then it must be her.

64
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,320
Who?

65
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,720
That foul mouth interior designer, Lomdao.

66
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,080
She must have known you.

67
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,240
Otherwise you wouldn't have heard of it.

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,320
Who has a foul mouth?!

69
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,000
Would you like me to fix it?

70
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,280
It's rude to say that to your superior.

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,440
Riga, please leave.

72
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,360
I am not worried about this at all.

73
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,520
It's good that you're not responsible for this.

74
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,160
Dang.

75
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,120
The master chased you out

76
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,640
and you still won't leave?

77
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,120
Why won't this guest leave?

78
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,880
You're just a maid

79
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,680
why are you meddling with us?

80
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,080
Because I am a maid

81
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,600
I need to be concern for my boss.

82
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,240
I visit his bedroom in the morning.

83
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,480
I cook for him in the late morning.

84
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,840
I give him massage at noon.

85
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,480
I send him off to bed at night.

86
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,480
My boss never complain a thing.

87
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
Faidam.

88
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,120
Isn't that right, Doctor?

89
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,920
Anyway, I don't know the person you mentioned.

90
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,440
And you should head back.

91
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,080
I'm heading inside.

92
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
Doctor.

93
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,720
Please listen to me, Doctor.

94
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,120
Still not heading back?

95
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,640
He chased you already.

96
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,720
Are you planning to bite his lips again?

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,280
But you can never assault him again.

98
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,120
Over my dead body.

99
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,680
You're nuts.

100
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,280
Faidam.

101
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,560
Come inside.

102
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,080
Excuse me.

103
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,600
He probably wants his maid

104
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
to send him off to bed.

105
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,480
Oops.

106
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,920
I forgot to close the gate.

107
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,960
What's wrong with this maid?

108
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,640
Doctor.

109
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,440
I'll put your briefcase in your room.

110
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,080
Hold on, Faidam.

111
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,320
What's the matter, Doctor?

112
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,480
Why did you talk to Riga like that?

113
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
What did I say?

114
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,040
That you entered my room...

115
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,200
Your bedroom.

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yes.

117
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,080
I don't want people to be saying I...

118
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,880
That you bring your servant to your bed.

119
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,360
Isn't that right, Doctor?

120
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,240
Don't say that again.

121
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
Sure.

122
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,240
You're just scared that

123
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,960
Miss Riga will misunderstood.

124
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,560
Dao must have went to see Angkab.

125
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,160
Who's calling?

126
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
Hello.

127
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,000
Hello, Grandma.

128
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,960
Did Dao come to see you?

129
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,040
Yes. Only a couple of times

130
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,480
saying she's busy with work.

131
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,520
Dao has work?

132
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,560
Yes, she brought me to her workplace the other day.

133
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,160
Really?

134
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,080
Did she tell you anything?

135
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,600
Dao only complained about

136
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,040
her large amount of work.

137
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,440
If she said anything important

138
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,160
don't forget to report it to me.

139
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,680
Of course, Grandma.

140
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,520
How can I tell her that young miss is a drug addict.

141
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,640
Is it tasty, Madam?

142
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,120
It's here.

143
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,280
Hey, hold on.

144
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,800
You had leftover change from buying grocery

145
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,080
to buy mango with sticky rice for us?

146
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,800
That's not it.

147
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,080
Faidam bought it

148
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,320
with her own money.

149
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,360
Precisely.

150
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,480
I want the Madam, Miss Phon, and Doctor

151
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,120
to eat delicious food.

152
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,160
Eat a lot, Madam.

153
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,280
I tried my best.

154
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,520
Are you guilty of something?

155
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,560
Trying to please me like this.

156
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,240
I didn't do anything, Madam.

157
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,040
But according to psychological principles

158
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,320
people tend to cover up the guilt in their heart.

159
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,440
But they say

160
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,800
people who study psychology

161
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,080
are undiagnosed psychopath.

162
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,760
If you're a psychopath no one would know.

163
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Faidam.

164
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,400
Enough, Param.

165
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,720
Hey.

166
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,600
Call Grandma Pathum

167
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,720
and check whether Lomdao has returned?

168
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,160
What's wrong?

169
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,440
Why are you so clumsy?

170
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,520
Sorry, Madam.

171
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,680
Don't pretend you didn't hear me.

172
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,320
They will think you do not care about her

173
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,840
if you still do not act up.

174
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,680
But I really do not care about her.

175
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,520
I don't want to know about her.

176
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,480
I don't care when she came back.

177
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,920
And I don't care

178
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,720
whether she'll meet us or not.

179
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
Brother.

180
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,800
Please don't be upset at her.

181
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,440
I'm sure she has her own reason.

182
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,960
No one wants to marry a stranger.

183
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,360
But in all seriousness

184
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,320
I don't want to marry her.

185
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,360
Of course.

186
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,760
You already have a lover.

187
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,120
You act as if I wanted to marry you.

188
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,160
You crazy doctor.

189
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,200
What are you complaining about?

190
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,400
Nothing.

191
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,480
What are you doing?

192
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,200
Nothing.

193
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,200
Just scribbling.

194
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,640
Are you sure?

195
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,640
Yes.

196
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,800
Nothing, really.

197
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,520
By the way

198
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,920
how's it going with Buab.

199
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,920
I don't want to brag about it.

200
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,200
Don't brag then.

201
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,320
I want to talk about it.

202
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
Fine.

203
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,960
Buab and I

204
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,320
love each other

205
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,320
very much.

206
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,640
Hey, that's what falling in love is like.

207
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,720
You can speak English?

208
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,280
Well

209
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,400
a little.

210
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,200
Then can you teach me some English song?

211
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,240
Like

212
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,120
I am going to serenade him an English song.

213
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
No problem.

214
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,280
You need to warm up first.

215
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
Stand up.

216
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,840
Sing.

217
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,560
Let's skip to singing.

218
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,960
Let's sing now.

219
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,160
- Sing now? - Yes.

220
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
Like this.

221
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
How was that?

222
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,520
I sang this when I was in kindergarten.

223
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,760
How nonsensical.

224
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,240
I paid so much attention.

225
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,320
I don't think she's an ordinary cook.

226
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,840
(Oab)

227
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,960
Oh.

228
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,960
Why don't you pick up the call?

229
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,200
I don't want to.

230
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,960
Just answer it in case it's an important call.

231
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,600
It's just Oab, it's probably nothing.

232
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,400
Did you guys fight again?

233
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,920
We didn't fight.

234
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
I just

235
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,720
don't like his way of thinking.

236
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What?

237
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,320
About what?

238
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,720
Well.

239
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,520
About brother and Miss Dao.

240
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,800
Oh dear.

241
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,680
Why are you fighting over that?

242
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,720
I'm speaking from a woman's view.

243
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,960
But he said that I am unreasonable.

244
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,320
What about you, Auntie?

245
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,760
Why do you insist on having brother marry Miss Dao?

246
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,920
Is it necessary to force him?

247
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,960
I have my own reasons.

248
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,440
(Oab)

249
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,400
Why isn't she picking up?

250
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,440
Women are so difficult to understand.

251
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,840
When she's angry she turns her back on you.

252
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,960
She ignores and won't pick up her phone.

253
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
What's wrong?

254
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,440
They won't pay the debt?

255
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,360
Or the debtor won't answer the call?

256
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
No, Dad.

257
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,680
I called Phon but she won't pick up her phone.

258
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,040
Girl problem.

259
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,400
Oh, I made a mistake.

260
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,280
Dad.

261
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,280
Huh?

262
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,160
Should we go look for Dao in Bangkok?

263
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,200
Look for Dao?

264
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,080
Or reconcile with Phon?

265
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,720
Oab.

266
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,520
There are still plenty of work.

267
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,000
How can you just leave?

268
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,280
I want to go reconcile with Phon.

269
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
Please, Dad.

270
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,320
Let me go reconcile.

271
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,680
No.

272
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Work!

273
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,680
Is your back hurt?

274
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,720
Allow me to massage your back.

275
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,440
- You're so tired and sweaty. - Don't massage. No!

276
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,200
- Dad. - No way.

277
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,560
- Where are you going? - No.

278
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
Dad.

279
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,600
No.

280
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,960
Why did you destroy Oab's dream like that?

281
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,800
Let's save Oab's matter for later.

282
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,000
I don't want to rush Dao

283
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,560
but I don't think Dao wants to meet us yet.

284
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,240
I also don't want to displease Grandma

285
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,440
but I also empathize with Dao.

286
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,160
If I had to guess

287
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,320
I think

288
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,480
she's somewhere near Dr. Param.

289
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,280
Shampoo? Would you like a free shampoo?

290
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,880
- You can try it our shampoo for free. - Hey!

291
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,440
Faidam, act like we're not together.

292
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,280
We can go get more samples that way.

293
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,240
Make your hair beautiful.

294
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
Okay.

295
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,600
Shampoo? Would you like a free shampoo?

296
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
Oh.

297
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,080
Hello, what shampoo are you using right now?

298
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,600
Oh! I use this brand.

299
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,160
My whole family use this one.

300
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,480
I used it and my hair became glossy.

301
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,080
Just like silk!

302
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,360
And you? Are you using this shampoo?

303
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,000
No, I used another brand.

304
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,800
Why did you say that?

305
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,800
Then please try this.

306
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,480
So you can feel how special our shampoo is.

307
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,120
Take it!

308
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,760
Yes, thank you.

309
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Oh?

310
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,440
What about mine?

311
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,520
But you're already using our shampoo.

312
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,120
I'm sure you already know how special it is, there's no need for a sample.

313
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,680
Huh?

314
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,320
Shampoo? Would you like a free shampoo?

315
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,680
Cheapskate, couldn't even spare one for me.

316
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,960
Madam.

317
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,640
Madam.

318
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Madam.

319
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,520
Here, I'll give it to you.

320
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,000
It's fine if you don't want it

321
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,160
then I'll use it myself.

322
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Wow.

323
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,320
I just saved 25 baht for this.

324
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,720
To think they'd pass this out for free.

325
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,200
This is so expensive.

326
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
Too bad.

327
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,680
Madam doesn't want it.

328
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,120
Fine, I'll take it.

329
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,800
I don't want to hurt your feelings.

330
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,240
Fresh fruit.

331
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,440
Madam.

332
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,760
There are orange, apple, banana, and guava.

333
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,840
Guava sounds nice.

334
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,280
Grab some.

335
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,800
The big one is 20 baht per kilogram, the small one is 10 baht per kilogram.

336
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,080
This is only 10 baht?

337
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,760
Yes.

338
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,400
I'll take 10 baht.

339
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,920
10 baht, 20 baht.

340
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,680
10 baht, 20 baht.

341
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,720
10 baht...

342
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,080
Take the big one, Madam.

343
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,760
The big one is bigger, Doctor likes it.

344
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
Fine.

345
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,960
Since got the big ones

346
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,240
I'll give you the small ones for free.

347
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,000
Wait. Then I'll only take the free small ones.

348
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,440
I'll return the big ones. Okay?

349
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,560
No!

350
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,280
How can I give you things for free.

351
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,560
You can't bargain like this, Go!

352
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,360
- Careful around the eyes. - Madam.

353
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,800
Why did you say that to her?

354
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,000
You might as well ask them for free.

355
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,040
Because I asked them for free stuff

356
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,880
that's why I am all bruised up.

357
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,080
Good thing that she didn't kill you.

358
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,200
I'm making sacrifices for everyone.

359
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,520
Why are you guys complaining?

360
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,520
Are you Jesus Christ? Making sacrifices for everyone like him.

361
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,280
I think if we just bought them

362
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,800
we wouldn't have to waste money on medicine.

363
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,120
Buy?

364
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Buy this

365
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
buy that.

366
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,840
Where are you going to get money from?

367
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,240
Are you going to spend your own money?

368
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,600
Fine.

369
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Hey.

370
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,560
Had I known you'd argue with me like this

371
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,560
I'd buy poisoned guava and feed you.

372
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,320
Oh, Madam.

373
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,120
If I knew there were poisoned guava

374
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,920
I'd immediately eat it.

375
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,080
At least, it's better than being your cook.

376
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
Look.

377
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,920
I got caught in the crossfire, My face is now ruined.

378
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,240
Your face is ruined?

379
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,000
You should have gotten ran over

380
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,360
by a ten wheeler ages ago.

381
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,960
Madam, look.

382
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,960
I think I am pretty.

383
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,120
Take a look, I am pretty.

384
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,960
Stop it already.

385
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,960
Stop it, Faidam.

386
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,960
Stop!

387
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,240
Stop fighting.

388
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
Look at her.

389
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,000
She bad-mouthed me first.

390
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,240
You little...

391
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,600
Auntie, you practically asked her for free.

392
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,800
Look. it wouldn't even cost that much.

393
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,960
That's right.

394
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,560
Would you like some poisoned guava, Miss Phon?

395
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,360
I told you, she's rude.

396
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,520
Let's go, Faidam.

397
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,560
Fine, fine.

398
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,080
Go now.

399
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,560
I told you, Mom.

400
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,240
She's not ordinary cook.

401
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,040
Who would have known she'd be a trouble maker.

402
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,640
You know very well

403
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,480
she's not right in the head.

404
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,400
I disagree.

405
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,160
I think she's brighter than we think.

406
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,360
What made you think so?

407
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,960
I don't know either.

408
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,160
I think she's faking it.

409
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,800
She fooled us into thinking she's weird.

410
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,480
I feel like

411
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,440
she has an ulterior move coming to this house.

412
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
Hey.

413
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,920
You mean

414
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,240
she's a spy for criminal?

415
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,800
A spy for criminal?

416
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,080
I am not sure either.

417
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,560
But I think

418
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,680
we should keep an eye on her.

419
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,560
Where did I place it?

420
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
Oh!

421
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,600
The refrigerator.

422
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,120
Who'd be crazy enough to put it in a refrigerator.

423
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,320
Seriously

424
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,360
where did I leave my notebook?

425
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,440
What if what brother said is true?

426
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,400
Yes, Miss Phon?

427
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,040
Nothing.

428
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,280
Hey

429
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,480
what are you looking for?

430
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
Oh.

431
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,560
I lost my recipe book.

432
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,800
I can't find it anywhere.

433
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,760
I'll help you look for it.

434
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,560
Oh. It's okay, Miss Phon.

435
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,080
I can find it myself.

436
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,400
Are you sure?

437
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,440
I'd feel bad.

438
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,840
I don't dare use my boss.

439
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
Miss Phon.

440
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,000
There's a call for you.

441
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,880
A call? Okay.

442
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,760
Oh!

443
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,680
Huh?

444
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,160
My garlic.

445
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,320
Oh.

446
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
Sorry.

447
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,240
Why did she look at me weird.

448
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,720
Huh?

449
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,160
What was that?

450
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
What did you say?

451
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,840
Why do you look like an owl?

452
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,400
What owl?

453
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
Oh?

454
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,840
Was she going to say "oh beautiful"?

455
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,160
Hello.

456
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,640
Phon.

457
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,720
It's me, Oab.

458
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,120
Don't hang up just yet.

459
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,240
Please listen to me.

460
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,240
You see.

461
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
I'm sorry.

462
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,600
I don't know why you're upset.

463
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,240
You said that women are unreasonable.

464
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,440
I didn't say you were.

465
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,120
I was talking about Dao's behavior.

466
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,800
It doesn't matter.

467
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,680
But I am a woman, too.

468
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,240
You should understand

469
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,000
why your sister doesn't want to marry my brother.

470
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,200
But you never bother asking.

471
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,440
And you called women unreasonable.

472
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,280
Did you think you were right?

473
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,640
I didn't think that I am...

474
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,040
Don't bother explaining.

475
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,400
Go listen to your sister instead

476
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,640
and don't call me anymore.

477
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,840
Phon.

478
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,240
Dao.

479
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,320
Causing trouble even though she's away.

480
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
Brother.

481
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,080
Why must you argue with Oab over Dao and I?

482
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,640
Because I don't like what he said.

483
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Women

484
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,760
are always self-centered.

485
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,360
It's not like that.

486
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,960
I just want you guys to understand

487
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,360
and stop blaming Miss Dao for everything.

488
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,840
Being forced to get married is a big deal.

489
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,080
She probably wants to marry someone she loves

490
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,000
more than a random stranger.

491
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,800
I'm not angry that she's not willing to marry

492
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,920
but I am angry that she doesn't respect Mom.

493
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,680
If she doesn't want to marry

494
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,840
she should be honest.

495
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,840
She can't just hide away when elders came to see her.

496
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,320
And do you think if she's honest about it

497
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,760
will the elders allow it?

498
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,680
And can you handle a rejection?

499
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,360
I don't think anyone will concede

500
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,120
and you probably can't handle it.

501
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,360
Because you've never been rejected before.

502
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,360
But she should at least talk it out first.

503
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,000
Exactly, why do you want to meet her?

504
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,120
Do you want to know if she's pretty or not?

505
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,800
That's not it.

506
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,880
I'm going to work now.

507
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
Yes.

508
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,440
Lemon soda, Miss Phon.

509
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,760
You're welcome.

510
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,520
It's my pleasure.

511
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,880
Miss Phon.

512
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,640
What's the matter?

513
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,280
Miss Phon.

514
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,240
What is it?

515
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,880
Please don't think I am being nosy.

516
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,920
Just now

517
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,480
what were you talking with the doctor about?

518
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,480
Why do you want to know that?

519
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,080
The doctor looked stressed out.

520
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,320
Why wouldn't he be?

521
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,000
His fiancee disappeared.

522
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
Huh?

523
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,240
The doctor has a fiancee?

524
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,640
She lives in Ubon Ratchathani.

525
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,640
Then

526
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,720
where did his fiancee disappeared to?

527
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,280
No one knows.

528
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,840
But I think it's not strange at all.

529
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,480
If I were forced to get married like her.

530
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,120
I would run away too.

531
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,920
Because I will only marry the one I love.

532
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,520
And the one that you love

533
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,800
is it Mr. Oabboon?

534
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
Faidam.

535
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,720
How did you know Oabboon?

536
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,040
You see...

537
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,160
Taew told me about him before.

538
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,320
Oh.

539
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,600
You sure like to gossip.

540
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Gosh-darn.

541
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,800
I got in trouble because of what you said.

542
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,360
Miss Phon probably thinks I like to gossip.

543
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,640
But I can't come up with other excuses.

544
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,200
And what will Miss Phon think of me?

545
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,840
Gossiping about one's boss.

546
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,640
Miss Phon hasn't said anything.

547
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,760
She probably doesn't think so.

548
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,120
Don't worry about it.

549
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,000
But I am not okay.

550
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,600
Also, I don't like that you used me as an excuse

551
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,760
when you went over to Mr. Wat's house. I always had to cover for you.

552
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,360
I'm sorry, please don't be angry at me.

553
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,560
I was originally Mr. Wat's people

554
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,200
sometimes I have problems that

555
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,800
I need to confide to Mr. Wat.

556
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,840
Why don't you just tell the Madam

557
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,280
that you went to Mr. Wat's house?

558
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,600
If I told her, she would fire me.

559
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,320
You already know that the Madam

560
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,080
doesn't want me to slack off.

561
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,520
Please, Taew.

562
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,880
You need to help me.

563
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,520
If I got fired.

564
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,320
My parents and siblings

565
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,160
will struggle a lot.

566
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,280
I also need to feed my grandparents.

567
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,440
As well as my nephews and nieces....

568
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,800
Faidam!

569
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
Hey.

570
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,280
Enough already.

571
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,400
Are you going to bring up your ancestors too?

572
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,920
Until you sympathize with me.

573
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,280
What do I have to do

574
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,480
until you can forgive me?

575
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,800
Well...

576
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,320
My clothes are S size.

577
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,360
But L for diamond rings.

578
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,960
Well then.

579
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,800
I will pass that message to Buab.

580
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,400
Sure thing.

581
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,160
I'll go set the table.

582
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,240
Yes.

583
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,920
Love you!

584
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,520
Sure.

585
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,600
How strange

586
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,600
the day that Mr. Oab visited

587
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,360
Faidam wasn't here

588
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,880
and I had to call her when he left.

589
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,880
Does Faidam know Mr. Oab?

590
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,920
Faidam is acting suspicious.

591
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,440
(Oab)

592
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,320
Yes, Oab?

593
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,640
I still can't find my sister.

594
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,240
I don't know where she went.

595
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,520
That's fine.

596
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,440
It's better that we don't marry.

597
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,000
If it weren't for my mom

598
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,720
I don't even want to see her face.

599
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,360
Hey.

600
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,560
Why did you say that?

601
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,920
You're not the only one who can reject other people.

602
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,960
I also have the right to reject you.

603
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,320
Lomdao.

604
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,040
Huh?

605
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,000
Is that what the doctor said?

606
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,320
I'm screwed.

607
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,400
Dr. Param must be angry with Dao's behavior.

608
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,920
How humiliating.

609
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,080
I can't find Dao anywhere.

610
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,360
Maybe she might be closer than we think.

611
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,760
We would've found her if that were the case.

612
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,640
Don't you think it's strange?

613
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,440
The fact that I found Dao's notebook

614
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,600
at Dr. Param's house.

615
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,200
Give Madam Pisamorn a call for me.

616
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,760
Did you know?

617
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,720
We should do our best in everything.

618
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,640
See this?

619
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,640
I scraped

620
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,480
until there's nothing left.

621
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,760
Oh, there's still more.

622
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,360
Listen

623
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,520
not only does it fill your stomach

624
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,520
you can apply it on your face

625
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,640
and get a smooth skin.

626
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,400
You're not going to leave anything

627
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,680
for other creatures to eat?

628
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,440
Hey.

629
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,320
Why would you leave them anything?

630
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,760
Those creatures carry disease. It's better for them to starve to death.

631
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,200
I am one of those creatures.

632
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,160
I would like to have a bite.

633
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,360
Here, it's yours.

634
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,240
Take it.

635
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,600
Hey, Faidam.

636
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,040
Answer the phone and be polite.

637
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,200
Don't be rude

638
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,800
like the way you talk to me.

639
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,000
Yes, Madam.

640
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,560
Hello, Monthianrak residence.

641
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,880
Just like Dao's voice.

642
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,880
Place it here, Grandma.

643
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,880
May I speak to Madam Pisamorn?

644
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,280
Grandma.

645
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,360
Tell her it's Grandma Pathum.

646
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,240
Wait a moment.

647
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,680
I'll go tell her.

648
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,400
Madam.

649
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,280
You have a call, Madam.

650
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,760
- Huh? - Come answer the phone.

651
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,160
Who called?

652
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Hello.

653
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,800
Pisamorn is speaking.

654
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,080
Oh.

655
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,240
Hello, Grandma Pathum.

656
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,200
You've found Lomdao?

657
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,040
I haven't found her

658
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,320
that's why I am scared that Dr. Param will misunderstand.

659
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,440
Oh.

660
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,040
Param won't misunderstand.

661
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,400
He can only wait for Lomdao's return.

662
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,040
What if Dao doesn't return?

663
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,400
I'll have him wait forever.

664
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,640
Wait forever, he can stay single forever.

665
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,360
He can stay single forever.

666
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,280
Why should I wait for her?

667
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,000
She's the one who wouldn't meet us.

668
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,080
I think she doesn't want to marry either.

669
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,840
Did you forget?

670
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,080
I already told you before

671
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,640
that why you must marry Lomdao.

672
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,360
But they're unreasonable.

673
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,160
You purposefully said all that

674
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,640
so you can embarrass me

675
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,440
and make me sad, right?

676
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,560
When are you going to accept that it's not going to happen.

677
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,080
Then make it happen.

678
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,920
Unless you already have a wife.

679
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,360
If that's true.

680
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,720
Believe me, I won't interfere.

681
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,440
It's Faidam.

682
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,600
What are you doing Faidam?

683
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,800
You're not asleep yet?

684
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,120
Doctor.

685
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,840
I am writing a letter to home.

686
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,880
Why do you look so stressed out?

687
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,600
Is Botox too expensive?

688
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,800
No one is willing to listen to me.

689
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,360
Listen to you about what?

690
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,000
I can listen to you.

691
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,600
You're too weird.

692
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,680
What can you do to help me?

693
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,480
I'm just going to listen.

694
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,600
I'm not going to fix your problem.

695
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,040
My mom

696
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,080
made me marry a woman I've never met.

697
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,680
Do you not like her because

698
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,320
she might be ugly?

699
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,160
That's not it.

700
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,080
The reason I don't want to marry

701
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,840
is because I don't know if she'll like me or not.

702
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,520
And

703
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,560
if she doesn't like you?

704
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,560
Yeah, I wonder.

705
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,280
But we should meet first

706
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,560
so we can find out.

707
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,200
Running away like this doesn't help.

708
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,440
The one who has to face the problem

709
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,640
is me.

710
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,800
Who would want a woman like this?

711
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,840
She's selfish.

712
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,960
But you already have Miss Ega, right?

713
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,720
Why don't you be honest then?

714
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,240
Or is it that you have choices to pick from?

715
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,560
Betrothed to one but bite another's lips.

716
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,520
If you're going to do that

717
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,480
then don't get engaged to anyone.

718
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,680
Why is she angry?

719
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,640
"If you're going to do that

720
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,600
then don't get engaged to anyone"?

721
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,080
If I already have a girlfriend

722
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,520
then I don't have to be engaged with Lomdao.

723
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,120
Selfish?

724
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,840
Who's selfish here?

725
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,560
Dating one person, but engaged to another.

726
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,560
You only see women as choices.

727
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,360
Just wait and see, I will never marry you.

728
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,040
Auntie.

729
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,920
Why did you say that to Brother?

730
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:56,240
Because I am certain Param is single.

731
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,360
You can't be sure.

732
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,040
Never mind a wife

733
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,080
he doesn't even have a girlfriend.

734
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,200
I am very confident that

735
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,680
Param isn't seeing anyone.

736
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,280
Hey, why are you two eavesdropping

737
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,080
on your boss's conversation?

738
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,240
Who's eavesdropping?

739
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,440
I'm busy peeling these onions.

740
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,520
I'm not, I am washing dishes.

741
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,840
So much work.

742
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,240
Hey!

743
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,440
You left the water running again.

744
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,160
Didn't I tell you to turn it off

745
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,720
once you were done washing?

746
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,400
I told you guys so many times.

747
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,200
I've wasted saliva telling you guys that.

748
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,160
Go turn it off.

749
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,280
Yes, Madam.

750
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,720
She even think saliva can be wasteful.

751
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,240
Yeah.

752
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,360
Here.

753
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,320
What is this for?

754
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,560
Your salary in advance.

755
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,840
If you pretend to be my girlfriend.

756
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,000
Why must I pretend

757
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,520
when I'll gladly do it.

758
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,800
I just want it to be an act.

759
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,880
Once my mom stop forcing me to get married we can break up.

760
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,960
Break up?

761
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,760
I'll transfer it to you every month

762
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,320
as your reward.

763
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,440
No, thank you.

764
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,720
I am happy to do it.

765
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,880
Please take it.

766
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,080
I want this to be strictly business.

767
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,440
Fine.

768
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,000
I will do as you request.

769
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,200
Starting now.

770
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,840
Because we are dating.

771
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,240
That's nonsense.

772
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,080
The man has yet to say so.

773
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,320
Don't go around entertaining

774
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,040
yourself with such thought.

775
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,480
Mom, she's my girlfriend.

776
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,840
(Next episode.)

777
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,400
I think he looks like a squid.

778
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,760
No other expression

779
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,800
but pair's well with that shameless woman, Miss Riga.
