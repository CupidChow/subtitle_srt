1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,800
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,160
(Previously...)

3
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,920
You don't need to find an excuse to not marry Param anymore.

4
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,120
Even if you wanted to marry him now,

5
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,400
I will no longer allow it.

6
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,640
I came here all the way from Ubon Ratchathani.

7
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,360
To give Pisamorn an apology.

8
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,280
That my grandchild had humiliated everyone.

9
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,160
Then, you will marry me?

10
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,600
Yes, I will!

11
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,640
Do you think Madam will allow it?

12
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,320
Taew!

13
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,560
Taew!

14
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
Phon!

15
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,640
It's late! Why haven't anyone set up the table for breakfast?!

16
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
Taew!

17
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,360
Taew!

18
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,680
It's done.

19
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,000
Here you go, Madam.

20
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920
Lomdao.

21
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,360
I made this Madam, I guarantee it's delicious like before.

22
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,720
I'll serve you some rice.

23
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,680
Do you want a lot, Madam?

24
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,720
Around two scoops then.

25
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,040
Here you go.

26
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,400
Enjoy your food, Madam.

27
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Taew!

28
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,120
Yes.

29
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,040
Go make fried egg for me.

30
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,360
Yes, Madam.

31
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,640
Brother.

32
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,480
Do you think Miss Dao can face Auntie?

33
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,600
I'm not sure either.

34
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
If it's Faidam,

35
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,080
Mom will soften up to her eventually.

36
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,480
What makes you think so?

37
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,200
For the past few days,

38
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,920
she doesn't seem to soften up at all.

39
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,200
Mom loves and adores Faidam,

40
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,720
those feelings won't easily fade.

41
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,600
Even if Mom is angry at Dao,

42
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,320
but she cannot hate Faidam.

43
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,640
I already fired you.

44
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,760
Why did you come back to my house?

45
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,760
I'll massage you, Madam.

46
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,160
I'm so sorry, Madam.

47
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,160
I'm really sorry.

48
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
Madam.

49
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,840
Madam, please stop being angry at me.

50
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,640
I love you, Madam.

51
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,120
I don't want you to be sad.

52
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,720
Or feel that I don't respect you.

53
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,400
I was wrong for lying to you.

54
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,200
I was wrong for making you sad.

55
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,960
You can insult me, scold me, however you like.

56
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,320
But please don't hate me.

57
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,320
Stop acting like Faidam.

58
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,320
And get out of my house.

59
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,640
Don't make me kick you out the second time.

60
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,640
Mom.

61
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,160
I...

62
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,720
I am not your mom!

63
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,080
I am sorry,

64
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,600
for deceiving you in the past...

65
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,840
Madam.

66
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,720
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

67
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,720
As long as you forgive me, Madam.

68
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,960
Are you sure?

69
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
Yes.

70
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,360
I am willing to do anything.

71
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,880
Whether it's a cook, a maid, a confidant,

72
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,360
or anything that you want me to be.

73
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,360
I am not going to charge you at all.

74
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,880
There's no need to go that far.

75
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,040
Just get out of my house is enough!

76
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,640
You used my trust as some kind of joke.

77
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,760
You must've thought that my family is so stupid, right?

78
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,640
I have misjudged you!

79
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,480
Madam.

80
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,080
Madam.

81
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Faidam.

82
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,560
It's okay, Faidam.

83
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,080
Madam will eventually understand.

84
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,560
Param, follow me upstairs.

85
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,920
I need to talk to you.

86
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,360
Yes.

87
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
Yes, Mom?

88
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,960
You were the one who brought Dao back, right?

89
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,840
No.

90
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,920
Dao wanted to come back on her own.

91
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,640
Even though she was always avoiding us before?

92
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,880
But now she knows that Riga and I aren't dating.

93
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,880
And that I wasn't going to marry her for money.

94
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,280
And you're okay with that?

95
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,600
Even though she thought of you like that.

96
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,480
Even though she disguised herself to deceive us?

97
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,680
Even though she tried to betray us?

98
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,040
Actually I think she didn't have ill intentions towards you and me.

99
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,480
She just heard something and misunderstood,

100
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,560
so she wanted to find out the truth.

101
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,360
Why didn't she just ask?

102
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,160
Why didn't she come and ask me?

103
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,280
Why did she do that to me?

104
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,240
Because she thought,

105
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,800
if she asks about it, she won't get the truth.

106
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,160
No matter what excuses you make for Lomdao,

107
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,440
I still can't accept it!

108
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,960
It doesn't matter how good she is to me,

109
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,280
she still can't change my mind.

110
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,400
It's best to just tell her

111
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,160
to stop doing this!

112
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,080
Mom.

113
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,000
Even if you're angry at Lomdao,

114
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,320
but you can't hate the Faidam that you love, right?

115
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,760
Faidam.

116
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,720
Don't over thinking.

117
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,040
Madam gets upset easily as she gets over it quickly.

118
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,400
She'll get over it soon.

119
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,120
Don't get discouraged yet.

120
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
Okay?

121
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,920
I won't get discouraged.

122
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,520
Why are you crying?

123
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,680
I feel bad.

124
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,120
For hurting Madam like this.

125
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,680
This means...

126
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,680
You won't give up and go home right?

127
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,040
Huh?

128
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,160
I'll be fine.

129
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,520
Madam, please stop being angry at me.

130
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,640
I love you, Madam.

131
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,120
I don't want you to be sad.

132
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,760
You can insult me, scold me, however you like.

133
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,800
But please don't hate me.

134
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,360
Actually I think she didn't have ill intentions towards you and me.

135
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,720
She just heard something and misunderstood,

136
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,840
so she wanted to find out the truth.

137
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,320
Why didn't she just ask?

138
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,160
Why didn't she come and ask me?

139
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,240
Why did she do that to me?

140
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,320
Because she thought,

141
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,920
if she asks about it, she won't get the truth.

142
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,320
Even if you're angry at Lomdao,

143
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,560
but you can't hate the Faidam that you love, right?

144
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,160
It's too late, Lomdao.

145
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,160
It's too late.

146
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,320
Try them, Grandma. They're tasty.

147
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,240
Why are there so many sweets here?

148
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,560
You need to try, this place makes the best sweets.

149
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,640
- Really? - Yes.

150
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,560
- I know this and that. - Yes.

151
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,040
- What about this? - Ask Mr. Oab, he bought them.

152
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,400
Egg tart, Grandma.

153
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,120
Egg tart, are they western food?

154
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,920
Is that so.

155
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,280
Let me take a look.

156
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll have one, too.

157
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,360
There's a fork, why didn't you use it?

158
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,560
Yeah, there's a fork, use it.

159
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
Phon.

160
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,720
Oab, Miss Dao has returned.

161
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,000
Grandma, Dao is back at Auntie's house.

162
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
Really?

163
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,080
Yes!

164
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,200
It seems like she quite likes Brother.

165
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,360
Really, Phon?

166
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,240
The reason she disappeared because she was with Brother.

167
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,880
I didn't tell you yet because they just came back this morning.

168
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,640
Then I still have a chance, Angkab?

169
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,280
I already told you, every problem has a solution.

170
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,960
Ask Phon, how Pisamorn is doing.

171
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,400
Phon.

172
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,640
How is Auntie dealing with all this?

173
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,040
Well, it is as we expected.

174
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,080
Ever since she met Dao,

175
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,840
she has been feeling irritated.

176
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,920
She gave Brother a long lecture.

177
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,880
Oab, Brother is here, I'll call you back.

178
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,960
Then let's not go meet her yet.

179
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,400
Let's wait until they come to an understanding.

180
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,120
Hmm?

181
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,040
Let's continue tasting these sweets.

182
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,520
Your fork?

183
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,840
I am using the fork.

184
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,880
Okay.

185
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,520
You look stressed.

186
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,160
I guess it'll take some time.

187
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,040
I think

188
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,680
Dao will eventually win over Auntie's heart.

189
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,040
No need to be stressed, Brother.

190
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,840
I don't know if she can win over Mom's heart.

191
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,880
I understand Mom's feelings.

192
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,920
The feeling of being deceived.

193
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,320
But when I saw how Mom treated Dao today,

194
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,920
I feel sorry for her.

195
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,240
Keep fighting.

196
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,280
What are you going to do now?

197
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,080
Yeah.

198
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,480
Madam Pisamorn is a straightforward person.

199
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,200
Whatever she feels, she will express it clearly.

200
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,400
Otherwise she wouldn't dote on Faidam,

201
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,720
and openly show her disgust towards Riga.

202
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,120
It's all my fault.

203
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,760
Actually I deserve it.

204
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,840
Let her be, Mom.

205
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,680
Give her some space.

206
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,360
As long as you can find the way home,

207
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,400
I'm already happy.

208
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,960
And you...

209
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,400
Are you alright?

210
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,840
This is this house's phone number, keep it.

211
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,720
The other number belongs to Dr. Param.

212
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,240
In case you can't find your way back,

213
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,160
just give me a call and I'll go fetch you.

214
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,320
I'll give this to you in case you need it

215
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,160
or for your grandma's treatment.

216
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,120
If this isn't enough just call me,

217
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,680
I'll transfer more to you.

218
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,400
Are you feeling unwell?

219
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,160
Yesterday you were playing

220
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,520
in the sea for a long time.

221
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,840
What's wrong, Faidam?

222
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,120
This

223
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,360
I accidentally pressed

224
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,960
too hard on the wound.

225
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,960
Here, give it to me.

226
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,680
Let me see, I can do it for you.

227
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,000
Your hand's also injured,

228
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,800
how would you do it yourself?

229
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,520
- Ouch! Ow! - Why are you so clumsy?

230
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,680
What is it lately? Bad luck?

231
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,200
You got sick, now you got injured.

232
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,120
Be more careful, alright?

233
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,960
Look at this, see?

234
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,440
Good thing, it's not serious.

235
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,960
I apologize on behalf of Param

236
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,600
for going overboard.

237
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,560
Let's go back to our home, Faidam.

238
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,280
Let's go.

239
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,920
I can look at you and know what you're thinking!

240
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,680
If you're not here, I would be bored to death.

241
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,600
I love and adore you like my daughter.

242
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,080
But you only see me as a fool.

243
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,600
You used my trust as some kind of joke.

244
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,680
You must've thought that my family is so stupid, right?

245
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,600
I have misjudged you!

246
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,320
Doctor.

247
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,560
Don't cry.

248
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,080
I will marry you no matter what.

249
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,600
Thank you.

250
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,960
But if your Mom still doesn't accept me.

251
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,600
Then I am not ready to marry.

252
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,640
All these times,

253
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,360
what I did was already horrible enough.

254
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,400
If we got married

255
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,080
while Madam still doesn't accept me,

256
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,200
everything will only get worse.

257
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,520
But please do not worry.

258
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,920
I will certainly make Madam forgive me.

259
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,280
Madam.

260
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,040
Your food is served.

261
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Here.

262
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,960
Please try this porridge.

263
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,600
I made this with a special recipe.

264
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,960
When you're done eating, you can eat medicine right after.

265
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,320
So you can get well soon.

266
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,760
Here, I'll feed you.

267
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,240
Here.

268
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,800
Stop doing this!

269
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,160
You don't need to please me!

270
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,240
I will never forgive you!

271
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,880
I know that you don't really mean it.

272
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,480
The truth is you're very nice.

273
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,840
Otherwise, you wouldn't love and miss me.

274
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Here.

275
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,680
Madam.

276
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,480
I still keep the cookies that you gave me.

277
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,640
Stop acting like this to me!

278
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,320
I am not your playmate!

279
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,640
And this! This!

280
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,280
This ridiculous wig and this ugly mole,

281
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,320
take them off already!

282
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,880
Wipe this all out!

283
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,320
What's happening, Mom?

284
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,200
You didn't have to act this harsh.

285
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,520
I am unmasking this fraud.

286
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,080
Well, Lomdao?

287
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,840
What do you want?

288
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,080
What do you plan to deceive me this time?

289
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,160
I am not here to deceive you.

290
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
I just...

291
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,160
Want you to love...

292
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,240
And adore Faidam like before.

293
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,720
But you're not Faidam.

294
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,840
You are not!

295
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,120
You're just a fraud who deceives others!

296
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:55,400
Did you think this ridiculous wig and this ugly mole

297
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,720
will soften me up?

298
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,200
Let me tell you right here,

299
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,520
no matter what you do,

300
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,560
you can never bring back the feelings that I have for Faidam!

301
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,840
You too, Param!

302
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,960
Know how to learn from when you were hurt.

303
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,280
Or else you might get deceived again!

304
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,240
It's alright, Miss Dao.

305
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,760
Mom.

306
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,840
I know that you're angry at Lomdao.

307
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,920
It's true.

308
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,880
She was wrong at first.

309
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,920
But she has repented.

310
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,080
She's trying her best to apologize you.

311
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,400
What more could you possibly want?

312
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
What I want?

313
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,280
I already told you.

314
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,000
I don't want to see her face in this house again!

315
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,760
But you'll have to see her.

316
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,680
Because Lomdao and I are getting married.

317
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,400
Go ahead!

318
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,440
If you insist on getting married.

319
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,760
Then you and I as mother and son are over!

320
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,280
Mom!

321
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,960
I can accept anyone in this world as my daughter-in-law.

322
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,400
But I really can't accept Lomdao!

323
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,320
Then I apologize to you, Mom.

324
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,080
That I made my decision to get married.

325
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,640
Param!

326
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,920
- What would you like, Grandma? - Wait, I'm looking.

327
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,680
All of them look delicious.

328
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,920
I'll have this.

329
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,360
I'll have this.

330
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,040
I'll eat with you, Grandma.

331
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,240
Order your own food.

332
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,720
Is it going to be enough?

333
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,960
- I'm eating less these days. - Sure.

334
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,480
Hey.

335
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,200
How is Dao doing?

336
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,600
She's giving it her all,

337
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,400
but emotionally she's not doing well.

338
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,120
Auntie is very adamant.

339
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,400
I never thought she would be this stubborn.

340
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,480
I don't know how long Dao can endure this.

341
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,120
Phon.

342
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,040
Does Dr. Param love my granddaughter a lot?

343
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,200
I think so.

344
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,120
Because no matter what Auntie says,

345
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,360
Brother will not listen.

346
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,440
He keeps insisting on marrying Miss Dao.

347
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,680
When Brother is leaving for work,

348
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,440
Auntie will not come downstairs.

349
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,720
But she had Taew bring her food up to her.

350
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,640
Or if she did come downstairs,

351
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,480
she'll completely ignore Miss Dao's existence.

352
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,240
I think it's time for me to step in.

353
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,000
Oh, coming!

354
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,160
You're here, open the door for me.

355
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
Yes.

356
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,880
- Hey! - Hey!

357
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,600
Open the door, Miss!

358
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,080
Why did you close it?

359
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,240
Open!

360
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,480
Still not going to open?

361
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,480
She's seriously!

362
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,480
Hello.

363
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,840
Yeah, yeah, hello.

364
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,080
- Madam is pretty weird. - Why?

365
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,840
She only employs maids with special characteristics.

366
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,080
The first one buck teeth, this one big mole.

367
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,840
Who are you here to see?

368
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,360
Are you a new maid?

369
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Oh?

370
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,800
Do you not recognize me?

371
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,200
Recognize who?

372
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,240
We just met, how would I recognize you?

373
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,320
Do you know me?

374
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,240
Oh.

375
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,640
Go tell Pisamorn that Grandma Pathum is here to see her.

376
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,760
Yes. Then...

377
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,680
- Please head inside, Grandma Pathum. - Yeah.

378
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,240
I will go get Madam.

379
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,560
Now, not "will".

380
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,800
- So much stalling, let's go. - How did she not recognize me?

381
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,200
- Grandma. - What?

382
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,080
A mole this big...

383
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,480
Your sister...

384
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,400
Disguised herself as a cook at my house.

385
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,320
Your sister

386
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,480
and my cook, Faidam,

387
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,720
is the same person.

388
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,920
Could she be the Faidam that Doctor mentioned before?

389
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,520
Faidam.

390
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,160
Hey.

391
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,960
Welcome, Grandma.

392
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,040
Please take a seat.

393
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,920
Then I'll go get Madam for you.

394
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,120
Hold up.

395
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,400
Yes, Grandma?

396
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,480
Is there anything else you'd like?

397
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,080
Come closer.

398
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,240
Come closer, is this close?

399
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,840
Closer?

400
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,800
- Closer. - Oh, okay.

401
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,560
Is this close?

402
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,640
Not yet.

403
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,760
- Closer. - Huh?

404
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,120
- Closer than this and I'll be sitting on her lap. - Closer.

405
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,320
Lift your head.

406
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,920
Oh, Grandma.

407
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,200
Dao!

408
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,920
Yes?

409
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,680
Well? We have to resort to this

410
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,240
for you to finally admit?

411
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,120
Grandma.

412
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,440
If you recognized me, why didn't you tell me?

413
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,920
Don't bother.

414
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,160
Why are you still disguising yourself in this house?

415
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,280
Didn't you said you were going to quit and go back to Ubon Ratchathani?

416
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,880
Hey!

417
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,080
Let me take a look.

418
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,480
Oab.

419
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,840
Give it to me.

420
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,560
Look, Grandma.

421
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,080
Why are you guys here?

422
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,800
To apologize Auntie about you.

423
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,040
Tell me.

424
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,040
What's the story?

425
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,920
Madam keep chasing her away

426
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,040
night and day but Faidam refuses to go.

427
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,520
Every time Faidam comes to this house,

428
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,080
I see her crying all the time.

429
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,640
If Doctor doesn't get with Faidam,

430
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,640
then we won't get to see her anymore?

431
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
I suppose.

432
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,600
I love Faidam so much, I don't want her to leave.

433
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,080
All the people that have worked at this house, only Faidam is my friend.

434
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,800
The others always behaved like my boss.

435
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,720
- Baby. - Huh?

436
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,200
Who's that?

437
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,200
Nice body and well dressed.

438
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,000
Sway this way, I'll look after you.

439
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,320
Baby.

440
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,800
Light-skinned, buff, crunchy.

441
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,320
- Taew! - Huh?

442
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,120
- Oh! - Hey, can't you remember your own husband?

443
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,760
I'm also light-skinned, handsome, and buff.

444
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,120
Oh, hubby.

445
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,440
I forgot.

446
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,440
Sorry!

447
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,640
You're really too much.

448
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,400
Excuse me.

449
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,040
I'm here to see Dao, is she here?

450
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,480
Dao...

451
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,080
- Hello. - Hello.

452
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,480
My name is Taew.

453
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,040
He didn't ask.

454
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,160
My shoulder almost broke.

455
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,280
Gosh.

456
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,920
Oh, Dao...

457
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,840
I'm so worried about you, you know that?

458
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,080
Look at you.

459
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,760
By the time you know they're good people,

460
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,800
it's already too late.

461
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,160
I'm sorry, Grandma.

462
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,560
If I believed you in the first place,

463
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,000
and wasn't so stubborn.

464
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,520
And willing to open up for Doctor when I got here,

465
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,320
this would not happen.

466
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,160
What about...

467
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
Pisamorn?

468
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,840
Huh?

469
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,640
She probably hates me now.

470
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,920
She probably wants me gone.

471
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,480
I don't know what else to do, Grandma.

472
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,720
You don't have to do anything, come here.

473
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,400
There, there.

474
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
Don't cry.

475
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Oab.

476
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,920
Comfort your sister.

477
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,680
Go to your brother.

478
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,920
Let him comfort you.

479
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,280
I'll be right back.

480
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,320
Pisamorn.

481
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,560
Hello, Grandma.

482
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,320
Can I talk to you?

483
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,000
You heard our conversation, right?

484
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,880
I know that is your decision.

485
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,000
I have no right to force you

486
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,000
to choose the kind of daughter-in-law you want.

487
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
Right?

488
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,360
It's not like that, Grandma.

489
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,760
To be honest,

490
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,600
I'm here to apologize to you on behalf of Dao.

491
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,160
For what she's done to you.

492
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,680
I might not have raised her well enough,

493
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,640
so she grew up into someone who doesn't give up easily.

494
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,240
She's always been like this since she was a kid.

495
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,240
Doesn't like to be forced.

496
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,680
Doesn't give in to others.

497
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,200
I'm still surprised that she came back here,

498
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,760
even though she's already got what she wanted.

499
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,120
Dao wanted to come resign

500
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,760
because she doesn't want you to feel hurt

501
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,040
for what she have done.

502
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,720
We're already this old.

503
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,120
How long do we have left on this earth?

504
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,520
Why don't we live happily?

505
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,120
By spending our life watching our kids raise their family.

506
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,080
Have a family they cherish.

507
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,200
Have someone they love taking care of them.

508
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,040
Isn't that what

509
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,080
every mother wishes for?

510
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,080
Think about it, Pisamorn.

511
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,880
She was wrong at first.

512
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,960
But she has repented.

513
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,320
She's trying her best to apologize to you.

514
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,440
What more could you possibly want?

515
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,960
I already told you...

516
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,760
I don't want to see her face in this house again!

517
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,400
But you'll have to see her.

518
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,360
Because Lomdao and I are getting married.

519
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,800
If you insist on getting married.

520
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,080
Then you and I as mother and son are over!

521
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,400
Then I apologize to you, Mom.

522
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,240
That I made my decision to get married.

523
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,320
It's all because of you,

524
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,800
that she found out it was Dao.

525
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,200
Why did you do that?

526
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,640
You're a doctor,

527
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,280
you have a brain but no sense.

528
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,000
Who would disguise themselves and not make it a secret?

529
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,280
I was surprised.

530
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,720
I acted too quickly.

531
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,760
You should think things through.

532
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,320
Do you know what Dao has to face because of you?

533
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,040
But if Dao doesn't get with Dr. Param,

534
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,040
I'll happily welcome her.

535
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,560
Why can't you understand that Dao doesn't like you?

536
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,920
How many times do I have to tell you?

537
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,680
But if you want to see Dao,

538
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,760
just wait here.

539
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,840
She'll be here soon.

540
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,720
- Taew. - Yes?

541
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,640
When you go to that house,

542
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,000
tell her that Mr. Korn is waiting for her here.

543
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Yes.

544
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,080
Faidam is pretty hot, she attracts a lot of hotties.

545
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,640
You're hot as well, baby.

546
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,320
Because I'm also a hottie.

547
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,280
So true.

548
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,960
Wat.

549
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,200
How long has Dao disguised herself?

550
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,640
Ever since she came back.

551
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,880
Then...

552
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,920
How long has Dao been in love with Dr. Param?

553
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,600
I'm not sure.

554
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
But...

555
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,160
For a while now from what I see.

556
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,000
Come home if you can't take it anymore.

557
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,360
I was wrong.

558
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,880
If I have to get kicked out night and day,

559
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,840
I'll be okay as long as Madam stop being angry at me.

560
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,720
Oab.

561
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,920
Let's go home.

562
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,160
Oh?

563
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,800
What's the rush, Grandma? You don't want to meet Madam Pisamorn?

564
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,560
No, let's go, Oab.

565
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,680
But I haven't seen Phon yet.

566
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,720
Oab.

567
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,640
Let's go back home.

568
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,440
Get me my purse, hurry.

569
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,440
I'll walk you out.

570
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,880
Of course you will.

571
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,920
Were you not going to?

572
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,360
No, I am going.

573
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,120
This cry baby...

574
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,320
You love Doctor, right?

575
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,600
Huh?

576
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,400
Yes, Grandma.

577
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,480
In that case,

578
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,600
you must fight!

579
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,000
I'll be cheering on you.

580
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Okay?

581
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,680
- Fight! - Fight!

582
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,800
Yeah.

583
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,480
That's more like it!

584
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,120
Fighting!

585
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,920
Doctor won't let you face this alone.

586
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,920
Okay?

587
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,200
Come.

588
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,560
Keep fighting.

589
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,880
Don't cry, my little sister.

590
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,480
I'll go start the engine for Grandma.

591
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,680
- Before Grandma can't breathe. - Bye.

592
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,720
- Fight, okay? - I will.

593
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,280
- Let's go. - Yes, Grandma.

594
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,360
- Fight on! - I will.

595
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,040
- You got this, Dao. - Yeah.

596
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,520
(Next episode.)

597
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,080
I got a wedding date already.

598
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,080
I reserved the venue and contacted everything already.

599
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,880
Let's see how they will get married.

600
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,560
I want you...

601
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,480
To be only my Faidam.
