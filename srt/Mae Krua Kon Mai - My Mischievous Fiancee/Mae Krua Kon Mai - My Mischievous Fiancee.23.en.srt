1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,840
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,160
(Previously...)

3
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,600
I won't marry you.

4
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,280
You don't want to, then don't.

5
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,400
I can't be the one to tell Pisamorn.

6
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,640
She really adores you.

7
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,600
Oh, right! Where's Faidam?

8
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,720
I'm right here!

9
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,080
Actually, you didn't have to come.

10
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,520
You don't have to marry me anymore.

11
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,840
Even if I quit,

12
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,680
I still want Madam to be happy when she thinks of Faidam.

13
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,880
The reason Dao avoided him is because

14
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,880
she already has a fiance in the States.

15
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,920
You're still here?

16
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,680
Lucky for you,

17
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,960
Madam supports you.

18
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,880
Otherwise you'd have been kicked out sooner.

19
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,560
What?

20
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,960
You don't dare talk back to me anymore?

21
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
Oh.

22
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,440
Doctor must've already taught you manners

23
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,400
so you know when to shut your trap now.

24
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,640
In the future,

25
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,920
when you meet me,

26
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,600
you'd better practice how to greet your future boss's wife.

27
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,640
How many times do I have to teach you?

28
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
Great.

29
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,640
Have your tears wash away

30
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,080
your rotten personality.

31
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,000
If you're just going to stand here and insult me, I'll close the door now.

32
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,360
I don't have time for this.

33
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
Wait.

34
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,400
I'm here to see Doctor.

35
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,640
Is he here?

36
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,720
Yes.

37
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
I'm going to wait for my friend here.

38
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
As for you,

39
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,760
go tell Doctor that I'm here to see him.

40
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,480
Your future wife, Miss Riga, is here to see you.

41
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,840
Why haven't you stop being sarcastic with me?

42
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,520
I am not being sarcastic.

43
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,800
I'm speaking the truth.

44
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,880
The news is everywhere,

45
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,440
do you think I'll turn blind eyes to it?

46
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,080
So that's why you refuse to get engaged with me.

47
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,840
Who would want to steal someone else's guy to have others gossip about?

48
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Doctor.

49
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
Dao!

50
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,560
What are you up to?

51
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,680
You're Lomdao?

52
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,720
Let go.

53
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,480
You dare disguise yourself to live in Doctor's house?

54
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
Hey!

55
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,200
What kind of person are you

56
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,640
that do something disgusting like this?

57
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,880
Doctor.

58
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,720
Are you really breaking up with me

59
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,000
to marry such a disgusting person like this?

60
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
Broke up?

61
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,480
You already broke up with her?

62
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,040
I didn't break up with you

63
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,520
because I didn't dated you at the beginning.

64
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,040
I only hired you to be my fake girlfriend.

65
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,040
And I've already told you

66
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,120
that I will not continue to hire you.

67
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,880
Why don't you understand?

68
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,640
If you're not really his girlfriend,

69
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,720
then you used me?

70
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
Yes.

71
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,000
I didn't expect that

72
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,000
not only I tricked you for information,

73
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
today,

74
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,680
you even exposed her yourself

75
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,880
that she disguised herself.

76
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,040
What's more,

77
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,000
she already has a fiance in the states.

78
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,400
You should get over her.

79
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,960
How was that?

80
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,480
Are you shocked?

81
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,280
Enough, Riga.

82
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,240
I'm sorry, Dao. I didn't think she would do this.

83
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,760
Let go! I'm not going anywhere.

84
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,800
I want to see what excuses she'll come up with.

85
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,280
What is all this ruckus?

86
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,360
Miss Riga!

87
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
Mom.

88
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,960
Go and handle your Lomdao on your own

89
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,600
for getting fooled by her for so long.

90
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,120
Enough, Miss Riga.

91
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,160
Let go!

92
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,200
Enough, Miss Riga.

93
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,520
Let go!

94
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,120
Enough, Miss Riga, let's leave.

95
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,600
Lomdao?

96
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,520
I'm so sorry, Madam.

97
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Madam.

98
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Madam.

99
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,480
Madam.

100
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,920
Madam.

101
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,760
I'm so sorry.

102
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,120
Please don't be angry at me, Madam.

103
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,000
Madam.

104
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,760
Madam.

105
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,720
Madam, please come out and talk to me.

106
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,040
Madam.

107
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,600
Madam.

108
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,160
Miss Dao.

109
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,080
Let's wait for Auntie to calm down,

110
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,680
then you can come to see her later.

111
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,280
I am sorry for deceiving you, Miss Phon.

112
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,600
If I were you,

113
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,840
I might have done the same.

114
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,520
I am on your side, Miss Dao.

115
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,360
As for Auntie,

116
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,840
I think you'd better wait for her to calm down

117
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,720
and you can come to meet her later.

118
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,520
Faidam.

119
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,920
Yes, Madam?

120
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,480
I got this for you.

121
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,800
Thank you.

122
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,080
I should call you Lomdao, right?

123
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,720
You can call me however you like.

124
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,120
Go pack your things

125
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,800
and get out of this house.

126
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,720
Madam.

127
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,840
You are very angry at me, right?

128
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,680
Even if I apologize,

129
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,560
I know that you would still be angry.

130
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,720
You don't have to say anything.

131
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,320
I loved and adored you like my daughter

132
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,800
but you only see me as a fool.

133
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,600
Go pack your things.

134
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,240
And get out of this house.

135
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,760
You don't need to find an excuse to not marry Param anymore.

136
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,600
Even if you wanted to marry him now,

137
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,080
I will no longer allow it.

138
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
Madam.

139
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,880
What you did was wrong.

140
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,880
Right or wrong, it was already done.

141
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,960
I didn't expect that that maid was actually Dr. Param's fiancee, Lomdao.

142
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,080
I have to thank you for recognizing her.

143
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,800
I'll come back and apologize to Dao later.

144
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,760
That's your business.

145
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,440
Why are guys so stupid?

146
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,320
It's obvious that Lomdao isn't a good person.

147
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,160
Why does everyone like her?

148
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,720
On your way out?

149
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,560
They kicked you out of the house, huh?

150
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
Of course,

151
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,800
who would want a liar as their daughter-in-law like you?

152
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,960
You're lucky that they didn't call the cops on you?

153
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,320
Didn't you hear what I said?

154
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,440
Hey! Are you deaf?

155
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,080
Quickly pack your stuff and leave.

156
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,720
Hey!

157
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,360
I don't know how your parents raised you up

158
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,000
so you became a person like this.

159
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,400
You lack manner and can't sympathize with others.

160
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,840
You're essentially worthless.

161
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,640
I'm not surprised

162
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,080
that all you can ever be is a fake girlfriend that doctor hired.

163
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,560
Stop!

164
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,080
If you hurt me,

165
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,160
I assure you, you'll be hurt even more than I am.

166
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,680
I won't give up on you so easily.

167
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Then

168
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,720
the day that doctor was watching over Faidam

169
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,880
when she drowned.

170
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,000
Faidam didn't sleepwalk and paint herself?

171
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,600
I don't know either

172
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,360
but Doctor knew for a while now.

173
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Hey!

174
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,320
I got fired.

175
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,880
Who fired you?

176
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,120
Doctor?

177
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,480
Madam.

178
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,520
Huh?

179
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,040
Madam fired you?

180
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,920
- Huh? - Yeah.

181
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,880
She loves you so much.

182
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,480
Why did she fired you?

183
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,760
Let's sit first.

184
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,640
Madam Pisamorn loves Faidam a lot.

185
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,320
How come she fired you?

186
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Riga

187
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,600
exposed me in front of Madam.

188
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,280
Madam know everything by now.

189
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,800
She was so angry,

190
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,840
she can't even stand to see my face.

191
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
Hey.

192
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,760
Maybe Madam is calling you back home.

193
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,840
(Max)

194
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,120
Who is calling?

195
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Max.

196
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,240
Table dashed.

197
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,280
We just need to catch it, Madam.

198
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,720
- Oh, right. - That's true.

199
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,720
Even though Faidam

200
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,040
is a not right in the head

201
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,440
but I trust her.

202
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,920
You should speak nicely to Faidam.

203
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,840
If she felt hurt and quit,

204
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,520
what am I going to do?

205
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,240
Even if I quit,

206
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,400
I still want Madam to be happy when she thinks of Faidam.

207
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,240
Lomdao?

208
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,960
Madam.

209
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,720
Param.

210
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,680
I'm sorry, Son.

211
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,560
For forcing you to get married.

212
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,880
With Dao?

213
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,440
Even her name,

214
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,080
I don't want to mention it.

215
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,480
Mom.

216
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,360
Let's order take out today.

217
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,920
So you don't have to cook.

218
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
Sounds good.

219
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,920
We won't have another cook for a long time.

220
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,480
(Max)

221
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,280
Yes, Max?

222
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,880
I've been calling you for a while,

223
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,280
you didn't pick up my call.

224
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,760
Sorry, I was busy just now.

225
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,560
Where are you, Honey?

226
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,400
I am in Bangkok now.

227
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
Huh? You...

228
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,880
You're already in Bangkok?

229
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,960
Yes, I have arrived

230
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,320
and I miss you very much.

231
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,800
Can you send me your location?

232
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,600
- I'll head over to you. - Yes.

233
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,320
Then I'll send my location to you.

234
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,680
Can you call me when you're coming over?

235
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,760
I'll wait for you.

236
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,720
Yes.

237
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,920
I'll go to my room now.

238
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,400
Whose journal is this?

239
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,080
It had photos with Dao.

240
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
Excuse me.

241
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,840
Yes?

242
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,280
Can I have my journal back?

243
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,200
Oh.

244
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,960
I saw it dropped on the floor so I was going to...

245
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,680
It's alright, thank you.

246
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,680
Yes.

247
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
Pardon me.

248
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,640
Excuse me.

249
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,680
Yes?

250
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,480
I know the woman in the photos.

251
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,040
So do you know where Dao is?

252
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,880
Of course.

253
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,800
But can you spare some time for me?

254
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,600
I'll treat you to coffee.

255
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
Sure.

256
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,240
Let's go inside.

257
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,160
Now tell me,

258
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,760
what did Max called you for?

259
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,280
He's just arrived in Bangkok.

260
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,160
So?

261
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,560
Do you still love him?

262
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,720
I don't know.

263
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,400
You no longer love him.

264
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,640
You want to date your fiance,

265
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,800
but you can't.

266
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,760
You don't know how to break up

267
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,560
with your boyfriend who followed you here.

268
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,160
He told me to send him my location.

269
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,680
He's coming over

270
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,080
but I haven't send it to him yet.

271
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Hey.

272
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,720
If you don't want him,

273
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,720
you can give him to me.

274
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,240
Doctor is nice,

275
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,360
your boyfriend

276
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,720
is not bad too, huh?

277
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,640
One americano, please.

278
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,440
Make that two americanos, please.

279
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,360
Excuse me...

280
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,960
- Mister... - Max.

281
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,600
Mr. Max.

282
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,920
You're Miss Dao's boyfriend from abroad, right?

283
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,080
Yes, did Dao tell you?

284
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,680
Something like that.

285
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,120
Then

286
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,960
did Dao say anything else about me?

287
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,800
Or did she gossip about me?

288
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,640
Dao didn't say much.

289
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,840
Did she tell you that

290
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,520
she has a fiance in Thailand.

291
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,120
I...

292
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,280
I just wanted you to know before meeting her.

293
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,040
Is the food here no good?

294
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,840
I'm not really hungry.

295
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,160
- Taew. - Yes?

296
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,240
You can put them away.

297
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,320
Yes.

298
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
Brother.

299
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,960
Are you okay?

300
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,280
Even if I wasn't, I had to.

301
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,800
You don't need to be okay.

302
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,240
Miss Dao isn't far away,

303
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,520
she's right next door at Mr. Wat's.

304
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,800
If you have something to say,

305
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
why don't you go over and talk to her?

306
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,480
So what if we talked?

307
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,920
Even if I like her,

308
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,800
she still didn't like me.

309
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,680
And she probably can't face Mom.

310
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,720
Brother,

311
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,120
can you stop thinking about other people?

312
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,360
If you still like Miss Dao,

313
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,880
you should try talking to her.

314
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,040
I think she also likes you.

315
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,360
Oh.

316
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,480
Brother,

317
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
wait a moment.

318
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,800
Try it, it might seems a little superstitious

319
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,760
but it doesn't hurt to try.

320
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,640
674.

321
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,280
Why do you want Dao's ID number?

322
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,200
I won't do anything bad with it, Oab.

323
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,040
I promise.

324
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,120
Yes.

325
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,360
It's pretty accurate, I already tried it.

326
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,200
Are you full now, Wat?

327
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,840
- Come, I'll take the plates. - I'll help, Mom.

328
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,480
It's alright. You eat, I'll put them away.

329
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
Eat up.

330
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,040
Hey, Dao.

331
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,600
So what's it going to be?

332
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,000
Are you going to stay here or go back to Ubon Ratchathani.

333
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,440
What about Max?

334
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,080
What are you going to do?

335
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,120
I don't know.

336
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,200
If I don't go

337
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,560
and she moved elsewhere, I won't be able to meet her anymore.

338
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,520
If I went over then what?

339
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,720
If I don't go,

340
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,800
then I won't be able to meet her anymore.

341
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,600
Hey.

342
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,280
I think Doctor's here to see you.

343
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,560
Faidam, someone...

344
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,120
Oh, Miss Lomdao, someone's here for you.

345
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,800
You can call me Faidam like before, Buab.

346
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,960
So, who's here?

347
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,040
Max.

348
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,240
Dao.

349
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,080
I miss you so much.

350
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,560
Hey, how did you get here?

351
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,880
I brought him here.

352
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,520
Oho.

353
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,640
She has a cue for her opening.

354
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,240
How to predict your soul mate.

355
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,400
Use the number from your ID card.

356
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,240
Add it all together.

357
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,280
Multiply it by seven.

358
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,760
And divide by nine.

359
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,200
Use the result to read your prediction.

360
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,080
The book said yes,

361
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,560
so it should be so.

362
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,680
I got it bad.

363
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,520
Why is Riga's car still here?

364
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,080
She's not inside the car.

365
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,240
Hey, even if you don't speak,

366
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,320
no one's going to think you're mute.

367
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,400
Why?

368
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,360
Everything I've said is true.

369
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
Was true.

370
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,360
Dao used to have a fiance

371
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,920
but not anymore.

372
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,400
Please update your information.

373
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,120
Hey, Dao and Doctor are no longer engaged?

374
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,160
Yes.

375
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,880
Dao and I are no longer engaged.

376
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,320
Right timing again.

377
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,760
Who is giving them the cue?

378
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,480
If no one's going to introduce each other

379
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,000
then I'll do it.

380
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
Doctor.

381
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,560
This is Mr. Max.

382
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,920
Dao's boyfriend that just came back from abroad.

383
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,520
Mr. Max.

384
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,520
This is Dr. Param.

385
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,000
Dao's former fiance.

386
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,480
I'm sorry.

387
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,160
Is this your mouth or a toilet?

388
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,280
Mr. Wat.

389
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,200
Can I borrow some sugar?

390
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,760
Huh?

391
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,920
Sugar?

392
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,320
Yes.

393
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,360
It's just...

394
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,600
We ran out of sugar.

395
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,960
Sugar.

396
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,200
Here's sugar.

397
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,400
Thank you.

398
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,920
He still loves you, right?

399
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,360
I'll rip that book to pieces when I get home.

400
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,440
100% soul mate.

401
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,040
What were you thinking?

402
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,440
Can you change your mind now?

403
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,960
Change my mind?

404
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,560
You did something awful like that,

405
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,640
did you think I'll change my mind to like you?

406
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,160
Riga, if you keep this up, no one can like you.

407
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,960
Why?

408
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,840
What's not good about me?

409
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,600
I did every single thing you asked.

410
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,120
Is it wrong

411
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,280
that your fake girlfriend ends up liking you for real?

412
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,000
Why didn't you give me any chance?

413
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,440
Riga.

414
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,520
I'm not so stupid

415
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,880
to be unaware of what you've been doing.

416
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,240
But for the sake of our friendship,

417
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,040
I decided not to say anything.

418
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,600
I still want us to be on good terms.

419
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,840
I know that when you meet someone better,

420
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,320
richer,

421
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,360
more interesting,

422
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,200
you will surely leave.

423
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,840
Because you are ambitious,

424
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,520
you lust for victory.

425
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Riga,

426
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,880
you can't win when it comes to this kind of matter.

427
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,240
I don't love you.

428
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,320
No matter how good you are.

429
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,320
I still can't love you.

430
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,840
It's not only you can't control me,

431
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,360
I can't control my heart either.

432
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,320
See you tomorrow, Honey.

433
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,040
I am in room 3101.

434
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,560
In case that you want to go up first.

435
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,320
Yes.

436
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Bye.

437
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,240
Bye.

438
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,320
Brother, one special egg noodles and wonton, please.

439
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,120
What do you want?

440
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Hey.

441
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,280
What do you want?

442
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,640
Oh, I'll have

443
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,440
jade noodles with wonton.

444
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,080
Hey.

445
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,880
That Riga was able to bring him over to my house,

446
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,840
but couldn't send him back to condominium.

447
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,800
Where the heck did she go now?

448
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,600
Forget her.

449
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,960
Are you really hungry?

450
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,360
Of course,

451
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,760
thanks to the adrenaline rush.

452
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,000
Your boyfriend came,

453
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,320
then Riga,

454
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,760
and Dr. Param.

455
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,120
They came like it was Magha Puja day.

456
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,440
Brother, is it ready yet? I'm so hungry.

457
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,760
Fabulous, you don't need any additional seasoning.

458
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,920
Oh.

459
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,960
What did you go talk with Max in the garden?

460
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,680
Silence.

461
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,680
Hey, I said,

462
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,920
what did you go talk with Max in the garden? Speak it.

463
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,040
Hello, you are with me on the talk show,

464
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,680
Hone Krasea, I am Num Gunchai.

465
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,560
What did you go talk with Max in the garden?

466
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,080
Answer.

467
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,560
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

468
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,800
I wanted to surprise you.

469
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,440
Dao.

470
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,240
Please marry me.

471
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,040
Please?

472
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,760
Marry me.

473
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,440
Don't you think it's a little too soon?

474
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,440
I can wait for you.

475
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,480
Max proposed to me.

476
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Hold up.

477
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,640
What was your answer?

478
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,320
Wat.

479
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,600
Can you take me to Max's condominium?

480
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,640
Sure.

481
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,080
Hey, Dao!

482
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Dao!

483
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,560
Wait up.

484
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,000
Brother, here's the money.

485
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,440
Dao.

486
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,160
Dao.

487
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,160
Hey.

488
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,360
Why did you come here?

489
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,480
To say yes to his proposal.

490
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,640
Huh?

491
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,240
You haven't told him yet?

492
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,600
Yeah.

493
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,680
You can leave first.

494
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,280
I'll call a cab home.

495
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,480
Chasing me away after you got a guy, great.

496
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,120
I was taking a shower.

497
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,120
Is it inconvenient?

498
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,200
Not at all.

499
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,640
It's...

500
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,600
I have something to talk to you

501
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,200
and I didn't want to wait until tomorrow.

502
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,720
Then please come inside first.

503
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,640
You make me happy,

504
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,840
make me smile.

505
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,600
From now on,

506
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,000
let me create happiness in your life too.

507
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,680
(Next episode.)

508
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,680
Please marry me.

509
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,080
I will.
