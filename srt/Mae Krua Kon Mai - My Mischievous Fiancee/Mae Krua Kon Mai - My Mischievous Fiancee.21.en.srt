1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,840
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,520
Help!

3
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,400
Faidam!

4
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,960
(Previously...)

5
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,560
Did you forget I'm a doctor?

6
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,960
I won't let anything happen to her.

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,200
Go and stay with Mom, okay?

8
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,400
If he doesn't know now, when will he know?

9
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,000
You're so tiny

10
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,120
but very stubborn.

11
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,200
You never listen to what I say.

12
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,080
I don't know when you're going to admit it

13
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,080
that my family

14
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,080
doesn't want your money.

15
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,440
If you're happy being Faidam

16
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,400
then I'll let you be her.

17
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,000
Until you get the answer you really want.

18
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
Who is it?

19
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,360
Phon.

20
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,760
Can you listen to me first?

21
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,160
Why don't you go talk to Brother at the beach?

22
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,840
Phon.

23
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,560
Because you're more important.

24
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,960
More important than what you want to talk to Brother about

25
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,680
when you came to seek advice from me?

26
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,720
Phon.

27
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,360
I only said that I want to talk to Doctor

28
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,880
because I want to talk to you.

29
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,040
Can I join you for dinner?

30
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,440
Oab.

31
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,440
I want to know what's your thoughts

32
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,160
on Doctor and Miss Dao.

33
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,280
I want Doctor

34
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,880
to love my sister.

35
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,920
But I don't know

36
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,320
how he'll clear things up with Miss Riga.

37
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Oh.

38
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,680
Doctor said it's not real.

39
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,400
He said he doesn't know any of it.

40
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,640
If I had to guess,

41
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,840
Miss Riga was imagining things.

42
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,920
If that's what Doctor said

43
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,120
then my sister has a chance.

44
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,160
But Dao

45
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,760
needs to understand that

46
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
Doctor has nothing to do with this.

47
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,080
Then you need to say it.

48
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,640
Tell her yourself.

49
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,680
My sister, Dao

50
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,720
doesn't listen to others.

51
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,400
Whatever she wants to know,

52
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,840
she needs to find the truth by herself.

53
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,760
Then,

54
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,280
you can bring Miss Dao to meet Brother

55
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,440
so she can know the truth.

56
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,080
Dao is fully aware,

57
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,720
she probably knows better than I do.

58
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,080
Oab.

59
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,440
What do you mean by that?

60
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,320
I mean that

61
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,080
you haven't tasted my cooking.

62
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,680
Come.

63
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,680
It's almost done.

64
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,120
Come.

65
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,520
Try and see if it's good or not.

66
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,400
How was it?

67
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,320
It's alright.

68
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
Of course.

69
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,720
Let's taste this.

70
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
Hey!

71
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,520
Do you know who changed my clothes?

72
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,920
Wouldn't they see everything?

73
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,520
They saw everything, didn't they?

74
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,480
It was me.

75
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,080
What a relief.

76
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,960
You're flat as a board.

77
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,160
You have no curves whatsoever.

78
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,160
What are you getting embarrassed for? You're no match for me.

79
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,000
These puppies are bigger than yours.

80
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,880
What strange is...

81
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,160
when I changed your clothes,

82
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,760
I remember scrubbing off the paint

83
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,360
and I took the wig off too.

84
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,800
But why...

85
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,040
What is it, Taew?

86
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,440
When Doctor entered the room, I thought he might've found out

87
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,840
- that you disguised yourself. - What did you say?

88
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,320
Doctor came when I was asleep?

89
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,360
Yeah.

90
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,680
And I'm not black?

91
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,680
Yeah.

92
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,880
Then

93
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,800
Doctor must have found out already.

94
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,280
But from what I've seen,

95
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,760
you're still black.

96
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Yeah.

97
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,960
- Is it possible... - Yeah?

98
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
that...

99
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,600
it's buried in my brain.

100
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,720
So I...

101
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,720
sleepwalk and paint my skin

102
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,200
and put on the wig?

103
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,680
I guess so.

104
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,960
Otherwise Doctor

105
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,040
should already make a fuss about it.

106
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,040
Yeah.

107
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,000
Take it easy.

108
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,560
Sit down first.

109
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,080
Eat up so you can have energy.

110
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
- Hey. - Huh?

111
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,080
Thank you.

112
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,280
We're friends.

113
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,480
Isn't this natural?

114
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,920
I thought I was going to Mars.

115
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,440
It's your fault.

116
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,600
You're not a good swimmer but you still entered the sea.

117
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,000
If I didn't make it in time,

118
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,360
what will happen to you?

119
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,560
Then we're both off to Mars.

120
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,520
I still want to stay on Earth not Mars.

121
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,560
Thank you.

122
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,160
Yeah, it's alright.

123
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,120
Oab.

124
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,560
Yes?

125
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Let go.

126
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,840
Oab.

127
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
Oab.

128
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,560
Fine.

129
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,160
You're done eating so please go home.

130
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
Alright.

131
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,480
But the food isn't digested yet.

132
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,360
It's not digested yet?

133
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
Fine.

134
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,760
Phon, I'm not only full.

135
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,400
It hurts too.

136
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,360
You can continue digesting in your car.

137
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,920
I'm going to bed after I wash the dishes.

138
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,560
Then

139
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,320
I'll wash these dishes

140
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,480
and you can go shower and head to bed.

141
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,560
And tonight,

142
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,680
I'll sleep with you here.

143
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
Oab.

144
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,640
Go shower and sleep.

145
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,720
Oab.

146
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,080
Don't be stubborn, Phon.

147
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,280
Fine.

148
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,920
Oab.

149
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,840
Let go, I'm going to close the door.

150
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
Oab.

151
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,240
Phon.

152
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,280
If you won't let me sleep inside,

153
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
then

154
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,280
I'll sleep in front of the door.

155
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,960
But I don't have a pillow for you.

156
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,120
Phon.

157
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,280
Aren't you scared the mosquitoes will bite me?

158
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,600
You can open the door and leave.

159
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,160
Good night.

160
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Good night.

161
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,240
Good night.

162
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,080
Breakfast is served.

163
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,760
What do we have here?

164
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,360
Seafood porridge.

165
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Excellent.

166
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,280
We're at the sea after all.

167
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
I'm sorry.

168
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,080
Come here.

169
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,560
Are you feeling unwell?

170
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,720
Yesterday, you were playing in the sea for a long time.

171
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,520
Must have been the case.

172
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,640
That's why she's sick.

173
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,640
Go take a medicine from my bag and go to sleep.

174
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,560
Yes, Madam.

175
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,920
Param, should we take her back

176
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,720
to see a doctor in Bangkok?

177
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,920
Huh? In case it's serious.

178
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,120
But it's nothing serious.

179
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,800
What would you know? There are so many strange diseases these days.

180
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,200
It's better to stay close to a doctor.

181
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,160
Isn't this close enough?

182
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,800
We sleep in the same house.

183
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,680
But if you want us to be closer,

184
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,320
I guess we need to sleep in the same room.

185
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,160
Param, what are you saying?

186
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,120
You keep that up

187
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,080
if she really does come,

188
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,880
you won't be able to run away.

189
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,880
Then I'll go ahead

190
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,320
and take the medicine.

191
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
Yeah.

192
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,920
Let's go.

193
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
Hey, Faidam.

194
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,080
I think Doctor still doesn't know.

195
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,200
Is that what you think?

196
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,680
Yeah.

197
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,320
If he knows,

198
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,200
you'd already be exposed.

199
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,160
Yeah, you're right.

200
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
Yeah.

201
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,600
Doctor hasn't said anything about it after all.

202
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,000
I think you really did sleepwalk and disguise yourself

203
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,040
before Doctor entered the room.

204
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,280
Hey.

205
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,840
Go take medicine and rest up

206
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,160
before you catch a fever.

207
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,040
- Let's go. - Fine.

208
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,280
Come.

209
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,080
Oh, Oab!

210
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,480
Why did you sleep here?

211
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,480
Well, you told me to sleep here.

212
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,080
I thought you already left.

213
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,680
Who would actually sleep here?

214
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,920
I'm worried about you.

215
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,480
You're home alone after all.

216
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,320
Even if I went home,

217
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,280
I wouldn't be able to sleep.

218
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
You...

219
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,320
How are you?

220
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,560
I'm sorry.

221
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,640
Are you hurt?

222
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,920
It hurts really bad.

223
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,360
- Right here? - Yeah, at the back.

224
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,360
It hurts!

225
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,880
It hurts here.

226
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,240
If you apply medicine on me,

227
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,200
then I'll get better.

228
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,720
Then

229
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,200
you can come inside first and I'll apply medicine for you.

230
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,480
Okay.

231
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,440
- Does it hurt really bad? - My back hurts.

232
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,480
Yes.

233
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,960
- Let me hold you. - Oh, goodness.

234
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,120
Oh dear.

235
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,320
Oh, my back.

236
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,160
- Careful. - It hurts.

237
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,840
He's pretty buff.

238
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,360
What did you say?

239
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,440
I meant...

240
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,640
you're pretty bruised.

241
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,000
Hold up, Phon.

242
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,040
I can apply it myself.

243
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,200
I'll help you apply.

244
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,040
You probably can't reach it.

245
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,520
Please sit down.

246
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,160
Slowly.

247
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,800
- Does it hurt that bad? - Yes.

248
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,440
I'll be gentle.

249
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,000
A little bit more here.

250
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,840
Hey, Phon.

251
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
Thank you.

252
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,520
I would like you to

253
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,960
look after me like this

254
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,440
until I'm old.

255
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
- Oab. - Phon.

256
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,760
And I would like to

257
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,200
look after you until you're old.

258
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
Help!

259
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,760
Faidam!

260
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,160
Faidam!

261
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,680
If something happened to you,

262
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,200
what would I have done, Dao?

263
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,480
Oab.

264
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,400
- Yes? - There's something I'd like to know.

265
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,000
What is it, Phon?

266
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,080
I want to know why you said that

267
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,520
Miss Dao knows about Brother

268
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,800
better than you do?

269
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,200
There's something I want to tell you

270
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,480
but you must promise me

271
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,360
that you won't be angry at Dao.

272
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,800
And help my sister

273
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,480
open up to Doctor.

274
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,880
Get some rest, Madam.

275
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,000
You rest up, too.

276
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
Yes.

277
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,640
Please go sit inside.

278
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,480
Watch your step.

279
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,600
Come, I'll carry it.

280
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,000
You get some rest.

281
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
But...

282
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
No but.

283
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,800
I'll put it away myself.

284
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
Go rest up.

285
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,760
Why is your face red?

286
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,280
Do you have a fever?

287
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Take some medicine.

288
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,080
How was it?

289
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,360
Just as you wanted, huh?

290
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,320
K-drama hero.

291
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,320
Warm and gentle,

292
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,960
even help you carry the bags.

293
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,760
Perfect, right?

294
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,840
Then you can no longer write on a report

295
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,280
that the boss here is mean.

296
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,440
Oh, so flustered, don't know how to react.

297
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,440
So confused.

298
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,360
Come.

299
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,360
This "oppa" will carry the bag for you.

300
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,560
Oh!

301
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,800
What's wrong? Why is your face red?

302
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,920
Do you have a fever?

303
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,800
Don't forget to take some medicine.

304
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,480
Crazy!

305
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
Crazy!

306
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Please don't!

307
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,840
How exciting!

308
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,200
Why do you guys come back so early?

309
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,360
Faidam suddenly got sick.

310
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,800
Is she okay?

311
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,400
She's okay for now.

312
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,520
But if we leave her to her own devices,

313
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,040
she would have been worse

314
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,520
and it'll be very troublesome.

315
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,800
So I decided we should head back.

316
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,320
And...

317
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,200
do you still want to go on another trip?

318
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,840
Where are you inviting me to?

319
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,280
So you know everything now, Miss Phon?

320
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,960
Yes.

321
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,360
Oab just told me.

322
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,280
Great, you can assist with our plan.

323
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,680
We'll have Phon take Auntie to Ubon Ratchathani then.

324
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,920
And I'll bring Dao there, right?

325
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,640
We'll meet at Ubon Ratchathani.

326
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,480
I'll get everything ready.

327
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,880
So, what will it be?

328
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,560
Where are you taking me?

329
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,840
You'll know when we get there.

330
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,440
Let's go today.

331
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,560
Huh?

332
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,960
Today?

333
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,760
Speaking of which,

334
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,480
who's paying for the trip?

335
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,360
This trip is on me.

336
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,600
You're paying?

337
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,080
Yes, it's all on me.

338
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,480
Wait a moment.

339
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,920
I'll go pack my clothes.

340
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,760
- Yes. - Phon is paying again!

341
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,720
Hey, Wat.

342
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,760
Huh?

343
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,840
Can I ask you to go get the model from the office for me?

344
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,200
It should be ready by next week.

345
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,800
I want to see the real deal.

346
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,960
Looking from the paper isn't enough.

347
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,080
Sure.

348
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,160
I'm always at the office.

349
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,160
Okay.

350
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,280
Hey.

351
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,640
Is your job done?

352
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,000
It should be tonight.

353
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,920
I've revised it several times.

354
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,880
Hey.

355
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,880
Hey, do you want to go on a trip?

356
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,880
Huh?

357
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,120
Let's go on a trip.

358
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,200
Hungry? Hungry like this?

359
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,640
Are you hungry for men?

360
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,320
Are you insane? I want to visit your home.

361
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,720
Fake.

362
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,760
What fake?

363
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,520
I'm bored with men from Bangkok.

364
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,440
I want to have a change of flavor

365
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,120
and taste Ubon Ratchathani guys.

366
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,360
I heard they were yummy.

367
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,680
Sure.

368
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,600
Then bring it on.

369
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,560
- Yes! - Invite your mom, too.

370
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,600
Hey, Madam won't be home for a while.

371
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,800
She's leaving out of town with Miss Phon.

372
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,560
Then I'll submit my work now.

373
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,520
I'll go tell Taew to watch the house.

374
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,080
Fabulous.

375
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,600
Tomorrow I can go...

376
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,080
That's it.

377
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,560
Go dance with you.

378
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,360
- Wait a moment, I'll submit work first - Yeah.

379
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,760
Okay, all done.

380
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,440
I'll go now.

381
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,760
Tomorrow I'll tell Doctor

382
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,360
then we'll head out.

383
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,280
I'll handle the plane tickets and mom.

384
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
Okay.

385
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,400
Bye.

386
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,080
Success.

387
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,560
Taew.

388
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,600
It's...

389
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,800
Madam went out of town

390
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,880
then tomorrow,

391
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,640
can I go home to visit Grandma?

392
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,160
Okay?

393
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,760
Taew.

394
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,680
Are you upset? Why are you not answering?

395
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,880
Fine.

396
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,240
Then, I won't go if you're not okay.

397
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,360
Then, I'll go tell Mr. Wat that I can't go.

398
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,840
You can go as long as you like.

399
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,480
Just be back before Madam does.

400
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,360
You keep talking and asking.

401
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,080
I don't want to speak.

402
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,040
I don't want my face to wrinkle, got it?

403
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,880
This is not winkled, it's dried and cracked.

404
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,800
Cracked like the fields in your home, Isan.

405
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,840
Drought.

406
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,760
Hey, don't waste it.

407
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,280
Such a bright smile,

408
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,760
what do you want from me?

409
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,040
Correct, Doctor.

410
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,920
What is it?

411
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,840
I'd like to ask for leave.

412
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,400
You can never stay home when Mom is away.

413
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,120
Where are you going?

414
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,000
To the alleyway.

415
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,840
I'm meeting Mes.

416
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,880
You have a foreign boyfriend,

417
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,640
motorbike taxi boyfriend,

418
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,440
and who's this new guy?

419
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,240
A messenger, Doctor.

420
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,520
Just kidding.

421
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,280
I want to go visit Grandma for three days.

422
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Go ahead.

423
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,120
Are you really okay, Doctor?

424
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,120
Come back fast.

425
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,320
Thank you, Doctor.

426
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,600
May this merit bless you with luck,

427
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,280
success and prosperity.

428
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,640
I'm going now. Thank you!

429
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,440
Will this really work, Oab?

430
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,040
Of course, Grandma.

431
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,080
Not only we lured Dao to meet Doctor.

432
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,680
We will need to make her admit

433
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,440
that she's Faidam.

434
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,040
Dao doesn't give in to others.

435
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,320
She likes to win.

436
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,600
I think that even if she was caught red handed,

437
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,960
she still won't give up.

438
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,640
You're right, Honey.

439
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,760
We'll never know until we try.

440
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,080
We have a lot of helping hands,

441
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,360
it doesn't hurt to try.

442
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,200
What are you up to, Doctor?

443
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,160
Printing my letter of leave.

444
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,360
Letter of leave?

445
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,760
Where are you going? Are you taking me with you?

446
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,680
I think you'd better sit over there.

447
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,840
It'll be bad if others saw us like this.

448
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,560
Why are you afraid?

449
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,960
Everyone already knows about our relationship.

450
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,160
We need to talk over this again.

451
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,240
Again?

452
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,800
What do you mean?

453
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,960
This is your last payment.

454
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,840
What made you say this?

455
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,880
Because you no longer need to be my fake girlfriend.

456
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,640
Are you going to get married like your mom wanted to?

457
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,360
I think it's not fair for you

458
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,640
and I don't want my fiancee to misunderstand

459
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,440
that you giving news.

460
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,160
Oh.

461
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,120
You want to end this

462
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,480
because I made your fiancee misunderstood?

463
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,400
You care about that kind of woman?

464
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,160
Or are you really want her money?

465
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,360
That's my business.

466
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,760
But I decided not to let it be this way.

467
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,840
When you're in trouble, you asked for my help.

468
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,400
I sacrificed my dignity

469
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,640
to pretend to be your fake girlfriend.

470
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,160
I let your mom insulted and scorn me.

471
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,320
In the end, you don't see my worth and kick me to the curb like this?

472
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,600
I'm sorry.

473
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
Sorry?

474
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,040
So what?

475
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,960
Did you think sorry will end all of this?

476
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,880
I will not let it end easily.

477
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,720
Ratchanee,

478
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,160
he took advantage of me.

479
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,520
Didn't you say that if I acted nice and sweet,

480
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,440
he will love and sympathize with me?

481
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,200
Do you know how much I had to endure?

482
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,680
His maid scorned me, slapped me, insulted me

483
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,360
but I had to endure all of it.

484
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,280
Even the maid doesn't respect me.

485
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,520
What do you think?

486
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,120
He broke up with you for who?

487
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,680
He said he doesn't want me

488
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,960
to give any news anymore.

489
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,400
Because he doesn't want his fiancee to feel uneasy.

490
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,240
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

491
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,960
He broke up with me

492
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,840
because he wants to be with the girl

493
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,520
that his mom arranged for him.

494
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,520
Clearly.

495
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,160
What are you going to do?

496
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,440
Until I found myself a new socialite,

497
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,280
I won't easily let go of Dr. Param.

498
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,080
Fiancee?

499
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,320
If they can get engaged,

500
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,520
they can also break up.

501
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,920
Do you know who his fiancee is?

502
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,400
I think I know

503
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,080
where I can obtain her information.

504
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,760
You've arrived.

505
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,880
Grandma!

506
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,160
- Mom! - Yes.

507
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,120
- Hello. - Hello.

508
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,080
- Hello. - Hello.

509
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,840
- Hello. - Hello.

510
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,520
Dao frequently bothered Ranee during school days.

511
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,080
I'm happy that we finally meet.

512
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,560
I'm also happy to meet Grandma and Miss Pa.

513
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,280
Wat and I have to bother you

514
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,920
during our stay here.

515
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,560
Not at all, the more the merrier.

516
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,200
We finally get to meet

517
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,240
so let's hold a party.

518
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,680
- Huh? - Yeah.

519
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,720
What party?

520
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,600
Red carpet celebrity party.

521
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,360
Wow.

522
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,000
You also have a theme?

523
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,960
Isn't having a theme trendy nowadays?

524
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,280
Grandma wants to hold a party

525
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,920
to welcome Mr. Wat and Miss Ranee.

526
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,400
Oh, thank you so much.

527
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,760
Young adult theme can be so much fun.

528
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,400
It'll be fun.

529
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,480
Thank you, Grandma.

530
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,680
You like it, huh?

531
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,200
Look at here.

532
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,440
I miss you so much.

533
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,120
Let's hug too.

534
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,600
This is... hey!

535
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,200
Why do you smell better?

536
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,160
- Perfection. - Goodness!

537
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,520
Here.

538
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,880
Choose the celebrity you want to be.

539
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,760
Wat and Miss Ranee went to buy

540
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,560
costumes to match the theme.

541
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,160
I want to know who will be dressing as who.

542
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,160
You guys really know how to choose.

543
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,880
Red carpet celebrity.

544
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,320
Let's see...

545
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,120
I'm going to be Taew.

546
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,240
Hot.

547
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,160
Good idea, Dad?

548
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,120
- Good idea? - Sure.

549
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,960
- Can you do it? - Yeah, tie it like this.

550
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,040
- Dad. - Huh?

551
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,400
Has Grandma given up on

552
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,160
making me marry Dr. Param?

553
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,640
- No. - Huh?

554
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,640
She still hasn't given up?

555
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,080
Since he's going to marry that person

556
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,960
I agree that you should dump him first.

557
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,160
So you can still keep you dignity.

558
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,680
Do you believe me now, Oab?

559
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,960
That your friend doesn't want to marry me.

560
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,320
If he does,

561
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,040
it'll be for another reason.

562
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,880
But that other reasons,

563
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,120
I don't know either.

564
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,520
But you agreed if I don't marry him.

565
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,320
It's your life,

566
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,960
whoever you choose

567
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,040
is up to you.

568
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,400
- Isn't that right, Dad? - Yeah.

569
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,520
It's your life.

570
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,560
Miss Riga.

571
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,320
Have you been waiting long?

572
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,640
Yes.

573
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,160
It's fine, I came early.

574
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,200
You called to meet me

575
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,960
so what business do you have?

576
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,680
Let's talk inside.

577
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,200
It's my treat.

578
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,600
When it comes to eating for free, I won't lose.

579
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,480
When it comes to true love

580
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,600
I won't lose either.

581
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,960
Mr. Korn.

582
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,440
You've worked at the same place

583
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,800
as Dr. Param for so long.

584
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
Have you seen his fiancee before?

585
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,080
Why are you asking me this

586
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,000
when you're closer to Dr. Param.

587
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,560
You're aware that I am dating Dr. Param, right?

588
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,280
Yes.

589
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,200
But suddenly Dr. Param's family

590
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,000
forced him to get married to a woman

591
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,040
called Lomdao.

592
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,560
I went to see my fiancee at Ubon Ratchathani.

593
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,640
Her name is Lomdao.

594
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,400
Have you heard of this woman before?

595
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,720
Perhaps.

596
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,280
But I'm not sure if it's the same person.

597
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,960
Then can you tell me

598
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,480
what kind of person is your friend, Lomdao?

599
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,760
This is yours, Auntie.

600
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,200
Who came up with this theme?

601
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Huh?

602
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,240
So Miss Dao doesn't see our faces.

603
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,960
Good idea!

604
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,800
Look!

605
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,080
Auntie.

606
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,040
Are you ready to meet Miss Dao?

607
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,520
Of course, I am more than ready.

608
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,520
How exciting!

609
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,520
Being a celebrity sure is exciting!

610
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,520
Auntie!

611
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,520
Pisamorn!

612
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,160
Come take a photo!

613
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,480
That was fun!

614
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,160
- Grandma. - Huh?

615
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,880
Where is Lomdao?

616
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,320
Oh, she'll come down. She's probably dressing up.

617
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,000
Let's go find a place to sit, okay?

618
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,040
I get to be a celebrity today.

619
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,240
Let's go.

620
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,680
- Kim, who's this? - It's Yaya.

621
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,680
Oh, Yaya!

622
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,040
Follow me, Noi.

623
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,840
Yaya!

624
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,520
- This is clearly destiny, Dad. - What?

625
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,840
Who would've thought that

626
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,200
Phon will choose Yaya mask.

627
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,680
And I picked this mask...

628
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,160
Nadech.

629
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,120
Take this!

630
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,560
I saw you secretly watching her

631
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,120
when she grabbed that mask.

632
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,200
Destiny my foot.

633
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,720
The apple does not fall far from its tree.

634
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,840
Dad, don't trip!

635
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,320
Why are you calling me?

636
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,480
How did he see me?

637
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,800
Go solo.

638
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,480
Do you want to go somewhere with just the two of us?

639
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,400
Excuse me.

640
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,360
So harsh.

641
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,040
How's it going, Songsawat?

642
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,520
Lost a guy before the party even started.

643
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,560
He started it, Mom.

644
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,080
He started running away more like.

645
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,760
Mom!

646
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,080
Oh, hey.

647
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,240
How long do we have to wear this mask?

648
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,440
I'm not sure either.

649
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,840
Oab said

650
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,360
to wear it until he gives the signal to take it off.

651
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,760
I hope your plan succeeds.

652
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,760
Mom.

653
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,400
If Dao knows that I was in on this,

654
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,280
she'll kill me.

655
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,920
Come on, don't over thinking.

656
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,880
We've already come this far.

657
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,240
Okay?

658
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,640
Dao hasn't come down yet?

659
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,880
I haven't seen her, Mom.

660
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,440
She'll eventually come down.

661
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,880
Oh, Grandma is there. Let's go see her.

662
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,520
Let's go.

663
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,640
This party is going to be so much fun.

664
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,080
- Hey. - Huh?

665
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,960
Whose mask are you wearing?

666
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,440
Doesn't suit Dao at all.

667
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,960
Oh.

668
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,400
Didn't you say to wear a celebrity mask?

669
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,960
Look.

670
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,040
Ah Si from Krong Kam.

671
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,400
Is it not okay?

672
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,840
He's handsome.

673
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,680
Yeah, he's pretty handsome.

674
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,800
But

675
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,760
you'd better wear this.

676
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,400
Why?

677
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,520
Lovers from Leh Bunpakarn.

678
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,320
Taew and James Ji.

679
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,040
Hey! The ones that followed each other every life time.

680
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,520
The love legend that lasted for hundreds of years. You've never watched it?

681
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,840
A doctor should easily understand things.

682
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,800
Why are you making things difficult?

683
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,880
Give that to me.

684
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,520
You're going to have a blast.

685
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,200
Dao.

686
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,720
(Next episode.)

687
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,240
