1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,840
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,960
If you think my family commands you work

3
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,440
more than you can take it.

4
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,760
Then leave!

5
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,680
No matter what, I won't go back

6
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,400
to work at that house ever again.

7
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,280
Could you please let her know that I'm here to take her home.

8
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,320
You're not his girlfriend so you don't get to play hard like that?

9
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,680
Right now, you're just their cook!

10
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,360
Miss Dao's father came and started punching Doctor's face.

11
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,640
Your face.

12
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
(Previously...)

13
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,040
Do you hurt?

14
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,360
I was worried thinking it was serious.

15
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,040
It seems he's fine.

16
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
I'm fine.

17
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,440
Did Faidam come back to apologize

18
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,880
or ask for job back?

19
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,200
If she returns, please don't fire her again.

20
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,960
Did you check what if Faidam

21
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,880
took anything with her?

22
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,120
I think you should check it.

23
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,200
Even if Faidam is aggressive

24
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,760
but she doesn't have the habit of stealing things.

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,360
That's not what I mean.

26
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm just worried that she might took something.

27
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,520
She doesn't have money or clothes.

28
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,200
How will she manage?

29
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,080
I think you'd better leave.

30
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,440
I want to quickly solve Faidam's issue

31
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,840
before my mom returns.

32
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,640
Please.

33
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
Yes.

34
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,080
Then I'll come back later.

35
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,280
I thought Doctor kicked her out,

36
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,880
there would be no more problem.

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,800
But what's this? When I visited him, he just chased me away.

38
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,040
He said he wanted to quickly solve his maid problem.

39
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,480
Hey, is a maid really important?

40
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,680
Do you think she'll come back to work again?

41
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,840
I don't know.

42
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,080
But since she's gone,

43
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,920
she can just go ahead and die.

44
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,240
Come on.

45
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,000
Don't give up.

46
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,160
Your sweet heroine acting has already convinced Doctor.

47
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,760
Sooner or later,

48
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,520
Madam Pisamorn will believe

49
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,520
that you're indeed a good girl.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,360
And soon, you'll become Doctor's wife like you wished.

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,800
I was not here for three to four days

52
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,320
and this so much has happened?

53
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,360
I'm sorry, Mom.

54
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,520
For firing your favorite cook.

55
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,840
But...

56
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,440
Faidam went too far.

57
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,520
Oh, Son.

58
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,400
Faidam isn't right in the head.

59
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,160
She might went overboard.

60
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,720
You shouldn't mind her.

61
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,120
What happened to your face?

62
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
Oh.

63
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,320
It's nothing.

64
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,240
I saw the bruises on Brother's face from getting punched days ago.

65
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
But

66
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,080
I didn't dare to ask.

67
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,160
Oab.

68
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,040
Can you go find out for me

69
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,560
that who did Brother fought with?

70
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,920
Someone like him,

71
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,440
I don't think he'll get in a fight with anyone.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,040
I thought so.

73
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,600
But the bruises on his face,

74
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,760
he must had a fight with someone.

75
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,200
So what did Auntie say about Faidam when she returned?

76
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,520
Well, she went on a rampage.

77
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,280
Really?

78
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,920
And what will she do?

79
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,960
When she's done scolding Brother,

80
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,880
she said she'll visit Auntie Ranee and Mr. Wat in the afternoon.

81
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,240
To ask about where Faidam's house is.

82
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,240
They're probably talking right now.

83
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,400
I really don't know where to find her.

84
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,640
I came here to ask you,

85
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,320
where Faidam's house is.

86
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,640
So I can call her back.

87
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,480
Faidam didn't return home.

88
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,280
She didn't?

89
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,840
Then where did she go?

90
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,520
Oh, Faidam.

91
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,200
She's already mentally challenged.

92
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,880
Perhaps she might get deceived out there.

93
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,520
I don't think so.

94
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,920
Faidam is here.

95
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Really?

96
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,360
I'll tell her that

97
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,920
you came here to get her.

98
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,960
Madam is here to call me back?

99
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,520
Yes.

100
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,960
Madam Pisamorn came here

101
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,200
to get you back by herself.

102
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,880
It shows that she really loves you, Dear.

103
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,160
Yeah.

104
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,440
Since your mission isn't accomplished yet

105
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,760
and the madam is here to get you herself.

106
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,560
I think you'd better return.

107
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,720
So this whole issue can be solved.

108
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,920
What will it be? Huh?

109
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,600
What should I do, Mom?

110
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,080
Madam is a good person.

111
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
But Doctor...

112
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,920
If you ask me.

113
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,160
I think if you haven't successfully found out

114
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,480
what you want to know yet,

115
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,680
then you should return.

116
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,440
If he still thinks of me that way in yesterday

117
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,920
then there's no need to prove

118
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,360
whether he's good or not.

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hey.

120
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,120
You told me that

121
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,920
if you still can't find the evidence

122
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,200
then you still have to marry him.

123
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,080
If that's the case

124
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,400
then you must return.

125
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,040
I'm sorry for making you wait.

126
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,080
Faidam was a little hesitant.

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,840
She's afraid that when she returns,

128
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,840
you will scold her and Dr. Param might fire her again.

129
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,320
I assure you.

130
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,880
I will never let Param do that again.

131
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,480
Believe me, Faidam.

132
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,440
Let's go home together.

133
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,760
Let's just say.

134
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,880
I apologize on behalf of Param for going overboard.

135
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,880
Let's go back to our home, Faidam.

136
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,840
Let's go.

137
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,880
Then I'll give you more salary.

138
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,480
For 500 baht.

139
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,840
1,000 baht.

140
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,560
How about 1,500 baht?

141
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,600
It's okay, Madam.

142
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,800
Why? Huh?

143
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,480
Is it too little?

144
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,200
How about 2,000 baht?

145
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Ha!

146
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,960
There's no need.

147
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,000
I confirmed since you gave me 500 baht.

148
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,000
Oh, Faidam.

149
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,840
Let me hit you once.

150
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,640
You only came back for 500 baht?

151
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,880
Faidam!

152
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,800
It's good that you're back.

153
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,280
Go quickly to cook something for me.

154
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
I'm hungry.

155
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
Param.

156
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,040
Why don't you speak nicely to her?

157
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,720
It's alright, Madam.

158
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,040
I don't mind.

159
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,480
Because I am just a maid,

160
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,960
the boss can speak whatever they like.

161
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,360
Hey, why didn't you say

162
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,480
"It's alright, Madam."

163
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,240
like before?

164
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,800
I don't want to say.

165
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,960
I'm not in the mood.

166
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,120
Faidam!

167
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,440
Keep it down.

168
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,920
Did you know?

169
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,160
Doctor was very stressed.

170
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,320
He went out to look for you everyday

171
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,080
and always coming home late.

172
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,720
He didn't look happy, though.

173
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,880
"It's good that you're back quickly go cook something for me, I'm hungry."

174
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,520
If I'm not worry Madam and Miss Phon's health, I'll give him laxative.

175
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,040
Squid face doctor!

176
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,480
Maids in these day are hard to find.

177
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,520
You should speak nicely to Faidam.

178
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,080
If she feels upset and quits, what am I going to do?

179
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,120
Just find a new one.

180
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,040
Easier said than done.

181
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,000
Haven't you seen the news?

182
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,040
A maid used an axe hit their boss.

183
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,440
Also one who's a criminal.

184
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,000
Even though Faidam is a not right in the head

185
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,440
but I trust her.

186
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,960
And I believe that

187
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,440
she will never kill me.

188
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,640
But do you know that your favorite person

189
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,320
is very mischievous?

190
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,240
How is she mischievous?

191
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,400
Did you believe Riga too much?

192
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,320
Oh, and I forbid you

193
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,080
from now on,

194
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,320
do not allow her to mess with my people.

195
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,040
Cook it properly.

196
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,800
Don't just get it over with.

197
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,240
When you're done in cooking,

198
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,360
just try to stay home.

199
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,360
Don't just go to Mr. Wat's house whenever you want.

200
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,040
Also, please speak nicely to my guest.

201
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,280
- Taew. - Huh?

202
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,080
Do you hear a fly buzzing around?

203
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
Oh...

204
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,680
I'm talking to you, can't you hear me?

205
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,720
Oh, Taew.

206
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,720
- Huh? - I'm done in cooking,

207
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,400
there's only stir fried basil left.

208
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,000
Can you quickly set the table before Madam is hungry?

209
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,200
I also made extra for Miss Phon.

210
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,280
Yeah...

211
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,520
Hey.

212
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
Faidam.

213
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,360
Doctor is trying to make up with you. Why are you so stubborn?

214
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,840
Trying to make up by scolding me?

215
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,040
He's trying to make a conversation.

216
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,760
You guys aren't dating.

217
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,240
He doesn't need to give you flower to apologize,

218
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,680
or sweet talk to try and please you.

219
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,880
This is already enough for a maid.

220
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,200
Ignoring me like that.

221
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,520
Even if you're my fiancee,

222
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,400
you're just a maid right now, Dao.

223
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,720
What do I have to do

224
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,920
to make up with you?

225
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,080
(How to win over a person's heart)

226
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,560
Hey.

227
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,200
Why are there so many leftover?

228
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,240
Madam ate them alone.

229
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,000
Miss Phon wasn't hungry.

230
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,320
As for Doctor,

231
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,480
he didn't eat.

232
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,520
He went outside.

233
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,120
I cooked it but he didn't eat.

234
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,960
Hey! What are you going to do?

235
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,120
I'm going to throw it away.

236
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,680
What a waste.

237
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,400
I miss your cooking.

238
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,680
Miss Phon only cook western food,

239
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,120
I'm not used to it.

240
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,840
I prefer dishes like this.

241
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,480
Delicious.

242
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,760
I'll bring rice to eat with this.

243
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,520
Don't throw it away.

244
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,880
I cooked it for you but you didn't eat.

245
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,040
Stupid doctor.

246
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,280
What should I buy?

247
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,840
This doesn't suit her.

248
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,760
Hello.

249
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,920
Are you finding a gift for your girlfriend?

250
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
Oh.

251
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,200
This one is excellent,

252
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,680
all girls like it.

253
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,400
- Really? - Yes.

254
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,240
It seems too childish.

255
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,480
Should I buy clothes?

256
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,080
Doctor.

257
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,040
Oh, my head hurts.

258
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,200
Oh, the sun is so bright, Doctor.

259
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,240
Oh, help me, Doctor!

260
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,760
I am dying.

261
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,920
What is it, Faidam?

262
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,920
Doctor, please look at me.

263
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,120
Why should I?

264
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,320
Hey!

265
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,080
I am wearing the shirt you bought for me.

266
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,160
Does it look good, Doctor?

267
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,800
Doctor, look.

268
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,680
Am I pretty?

269
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,960
Fine, Doctor.

270
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,120
Hey!

271
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,480
Hey!

272
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,040
Hey!

273
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,360
You don't like any clothes.

274
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,840
Then why did you buy it for me, Doctor?

275
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,920
Hey! You stupid doctor!

276
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,120
Are you alright?

277
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,440
Oh.

278
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,560
It's nothing.

279
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,040
She'll hit me if I bought it for her.

280
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,360
Oh.

281
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,760
Hello.

282
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,480
What size do you wear?

283
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,560
We have all sizes from A to E.

284
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,960
We have all sizes.

285
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,800
No, thank you.

286
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,480
Yes.

287
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,840
Do I appear like one?

288
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,200
- Hello. - Hello.

289
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,760
The weather is cold right now, a scarf's perfect for it.

290
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,120
It has nice design and just recently came out.

291
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,120
You can use it as an accessory too.

292
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,400
We have many colors and designs.

293
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,760
Excuse me,

294
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,600
what skin tone does your partner has?

295
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,240
I'll find a suitable color for her.

296
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,680
Light...

297
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Dark...

298
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,640
I'm not sure either.

299
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,400
I'm sorry.

300
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,160
I really can't choose.

301
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,840
That's alright.

302
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,520
Actually, any skin tone is suitable for it.

303
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,880
How about this?

304
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,360
You can choose seven colors for each day of the week.

305
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,600
The only reason I'm reconciling is because I'm close to Oab.

306
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
Oab.

307
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,000
What is it, Doctor?

308
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,360
I wanted to tell you that

309
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,760
your sister has returned.

310
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,320
Hey, really?

311
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,680
How is she?

312
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
Same old.

313
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,520
Sharp tongue as usual.

314
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,880
That's just like Dao.

315
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,640
Mischievous like her suits you.

316
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,960
For normal beauty,

317
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,360
you don't like that.

318
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,920
Oh, Oab.

319
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,200
Send my apologies to your family that making them worried.

320
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,360
It's my fault,

321
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,120
for being too emotional with Faidam.

322
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
I promise.

323
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,600
I won't let this happen again.

324
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,240
Sure.

325
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,360
I know that you're worried about Dao.

326
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,320
Thanks for telling me.

327
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,280
What did Dr. Param say?

328
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,880
I am relieved.

329
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,560
If anything happened to Dao,

330
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,240
I will not die in peace.

331
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,680
Even if she's back and is on good terms with that doctor,

332
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,640
I won't forgive him for what he did to her.

333
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,040
Mr. Ratt.

334
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,640
It's good enough that Dao came back safe.

335
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,640
Yeah.

336
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,760
What Angkab said is true, Honey.

337
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,000
From what Oab told us,

338
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,240
I think Dr. Param really likes Dao.

339
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,680
Yeah, Dad.

340
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,280
I think we should celebrate tonight .

341
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,600
Dao is safe after all.

342
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,760
That's true.

343
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,120
Where should we go celebrate then?

344
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,480
Hit harder, Mom.

345
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,480
Mom!

346
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,200
I thought you would be happy

347
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,680
that Dao has softened up.

348
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,920
If no one wants to celebrate,

349
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,080
Oab, let's go!

350
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,840
Look at him!

351
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,080
Look, Mom!

352
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Let him go.

353
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,760
I'll take care of it.

354
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,160
There's no doubt about

355
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,240
where Miss Dao gets her personality from.

356
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,760
Yes.

357
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,280
No problem at all, Grandma.

358
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,520
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

359
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,360
You're not this eager

360
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,080
when it comes to work, Mr. Songsawat.

361
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,760
Just a little, Mommy Ranee.

362
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,200
Sure.

363
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,520
- I'll go prepare our meal. - Yes.

364
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,520
Eat your snack.

365
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,320
See you next month.

366
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,920
- Thank you, Doctor. - Thank you.

367
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,200
Oh.

368
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,920
Aren't you going to ask why I'm here?

369
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,440
This is your salary.

370
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,120
Doctor.

371
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,040
What kind of person do you think I am?

372
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,920
I'm not here for this.

373
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,720
The reason why I'm here because

374
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,960
I want to know what your mom said about Faidam's missing.

375
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
Furious.

376
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,560
She's just a cook.

377
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,560
There are unemployed people being laid off on set.

378
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,240
Tell her not to worry,

379
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,640
I'll find a new cook for her.

380
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,680
No need.

381
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,040
Because Faidam is back.

382
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
What?

383
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,120
- She's back? - Yes.

384
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,800
Why?

385
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,560
Nothing.

386
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,920
It's great that she's back.

387
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,520
Your mom can be at ease.

388
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,440
I don't want to be the reason

389
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,000
why Faidam ran away from home.

390
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,520
Should I buy her a gift as an apology?

391
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,120
It's alright.

392
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,600
I already bought it.

393
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,960
Are you angry at me?

394
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,520
Are you angry that I had a fight with Faidam?

395
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,560
You're over thinking, Riga.

396
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,640
If there's nothing else,

397
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,120
let's talk later.

398
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,000
I have to hurry home today.

399
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,640
If you weren't rich, I wouldn't chase you like this.

400
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,640
When I find someone better,

401
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,480
I'll dump him.

402
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,480
Hey, Faidam.

403
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,360
Your cooking skill hasn't dropped at all.

404
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,040
Then please eat a lot, Madam.

405
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,600
Miss Phon as well.

406
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,640
Yes.

407
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,000
Same old menu.

408
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,080
But you're eating nonstop, Brother.

409
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,480
Actually, you also like her cooking, huh?

410
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,920
It's delicious right, Param?

411
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,880
It's

412
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,960
nothing special.

413
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,640
It's not delicious but you keep eating.

414
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,640
There are a lot people here.

415
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,360
Why did you only cook this much?

416
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,960
The food is almost gone and you haven't made more?

417
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,040
Didn't he said he's was tired of it?

418
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,240
If he so, why did he tell me to make more?

419
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,320
Yeah, Brother.

420
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,000
Why cook more?

421
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,920
Well, it's better than only eating rice.

422
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,560
Well? Get going.

423
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
Sure.

424
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,160
I'm just a maid,

425
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,680
I must go anyway.

426
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,920
A small matter like this is not a problem.

427
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,560
Not a problem

428
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,720
but there's a problem every time.

429
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,000
What now?

430
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,160
Did you think someone like me will get bullied one-sided?

431
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,520
Wait and see.

432
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,760
You'll be rushing to the toilet.

433
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,560
Laxative.

434
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,240
Dr. Param's personal seasoning.

435
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,840
Definitely delicious.

436
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,920
Wow.

437
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,360
Looks delicious.

438
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,480
It's done.

439
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,360
Serve it directly to Doctor's mouth.

440
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,280
They're all full now.

441
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,040
Then I'll take this.

442
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,360
- Taew! - Huh?

443
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,640
I think it's not okay.

444
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,200
Why is not okay?

445
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,680
Hey, Taew!

446
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,600
This belongs to the boss.

447
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
Hey, Taew!

448
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,520
I already warned you.

449
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,440
Faidam, you won't let go?

450
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,160
- Yeah. - You won't let go?

451
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,840
- Don't eat it. - Fine.

452
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,160
Taew!

453
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,520
Delicious!

454
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,880
Taew, that's enough!

455
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,960
My mouth is lucky today.

456
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,760
Taew, already enough!

457
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,520
There you go.

458
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,680
I feel like...

459
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,000
it's about to...

460
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,720
I told you not to eat it.

461
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,920
It's that, isn't it?

462
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,880
I was correct!

463
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,120
"Not a problem."

464
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,560
Always a problem.

465
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,160
Are you okay?

466
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,840
Taew!

467
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,200
Stop!

468
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,920
Are you angry at me?

469
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,120
- Let's talk later. - Taew!

470
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,880
Forgive me.

471
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,800
"Not a problem."

472
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,160
Taew!

473
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,360
It's a big one.

474
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,000
It's dripping.

475
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,160
My throat stings.

476
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,040
Please go to the toilet, Taew.

477
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
I'm sorry.

478
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,040
I'm sorry.

479
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,960
Please go ahead.

480
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,560
Excuse me, what's the matter?

481
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,840
Why don't you go in?

482
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,440
There are only M and L sizes.

483
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,480
Mine is...

484
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,120
only S size.

485
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,640
So I don't know which one to go in.

486
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,360
Seems like you're drunk.

487
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,640
Come, I'll help you.

488
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,600
Good job, Brother, I'll tip you.

489
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,880
My dad is rich.

490
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,240
- Baby? - Yes?

491
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,440
Do you want to come over today?

492
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,520
Is that a good idea, Buab?

493
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,600
Ms. Ranee and Mr. Wat wouldn’t be pleased.

494
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,880
It's fine, no one will scold you.

495
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,120
I'll give another one.

496
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,440
Come over if you're willing to.

497
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,480
Come.

498
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,640
I'm shy, Buab baby.

499
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,160
Hey!

500
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,680
Oh!

501
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,200
Buab baby.

502
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,200
Buab baby.

503
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,440
Oh!

504
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,760
It's coming.

505
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,160
Baby, wait!

506
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,280
Oh, screw me.

507
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,120
Missed again!

508
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,240
Be careful.

509
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,920
Be careful, not to fall for me?

510
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,320
The stairs.

511
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,680
Mind your steps, baby.

512
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,880
Well?

513
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:20,240
Teenagers in these days look cute and adorable!

514
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,480
My face is right here.

515
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,920
Oh.

516
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,480
I'm sorry.

517
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,040
I'm a little short.

518
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,400
Oab.

519
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,040
Are you sure that you won't change your mind?

520
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,200
Yes, Dad.

521
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,920
Phon will be angry.

522
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,920
You're not even married yet and already feel afraid?

523
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,760
Let's go.

524
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,160
Oh, wait.

525
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,560
Wait a moment.

526
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,360
Remember, don't tell my wife.

527
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,840
But I can tell Mom, right?

528
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,840
My wife and your mom are the same person.

529
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,280
You slapped me so hard.

530
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,320
You won't change your mind?

531
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,720
I won't talk.

532
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,760
Do not talk.

533
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,800
Let's go.

534
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,840
Come in.

535
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,080
Don't be naughty yet.

536
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,880
Let me take a shower first.

537
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,560
You don't need a shower,

538
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,360
you already smell so nice.

539
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,360
You're strong for a woman.

540
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,160
I'm going to wash my face real quick.

541
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,800
I'll be right back. I'll be quick.

542
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,760
Yes.

543
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,880
This won't do.

544
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,400
Huh?

545
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
I'm done.

546
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,040
We need to make things clear.

547
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,080
What?

548
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,280
Do you have a boyfriend?

549
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,920
No.

550
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,760
No boyfriend?

551
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,520
Then whose photo is this?

552
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,120
Your fling?

553
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,640
Nope.

554
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,280
Someone like me doesn't have a fling.

555
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,960
When I love someone,

556
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,400
I only love that person.

557
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:56,280
If he's not your boyfriend or a fling,

558
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,600
who is this man?

559
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,840
That's me.

560
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,880
That's me.

561
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,360
- This is your photo? - Yes.

562
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,760
I have an urgent business.

563
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,040
Who locked the door?

564
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,680
Hold on, let's bath together first.

565
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,680
I won't bath anymore.

566
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,280
I'm leaving, wifey!

567
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,200
All done, Sister.

568
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,800
Thank you so much.

569
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,560
Love you.

570
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,560
Hello, Grandma.

571
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,720
My agent just called and everything has been taken care of.

572
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,200
Serves you right.

573
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,440
Thank you so much, Wat.

574
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,240
No problem.

575
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,880
Next time,

576
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,560
if you need my help just tell me,

577
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,960
I will arrange a good one like you asked.

578
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,520
Thank you so much.

579
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,320
Bye!

580
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,920
Oab's back, you can lock the door now.

581
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,280
Yes, Mom.

582
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,880
Drunk as a skunk.

583
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,280
Taew? Is that you?

584
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,920
Didn't Taew went to see Buab?

585
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,000
Could it be

586
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,160
a burglar?

587
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,200
Doctor!

588
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,680
Why are you standing here?

589
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,880
I...

590
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,440
I'm out for a stroll.

591
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,840
Oh....

592
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,600
A stroll?

593
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,080
In front of a maid's room?

594
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,000
It's not a pretty sight, Doctor.

595
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,760
Hey, stop dreaming.

596
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,880
Did you think I'll approach you?

597
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,080
Don't be so sure.

598
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,040
In case you

599
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,880
might like something different.

600
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,840
I like different things.

601
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,480
But something dark like you,

602
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,760
I'd rather not.

603
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,160
Hey, Doctor!

604
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,200
Faidam!

605
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,120
Faidam! Can you not be angry?

606
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,440
I went to stand in front of your room

607
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,560
because I have something to give you.

608
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,400
What is it, Doctor?

609
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,040
Open it.

610
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,360
I don't dare to open it.

611
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,720
I don't know what's in there.

612
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,120
It's not a prank.

613
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,320
I'll open it for you.

614
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,800
Aren't you overreacting?

615
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,560
Here.

616
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,720
I bought it for you because

617
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,480
I went overboard the other day.

618
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,600
There are seven colors for seven days.

619
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,480
What's wrong?

620
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,920
Why don't you get a complete set next time?

621
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,840
Purple, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red.

622
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,520
So I can hang them as a rainbow when it rains.

623
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,960
How dare you bought them.

624
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,280
You didn't consider the person who will wear them.

625
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,560
Why are you complaining?

626
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,920
- Because... - This way.

627
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,760
I ditched work to buy them for you.

628
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,280
You really don't want them?

629
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,880
You can try them on.

630
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,960
Okay?

631
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,960
When you're wearing them, you look alike and suit them.

632
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,520
Look alike and suit what?

633
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,080
A crow wears a red dress.

634
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,080
You squid face doctor!

635
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,000
Trying to make up but still acted cocky.

636
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,880
I will... what are you looking at, Doctor?

637
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,120
I came to close the door.

638
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,720
I'm scared a crow will enter.

639
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,200
A crow wears a red dress?

640
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,520
Just you wait, tomorrow you will get it.

641
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,840
Why is everyone gathering here?

642
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,000
What's going on, Auntie?

643
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,920
It's the neighbors.

644
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,200
What are they doing in our front yard?

645
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,960
Come in.

646
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,400
Hey, stop!

647
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,440
Taew.

648
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,960
Why are you bringing strangers into the house?

649
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,280
They came to ask for lottery numbers from Goddess Faitong.

650
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,000
Goddess Faitong?

651
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,200
There's no one like that here.

652
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,240
There is.

653
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,040
This morning she appeared.

654
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,000
I brought all the troubled people

655
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,160
to ask for her help.

656
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,800
May I, Madam?

657
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,000
Let's go, everyone.

658
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,640
Ask for three lotto numbers.

659
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,440
Something's going on.

660
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,200
Let's go take a look.

661
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,880
Put your palms together.

662
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,480
Salute and prostrate.

663
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,520
The Goddess has appeared.

664
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,920
Salute and prostrate.

665
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,960
Goddess Faitong.

666
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:59,680
What brought you guys come to see me?

667
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,800
Taew announces that you give accurate lottery numbers.

668
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,720
So we came to ask for your help.

669
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,880
This woman!

670
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,880
This matter,

671
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,160
it depends on one's fate.

672
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,200
If you want it,

673
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,800
you need to go scratch for lucky numbers

674
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,880
around there.

675
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,640
Which way?

676
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,320
This way!

677
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,120
I have nothing to do with this.

678
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,880
Hey! I have nothing to do with this!

679
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,440
Please stop!

680
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,160
Brother, Auntie is fainting!

681
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,160
- Taew, help Mom, take her inside. - Am I going to get fired?

682
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,520
- Taew! - Yes!

683
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,120
Madam!

684
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,920
Stop! Stop!

685
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,440
You! Come here!

686
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:02,960
- Hey! - Come here.

687
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,760
You dare disrespect me?

688
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,520
Let me go, Doctor!

689
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,640
Let me go, Doctor!

690
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,960
Come here.

691
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,160
Hey, why should I let you go?

692
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,760
Don't you like lucky numbers?

693
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,480
Come, I'll arrange it for you.

694
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,960
Hey! Don't do that, Doctor!

695
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,280
Hey!

696
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,840
Stop, Doctor!

697
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,960
Let's see if I'll get lucky numbers or not.

698
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,240
Here, there's no lucky number.

699
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,640
But here's an evidence that you disguised.

700
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,920
Why are you doing this?

701
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,960
Lomdao.

702
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,080
Doctor.

703
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,440
What are you doing?

704
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,560
(Next episode.)

705
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,600
Doctor.

706
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,680
Madam!

707
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,840
- What's with all the noises? - Goodness!

708
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,680
What are you doing at Faidam and Taew's room?

709
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,320
Faidam disguised to be get in here.

710
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,880
You're screwed.
