1
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,920
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,840
I feel like you look familiar.

3
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,400
You were with Wat the whole night.

4
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,800
She went out with Wat?

5
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,880
Yeah.

6
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,320
Miss Dao who is Mr. Wat's friend is coming over.

7
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,880
So he wonders if you will let Faidam cook for them.

8
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,440
(Previously...)

9
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,600
That's the kitchen.

10
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,160
Yes. That's where I'm going.

11
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,840
Where's Faidam?

12
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,880
Doctor.

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,600
How did you do that?

14
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,760
To be honest,

15
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,240
this whole affair almost gave me a heart attack.

16
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,160
I told you Dr. Param isn't stupid.

17
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,800
Stop with this crazy act.

18
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,080
I told you I need time to gather evidence.

19
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,200
What evidence, dear?

20
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,480
Evidence that shows the Monthianrak family is after my family's fortune.

21
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,600
Besides, Dr. Param is already dating Miss Riga.

22
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,440
- Dao. - You saw it, too.

23
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,680
Riga and Doctor are more than just friends.

24
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,440
Or do you want to see me steal someone else's boyfriend?

25
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,440
I'm sorry, Mom.

26
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,360
But I really don't want to marry Dr. Param.

27
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,520
Who's calling?

28
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Hello.

29
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,880
Here.

30
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,480
A foreigner wishes to speak to you.

31
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,760
Hi.

32
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,080
Oh. Hi, honey.

33
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,240
Yes.

34
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,840
I miss you too, Max.

35
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,200
But I'm busy right now.

36
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,960
I'll call you back, okay?

37
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,320
Yes.

38
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,480
Bye.

39
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,240
He was Max.

40
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,920
He must've called my phone but couldn't reach me.

41
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,000
So, he called here.

42
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,120
I gave him the phone number

43
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,040
and said it's friend's house where I'll be staying.

44
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,520
Who's Max, dear?

45
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,000
Max is my boyfriend.

46
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,400
The reason you don't want to marry Dr. Param

47
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,120
isn't because he is a bad person.

48
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,760
It's because you already have a boyfriend.

49
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,360
I can carry it myself, Doctor.

50
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,320
You can't even walk straight, I'll help.

51
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,920
Or would you like me to carry both you and the bag?

52
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,560
So, are you no longer suspicious about me and Miss Dao?

53
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,080
Doctor.

54
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,280
You're over thinking it.

55
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,200
It's obvious she's a socialite.

56
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,080
Why would she look like me?

57
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,280
What made you think so?

58
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,920
I know you're no ordinary cook.

59
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,840
Not ordinary?

60
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,320
Why am I not ordinary?

61
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,120
Hey, Doctor.

62
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,800
Don't tell me that you think,

63
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,840
Miss Dao and I are the same person?

64
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,040
Did you think everyone is on it with me

65
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,000
trying to deceive you, Doctor?

66
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,680
Think what you will, Doctor.

67
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,800
Miss Dao is so light-skinned,

68
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,840
beautiful,

69
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,360
but I am dark-skinned.

70
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,960
But if you think that I am beautiful.

71
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,440
Then I'm happy.

72
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,320
Today, I might not have an evidence.

73
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,680
But my senses are not wrong.

74
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,160
I am confident that you're not an ordinary cook.

75
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,680
You'd better find the evidence, Doctor.

76
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,320
So you'll know that I am actually an under covered police.

77
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,840
You'd better find it soon.

78
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,480
How long will I keep getting away with it?

79
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,320
Your hair...

80
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Where does this dark stain come from?

81
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,720
Why does your mole...?

82
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Doctor!

83
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,920
That's the kitchen.

84
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,400
Yes. That's where I'm going.

85
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,480
Auntie, Where's Faidam?

86
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,400
Those two are never in the same room together.

87
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,320
But Auntie Ranee willing to do such thing with Faidam?

88
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,920
No cases left, Doctor?

89
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,720
I have another one in the afternoon.

90
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
Dr. Korn,

91
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,400
have you ever met

92
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,960
two people who look identical

93
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,200
but are not related?

94
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,560
Look identical, but are not related...

95
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,960
Doctor, that's actually very common.

96
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,360
For instance, "Pompam" (Thai host) looks like Obama.

97
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,520
Yaya and Patricia Good.

98
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,160
And I look like Nadech's identical twin.

99
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,920
If the nurse didn't tell me,

100
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,560
I would've thought you were Nadech.

101
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,440
That's right, I tell myself that every day.

102
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,960
So, why were you asking?

103
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,720
Nothing.

104
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,760
Am I over thinking it?

105
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Oh, Doctor.

106
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,680
The coffee capsule that you just bought smells very good.

107
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,160
You need to buy more.

108
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,440
I'm concerned it'll run out.

109
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,120
Yes.

110
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Oh, hot.

111
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,040
I'm leaving, Doctor.

112
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,160
I am not worried,

113
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,200
but you left with Lomdao and you two disappeared.

114
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Yes.

115
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,000
Aren't you concerned about my feelings?

116
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,360
You and I went out for dinner.

117
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,400
That means there should be only two of us eating.

118
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,480
Not you leaving me behind and make me eat alone.

119
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,400
Where did you go with her?

120
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,440
Why do I need to tell you everything?

121
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,600
Don't forget you're my lover.

122
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,000
Yes, I am your lover.

123
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,200
But it's a fake lover to convince my mom

124
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,840
that I already have a girlfriend.

125
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,400
So my mom won't bother me

126
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,680
about the marriage.

127
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,560
Do you care about her that much?

128
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
Yes.

129
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,720
Doctor!

130
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,000
I am concerned about her because she looks familiar.

131
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,480
I think she looks like an acquaintance of mine.

132
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
Who?

133
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,800
I don't think she looks like anyone you know at all.

134
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,160
Lomdao looks like...

135
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
Faidam.

136
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,920
Lomdao and Faidam?

137
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,840
That's absurd.

138
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,720
But if we're talking about their personalities, can't say I disagree.

139
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,560
Because both of them have

140
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,920
terrible personalities.

141
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,920
I know you don't like both of them.

142
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,600
But your feelings aside...

143
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,720
do you think Faidam and Lomdao

144
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,160
look similar?

145
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,440
A little.

146
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,120
Is it possible that Faidam and Lomdao are the same person?

147
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,960
Impossible.

148
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,320
Faidam has no manners and class.

149
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,160
For Lomdao who I don't like her,

150
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,120
I know that she has class

151
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,320
have rich family, an overseas graduate and uses luxurious things.

152
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,680
She has money.

153
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,040
Completely different person.

154
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,040
Why do you think they're the same person?

155
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,120
It's just a random thought.

156
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,000
Then get over it.

157
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,600
Even though I'm not your girlfriend,

158
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,200
but I don't want you thinking about other people.

159
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,000
Especially Lomdao.

160
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,240
What are you doing out here so late?

161
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,360
Why do I need to tell you what I do?

162
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,560
Huh?

163
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,800
But... you're eavesdropping on my conversation.

164
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,640
It's my personal business.

165
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,040
Why do you have no manners?

166
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,240
I don't care about manners.

167
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,400
Because I want to know why you speak English fluently.

168
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,640
So what if I can speak English,

169
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,480
what's wrong about it?

170
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,680
Or do you have a rule that says

171
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,760
maids aren't allowed to speak English?

172
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,960
It's true we don't have a rule for that.

173
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,520
But someone like you, your central Thai dialect isn't fluent

174
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,480
but you speak English very well.

175
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,440
Isn't it strange?

176
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,440
Doctor!

177
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,720
Are you saying that you think I'm not smart?

178
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,680
So, I have to thank Mr. Johnny who was my ex-boyfriend from Pattaya.

179
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,280
Your ex-boyfriend?

180
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,360
That's true.

181
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,880
At Pattaya?

182
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,960
Yes!

183
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,640
He taught me how to speak English.

184
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,960
But unfortunately, we broke up.

185
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,240
So I have to find a new boyfriend.

186
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,800
I plan to post a status on "My pal is single, please flirt her" page,

187
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,840
and tell them my type about men.

188
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,960
In case someone is interested.

189
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,200
I am in the middle of writing it.

190
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,040
Do you want to take a look?

191
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,320
(My pal is single, please flirt her)

192
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,720
You're a player.

193
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,400
I am a woman after all.

194
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,600
I might not be pretty,

195
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,480
but I still have the right to choose.

196
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,760
Otherwise, men might deceive me for my money.

197
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,200
You're right.

198
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,440
But you need to be rich first,

199
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,160
for those men to come deceive you.

200
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,560
Does that mean that,

201
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,440
if you see a rich woman

202
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,920
you might deceive her?

203
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,600
Do you not like rich people?

204
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
Huh?

205
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,840
Faidam.

206
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,960
Faidam.

207
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,480
You're awesome.

208
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,960
Super awesome!

209
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,360
Faidam.

210
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,960
How did you get away from that situation?

211
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,760
How did you know?

212
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,520
I walked passed that area.

213
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,440
Someone like me must be prepared for every situation.

214
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,120
By the way...

215
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,000
What's that single page like?

216
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,160
Can I take a look?

217
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,040
Can you post status for me that you have a single, pretty, and hot friend.

218
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,240
Write it for me please.

219
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,960
What about Buab?

220
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,720
Oh, right.

221
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,680
My mood is ruined now.

222
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,240
- Faidam. - Huh?

223
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,360
Do you think the Doctor

224
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,440
is still suspicious of who you really are?

225
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,320
Does he believe in what you said?

226
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,360
It's up to him to believe or not.

227
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,200
But I must complete my mission.

228
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,880
Then what are you going to write about Dr. Param and Madam Pisamorn?

229
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,720
Hey, why did you scream?

230
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,040
I haven't touched you yet.

231
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,840
Just rehearsing in case it hurts.

232
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,560
Because of the liquor.

233
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,720
That's why you ended up getting car scraped everywhere.

234
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,240
Look at your head.

235
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,400
But I'm happy.

236
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,000
That I have an understanding wife who won't blame me.

237
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,360
Hey, don't even bother.

238
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,120
What I mean is you were drunk driving,

239
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,240
that's why you ended up like this.

240
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,840
Remember, don't drink and drive.

241
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,720
And drive slowly in the next time.

242
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,600
Other people drive even faster than me.

243
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,320
Right! Other people drive faster than you.

244
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
Yeah!

245
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,680
But now,

246
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,200
they all were dead.

247
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,400
You talk too much, I might hit your ears.

248
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,040
Always talking back.

249
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,080
Good thing is that there's an incoming call.

250
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,280
Otherwise...

251
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,320
Huh?

252
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,160
Otherwise what?

253
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,040
I'll let you finish treating my wound.

254
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,400
- It's not even done yet. - You cheeky little...

255
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,240
Hello?

256
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,640
Huh? It's Dao?

257
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,720
Oh! Dao!

258
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,440
Dao, it's me, your dad.

259
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,120
Dad.

260
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,320
What did Grandma say about the marriage?

261
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,920
- Hey. - Nothing has changed.

262
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,200
But not to worry because I understand you.

263
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,000
Does that mean you will talk to Grandma about it?

264
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,520
I want to speak to her, too.

265
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,960
But she's not home right now.

266
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,680
Oh? Grandma and Oab haven't returned to Ubon Ratchathani yet?

267
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,440
Oh!

268
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,120
Grandma said she'll only return

269
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,200
once she finish clearing things up about your marriage.

270
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,800
Dad!

271
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,000
Oh! But...

272
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,440
How did you know Oab also went with her?

273
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,120
I haven't mentioned that.

274
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,200
Dad, I'm a little busy right now.

275
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,080
I'll call you back.

276
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,320
Bye!

277
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,080
Dao.

278
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,120
Hey.

279
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,240
Dao?

280
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,680
Dao.

281
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,320
Why didn't you ask her where she is?

282
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,560
Honey.

283
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,240
She ran away like this,

284
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,440
she certainly wouldn't tell us.

285
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,880
- Oh, but it is suspicious. - Huh?

286
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,160
How did Dao know

287
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,120
that Oab also went with Grandma?

288
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,840
Hey.

289
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,600
Where are you going?

290
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,640
To go thinking.

291
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,280
I'm all confused.

292
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,800
Fine, I won't go.

293
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,320
Think.

294
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,760
Weather in Bangkok really affects that the PM 2.5 pollution is terrible.

295
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,400
I only went out for a quick walk.

296
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,760
Look.

297
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,760
My nose is all itchy.

298
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,160
Why are you carrying your mask?

299
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,480
Why didn't you wear it?

300
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,960
I can't breathe when I wear it.

301
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,960
I keep taking it off and putting it on.

302
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,920
I see. No wonder why you keep sneezing.

303
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,280
Oh, Mr. Oab.

304
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,040
Oh.

305
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,400
- You're back? - Yes.

306
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
How was it?

307
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,360
Did you find Dao at Tham Krabok?

308
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,200
Not yet, Grandma.

309
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,240
Huh?!

310
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
Grandma!

311
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,760
You're useless!

312
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,960
The worst!

313
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,280
Aren't you worried about your sister?

314
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,360
If I went there, I would've already brought her home.

315
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,720
But what's this?

316
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,720
You're useless!

317
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,280
Why are you like this?

318
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,440
I really want to die.

319
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,520
You incompetent fool!

320
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,160
Grandma.

321
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,800
This is how you want to die?

322
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,840
Your feet is rough.

323
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,880
Do not touch them!

324
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,600
You're not going to die so easily.

325
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,000
You're not worried about me at all.

326
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,560
You're only worried about Dao.

327
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,280
Did you know that the other day I nearly didn't make it?

328
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,160
I'm getting goosebumps all over when I think about it.

329
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,840
Did you see a ghost?

330
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,280
- Perverted gay ghost actually, Auntie. - Oh, I see.

331
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,120
- I'm getting goosebumps all over again. - Oh, dear.

332
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,840
A gay ghost.

333
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
Grandma.

334
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,440
You don't have to worry about it.

335
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,720
Regarding Dao, I'll make it so she will marry the Doctor.

336
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,720
What are you going to do?

337
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,320
Try selling it to me again.

338
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,280
I will sell more ten items.

339
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,960
What are you complaining about?

340
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,160
Earlier, Mr. Wat. An employee from a credit card company

341
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,120
insisted to see you so I chased them away.

342
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,440
What did you do?

343
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,600
I saw you talking to them for a long time.

344
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,400
You see.

345
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,240
He was pestering me, so I said

346
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,680
Okay, if my boss signs up credit card with you

347
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,360
you must buy insurance from my boss too.

348
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,560
Because my boss sells insurance.

349
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,080
After that he just ran away.

350
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Thank you.

351
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,840
Hey, can you look after Faidam to prevent have problems with Dr. Param?

352
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,360
Okey dokey, roger sir, aye aye captain.

353
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,280
I will do everything you command.

354
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,720
Yes, sir.

355
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Go ahead.

356
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,480
My leg!

357
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,560
Sorry!

358
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,800
Are you still not done mopping?

359
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,640
Hey, some corners where you can't reach

360
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,600
use a kitchen rag and wrap it around finger like this

361
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,240
and poke it through.

362
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,760
Hey! Not on me!

363
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,040
Madam, please move.

364
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,160
Why don't you go mop elsewhere?

365
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,400
Hey! You too.

366
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,440
You only scrub under the table.

367
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,040
Are you going to sleep there?

368
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,360
It's dirty, Madam.

369
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,960
Are you going to sleep in there or something?

370
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,680
- Great, it's clean. - Is it clean?

371
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,040
Gosh. Gosh.

372
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,080
You guys!

373
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,720
Stop fooling around.

374
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,120
Be serious.

375
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,400
I still have many other jobs for you

376
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,240
There are seven restrooms for you to clean.

377
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,760
Hurry up.

378
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,640
Dao, you won't know what's in store for you.

379
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,600
Oab.

380
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,200
You're in trouble, Dao.

381
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,000
(Songsawat)

382
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,480
Hey! Scrub everything well and look out for the stains.

383
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,640
For short, long, black marks, help each other scrub them out.

384
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,160
What are you looking at? Scrub!

385
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,200
Yes!

386
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,560
Hey, Madam. I scrubbed everything.

387
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,840
There's only one left,

388
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,720
but it won't come off.

389
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,600
You're not putting enough force.

390
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,080
Such a small mark, why can't you scrub it off?

391
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,080
Madam, come to take a look at it.

392
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,480
Gosh, You never do what I want.

393
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,520
Here, no matter how much I scrub it won't come off.

394
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,080
I'm think of buying sand paper to scrub it off.

395
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,960
Hey! Enough.

396
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,120
- What? - That's the brand name logo.

397
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,200
It's Thailand Standard brand, do you not know it?

398
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,720
Oh!

399
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,480
Thailand Standark.

400
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,680
"Dard..."

401
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,000
Don't scrub anymore.

402
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,160
(Songsawat)

403
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,560
I see!

404
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,320
Thailand Standard, Madam?

405
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,720
I thought you don't use brand stuff.

406
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,920
You're such a weirdo.

407
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,800
Thailand Standard is a brand.

408
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,680
You're really clueless.

409
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,480
Oh!

410
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,640
Off to work, son?

411
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,320
Yes.

412
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,280
Come home early today, I want to go to Grandma Pathum's house.

413
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,320
I've got a patient appointment this evening.

414
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,520
I probably couldn’t go with you.

415
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,280
Then I'll take my leave.

416
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,360
When will he meet Dao then?

417
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,120
She's rich, right?

418
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,680
That's why you want her as a daughter-in-law.

419
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,280
A rich daughter-in-law

420
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,240
who doesn't want that, Faidam?

421
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,000
So true. I want a rich husband as well, Madam.

422
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,040
The same point for me.

423
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
Huh?

424
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,840
Phone?

425
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,520
Where is it?

426
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,680
I can only hear it.

427
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,520
Oh.

428
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,360
Good thing the psycho doctor wasn't here to see.

429
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,080
Hello, Wat.

430
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,440
Why did you call me?

431
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,960
Hey. I called you many times why didn't you pick up?

432
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,560
Can you not be angry now?

433
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,520
How can I not be? I called you for ten minutes straight.

434
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,280
Oab is probably at the house gate now.

435
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,280
Huh? What did you say? Oab is here?

436
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,720
Doctor!

437
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,800
Oh! Hey.

438
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,880
Oab, what's the matter?

439
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,920
Hello, Auntie.

440
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
Yes.

441
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,520
- Where is the Doctor rushing off to? - He's heading to the hospital.

442
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,800
What business do you have?

443
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,880
I need to speak to him.

444
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,600
Did you need to speak to Param

445
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,920
or is it actually someone else?

446
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,080
Well...

447
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,840
I also want to talk to Phon, too.

448
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,960
See? I knew it.

449
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,200
Phon isn't here.

450
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,440
She went to buy something and I don't know when she'll be back.

451
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,840
Yes.

452
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,640
Go inside and have a glass of water.

453
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,480
I'll tell Faidam cook something delicious for you. Come in!

454
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,160
That's alright, Auntie.

455
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,040
I'll come back another day.

456
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Bye.

457
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,680
Hey.

458
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,600
He quickly leaves when he knows that Phon isn't here.

459
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,200
I had to followed you here to the hospital.

460
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,000
Dao's notebook.

461
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,160
Oh?

462
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,680
Hey.

463
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,560
Where did it go?

464
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,440
Where did it go?

465
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,000
(Tom yum goong mae nam)

466
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,560
(Fried fish with chili sauce)

467
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,000
Food recipe.

468
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,760
I lost my recipe book.

469
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,960
I can't find it anywhere.

470
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,600
Could this be the book she's looking for?

471
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,520
Let me see.

472
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,280
You went to buy stuff from supermarket again.

473
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,280
It's expensive.

474
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,280
Look

475
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,600
a handful of these parsley

476
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,040
are more than 10 baht.

477
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,520
If you buy it from the market nearby our house,

478
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,920
it's 10 baht per handful.

479
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,040
Goodness. How much did you spend?

480
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,080
goodness You bought... Oh godness!

481
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,440
Why did you buy a hair conditioner?

482
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,040
If you want a soft and silky hair

483
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,920
after you finish shampooing

484
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,360
use olive oil while it's damp.

485
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,080
A couple of drops in your hand and

486
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,840
massage it from head to the tip.

487
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,160
Your hair will be like silk.

488
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,200
Why did you spend money to buy it?

489
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,200
Oh, or if you don't want to waste your shampoo or conditioner,

490
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,720
trim your hair short.

491
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,880
It saves a lot of money and you don't have to waste shampoo.

492
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,600
- Don't you think so? - Yes.

493
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,080
Madam.

494
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,840
Why do you keep long hair then?

495
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,280
What a waste of shampoo.

496
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,320
Waste of what?

497
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,440
I only washed my hair once a week.

498
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,680
And the water that I used to shampoo with is very precious,

499
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,400
it can also be given to the plants

500
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,720
or clean the toilet

501
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,720
it's so useful.

502
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,400
How could you say it's a waste?

503
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,880
You guys should use me as a role model.

504
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,720
Conserve, understand?

505
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,880
But I think...

506
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,440
I'd rather not... my hair will end up being matted.

507
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,200
Faidam.

508
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,600
You wash your hair every day, is it not already matted?

509
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,640
Look at it.

510
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,000
Take a look in the mirror.

511
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,520
- Oh, Faidam. - Yes?

512
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,400
I found this notebook dropped at the house gate.

513
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,520
Is it yours?

514
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,320
Yes, Miss Phon.

515
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,320
It is mine.

516
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,040
But it's dropped at the house gate?

517
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,800
When did I drop it?

518
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,480
Hey, someone as clumsy as you would forget it anywhere.

519
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,160
Go, start cooking.

520
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,840
Thank you.

521
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,280
Take it.

522
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,200
Wasted so much money...

523
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,480
- Taew. - Yes?

524
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,400
- I already know. - Two bags, okay?

525
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,760
- Sure. - I'll take my leave.

526
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,760
- I got everything, Madam. - I counted it already.

527
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,720
Hey, Oab.

528
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,840
You came to see me in Bangkok?

529
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,040
What brings you here?

530
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,960
At first, yeah.

531
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,720
But now... it's nothing.

532
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,560
What?

533
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
Hey, Doctor.

534
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,280
I still can't find my sister.

535
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,080
And?

536
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,560
Hey.

537
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,240
Do you not care about her?

538
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,680
Why must I care?

539
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,040
Hey, Doctor.

540
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,080
My sister is your future fiancee.

541
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,680
Future fiancee that always miss the appointment?

542
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,000
She doesn’t respect my family at all.

543
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,120
Doctor.

544
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,520
Don't mind her.

545
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,120
She's still young.

546
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,600
In her 20s isn't young anymore.

547
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,440
Graduated from America.

548
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,600
If she was young, she wouldn't let things be complex.

549
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,720
What do you mean?

550
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,480
The other day I met an interior designer.

551
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,640
Her name is Lomdao.

552
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,480
And?

553
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,200
Her name is just like Dao's name.

554
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,440
Lomdao isn't a common name,

555
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,520
and they're both interior designer.

556
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,800
Do you think it's possible

557
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,840
that the Lomdao I met is your sister?

558
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,720
I...

559
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,760
I don't think so.

560
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
Why not?

561
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,920
Because she's not in Bangkok right now.

562
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,520
Hey, seriously.

563
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,680
She's not in Bangkok right now.

564
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,960
Not in Bangkok, so then where?

565
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,120
This...

566
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,160
I don't know.

567
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,640
How did you know she's not in Bangkok, huh?

568
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,680
Because I don't know.

569
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,480
She's not at Tham Krabok. Not in Ubon Ratchathani, too.

570
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,960
Angkab said that she visited her.

571
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,800
But I’m not sure where she goes after she visits with me.

572
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,760
See, Grandma?

573
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,120
Auntie Angkab doesn't know as well.

574
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,000
Then how can you be sure?

575
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,640
That the one Dr. Param met wasn't Dao?

576
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,120
That... I'm not sure, too.

577
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,840
But I think you don't know your sister that well.

578
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,120
With her disappearance...

579
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,240
and a maid called Faidam shows up.

580
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,680
Don't you think it's too much of a coincidence?

581
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,400
Huh?

582
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,240
Then there's Dao's notebook at Dr. Param's house.

583
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,960
I think Dao is related to all of these.

584
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,120
Grandma is asleep.

585
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,440
Both are asleep.

586
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,600
I'll call Dao now.

587
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,120
Auntie Angkab.

588
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,200
Hello.

589
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,680
Miss Dao?

590
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,120
Yes, Auntie.

591
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,360
What's the matter?

592
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,560
You called me this late.

593
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,520
Something big happened, Miss Dao.

594
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,520
What is it, Auntie?

595
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,320
Grandma and Mr. Oab,

596
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,320
they're suspicious of what you're up to.

597
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,360
Miss Dao, you need to get here first.

598
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:21,040
So you can talk to them before it gets messier.

599
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Yes, Auntie.

600
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,600
Thank you so much for telling me.

601
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,320
What business do you have?

602
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,000
You're still crippled.

603
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,760
You still want to go out and walk?

604
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,280
When is it going to heal?

605
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,320
My distant cousin is sick.

606
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
She doesn't have children in Bangkok.

607
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,680
She has only me.

608
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,200
She is used to raise me.

609
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,000
I need to be dutiful.

610
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,840
I have to visit her.

611
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,520
I'll bring food on the way back.

612
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,640
You're going to visit a sick person not attend a funeral.

613
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,680
Why do you need to bring food back?

614
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,240
I can just buy it.

615
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,400
Are you going to spend that much?

616
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,480
What do you think, mom?

617
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,520
Are you going to let your favorite cook go?

618
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,480
Go ahead.

619
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,360
You will see other people's generosity during sick times.

620
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,880
Thank you so much, Madam.

621
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,120
I will hurry back soon.

622
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,080
Hey. Don't forget.

623
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,440
Don't forget the phone number and address.

624
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,880
In case you lost your way.

625
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,000
Yes, Madam.

626
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,600
I'm in a hurry right now.

627
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,880
Oh!

628
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,240
Doctor.

629
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,720
What do you want from me?

630
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,320
I'll drop you off.

631
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,760
Drop me off?

632
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,240
Your leg is hurt.

633
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,960
And that's because of me.

634
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,160
So, I need to be responsible for it.

635
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,120
Come here.

636
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,880
Hey, no need to do.

637
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,960
I'll help you carry.

638
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,880
There's no need to.

639
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,280
My leg hurts not my hands.

640
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,200
Then... come here.

641
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,680
Hey, Doctor!

642
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,720
Your leg hurts so I'll help to carry you.

643
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,960
And you're not right in the head.

644
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,560
You'll end up lost again. Come here.

645
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,120
Doctor, please stop.

646
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
Hey.

647
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,520
You don't need to be kind to me.

648
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,000
I know that you're trying to find fault in me.

649
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,800
If you're innocent,

650
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,880
why would you even care?

651
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,000
Get inside the car.

652
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,680
I'll drop you off.

653
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,560
Don't touch me, Doctor.

654
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,160
It's over, if I let him drop me off at Auntie Angkab's house.

655
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,240
What should I do?

656
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,440
Get inside the car.

657
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,680
- Or would you like me to carry you? - No need.

658
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,840
Oh, where are you going?

659
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,800
I'll open the gate, Doctor.

660
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,240
How will you leave if you don't open it.

661
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,600
Just get inside the car. I'll open it.

662
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
Fine.

663
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,520
Oh, baby.

664
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,360
You thought of me right away,

665
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,600
after you woke up to come see me this quickly?

666
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,400
Baby, why are you so floral today?

667
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,880
Buab!

668
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,680
Why did you call me a floozy?

669
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,240
I didn't.

670
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,840
But you really are floral today.

671
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,160
Idiot Buab!

672
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,360
You just called me a floozy again.

673
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,920
No, I didn't

674
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,080
What's going on here?

675
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,360
Why are you hitting each other.

676
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,640
Buab keeps calling me a floozy.

677
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,680
Mr. Wat, how could I not say that?

678
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,080
Look at her, she's wearing so many floral pattern.

679
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,680
What? Floral pattern?

680
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,280
Look, it's so floral.

681
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,480
It's not just the top.

682
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,720
But from head to toe.

683
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,760
Look.

684
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,640
even your hair clips are floral.

685
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,520
Floral, indeed.

686
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,520
Hey!

687
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,560
- What? - Mr. Wat.

688
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,440
- I almost forgot. Dr. Param took Faidam in his car. - Huh?!

689
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,800
I wanted to tell Mr. Wat earlier

690
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,600
but you stopped to argue with me. I almost forgot.

691
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,480
- Do you know where they went? - No, I don't.

692
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,000
See? this is because of you.

693
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,160
Be serious.

694
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,400
I really don't know.

695
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,560
- Are you sure? - I'm sure.

696
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,120
- Completely talk to him first. - No.

697
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,760
So what is it?

698
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,000
- Hey! - This way.

699
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,800
That's my boss.

700
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,120
Sorry.

701
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,160
Drop it.

702
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,240
Sorry, Mr. Wat.

703
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,480
This is all because of you.

704
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,440
Oh! Drive through the tunnel, Doctor.

705
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,680
- Tunnel? - Yes.

706
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,120
There will be a bridge so cross over it.

707
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,800
Oh, then there will be a U-turn under the bridge.

708
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,840
Just turn around.

709
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,960
- U-turn? - That's right.

710
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,120
And then drive through the tunnel.

711
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,640
And then up the bridge again.

712
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,800
The bridge again?

713
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,840
Yes.

714
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,120
There's a U-turn on the bridge.

715
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,560
- And then go through... - The tunnel, right?

716
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,640
That's right!

717
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,600
And then up the bridge again.

718
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,200
And then a U-turn.

719
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,200
And then up the bridge and down the tunnel.

720
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,720
Oh, exactly!

721
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,840
You have good memory, Doctor.

722
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,680
That's right.

723
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,280
So, where are you heading?

724
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,280
You told me with wrong directions.

725
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,920
You'll go down the tunnel, up the bridge.

726
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,000
U-turn, down the tunnel, up the bridge.

727
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,160
It's the same loop.

728
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,960
Well...

729
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,080
I told you already that I don't remember the direction.

730
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,160
It's the best that I take the bus.

731
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,760
You didn't believe me.

732
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,120
So this is what happens.

733
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,280
I didn't let you go by yourself because I know you well.

734
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,760
So, where do you want to go?

735
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,920
Fine, Doctor.

736
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:53,560
Then drive and I'll tell you the correct direction now.

737
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,600
- Sure? - Yes.

738
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,240
(Next episode.)

739
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,400
Some woman are perfect in every way.

740
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,680
But fake.

741
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,880
Lies to them self and to other people.

742
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,000
Who could be rich and smart like Miss Ega that is your girlfriend?

743
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,040
My fiancee.

744
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,560
But it's a pity, I don't fancy her.

745
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,280
Doctor!

746
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,480
What is going on?!

747
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:33,280
- Hold on, Mom. I'll show you something good. - Faidam!
