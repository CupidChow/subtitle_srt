1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,840
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,840
I am forced to get married.

3
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,440
Let's go to see him.

4
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,680
(Previously...)

5
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,440
But Grandma

6
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,800
Dr. Param already has a girlfriend.

7
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,880
A celebrity named Riga.

8
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,280
Dao's gone.

9
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,120
If you know any cook

10
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,600
please introduce some to me.

11
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,920
- Where's Lomdao? - She hasn't come down yet.

12
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,120
I don't know, Mom.

13
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,840
She woke up before I did.

14
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,600
Then go get her.

15
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,200
Who knows if something happened?

16
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,000
There is no need.

17
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,720
I have arrived!

18
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,280
Who are you?

19
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,320
Did you come to the wrong house?

20
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,080
No, I didn't.

21
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,240
It's me.

22
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,520
Who's me?

23
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,520
Dressed in this fashion, who's me?

24
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
It's me.

25
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,240
Dao?!

26
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,440
Call me...

27
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,960
Faidam (black mole).

28
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,560
What Faidam?

29
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,400
Did you take the wrong medicine this morning?

30
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,840
Why are you dressed like this?

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What's this?

32
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,400
This. A tick on your face?

33
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,440
It's a mole!

34
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,440
This will help me easily slip into Dr. Param's house.

35
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,080
What's the reason?

36
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,160
And how will you get in?

37
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,960
I'm so confused.

38
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,760
To go in and check out her future groom.

39
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,640
See what kind of person he really is.

40
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,360
- Future groom? - Yes.

41
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,400
But I need you...

42
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,160
and Wat,

43
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,200
to help me out.

44
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,640
Tell me more about you. Go on.

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,400
My name is Faidam, Madam.

46
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,400
A daughter of Mom and Dad.

47
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,800
From Ubon Ratchathani.

48
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,240
I assure you, I didn't come from storks.

49
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,200
Have you heard of it, Madam?

50
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,480
Ubon Ratchathani.

51
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,880
the land of beautiful people!

52
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,640
Sure.

53
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,160
Pretty lady.

54
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,760
Very pretty.

55
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,320
Like a crow wearing a red dress.

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,640
"There's a shade of red for every woman", Madam.

57
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,800
Do you know how to cook?

58
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,080
My cooking is even better than that of the "Master Chef"!

59
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,640
Good.

60
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,680
Then, let me...

61
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,760
test you out first.

62
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,160
Test her out?!

63
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,960
First, I'll test your cooking skills.

64
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,280
If you pass, you're good to go.

65
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,400
Sure, Madam.

66
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,160
I will make it for you.

67
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,760
What would you like me to make?

68
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,640
Fried sea bass with fish sauce,

69
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,680
stir-fried blue crab with curry powder,

70
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,200
river prawn in red curry,

71
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,840
seafood papaya salad.

72
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,160
One more dish,

73
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,400
stir-fried morning glory.

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,640
Sure thing, Madam.

75
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,040
- What? - Money.

76
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,480
What money?

77
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,680
For the food, Madam!

78
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,400
Hey. Why do I have to spend money?

79
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,400
I let you cook for me to taste.

80
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,120
If it comes out awful.

81
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,640
I won't be wasting my money.

82
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,000
Hello, Auntie Ranee.

83
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,960
- Hello. - Hello, Mr. Songsawat.

84
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,000
Who's this, Mom?

85
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,080
Oh, this is Faidam.

86
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,160
I brought her in to apply as a cook here.

87
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,720
Hello.

88
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,440
Faidam came looking for a job in Bangkok.

89
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,920
I brought her over because Mrs. Pisamorn is looking for a worker.

90
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,880
I heard that you were going to buy groceries.

91
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,560
Take this and buy groceries.

92
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,920
That's very kind of you, Doctor.

93
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,760
Why are you giving her 1,000 Baht?!

94
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,640
So much money.

95
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,240
Giving her 100 baht is enough.

96
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,320
Money 100 baht is enough for everything.

97
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,240
Mom.

98
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,440
You can't even buy a prawn with 100 baht.

99
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,600
To be a cook at this house,

100
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,320
think "I can do everything".

101
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,440
Khaen?!

102
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,120
What are you trying to do with a Khaen?

103
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,680
Just blow it!

104
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,080
Hey! I meant the English phrase...

105
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
meaning...

106
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,480
you must be able to do everything.

107
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,680
Then I will...

108
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,080
can do everything, Madam!

109
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
Will she be okay?

110
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,320
My thoughts exactly.

111
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,520
Only 100 baht.

112
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,680
This gives me chills, Mom.

113
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,840
It's fine, Madam.

114
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,000
If you want it, Faidam will arrange it.

115
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,040
Thank you Mrs. Ranee,

116
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,200
for finding me a cook.

117
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,920
It's my pleasure, Dao wants...

118
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,280
Oh, Faidam.

119
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,720
She wants to work anyway.

120
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,400
Don't worry, Auntie. She's skillful and also a good cook.

121
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,840
I guarantee you, she won't cause you any problems.

122
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,280
What's that smell?

123
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Smoke!

124
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,160
Smoke! Where did it come from?

125
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,520
Faidam, what are you doing?!

126
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,640
Trying to burn my house down?! Huh?!

127
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,640
What's this?!

128
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,600
Wat, bring water to put out the fire, quick!

129
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,440
Are you trying to burn my house down?!

130
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,680
No, Madam! I'm not burning down your house.

131
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,560
I'm making stir-fried morning glory.

132
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,080
Stir-fried morning glory, my ass!

133
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,160
My house is about to be burned down!

134
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,840
Can't you see? The smoke is spreading everywhere!

135
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,000
Quickly bring some water to put it out, now! Go!

136
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,920
Wat, have you got the water yet?!

137
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,840
Here comes the water!

138
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Faidam!

139
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,520
What happened?!

140
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,160
I'm so sorry, Madam.

141
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,360
I really wasn't trying to burn your house down.

142
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,880
I was making fire to cook stir-fried morning glory, just like you ordered.

143
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,080
Shut up!

144
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,520
And get your ass out of my house immediately!

145
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
Madam,

146
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,280
you haven't even hired me.

147
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,480
Yet, you're firing me so quickly!

148
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,720
Why didn't you use the gas stove?

149
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
Son.

150
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,520
If we let her use the gas stove,

151
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,480
our house would have been completely burned down by now.

152
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,640
Just leave!

153
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,920
If I let you stay any longer,

154
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,960
I will be dead.

155
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,920
Calm down, Auntie.

156
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,600
Give her a chance to redeem herself.

157
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,320
That's right, Madam.

158
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,320
Let me redeem myself, first.

159
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,280
What if, one day in the future...

160
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,040
you really do burn down my house.

161
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,120
Who'll take responsibility?

162
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,000
I will take my own responsibility!

163
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,120
I won't take the salary from you...

164
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,800
for two months!

165
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,800
Three months?!

166
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,200
Half a year, Madam!

167
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Half a year!

168
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,600
That's a deal.

169
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
Go.

170
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,640
Back to cooking.

171
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,640
Then, can I...

172
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,120
get my advance salary, Madam?

173
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
Faidam!

174
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,560
I don't want it, then.

175
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,800
I do wonder...

176
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,440
if Lomdao can really cook?

177
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,200
Come on, Mom! It'll be a breeze. Don't worry.

178
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,200
A rich, spoiled lady like her can do anything.

179
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,520
Her family sure taught her well.

180
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,040
The only thing I'm worried about...

181
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,000
is how she'll handle Madam Pisamorn.

182
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,680
- Param. - Yes?

183
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:02,080
Param, you see, Faidam managed to make all the dishes I ordered.

184
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,880
Impossible.

185
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,600
Using only 100 baht?

186
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,640
Why is it impossible?

187
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,000
If I knew she could do it, I would have given her only 50 baht.

188
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,400
Where are you going?

189
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,200
Be patient, Doctor.

190
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,720
It'll be done in a jiffy.

191
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
What is this?

192
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,640
Doctor! This is river prawn!

193
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,720
While you were at school,

194
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,800
did they not teach you?

195
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,120
I know.

196
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,480
I thought so. To become a doctor, you have to be smart.

197
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,880
But, what I want to know is...

198
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,480
how did you use 100 baht to buy all these things?

199
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,120
And who said all of these was 100 baht?

200
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,840
You see, Doctor.

201
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,760
Just sea bass and blue crab, that's already 300 baht.

202
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,480
- And the prawns... - Alright.

203
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,600
Then, where did you get the extra money?

204
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,920
Well... my own money, Doctor.

205
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,640
I didn't steal someone else's money.

206
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Are you crazy?

207
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,760
How could you use your own money for this?

208
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,120
I'm not crazy, Doctor!

209
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,760
Look, Doctor.

210
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,840
They call it...

211
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,400
an "investment".

212
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,080
What are you investing in?

213
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,600
Oh, jeez!

214
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,680
Doctor.

215
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,880
If I hadn't use my own money,

216
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,040
I wouldn't have landed the job.

217
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,480
They call it "marketing",

218
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,720
Have you heard of that, Doctor?

219
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,400
- Oh, Phon. - Brother.

220
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,880
I didn't know you were back. I could have picked you up.

221
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,760
Oh. Mom and dad bought tons of salted fish for auntie.

222
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,880
Why?

223
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,960
Mom is already stingy enough.

224
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,160
It's called being "frugal", not stingy.

225
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,560
So, are you heading out?

226
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,600
Just taking a stroll.

227
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,000
I don't want to watch how mom welcomes our new cook.

228
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,560
A new cook?

229
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,560
Yeah.

230
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,960
Her name is Faidam.

231
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,840
Why is she called Faidam?

232
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,640
What a weird name.

233
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,280
It's not weird.

234
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,920
Once you see her face, you will understand why she's called Faidam.

235
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,320
Bon appetit, everyone.

236
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,440
I guarantee my cooking is super delicious, Madam.

237
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,720
Here you go, Doctor.

238
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,080
How is it, Miss Phon?

239
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,800
How is it, Madam?

240
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,560
Is the food to your liking?

241
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,640
Well,

242
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,520
it tastes like food.

243
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,920
But nowhere near professional.

244
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,880
If it's not tasty, I'll put it away.

245
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,120
Hold on, Phon. Put that down!

246
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,880
Putting it away will be a waste of food.

247
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,200
With the current economy,

248
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,040
you should be glad with whatever that's on your plate.

249
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,640
Madam. Don't force yourself to eat if it doesn't please you palate.

250
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,320
It'll just ruin your taste buds.

251
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,640
A super-taster like me can finish them all.

252
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,760
Oh. Put it down!

253
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,960
I can still eat it.

254
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,080
If you don't find it tasty, you don't have to hire Faidam.

255
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,480
As for the food...

256
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,600
Phon can handle it

257
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,560
until you can find a new cook.

258
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,760
Why would I have Phon handle it?

259
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,120
If we let her, she'll surely overspend.

260
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,000
Plus, she likes cooking western food.

261
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,880
Look at Faidam, she can make this much with 100 baht.

262
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,280
Exactly, Madam.

263
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,880
However...

264
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,120
It tastes bad, doesn't it?

265
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,800
I didn't say it was tasty.

266
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,480
But it's alright.

267
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,680
And the food can also be saved for tomorrow.

268
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,520
These prawns. if there's any leftovers, we can put them in the freezer.

269
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,840
If we couldn't eat that whole fish,

270
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,880
remove the bones, save the meat fry them for tomorrow's breakfast.

271
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:20,000
For this dish. Cook some rice tomorrow, and use it for seafood fried rice.

272
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,160
As for this,

273
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,160
I'll give it to you.

274
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,760
(Bam!)

275
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,840
How salty.

276
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,160
Hey, Faidam.

277
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,400
Are you calling me salty?

278
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,520
No, Madam.

279
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,680
I said that this fish sauce...

280
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,800
is so salty.

281
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,720
This one.

282
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,160
How much do you want for salary?

283
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,080
It depends on Madam is willing to pay

284
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,000
a country bumpkin with no place to go like me.

285
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,040
Poor thing.

286
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,880
We're hiring a cook, what else is there to think about too much?

287
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,440
Son! We need to think things thoroughly.

288
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,200
That way, we won't be regretting it later on.

289
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,880
Hey.

290
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,440
This is my best offer...

291
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,080
1,500 baht!

292
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,440
1,500 baht!

293
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,680
- Madam. Your best offer to me is only 1,500 baht?! - Yes!

294
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,320
I pity you.

295
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,240
At first, I was going to pay you 1,000 baht.

296
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,920
So, you think you can hire me with this amount of money?

297
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,360
She's right, Mom.

298
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,520
It's only 1,500 baht.

299
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,960
How is she going to manage?

300
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,840
I agree, Auntie. It won't even cover transportation fee.

301
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,600
1,500 baht.

302
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,800
Room and board included.

303
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Yes,

304
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
or no?

305
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,160
I'll take it!

306
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,520
I was already okay with 1,000 baht.

307
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,240
I've got many family members.

308
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,240
If you give me 500 baht, I'll have to take it.

309
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,080
Thank you so much, Madam.

310
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,280
It is truly a blessing to meet such kind hearted person like you.

311
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,360
Paying me 1,500 baht as salary.

312
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,360
That's right.

313
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,960
Why on earth am I working as a cook for this Madam Pisamorn.

314
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,880
Plus my salary is only 1,500 baht.

315
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,960
- But minimum wage is 300 baht. - Hey, what are you complaining about?

316
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,200
Well? What are you complaining about?

317
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,000
Who's complaining?

318
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,880
I wasn't. I wasn't complaining at all.

319
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,800
Where are you going?

320
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,440
I'm going to get my clothes from Mr. Wat's house.

321
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,520
If you'll excuse me.

322
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,680
Wait.

323
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,360
What else do you want from me?

324
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,080
Yes, Doctor?

325
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,160
I just started working today.

326
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,200
Why do you rush to fire me already?

327
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,560
Why are you crying?

328
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,120
I'm not firing you.

329
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,480
You're handing me a compensation, aren't you?

330
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
I won't take it.

331
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,640
I don't want to be jobless.

332
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,000
I said, I'm not firing you.

333
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,840
I'm adding this to your salary.

334
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,200
Mom is giving you 1,500 baht.

335
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,120
I'm giving you another 8,500 baht.

336
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,720
A total of 10,000 baht.

337
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,800
Just take it. Here it is.

338
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,440
Holding hands like this... Is this inappropriate?

339
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,840
Now, you'll have money to send back home.

340
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,480
As for groceries... If it's not enough, just come to me.

341
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,760
I know the money that my mom gave to you is not enough.

342
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,360
So, don't try to use your own money like you did today.

343
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,480
Thank you so much!

344
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,880
You're so nice, doctor!

345
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:19,080
- I'll head over to Mr. Songsawat's house now. - Yeah.

346
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,240
According to what you said, he seems like a pretty decent guy.

347
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,600
I'm not so sure. I'll have to keep my eyes on him.

348
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,480
Meaning, you'll pretend to be Faidam for quite a while?

349
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,840
Yes.

350
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,560
How long?

351
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,480
Until...

352
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,800
I unveil the real Param beneath that mask,

353
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,200
and prove that he's not a suitable candidate for marriage.

354
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,240
Here you go.

355
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,120
I bought some pastries.

356
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,520
Looks yummy!

357
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,200
How is it, Auntie? Delicious?

358
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,680
Of course!

359
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,680
Where did you buy it? I'll have Faidam buy it sometimes.

360
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,920
At Paragon.

361
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,000
This shop is so famous, everyone has to queue up to buy it.

362
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,600
It's 150 baht per piece.

363
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,480
Huh?! 150 baht?!

364
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
How could you buy it? So expensive!

365
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,160
Don't bother buying it next time!

366
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,800
Buy the sugary biscuits. Those only costs a few baht.

367
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,920
I bought them in bulk and I still haven't finish them all.

368
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,560
You haven't eaten them all

369
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,880
is because they aren't as yummy as premium pastries, isn't it?

370
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,920
Sounds like you had premium pastries before?

371
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,840
You said they are yummy.

372
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,040
Jeez, Doctor.

373
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,720
It costs 150 baht. If it's not yummy, it won't be sold.

374
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,040
I may look like this, but I'm not stupid.

375
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,480
- Why are you following me? - I'm not!

376
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,480
I'm throwing out trash.

377
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,480
Doctor! Say something if you're going to stop!

378
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,920
You said, you weren't following.

379
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,800
I really wasn't!

380
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,160
Don't tell me,

381
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,920
you think... I'm interested in you.

382
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,640
I may look like this, but I do have preferences too.

383
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,680
Throw out the trash.

384
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
Before I throw you in as well.

385
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,280
Okay.

386
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,480
What's this?

387
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,960
Nothing.

388
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,080
I was messing with you.

389
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,840
You're getting on my nerves.

390
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,480
This is the place...

391
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,760
O Romeo!

392
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,320
Romeo!

393
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,960
Wherefore art thou Romeo?

394
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,120
Romeo!

395
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,200
O Romeo,

396
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,760
Who are you looking for?

397
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,320
Is anyone home?

398
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,800
Nobody's home?

399
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,000
What the... Is she crazy?

400
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,600
Hello!

401
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,760
- Mole! - Teeth!

402
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,760
- Mole! - Teeth!

403
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,640
- Buck teeth! - Why is your mole like that?

404
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,600
So, who are you looking for? Will you answer me now?

405
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,440
I'm here to see...

406
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,440
Madam Pisamorn Monthianrak.

407
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,520
Madam? What's your name?

408
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,320
You can call me Bella. Or Taew is good.

409
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,400
Or Kimberly.

410
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,760
Or Princess Kate.

411
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,360
Beyonce is alright, but I look more like Yaya.

412
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,960
You do look like Yaya.

413
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,320
Such beautiful hair.

414
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,480
Should I call you Yern (buckteeth)?!

415
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,800
Madam!

416
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,160
Are you Yaya or Yoyo?

417
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,480
Your vacation lasted almost a month.

418
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,440
I should cut down your salary by half!

419
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,320
Please don't cut it down, Madam.

420
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,360
I'm practically having zero rice nowadays.

421
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,200
- Yern! - Call me Taew!

422
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,960
You really want me to cut your pay?

423
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,080
No. Please don't do that.

424
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,640
Now, put away all of your things.

425
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,200
Then, come down and start working.

426
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,320
Yes.

427
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,520
I better not see you two gossip.

428
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,200
Please call me Taew.

429
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,800
Don't call me Yern like she did.

430
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,760
- Got it, Yern. - Huh?!

431
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,920
Taew!

432
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,800
- Taew? - Taew.

433
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,280
- Taew. - Yes.

434
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,200
- Let me help you. - Thanks.

435
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,480
Let's go.

436
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,640
Let's go, Yern.

437
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,200
It's Taew!

438
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,400
Faidam! You just moved in, right?

439
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,160
And you?

440
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,480
I've lived here since I was a tiny kid.

441
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,320
This tiny?

442
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,960
Yeah. Well.

443
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,800
My mom was Mr. Sa Nga's housekeeper.

444
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,920
Mr. Sa Nga is Dr. Param's father.

445
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,080
So, where is Mr. Sa Nga right now?

446
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,280
He passed away years ago.

447
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,560
So, how is it living here?

448
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,720
Is Madam super salty and stingy?

449
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,280
But deep down, she's a nice person.

450
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,720
Nice?

451
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,480
Yeah! She's nice!

452
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,440
Why are lying on the floor like that?

453
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,840
Speaking of which,

454
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,960
Madam is overall a nice person.

455
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,560
She even paid for my school tuition.

456
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,200
Then I thought about it,

457
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,520
studying gives me headache.

458
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,040
I'd rather get a husband.

459
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,360
Just kidding.

460
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,960
I was too lazy. So I studied up to ninth grade.

461
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,120
But truthfully....

462
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,560
I have a dream.

463
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,320
I want...

464
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,520
to become a celebrity.

465
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,080
Just like Yaya.

466
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,520
So I can get a boyfriend...

467
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,760
like Nadech.

468
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,360
If that's impossible, Dr. Param would be nice.

469
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,040
He's both handsome

470
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
and nice.

471
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,280
You say he's nice?

472
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,200
He treats crazy people.

473
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,640
Many patients were cured.

474
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,400
Really? Why doesn't he treat his own mom?

475
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,280
What a foul mouth!

476
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,280
Did you know, he loves his mother the most?!

477
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,400
Whatever Madam says, he'll do it.

478
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,560
Like ordering him to marry me?

479
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,480
Huh? Marry?

480
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,000
A marriage?

481
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,720
Nothing! It's nothing.

482
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,760
She gave me work while you weren't here.

483
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,320
So, is there anything I can do to help?

484
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,200
No. You're free to do whatever you want.

485
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,240
Madam is taking a nap right now.

486
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,440
It'll be evening when she wakes up again.

487
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,520
Then, I'll be right back.

488
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,960
Where are you going, Faidam?!

489
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,680
So you asked me to accompany you to the mall?

490
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,840
What a waste of time.

491
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,000
Time for looking at men?

492
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,680
Miss-Know-It-All

493
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,160
Hey! You're here to help us get some work.

494
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,560
Do you remember Mr. Nick, the owner of U-691 Interior Design?

495
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,080
I do, why?

496
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,760
I met him in America.

497
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,120
He told me to work with him once I'm back.

498
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,960
Hold up. Did you forget your disguise as Faidam?

499
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,800
To cook for that Madam Pisamorn.

500
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,920
I have my own way.

501
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,840
So, Miss Lomdao and Mr. Songsawat

502
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,440
will do freelance jobs?

503
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,640
- We're all for it. - If that's not a problem.

504
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,320
Sure. I have no problems.

505
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,080
You just join in the briefing with clients every time.

506
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,720
- Will do. - Will do.

507
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,960
Miss Lomdao as interior designer, and Mr. Songsawat as salesman,

508
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,720
It seems like our business will be booming this year.

509
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,720
For sure.

510
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,040
Today, could Miss Lomdao check out these condos?

511
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,200
The client wants a modern style.

512
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,520
Sure thing.

513
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,400
- I'll drop off the work in a few days. - Okay.

514
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,840
- We'll take our leave now. - See you.

515
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,680
Hello, Miss Nattriga.

516
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,840
- Hello. - Hello.

517
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,560
Go ahead, Riga. You don't need to worry.

518
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,840
I'll go check out the bookstore inside the mall.

519
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,680
Doctor.

520
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,280
What can I do for you, Miss Nattriga?

521
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,480
- Please come inside. - Right.

522
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,040
The designs he gave me needs a lot of revision. They don't look modern.

523
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,360
Oh. I'll check out the books for a bit.

524
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,360
Dao.

525
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,920
I'll be back. I need to use the toilet.

526
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,320
Okay, I'll be in here.

527
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,880
They might be out of stock.

528
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,520
I grabbed it first!

529
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,520
The moment we meet,

530
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,520
My heart almost melted.

531
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:58,960
The kind of thing that's completely out of my control.

532
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,080
First sight, you feel so familiar.

533
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,800
Kept asking myself "Why?"

534
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,360
A voice from my heart, whispering "I love you".

535
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,920
- I'm sorry. - It's fine.

536
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,440
Miss! Miss!

537
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,240
Miss!

538
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,560
- Miss! - Yes?

539
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,400
Here, the book.

540
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,600
It's alright, it's fine.

541
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,960
Hold on, Miss.

542
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,160
I...

543
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,920
I didn’t think you would grab it too.

544
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,680
There's only one left.

545
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,280
You can have it.

546
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It's fine.

547
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,560
I just wanted to take a look, that's all.

548
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,400
I wasn't going to buy it.

549
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,280
Hey! Dao. Wasn't that the book you've been searching for so long?

550
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,320
Why didn't you take it?

551
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,320
If I take it, I'll be ruined.

552
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,440
Scaredy cat.

553
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,840
He doesn't recognize you.

554
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,680
You and Faidam look nothing alike!

555
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,720
Whether or not he remembers, I don't want him to see my face.

556
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,280
Are you like me?

557
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,680
The moment you look into his eyes, you melt.

558
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,760
- Right? - Delusional!

559
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,520
My, aren't you drinking fast. A sudden thirst?

560
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,960
Walking made me feel tired.

561
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,080
So I need to drink up.

562
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,400
Yes, I'm coming.

563
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,920
Faidam, why aren't you back?

564
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,840
Who closed the gate?!

565
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,040
Too much time on your hands, Riga?

566
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,560
Visiting us so often.

567
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,360
I'm not so free.

568
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,880
Work is busy. I have to film dramas, commercials, and photo shoots everyday

569
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,960
There's also a movie.

570
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,800
That's a lot of filming. Where will it be premier?

571
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,720
The moon?

572
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,960
How come I haven't seen any of your work?

573
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,040
There's not a fixed date to air yet.

574
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,680
You'll see it soon, though.

575
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,280
She says that every year. Every visits as well.

576
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,200
Mom, I'm hungry. Let's eat.

577
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,920
That's great.

578
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,360
He mentioned you hiring a new cook? And a skillful one at that?

579
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,400
I want a taste of her cooking.

580
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,080
My condolences.

581
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,040
This isn't a charity.

582
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,160
Nothing here is given for free.

583
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,640
Mom.

584
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,440
Here's some chilled water.

585
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,560
- Taew. - Yes?

586
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,360
Tell Faidam to set up the table.

587
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,840
Faidam?

588
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,640
What's wrong?

589
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,360
Tell Faidam to set up the table.

590
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,920
She isn't here.

591
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,240
My new cook isn't here.

592
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,040
You'll have to miss out, Nattriga.

593
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,160
But I can cook.

594
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,480
I'm not hungry!

595
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,680
I'm sorry.

596
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,840
You can visit again when she's in a better mood.

597
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,440
I understand.

598
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,320
If you understand. Then, don't cry.

599
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,600
I can't help it.

600
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,280
She treated me like a disgusting flea.

601
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,600
I hope you don't feel the same way.

602
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,400
I love you so much.

603
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,240
Everybody!

604
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,520
Come and watch these two biting each other!

605
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,920
Come and watch these two biting each other!

606
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,520
Doctor! Are you alright?

607
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,000
You got bit. Are your lips busted?!

608
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,840
What are you saying?!

609
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,520
I'm not making it up.

610
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,480
Earlier, I really saw her biting your lips.

611
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,880
Hey!

612
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,680
I was wondering who you were,

613
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,280
you're Miss Ega (crow).

614
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,200
Why were you biting his lips?

615
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,280
You're crazy! It's none of your business?!

616
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,800
Hey! Hey! Stop it right now! Stop!

617
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,080
I said stop!

618
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,760
What happened?

619
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:16,000
Earlier, I saw Miss Ega bite his lips.

620
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,600
Biting lips?

621
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,080
That's right.

622
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,720
She bit and mauled,

623
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,920
trying to suck his blood.

624
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,960
Who knows if his lips are okay.

625
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,160
Riga.

626
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,480
I haven't done anything.

627
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,800
But if you choose to believe the words of a maid like Faidam,

628
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,200
then I'll take my leave.

629
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,920
Why are you mad at me?

630
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,200
I was telling the truth.

631
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,320
Why were you spying on me?

632
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,600
I wasn't spying.

633
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:25,320
I walked by and saw you and Miss Ega were getting it on.

634
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,840
That's still considered rude.

635
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,480
I get it.

636
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,200
If you say so,

637
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,320
I probably don't have manners.

638
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,000
But next time someone with manners like you

639
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,120
want to bite some lips, please double check.

640
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,040
So I won't get in trouble.

641
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,680
Don't go biting each other's lips in the middle of the road.

642
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,800
Faidam!

643
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,320
Hey!

644
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,400
She's right, son.

645
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,160
You were doing things out in the open.

646
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,200
Faidam.

647
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,560
- If you're done here, go back and do your job. - Yes.

648
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,560
Param.

649
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,160
When you're going to do something, think carefully.

650
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,640
Don't forget, Dao is your fiancee.

651
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,840
If she finds out, what will she think?

652
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,800
Well, that's her problem.

653
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,480
Lomdao and I are strangers.

654
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,640
Why do I have to care?

655
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,840
Lomdao and I are strangers.

656
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,560
Why do I have to care?

657
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,920
You don't care about your fiancee,

658
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,360
but care for your crazy patient like Riga.

659
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,200
Do doctors, treat their patients the way he did?

660
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,760
Crazy doctor!

661
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,880
I will never marry a person like you!

662
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,040
I want to know

663
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,360
what’s wrong with me

664
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,800
can you tell me

665
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,680
If Faidam is done with whatever she's doing,

666
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,640
tell her I want to talk.

667
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,120
