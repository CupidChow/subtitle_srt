1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,840
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,360
My name is Faidam, Madam.

3
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,320
Do you know how to cook?

4
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,600
My cooking is even better than that of the "Mister Chef"!

5
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Good.

6
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,960
Then, let me

7
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,160
test you out first.

8
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,840
If you want it, Faidam will arrange it.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,560
(Two weeks ago)

10
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,800
One, two , three, four, punch.

11
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,960
Under, switch feet.

12
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,360
One, two , three, four.

13
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,560
Must I teach everything?

14
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,400
You work in the rice mill

15
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,040
but don't know how to carry rice.

16
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,320
Careful.

17
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,760
Hey, hold on.

18
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,800
You're huge

19
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,560
why are you carrying a tiny sack?

20
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,440
Throwing away?

21
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,640
Uncle Ju.

22
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,200
It's heavy.

23
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,040
I've gained so much muscles, see?

24
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,200
Even birth control pill doesn't help.

25
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
Enough.

26
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,640
Go change it to a bigger sack.

27
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,760
Zero waste, you know?

28
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,160
This should be enough.

29
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
Sure.

30
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,600
- Really? - Should I pay you "Zero Waste", too?

31
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,240
No, thank you.

32
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,880
Go change it to a bigger sack.

33
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,520
Okay, then I'll go change.

34
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,400
- Yes! - Okay.

35
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,360
You're huge but look at them

36
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,480
they're all scrawny but still carry big sacks.

37
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,680
Uncle Ju.

38
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,000
Why did you call me? Huh?

39
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,280
Wifey.

40
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,280
Go eat.

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes.

42
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,320
I thought you'd be always be tough.

43
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,920
Mom.

44
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,440
"Mom, mom"

45
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,000
Be consistently tough.

46
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,680
- Pa - Yes?

47
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,960
What's for lunch today?

48
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,160
They're all your favorites today.

49
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
- Really? - Yes.

50
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,720
- Teacher - Yes?

51
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,160
Let's take a break, I'm hungry.

52
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,760
Of course.

53
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,800
Please come again.

54
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,240
Let's meet next week.

55
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
Sure

56
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,800
- Please eat less sweet and salty food. - Okay.

57
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,120
Dao will jump right after these food

58
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,680
when she sees them.

59
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,640
That's right, these are all her favorites.

60
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,200
Yes.

61
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Oh.

62
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,160
Has anyone told Dao yet?

63
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
Hmm?

64
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,040
About what?

65
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,680
About the wedding.

66
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,560
Dao has to hurry and return to marry Dr. Param.

67
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,880
Seriously?

68
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
No one has called her for me?

69
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,200
Huh?

70
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,240
I think important matter like this

71
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,800
let's wait for her return first.

72
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
No way.

73
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,480
Madam Pisamorn has been asking.

74
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,320
Oab, call your sister.

75
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Now.

76
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,640
Grandma.

77
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,280
As if she'll listen to me.

78
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,080
Tell her it's my order.

79
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,240
What are you yawning for, huh?

80
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,960
Are you only ever going to yawn

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,160
and not speak?

82
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,600
I couldn't catch up.

83
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,520
What I wanted to say was

84
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,440
let's not tell Dao about the wedding yet.

85
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,680
Perhaps she won't return when she finds out.

86
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,800
Do you think she can refuse my order?

87
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,560
Huh?

88
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,200
Such a small matter.

89
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,120
Then I'll call her.

90
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,160
Yes, call her now.

91
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,880
But if...

92
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,720
What?

93
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,000
What's with you?

94
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,640
Always stuttering, it's irritating.

95
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,160
Just spill it out.

96
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Annoying.

97
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,160
What if she returns

98
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,280
with a husband.

99
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
Husband?

100
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,960
I'll tell Grandma about us.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,160
Don't worry.

102
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,960
How could I not be worried.

103
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,240
I have so many unfinished business.

104
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,040
Then quickly finish them.

105
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,600
Okay, I will.

106
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,080
You can come see me next Friday.

107
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,960
Okay, talk to you later.

108
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,240
Miss you already.

109
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,320
Bye.

110
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,920
(Bam!)

111
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Crap.

112
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,160
It's mine.

113
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,320
Then this bag belongs to...

114
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,360
Sister, isn't he handsome?

115
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,400
Just my type.

116
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,760
Can't believe someone so masculine

117
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,080
wears such small g strings.

118
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,680
So true, sister.

119
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,760
How can he wear something that small.

120
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,960
Perhaps he likes it tight.

121
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,160
You said it, girl.

122
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,320
By the way, sister

123
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,600
beauties like us need to choose carefully.

124
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,960
Nowadays, there are hundreds of handsome men 50 of them are trans

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
30 are gays

126
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
25 are bi

127
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,160
there is only a handful of real men left.

128
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,840
I really don't know how this happened.

129
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,440
It sure is confusing.

130
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,920
Oh, dear.

131
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,720
My luggage is here, bye.

132
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,080
See you, sister.

133
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,640
Fast transaction, pretty, good techniques.

134
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,800
Here's my number.

135
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,640
Please take it.

136
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,800
Come see me when you're hungry.

137
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,640
Don't leave just yet.

138
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,680
Hello.

139
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,800
My luggage got switched with someone else's.

140
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,120
Okay.

141
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,840
Then I'll wait by the information zone on the first floor.

142
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,440
Excuse me.

143
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,120
It's mine.

144
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,400
Oh...

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,440
You're the one who claimed that

146
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,000
I like to wear tight underpants.

147
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
Don't you know how embarrassed I was

148
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,640
with your tiny g strings.

149
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,960
Can't you keep your voice down

150
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,160
everyone's watching.

151
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,960
You've embarrassed me

152
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,560
why should I lower my voice.

153
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,320
When did I do that?

154
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,400
You're the one who took my luggage.

155
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,280
It's you

156
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,920
who took my luggage first.

157
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
Hey

158
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,640
how could you blame me

159
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,920
you obviously took my luggage first.

160
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,120
- You just want to take it home and wear it. - Hey.

161
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
Doctor.

162
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,920
I searched everywhere for you.

163
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,240
Is everything okay?

164
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,560
It's nothing.

165
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,320
Here.

166
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,800
Take your luggage.

167
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,960
Let's go.

168
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,200
What the heck.

169
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
Damn.

170
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,520
What a headache.

171
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,280
Unlucky me.

172
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,200
Got told off for free.

173
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,200
What?

174
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,440
What's wrong with having g strings?

175
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,960
I'm not wearing it to show everyone.

176
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,680
Your mom is marrying you off to a stranger?

177
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,800
It's 2020.

178
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,040
No one's going to get an arranged marriage.

179
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,480
She probably wants to choose someone she likes.

180
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,880
Are you going to accept the marriage?

181
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,200
You've never met her.

182
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,360
Maybe the reason she refused to show up

183
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,880
is because she's so ugly that

184
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,760
you guys might change your mind.

185
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,880
Don't marry her, Doctor.

186
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,800
I'll be the one to decide that.

187
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,120
But marriage isn't a small matter.

188
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
Riga.

189
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
I told you

190
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,080
I'll be the one to decide that.

191
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Fine.

192
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,560
I'm sorry.

193
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,400
I'm just worried.

194
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
Let's go.

195
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,880
I'm not the only unlucky one to get

196
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,120
an arranged marriage?

197
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,520
It's 2020.

198
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
Who's there?

199
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,200
Oh, Dao.

200
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,160
Why didn't you tell me you've returned.

201
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,920
I told you there would be a surprise.

202
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,000
I thought you would send some studs over.

203
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,400
Anyway

204
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,640
your house is this big

205
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,720
why are you the one to open the gate.

206
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,320
My employee, Buab, isn't here.

207
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,360
My mom and I have to do all the work.

208
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,920
Let's go inside.

209
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,200
Let me carry it.

210
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,360
You should've told me that you came back, don't surprise me like that.

211
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
No way.

212
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
Let's go.

213
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,240
Who came, Wat?

214
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,840
Surprise!

215
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,000
Mom, it's me.

216
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,000
Dao!

217
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,280
I miss you so much.

218
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,440
I miss you a lot, too.

219
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,520
I have to trouble you

220
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,760
and stay over for a couple of days.

221
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,560
Only a couple of days?

222
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,480
When you were a student

223
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,000
you stayed even longer.

224
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,960
You can even stay for a whole year here.

225
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,840
I miss you.

226
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,080
Thank you, mom.

227
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,560
I haven't seen you for so long.

228
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,320
Oh, I'll cook for you.

229
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,360
Of course, mom.

230
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,560
Wait one moment.

231
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,040
Hey, Dao.

232
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,560
I'll call Ji and Su.

233
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,280
We need a party for your return.

234
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,680
We've got to dance it off.

235
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
Yeah!

236
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,800
Hello, mom.

237
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,440
You've returned, son.

238
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,480
I miss you so much.

239
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,880
Let me take a look.

240
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,320
Do you have a souvenir for me?

241
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,320
Plenty.

242
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,360
How nice.

243
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,760
Quickly unpack it.

244
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,200
I wonder what's inside.

245
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,840
Cheapskate.

246
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,400
Chirp, I heard a bird chirping just now.

247
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,040
I didn't mention you, mom.

248
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,080
I didn't say anything.

249
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,360
I just thought it's strange

250
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,600
how there's a bird inside here.

251
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,480
Mom, here.

252
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,200
Do you not like it?

253
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,520
Why wouldn't I like free stuff?

254
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,440
But

255
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,560
there's no airplane food here.

256
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,920
Oh, I...

257
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,320
Hey.

258
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,640
Param.

259
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,400
Don't tell me you didn't bring it.

260
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,360
I know you don't like eating on the airplane.

261
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,720
Why didn't you bring it for me.

262
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,120
They already gave it to us

263
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,840
it's ours to take home.

264
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,880
We currently do not have a cook

265
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,680
we could have save a meal

266
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,520
had you brought it home.

267
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,320
Yes.

268
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,160
You're rich, mom.

269
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,280
There shouldn't be any problem.

270
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,120
How long do you intend to save up money?

271
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,840
I am saving up money

272
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,600
as a dowry for my daughter-in-law.

273
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,240
The way mom talks

274
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,080
is so inconsiderate to me.

275
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,240
She has always been blunt.

276
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,480
But she knows we're dating.

277
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,320
Riga.

278
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,720
We've talked over this.

279
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,040
Fine, we're not dating.

280
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
But

281
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,000
you know my feelings for you.

282
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,880
It's okay.

283
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,480
I'll wait

284
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,640
until you've soften up to me.

285
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,040
Then...

286
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,320
let's have dinner tomorrow night.

287
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,320
When you attended the seminar in America

288
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,840
I was so lonely.

289
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,240
Oh, right.

290
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,760
I think Dao will bring

291
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,800
a Caucasian lover home this time.

292
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,440
Definitely.

293
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,640
She went abroad for so many years

294
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,960
surely, she would bring one back.

295
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,920
But that might not be the case

296
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,480
it's up to fate.

297
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,240
Even if it's fate

298
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,920
it's no match for me.

299
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,240
Listen up

300
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,800
Dao won't bring anyone back

301
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,280
because she likes me.

302
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,480
Yeah, right

303
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,960
Wait and see

304
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,720
who she brings with her.

305
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Hey!

306
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,280
Dao's here.

307
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,960
Hey.

308
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,240
Tall, white, is that a westerner?

309
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,000
My heart got swayed by him.

310
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Damn it.

311
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
Dao.

312
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,080
I miss you so much.

313
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,240
Hi.

314
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
Wat.

315
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,520
I thought she brought a hunk.

316
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,120
It's Watsy, not Wat.

317
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,720
Dao.

318
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,720
Hey.

319
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Away, away.

320
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,480
Step back.

321
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,840
Hey. You're dressed nicely

322
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,760
I got scared

323
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,560
I thought I had a competitor.

324
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,840
How about an escort instead?

325
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,080
Dao.

326
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,080
Hey.

327
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,440
Stay here.

328
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,920
By the way

329
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,560
you didn't bring your partner to show us?

330
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,960
Could it be

331
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,760
you're still single?

332
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,800
It's not the right time yet.

333
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,360
Unlike that couple, always showing off.

334
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,200
That ruined my mood.

335
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,760
It's that dude.

336
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,720
Who is he?

337
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
Dr. Param.

338
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,520
Dr. Param Monthianrak.

339
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,000
Thailand's famous psychiatrist.

340
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,880
I got all weak.

341
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,120
Dr. Param Monthianrak...

342
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,640
Oab.

343
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,960
I will not marry a stranger.

344
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,320
Listen

345
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,880
he's a doctor called Param Monthianrak

346
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,760
can you marry him now?

347
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,240
He's this nutcase?

348
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,960
Dr. Param Monthianrak.

349
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,680
What? Are you interested in him?

350
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,200
Why would I be interested?

351
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,280
- Because he's absolutely handsome. - Right?

352
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,320
Handsome?

353
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,720
Dr. Param is every Thai woman's dream guy.

354
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,280
Handsome.

355
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,680
Rich.

356
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,920
Warm.

357
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,320
Unfortunately, he's taken.

358
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,640
He's in a relationship?

359
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,120
That woman sitting next to him.

360
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,000
Her name is Nuttriga.

361
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,600
She's a celebrity but not famous.

362
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
Yeah.

363
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,840
A few days ago

364
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,920
I looked up a celebrity gossip page

365
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
they say

366
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,840
she's trying to get a hold of Dr. Param

367
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,680
in order to enter the Monthianrak's family

368
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,680
trying to upgrade status.

369
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,720
Miss know-it-all.

370
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,280
Right. You know everything.

371
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,520
Even though I work at the same place as him

372
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,480
I still don't know as much as you do.

373
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,920
Of course we know

374
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,800
we have an insider after all.

375
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
Who?

376
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,440
What? What's wrong?

377
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,680
He lives next door.

378
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,000
Next door?

379
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,400
Yeah. My neighbor.

380
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,480
No matter what he does

381
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,680
where, how

382
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,680
and when

383
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,560
I can see it all.

384
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
Nosy.

385
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,120
Oh, this isn't nosy.

386
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,640
It's called being interested.

387
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
Interested?

388
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,400
Interested in wanting him as my husband.

389
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,480
Bravo. woo!

390
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,880
You're so honest.

391
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,160
Let's continue.

392
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,680
You're still awake, mom?

393
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,640
Well, I was waiting for you.

394
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,360
Param.

395
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,200
I'll be honest

396
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,280
I don't want you to be around Riga.

397
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,360
We're just friends.

398
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,440
Nothing more.

399
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,120
Does she only think of you as a friend?

400
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,160
I saw her nearly sucking you lips.

401
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,080
Are you spying on me?

402
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,040
Good night.

403
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,320
No.

404
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,480
But you saw.

405
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,800
I told you nothing's going on, mom.

406
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,760
If nothing's going on

407
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,680
don't lead her wrong.

408
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,120
I forbid you from hanging out with her.

409
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,400
It's my request.

410
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,760
Mom.

411
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,680
Riga used to be a nurse

412
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,560
and she used to work with me

413
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,800
now she's my patient.

414
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,360
You know when she's stressed out

415
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,160
there's high chance of suicide.

416
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,320
More like faking it.

417
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,760
Whatever.

418
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,200
Whatever you do

419
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,400
you're not allowed to date her.

420
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,280
Don't forget

421
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,360
you already have a fiancee.

422
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,280
Mom.

423
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,880
I've never seen her face before.

424
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,120
I can't marry someone I don't know.

425
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,520
I'll go take a shower.

426
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,800
Why can't you?

427
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,440
It's my order.

428
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,800
Do you want others to call me a liar.

429
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,560
I think Grandma Pathum isn't serious about it.

430
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,560
But I am.

431
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,320
You know how much I owed to granny Pathum.

432
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,480
I was an orphan.

433
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,800
If it weren't for her financial support

434
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,320
I would never get to meet your dad.

435
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,320
I would never get to be your mother.

436
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,600
I wouldn't be Madam Pisamorn that I am today.

437
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,640
And if she

438
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,040
wants her granddaughter to marry you

439
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,760
how can I refuse that?

440
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,880
Even though I am a psychiatrist

441
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,560
I've fixed others' problems.

442
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,280
but I can't fix my own problem.

443
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,520
You sure like to walk and sigh.

444
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,440
What's wrong, Lomdao?

445
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,720
You look miserable.

446
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,720
Is it a big problem?

447
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,440
Yeah.

448
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,840
Tell me.

449
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,680
Sit right up and talk properly.

450
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,760
Just tell me.

451
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,480
I have to return home today.

452
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,520
That's it?

453
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,600
How is that a big problem?

454
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,960
The problem is

455
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,960
my family forced me to get married.

456
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,960
Huh?

457
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,120
What did you say?

458
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,960
I am forced to get married.

459
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
What?

460
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,760
Are you kidding me?

461
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,600
It's 2020.

462
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
Right?

463
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,960
Oab said it's Grandma’s order.

464
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,720
Otherwise I wouldn't rush back from America.

465
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Why?

466
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,640
The guy can't find a wife himself?

467
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,440
Is he short and ugly?

468
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,760
Do you want to see him?

469
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,520
Sure. Let's go see him.

470
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,720
Then follow me.

471
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,760
Hey.

472
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,520
Are we seriously walking there?

473
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,520
Yes.

474
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,760
What, what?

475
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,640
That's the guy.

476
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,600
That's Dr. Param, my neighbor.

477
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,960
That's right, your neighbor.

478
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,160
Every girl, auntie, and gay's dream guy

479
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,480
Dr. Param Monthianrak.

480
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,520
Huh?

481
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,480
Is he gone?

482
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,720
Walk.

483
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,360
Param.

484
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,080
- Param. - Yes, mom?

485
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,080
Hey

486
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,400
are you free the day after tomorrow?

487
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,320
What's the matter?

488
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,200
Grandma Pathum called to say

489
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,560
Dao is coming back the day after tomorrow.

490
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,560
Since you've never met her

491
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,400
I want you to meet her at Ubon Ratchathani.

492
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,240
Are you free? Are you free the day after tomorrow?

493
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,600
Even if I'm not free

494
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,760
You would force me to go anyway, right?

495
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,800
It's settled, Grandma.

496
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,040
The day after tomorrow

497
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,320
Param will go meet her at Ubon Ratchathani.

498
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,640
I think it will be a love at first

499
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,400
before they even met.

500
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,160
Yes.

501
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,920
Yes, I'm glad.

502
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,040
Yes.

503
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,560
The fact that you stayed over

504
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,720
is for you to prepare for your Grandma.

505
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
Yeah.

506
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,840
I don't understand.

507
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,760
He already has a girlfriend.

508
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,000
Why would my grandma wants me to marry him.

509
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,560
The girlfriend isn't the problem.

510
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,880
It's Dr. Param's mother.

511
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,160
Why?

512
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
She's miserly

513
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,440
stingy

514
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,560
cheapskate

515
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,560
scrooge

516
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,240
She wouldn’t even let a dog sniff her stuff.

517
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,720
People here call her Pisawong.

518
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,640
But I don't blame her

519
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,880
There's a rumor that she got scammed

520
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,480
until she's left with nothing.

521
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,600
Because she has a large amount of debt

522
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,960
she has to be very frugal.

523
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,440
I feel sorry for Dr. Param if it's true.

524
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,040
He has to earn money to pay off the debt.

525
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,040
Oh.

526
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,480
That's why he wants to get married

527
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,400
so that I can help him with his debt?

528
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,560
I don't know, that's just what I heard.

529
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,880
You're back.

530
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,080
Grandma!

531
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,080
Hey.

532
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,600
I miss you so much.

533
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,040
Don't bother.

534
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,600
If Oab didn't call you

535
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,080
you wouldn't even return, right?

536
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,040
I just graduated

537
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,480
I wanted to stay a little longer.

538
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,800
Don't bother.

539
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,920
Let me give you a kiss.

540
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,560
Go see your parents. Go.

541
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,000
I miss you so much.

542
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,200
I miss you, too.

543
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,640
Seems like she only has her mom.

544
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,240
Are you sulking?

545
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,040
I miss you too, dad.

546
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,480
Haven't seen you in a while.

547
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
Come.

548
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,040
Enough.

549
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,360
Let's go take a seat.

550
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,520
Don't sulk, I love you too.

551
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,280
Let me hug you.

552
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,240
She's clinging to Grandma.

553
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,760
Because she feels guilty.

554
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,720
Mom

555
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,360
is dad still healthy and full of energy?

556
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,920
What are you asking?

557
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,480
I want to know.

558
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,360
Oh, you...

559
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,160
Well...

560
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,840
You're no better.

561
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Alright.

562
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,880
Let's move on.

563
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,800
Let's talk about you.

564
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,520
Speak.

565
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,280
I will not marry Dr. Param.

566
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,600
What?

567
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,000
You can't.

568
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,560
I already promised her

569
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,040
I'm in trouble if you say no.

570
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,840
But Grandma

571
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,880
Dr. Param already has a girlfriend.

572
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,320
A celebrity named Riga.

573
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,440
There's a rumor going around that

574
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,160
Dr. Param is flat broke

575
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,960
and has a large amount of debt.

576
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,360
Are you going to marry me off

577
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,920
to help them with their debt?

578
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,000
Nonsense.

579
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,600
What are you saying?

580
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,520
There's no way the Monthianrak family

581
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,560
is completely penniless.

582
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,800
Just wait and see

583
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,800
Dr. Param and Madam Pisamorn

584
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,080
is coming tomorrow.

585
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,400
Dr. Param is coming tomorrow?

586
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,560
Of course.

587
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,560
Grandma.

588
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,840
Wait up.

589
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,240
Grandma.

590
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,840
- Is it done, dad? - Yes.

591
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,840
Grandma.

592
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,720
It smells good.

593
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,200
We're still preparing.

594
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,800
Don't taste the food yet.

595
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,880
What, dad?

596
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,920
Don't let it burn.

597
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,880
Why are you carrying a childish notebook?

598
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,000
It's not childish.

599
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,760
I wrote down food recipes here

600
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,640
to cook them for you guys.

601
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,960
Lucky us!

602
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,600
But I changed my mind.

603
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,600
Oab, tell your friend that

604
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,760
I don't want to get married.

605
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,720
Talk to grandma.

606
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,120
Dad.

607
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,000
You should listen to your elders.

608
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
Mom.

609
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,640
Hmm?

610
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,440
I think the guy isn't that bad.

611
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,520
You should get married.

612
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,320
If you marry Dr. Param

613
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,320
you can match make for Phon and me.

614
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,040
Dr. Param's cousin.

615
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,400
Aha! You always have an ulterior move.

616
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,440
Seriously, you...

617
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,760
Fine.

618
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,920
Raise your hand if you agree with me.

619
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,240
Mom.

620
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,360
Oab.

621
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,440
Dad.

622
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,560
Well?

623
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,680
Fine.

624
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,720
I'll remember that none of you guys care for me.

625
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,760
It's not that I don't care.

626
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,080
Don't bother, dad.

627
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,800
Dao.

628
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,800
Pa.

629
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,800
Don't bother.

630
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,240
You spoiled her too much

631
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,920
that's why she's like this.

632
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,520
Right.

633
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,360
Mother.

634
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,600
Let's not force her

635
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,680
if she doesn't want to get married.

636
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,000
Believe me

637
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,440
I chose the best for your daughter.

638
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,960
Hello.

639
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Hello.

640
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,000
Have a seat.

641
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,840
How are you?

642
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,400
Are you tired from traveling?

643
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,840
Not at all.

644
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,200
Because I took a plane here.

645
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,880
It's a pity that the plane ticket is pricey.

646
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,440
I paid such a high cost for a short flight.

647
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,200
Oh, Pisamorn.

648
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,760
Phon isn't with you?

649
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,840
Mom already complained

650
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,960
this much from the tickets

651
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,840
Phon surely can't come.

652
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,240
I can go pick you guys up next time.

653
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,920
There's no need for that.

654
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,440
Just send money for the plane ticket to me.

655
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,240
Oh, where's Dao?

656
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,120
Right, Oab please go call her.

657
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,520
Go.

658
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,560
Oh?

659
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,840
What's wrong?

660
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,040
What's the matter?

661
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,360
Dao's gone.

662
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,400
Huh?

663
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,520
I don't know where she went.

664
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,920
She left this letter.

665
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,160
Seriously?

666
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,880
I need time to prove that

667
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,520
Dr. Param is a good person.

668
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,400
If I am confident in him

669
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,840
I will agree to marry him.

670
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,440
Where's Dao?

671
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,800
Oh.

672
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,720
Oh.

673
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,240
She has an urgent work.

674
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,880
So she just took off.

675
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,680
That's how she is, always move swiftly.

676
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,200
What work, Grandma?

677
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,880
She's just returned yesterday.

678
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,000
I said it's work.

679
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,760
My apologies to Pisamorn and Dr. Param.

680
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,440
When she's back

681
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,680
I'll bring her to you in Bangkok.

682
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,960
What a pity.

683
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,960
We sincerely apologize.

684
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,880
You came all the way here

685
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,200
but didn't get to meet her.

686
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,240
That's right.

687
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,680
That's not it.

688
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,000
I just regret that I wasted the plane tickets.

689
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,280
It was a short flight

690
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,120
and now we're already returning.

691
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,120
Thank you.

692
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,560
You've just flown to Ubon Ratchathani, and now you're back?

693
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,240
How could I not be back

694
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,920
your neighbor chased me all the way to Ubon Ratchathani.

695
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,200
Really?

696
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,840
Have I ever lied to you?

697
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,240
So you'll never ever marry Dr. Param?

698
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,040
Yeah.

699
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,360
What did your family say?

700
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,440
They won't listen.

701
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,160
Especially my grandma, she won't give up.

702
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,240
I will unmask Dr. Param

703
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,480
that he wants to leech off from women.

704
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,200
How are you going to do that?

705
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,080
I also don't know.

706
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,240
Dang it.

707
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,000
I don't know.

708
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,440
I'll find a way to get close to this family.

709
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,320
Look, it's not easy.

710
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,480
Even though I live next door

711
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,920
I still don't know anything.

712
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,360
Unless you...

713
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,480
go and live in their house.

714
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,520
How?

715
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,360
Hide!

716
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,680
What's with you?

717
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,240
Dr. Param!

718
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,760
Dr. Param?

719
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,800
Hide!

720
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,920
Are you still sane?

721
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,960
- Go over there. - Wat, you...!

722
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,600
Go hide.

723
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,360
Suddenly appearing like that.

724
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,080
Why are they here?

725
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,440
I brought Vietnamese meatball wrap for you guys.

726
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,200
Look

727
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,000
it's so meaty.

728
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,280
Just one stick?

729
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,840
Here.

730
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
Could it be

731
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,600
You guys don't like it?

732
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,000
If you don't like it I'll take it back.

733
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,160
It's okay, we can eat it.

734
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,680
I'm afraid it won't be enough.

735
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,120
I'll bring more next time.

736
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,800
Thank you, one stick is plenty.

737
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,160
But I think...

738
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,560
Oh no, you're all dirty.

739
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,560
Sorry, Doctor.

740
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,640
You should hurry and wash it off.

741
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,120
The restroom is right here.

742
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,200
The tap is in front.

743
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,960
You can wash there.

744
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,680
Why would you go there

745
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,160
when the restroom is here?

746
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,800
Just use the nearest restroom.

747
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,240
Excuse me, then.

748
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,280
Let me throw it away, mom.

749
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,640
Mom!

750
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,040
It's nearer here.

751
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,280
Doctor.

752
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,640
Let's use a liquid soap upstairs.

753
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,160
Is that so?

754
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,880
I'll pick this soap up.

755
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,840
Okay.

756
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,120
Wash my hand first.

757
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,120
Sure.

758
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,680
Can I use the toilet?

759
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,160
The toilet here is terrible.

760
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,840
Please you the one in my room.

761
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,280
It's okay, I'll be quick.

762
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,880
Please.

763
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,720
Okay.

764
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,040
I wish I were you, Dao.

765
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,000
All done?

766
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,800
This way, please.

767
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,800
It's a pity about that Vietnamese meatball wrap.

768
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,280
If I brought the one at home

769
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,600
it would be inconvenient.

770
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,440
My cook has resigned

771
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,400
and the maid also went home.

772
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,640
There's no one who can cook right now.

773
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,400
If you know any cook

774
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,040
please introduce some to me.

775
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,440
My cooking is even better than that of the "Mister Chef"!

776
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,920
(Next episode.)

777
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,000
Then, let me...

778
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,960
test you out first.

779
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,920
Faidam, what are you doing?!

780
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,400
Trying to burn my house down?!

781
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,960
Here comes the water!

782
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,560
And get your ass out of my house immediately!
