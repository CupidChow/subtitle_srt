1
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,040
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,560
Your house is this big

3
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,640
why are you the one to open the gate.

4
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,360
My employee, Buab, isn't here.

5
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,440
(Previously...)

6
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,040
Everybody! Come and watch these two biting each other!

7
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,240
Don't forget, Dao is your fiancee.

8
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,160
If she finds out, what will she think?

9
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,640
Lomdao and I are strangers.

10
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,040
Why do I have to care?

11
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,360
It's Dr. Param's mother.

12
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Why?

13
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
She's miserly

14
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,440
stingy

15
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,480
cheapskate

16
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,680
Boo!

17
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,480
Why did you wake up so early, Madam?

18
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,960
It's not me who woke up early

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,040
it's you who woke up late.

20
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,000
About what happened last night

21
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,840
when Param scolded you

22
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,240
don't mind him and

23
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,480
don't be angry at him.

24
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,760
I'm not angry.

25
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,520
Just wondered what I did wrong.

26
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,400
The doctor got bit on the lips.

27
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,880
I was so shocked.

28
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,000
Why did I get told off by the doctor?

29
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,880
Talking to a weirdo like you is tiring.

30
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,360
Hey, Where did you go yesterday?

31
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,280
I have something for you to do

32
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,160
but you were nowhere to be found.

33
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,320
Yesterday...

34
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,000
I went to Mr. Wat's house.

35
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,960
You're a cook here

36
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,080
not Mrs. Ranee's.

37
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,440
You always hang out there.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,080
Go buy groceries

39
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,280
and prepare food for me.

40
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,080
What?

41
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,240
Money for groceries.

42
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
None.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,800
If there's no money

44
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,120
how am I supposed to cook?

45
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,160
Consider it a compensation for yesterday's procrastination.

46
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,880
Figure it out yourself.

47
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,760
Today I feel like eating western food.

48
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,120
Make it special.

49
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,440
Can you make it?

50
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,480
Understood?

51
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,480
Yes.

52
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Go on.

53
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,720
What's this, Faidam?

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,120
Western food, Madam.

55
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,560
I present you

56
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,120
"loasted chichen salad."

57
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,480
What? "Chichen"?

58
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,160
"loasted chichen salad", Madam.

59
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,600
Roasted chicken salad.

60
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,440
Oh!

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,040
Yeah! You're right, Miss Phon.

62
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,720
That roast, roast dish.

63
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,800
Looks pretty good.

64
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,440
And here's spaghetti carbonara.

65
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,400
Also, potato soup with bread.

66
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,720
Really appetizing.

67
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,400
Faidam.

68
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,480
Are you sure they're edible?

69
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,840
Of course, Doctor.

70
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,080
Back when I worked for westerners I wrote down all the recipes.

71
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,440
This meal must be expensive, Faidam?

72
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,200
How much did Auntie give you?

73
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,400
I didn't buy anything.

74
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,000
I told you

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,960
money can't buy tasty food.

76
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,880
Unlike Phon

77
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,280
you would spend thousands on a meal.

78
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,200
Absolutely wasteful.

79
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,760
- Faidam. - Yes, Doctor?

80
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,040
Did you use your own money again?

81
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,720
No.

82
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,880
How did you cook all these food?

83
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,440
I asked Mr. Wat for his leftover spaghetti noodles.

84
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,120
As for this potato soup here

85
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,360
I asked the lady in the market for rotten ones

86
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,720
that were about to be thrown away.

87
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,360
Phon.

88
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,120
Let's eat the croissant

89
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,200
seems to be the safest choice here.

90
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,600
The bread that you're about to eat

91
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,680
I asked the bakery shop down the street

92
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,960
they gave me expired ones.

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Faidam.

94
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,160
Yes, Madam?

95
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,680
How did you get this bacon?

96
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,680
I use the pork belly pieces in the refrigerator

97
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,160
and dry them under the sun

98
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,920
then the flies worked on its magic

99
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,720
while I went to the market.

100
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,880
They were done by the time I got back and this salad dressing over here...

101
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
Enough!

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,080
Stop, there's no need to continue.

103
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,800
I'm about to throw up already.

104
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,400
You wouldn't throw up

105
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,280
it would be too wasteful for you.

106
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,680
- Auntie. - Mom.

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Mom.

108
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
Madam.

109
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,000
Aren't you going to eat these western food?

110
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
Faidam.

111
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,600
This is food.

112
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,840
I told you before

113
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,040
if you need money just tell me.

114
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,400
Don't do this.

115
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,800
Doctor! Wait up!

116
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,880
Doctor.

117
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,960
Throwing trash away again?

118
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
No.

119
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,240
I...

120
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,840
I am sorry.

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,680
If my mom doesn't pay you

122
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,240
why don't you come ask me.

123
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,800
Are you making my family eat rotten food?

124
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,120
I'm afraid to ask for money.

125
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,240
But you're not afraid to cook trash.

126
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,760
I'm afraid that

127
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,880
I will see you bite a woman's lips again.

128
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
Faidam.

129
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,760
If you're still angry

130
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,400
then

131
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,560
let me make it up to you.

132
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,880
What are you doing?

133
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,160
I became your bodyguard, Doctor.

134
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,040
In case some women will come bite you lips again.

135
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,400
I will protect you.

136
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,360
Go open the gate.

137
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,480
I am going to work now.

138
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,840
Wait, Doctor.

139
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,280
It's safe.

140
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,200
Hey! It's Oab!

141
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,480
Taew.

142
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,040
Taew.

143
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
Taew.

144
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,520
It's not locked.

145
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,400
Goodness!

146
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,720
The plants aren't watered yet.

147
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,440
How irresponsible.

148
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,720
Buab.

149
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Buab.

150
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,520
Buab.

151
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,160
Buab.

152
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,880
Why are you looking for Buab?

153
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,800
Look, Wat.

154
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,320
This is terrible.

155
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,280
He went on a vacation for several days

156
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,840
I only caught a glimpse of him

157
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,480
after he returned this morning

158
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,120
then he disappeared.

159
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,680
Follow me.

160
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Huh?

161
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,600
Even if you don't see him

162
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,720
you can guess where he went.

163
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
Over there.

164
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,680
Buab, why didn't you tell me that you've returned.

165
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,800
Well, I wanted to surprise you.

166
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,040
Haven't seen you for many days

167
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,600
I miss you so much.

168
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,160
When I came back

169
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,520
I didn't dare to ask Faidam if she has seen you

170
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,560
I'm afraid she'll think I'm promiscuous.

171
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,760
Baby, who's Faidam?

172
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,600
You haven't met Faidam yet?

173
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
No.

174
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,200
You see

175
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
I lost something.

176
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
Huh?

177
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,600
My heart to you.

178
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,720
Stupid!

179
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,680
By the way, who's Faidam?

180
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,920
She's

181
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,760
the newly hired cook.

182
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,600
But I don't know her

183
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,720
since my heart only knows you.

184
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,360
You're sweetest.

185
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,560
And you're cutest.

186
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,520
Let me kiss you to heal my lonely heart.

187
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
Fine!

188
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
Taew!

189
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,440
Taew!

190
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,120
Taew!

191
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,360
So sorry!

192
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,280
Why did you pull me down?

193
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,240
I have an urgent business, follow me.

194
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,160
- Where to? - Just come.

195
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,640
Buab baby!

196
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,000
Taew baby!

197
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,720
Our lips nearly touched.

198
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,000
Dang it.

199
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,720
When will we finally kiss?

200
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,800
Why did you drag me here Faidam.

201
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,800
Buab and I

202
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,800
nearly share our passionate kiss.

203
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,200
I have an urgent matter to attend.

204
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,720
Can you help me cover from the Madam?

205
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
No.

206
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,520
It's still early, she's not asleep yet.

207
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,360
I know she's not asleep yet.

208
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,880
That's why I need your help.

209
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,480
Buab...

210
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,720
Help me, please.

211
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,880
Not enough?

212
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,400
How about 500?

213
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,320
You already had me at 100.

214
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,640
You're really giving me 500? Wow.

215
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
Then

216
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,960
can you help me with another matter?

217
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,800
Of course, you already gave me 500.

218
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,400
When that man leaves, call me immediately.

219
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Sure thing!

220
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,640
- I'll be leaving. - Sure.

221
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Bye.

222
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,080
You're not teaching today?

223
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,760
School's out at the moment.

224
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,400
Did you forgot?

225
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,240
Well...

226
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
I can forget anything

227
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,560
except breathing

228
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,920
and you.

229
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,240
Where did you learn

230
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,800
such cheesy pick up line from?

231
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,720
And what brings you here in Bangkok?

232
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,360
I have some business and...

233
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
Come to see you.

234
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,520
You're here for business

235
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,080
did you use me an as excuse?

236
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,680
Hey, Phon.

237
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,040
Are you angry?

238
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,080
No.

239
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,840
I was going to tell Faidam

240
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,120
to cook you something.

241
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,600
Oh no.

242
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,680
This will surely shorten my life.

243
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,120
I am in your care this breakfast.

244
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,080
Certainly, It's no problem at all.

245
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,800
I just hired a new cook.

246
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,440
I'll call her over.

247
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,000
Faidam.

248
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,560
Faidam.

249
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,040
Hey, I called Faidam

250
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,240
what are you doing here?

251
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,960
Faidam

252
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
has diarrhea.

253
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,080
The stench is remarkable.

254
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
Hey.

255
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,280
When she's done

256
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,360
tell her to come see me.

257
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,040
I don't think she can come.

258
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,280
You see, Faidam has a terrible diarrhea.

259
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,280
Is it that bad?

260
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,160
Did she take medicine yet?

261
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,360
Yes.

262
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,840
But she's resting at the moment

263
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,240
she has no energy to get up today.

264
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,560
Madam!

265
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,000
Madam, please tell me your order instead.

266
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,680
Auntie, where are you going?

267
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,960
I am going to check up on Faidam

268
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,400
in case it's severe.

269
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,920
Is she still alright?

270
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
Oh no!

271
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,520
Oab, excuse me for a moment.

272
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,040
Sure.

273
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,880
Madam, please don't enter.

274
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,840
Exactly why can't I?

275
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
Well

276
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,400
Faidam has been diarrhea since this morning.

277
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,760
But she can still cook this morning.

278
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
Yeah.

279
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,080
When she's done cooking, she...

280
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,360
nonstop.

281
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,440
That's karma for you.

282
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,160
Fast as lighting.

283
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,120
See? She gave us spoiled food

284
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,360
but it backfired her.

285
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,720
Let me see her face

286
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,240
so I can laugh at her.

287
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,080
What now, Taew?

288
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,600
You really can't enter.

289
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,640
Madam, you seriously can't.

290
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,040
Faidam's diarrhea is...

291
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,040
like this.

292
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,360
I thought it was a 5D cinema

293
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,960
there are heavy smell and voice.

294
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,280
If you enter the room

295
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,440
you'll faint for sure.

296
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,400
Auntie

297
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,640
it's alright

298
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,440
I'll cook for Oab instead.

299
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,680
The stench got me good.

300
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,160
It does indeed smell.

301
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
Oh dear...

302
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,200
So close

303
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,040
You nearly got me fired, Faidam.

304
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,720
Where did you go?

305
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
Miss Dao.

306
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,120
If Grandma finds out

307
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,280
I'll get scolded.

308
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
Miss Dao.

309
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,920
Why do you always create problems?

310
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,640
I haven't done anything, Auntie.

311
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,800
I just don't want to go home.

312
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,600
If I guess correctly

313
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,000
Oab will be here to bring me back.

314
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,520
What would you like me to tell him?

315
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,040
Auntie Angkab can say...

316
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,320
that...

317
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,720
Miss Dao

318
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,640
what are you planning now?

319
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,600
If I tell you

320
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,400
you must promise me

321
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,920
that you will keep it a secret.

322
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
Well...

323
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,320
Well...

324
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,600
I am a drug addict.

325
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,640
Huh?

326
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,520
You're a drug addict?

327
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,480
If my family knows that

328
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,920
I am doing a therapy at Tham Krabok

329
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,280
if I told them

330
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,760
everyone is going to be surprised like you.

331
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,200
I really want to quit drugs.

332
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,880
But I don't want others to know that I'm a drug addict.

333
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,200
I don't want others to worry that I disappeared

334
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,840
So

335
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,880
can Auntie tell everyone

336
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,600
that I went out for work

337
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,800
and rarely visit here.

338
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,840
Please?

339
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,960
But Miss Dao...

340
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,960
If you don't agree

341
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,240
I will never visit here.

342
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,960
Miss Dao

343
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,520
how could you say this?

344
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,440
There's no way I can say no.

345
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,760
Fine.

346
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,760
I knew you would help me, Auntie!

347
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,440
I love you the most, Auntie Angkab.

348
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,280
How mischievous.

349
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,480
Yes, Mr. Nick?

350
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,880
Are you free this afternoon?

351
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,520
There's a client who wants to decorate her condominium

352
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,480
I want you to come meet her.

353
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,840
Of course. I was about to turn in my work.

354
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,280
I'll be there around two o'clock.

355
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,760
Okay, see you later.

356
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,400
See you later.

357
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,120
That's how relationship is

358
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,520
it's normal to argue or even break up.

359
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,760
What about you, Doctor?

360
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,760
Have you broken up with anyone?

361
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Well...

362
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,120
- Oops. - Oops.

363
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,200
Found a stump.

364
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,680
Sorry.

365
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,200
If you're still stressed out or unable to sleep.

366
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,440
I'll prescribe an antidepressant medicine for now.

367
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,000
Try taking it for a week.

368
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,880
Just talking to you today

369
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,560
made me feel a whole lot better.

370
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,200
But I wonder

371
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,400
if having a partner helps

372
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,120
please be my boyfriend, Doctor.

373
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
Please.

374
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,360
I handle this case

375
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,880
you can wait outside.

376
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,720
Doctor.

377
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
All in all

378
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,200
I'll prescribe the medicine for you, you can wait outside.

379
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,880
Waiting for someone who

380
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,080
doesn't care about you

381
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,720
is the same as waiting for a train

382
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,880
at a bus station.

383
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,360
Would you like to leave by yourself

384
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,320
or would you like me to send you off?

385
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,160
No need to get in the way.

386
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,240
- Doctor. - Yes?

387
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,680
My phone number is here.

388
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,840
You can call me anytime.

389
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,720
Please.

390
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,320
Sure.

391
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,320
Good thing you're still here.

392
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,720
Is there anything you want, Riga?

393
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,880
I have something to consult about.

394
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,400
Then sit here for a moment.

395
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
Not here.

396
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,440
I need your judgment

397
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,800
please come with me.

398
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,080
I'm not free.

399
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,800
Are you upset at me?

400
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,880
Is it about yesterday?

401
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,880
That's not it.

402
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,200
Then come with me.

403
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,040
You have to make up for your maid Faidam

404
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,360
for humiliating me yesterday.

405
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,680
Fine.

406
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,320
Brother usually return by now.

407
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,440
Perhaps he's stuck with a patient.

408
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
What a pity

409
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,920
he didn't get to meet you.

410
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,040
That's alright.

411
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,680
I can come by next time.

412
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,480
I can see you again, too.

413
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,640
You smooth talker.

414
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,640
Oh, Phon.

415
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,720
Did your brother say anything about Dao?

416
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,000
A little, probably because he didn't see her at Ubon Ratchathani.

417
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,800
He didn't meet her here in Bangkok as well?

418
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
Not yet.

419
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,360
No need to worry, Oab.

420
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,760
I will not allow brother

421
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,440
to chase other women.

422
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,760
But I wouldn't mind.

423
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,120
Dao isn't interested in him.

424
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,200
If he sees someone else

425
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,920
I can't blame him.

426
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,080
Why are guys always biased for each other?

427
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,760
They are betrothed

428
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,600
how can he see someone else.

429
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,960
Wait a minute, Phon.

430
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,400
My sister's at fault here.

431
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,560
If he wants to see someone else

432
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,080
I don't think he's wrong at all.

433
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,680
Please understand women.

434
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,960
Perhaps Dao has her own reason.

435
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,960
That's why she still doesn't marry him.

436
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,920
Probably an unreasonable reason.

437
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,200
Unreasonable?

438
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,240
Men are unreasonable for not understanding women.

439
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,760
You're the unreasonable one.

440
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
Phon.

441
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,720
Phon.

442
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,480
I'll be damned.

443
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,760
Not even my business.

444
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,480
You should decide for yourself

445
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,960
since it's your room.

446
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,480
But I want you to be involve in the design.

447
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,280
But it's your room.

448
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,120
I'm not going to live here.

449
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,680
I don't know your preference.

450
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,440
Since you're already here

451
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,520
please help me talk to the designer.

452
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,320
Please?

453
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,840
Let's go.

454
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,320
Dao, where are you?

455
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,160
I'm on my way.

456
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
Hurry.

457
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,040
The client is waiting.

458
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,640
Miss Riga has to film a drama afterward.

459
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,240
Mr. Nick

460
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,720
who is my client?

461
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,960
It's Miss Nattriga.

462
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,360
The rising star.

463
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,360
Aren't you overjoyed?

464
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,880
Having an actress as a client.

465
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,960
Hurry up and come.

466
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,760
Yes.

467
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,200
She's right around the corner.

468
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,040
Why is that crazy doctor there?

469
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,240
It's one thing if it's just Riga.

470
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,440
What should I do?

471
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,600
Wat!

472
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,960
Speak.

473
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,760
You must help me.

474
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,240
Help with what?

475
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,720
Always requesting for strange stuff.

476
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,680
I am at the office

477
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,920
and the doctor is there with Miss Riga.

478
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
And?

479
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,560
I'm in trouble if the doctor sees me.

480
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,120
Can you take him somewhere, anywhere?

481
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,920
Call Dr. Param after you hang up my call.

482
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,040
Please.

483
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,600
What do you expect me to do?

484
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,160
Hello, Dr. Param speaking.

485
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,960
Dr. Param, this is Auntie Ranee.

486
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,520
Yes, Auntie Ranee?

487
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,360
Wat is not feeling well.

488
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,880
What's wrong with Mr. Wat?

489
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,520
What is wrong with Wat...

490
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,600
What is wrong with Wat?

491
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,000
He's screaming and shouting.

492
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,000
I will kill you!

493
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,600
What should I do?

494
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,680
Doctor!

495
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,080
Okay, I'm on my way.

496
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,640
Doctor.

497
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,120
Where are you going?

498
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,520
I have an urgent matter.

499
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,880
Excuse me.

500
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,240
Wat!

501
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Wat!

502
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,720
Enough!

503
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,560
I've already hanged up.

504
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,240
Why didn't you tell me?

505
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,520
I parked the other way.

506
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,120
Too rushed that I forgot.

507
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,280
Thank you so much, Wat.

508
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,080
Miss Riga.

509
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,440
This is Miss Lomdao.

510
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,120
Out top interior designer.

511
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,320
Hello.

512
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,760
Then please take your time.

513
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,960
Sure.

514
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,840
Why did you arrive late?

515
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,320
You've ruined the appointment.

516
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,840
I had other business, sorry.

517
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,960
Did you think I wouldn't have one too?

518
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,520
I am a superstar.

519
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,440
I don't even have time to eat or sleep.

520
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,040
Having to wait for a third-rate designer like you is a waste of my time.

521
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,480
Superstar in front of Lumpini Park?

522
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,120
What do you mean?

523
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,440
You probably started out as an extra

524
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,880
you wish to upgrade yourself

525
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,200
to the top class actress.

526
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,000
But you can only be an

527
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,640
actress in front of a park.

528
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,120
Are you calling me an escort?

529
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
Yes, I am.

530
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,400
Save your hands for your work.

531
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,840
Don't use it to slap me.

532
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,280
Fine.

533
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,680
I'll tell your boss.

534
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,560
Print this for the client, they're waiting.

535
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,360
- Alright, I'll handle this for you. - Okay.

536
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,120
Mr. Nick, how could you hire someone like this here?

537
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,080
What happened?

538
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,800
She called me an escort.

539
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,600
That's right, I said it.

540
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,480
Go ahead and keep someone like this to scare off clients.

541
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,160
But I will never pay for someone like her.

542
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,000
Miss Dao, what happened?

543
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,680
She called me a third-rate interior designer.

544
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,200
Not to worry.

545
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,160
I lost a client

546
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,320
I'll find another for you.

547
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,520
Excuse me.

548
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,240
Yes.

549
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,680
Mom.

550
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,080
You're as good as an Hollywood actress.

551
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,400
Hey, when you were on the phone

552
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,360
I was completely absorbed.

553
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,200
Excellent performance.

554
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,520
Wat.

555
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,360
How long are you going to make me lie to everyone like this?

556
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,360
If Dr. Param came here what should we do?

557
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,120
- Oh no! - Oh no!

558
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,360
Where are you going?

559
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,720
Away from Dr. Param

560
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,120
in case he catches me.

561
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,240
Good bye, mom.

562
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,040
How is Mr. Wat doing?

563
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,800
Oh, you see...

564
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,440
I'll go look for him.

565
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,800
Please hold on.

566
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,360
Mr. Wat might get worse if we don't act now.

567
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,240
Well

568
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,800
He's fine now.

569
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,600
He already left for work.

570
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,560
But he had a seizure.

571
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,000
He's fine now and left for work?

572
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,040
Yes.

573
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,800
Perhaps a spirit possessed him.

574
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,800
When Mr. Wat is free he can come in for an examination at the hospital.

575
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
Thank you.

576
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,840
- Please call me if anything comes up. - Thank you.

577
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,400
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

578
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,120
I'm really sorry, Doctor.

579
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,440
Dao, Wat.

580
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,160
What are you guys doing?

581
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,040
I am so unlucky today.

582
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,560
Whose car is that?

583
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,240
Why he is back so early?

584
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,760
He didn't see me.

585
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,320
Faidam.

586
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,160
Where did she fool around this time.

587
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,880
Oh, Param.

588
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,200
- You're back. - Yes.

589
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,120
What would you like to eat? I'll cook for you.

590
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,560
It's okay, mom.

591
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,920
Faidam can do the cooking.

592
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,880
Faidam has diarrhea since this morning.

593
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,920
She won't be able to cook.

594
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,680
Just tell me what you want to eat

595
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,760
I'll cook it.

596
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,400
Diarrhea since this morning?

597
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,120
But it's evening now.

598
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,320
She's still not better?

599
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,800
Hey, Taew.

600
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,160
Is Faidam better now?

601
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,880
Not yet.

602
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,360
Doctor!

603
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,600
Where are you going?

604
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,560
I'm taking Faidam to the hospital.

605
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,480
Right! I am coming with you.

606
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,840
Doctor!

607
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,600
Doctor!

608
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,640
Goodness, Doctor!

609
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,080
- Are you stopping me? - Huh?

610
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,680
No!

611
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,680
Give me the key.

612
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,520
Give me.

613
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,080
You're stopping me because Faidam isn't home, is she?

614
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,480
Faidam ditched work didn't she?

615
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,960
Give me the key, hurry.

616
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,840
Yes...

617
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,240
I'm dead meat.

618
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
Here she is.

619
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,440
She's resting here.

620
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,680
How can you tell that this really is Faidam?

621
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,440
If not Faidam then who is it?

622
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,600
A body pillow.

623
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,320
What made you think so?

624
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,320
I just saw Faidam

625
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,520
hanging around Mr. Songsawat's house.

626
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,640
How is that possible.

627
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,920
Faidam has diarrhea since this morning.

628
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,440
Faidam.

629
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,640
Doctor.

630
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,880
What do you need me for?

631
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,640
Mom said you have diarrhea since this morning?

632
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,480
That's correct, Doctor.

633
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,960
But right now, I am okay.

634
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,280
But you look terrible.

635
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,840
Let me take you to the hospital.

636
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,760
Hospital?

637
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,520
I'm all good now, Doctor.

638
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,560
I'm completely healed now.

639
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,400
How could that be?

640
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,320
Let's go to the hospital, go.

641
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,480
Doctor!

642
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,080
Doctor! Let go of me!

643
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,320
It's coming out, Doctor!

644
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,120
- What's coming out? - Poop.

645
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,800
Didn't you say you're all better now?

646
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,960
I am completely pain free

647
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,880
totally fine now.

648
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,120
If you feel pain then

649
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,760
you need to go see a doctor.

650
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,640
Go.

651
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,760
Let go of me, Doctor!

652
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,080
Release me!

653
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,440
I don't want you to die inside my house.

654
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,560
You're already this scary as a human

655
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,360
if you were a ghost my mom and I would've abandon the house.

656
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,720
Hey!

657
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,560
I wouldn't die so easily.

658
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,960
The reason you won't release me

659
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,560
because you want to carry me

660
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,560
you want to be close to me, am I right?

661
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,160
Could it be that

662
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,640
you want to bite my lips?

663
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,560
So you won't put me down.

664
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,280
If that's the case

665
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,360
you should've told me directly, Doctor.

666
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,640
Hey, be straightforward.

667
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,320
I will jump for your lips and bite it

668
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,360
it'll be even hotter than Miss Ega.

669
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,680
- Really? - Yes.

670
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,680
Fine.

671
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,160
Doctor!

672
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,640
Why did you drop me?

673
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,320
So you will know

674
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,640
that I

675
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,640
am not interested in you.

676
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,080
- Why aren't you guys on the way to the hospital yet? - Because

677
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,320
Faidam is all better now

678
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,960
but Doctor doesn't believe me.

679
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,400
You're becoming more mischievous every day.

680
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Hey.

681
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,320
I think Doctor doesn't believe in your acting.

682
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,360
You're becoming more mischievous every day.

683
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,880
Look, Doctor won't catch me.

684
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,880
Believe me.

685
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,480
He's just saying it.

686
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,280
Faidam.

687
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,000
What happened?

688
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,280
Why is there a white smudge on you face?

689
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,280
Look.

690
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,360
Where?

691
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,360
- Here. - Here?

692
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
Yeah.

693
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,200
It's a big white mark like fungus.

694
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,240
- Son. - Yes?

695
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,800
Are you really not taking

696
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,400
Faidam to the hospital?

697
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,920
She's that mischievous

698
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,080
I think she's fine.

699
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,640
How is Faidam mischievous.

700
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,920
Nothing.

701
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,600
But I think it's better if you

702
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,920
keep an eye on her.

703
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,400
I don't think she's ordinary.

704
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,520
Of course she's not ordinary

705
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,680
because she's not right in the head.

706
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I think

707
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
she's a looney.

708
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,840
Anyhow

709
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,240
as they say "don't fuss over a crazy person."

710
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,120
Okay.

711
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,480
Oh! hey!

712
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,280
What happen to your shirt?

713
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,600
Why is there a black smudge?

714
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,560
Did he see it?

715
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,560
If he sees it

716
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,760
I'm in trouble.

717
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
Nice.

718
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,720
His shirt.

719
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,440
I need to quickly wash that shirt.

720
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,080
Where was this from?

721
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,840
When did I dirty it?

722
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,440
He's not here, what a relief.

723
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,640
What are you planning to do to me?!

724
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,600
I should be the one asking you that how did you enter my room?

725
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,360
I came to tidy your room

726
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,440
and

727
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,160
take your dirty clothes to wash.

728
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,840
Doctor!

729
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,680
You can't do this, Doctor!

730
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,880
Doctor!

731
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,320
Did you say earlier

732
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,720
if I tell you upfront...

733
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,680
No.

734
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,920
I didn't say that, Doctor.

735
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,960
Hey.

736
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,160
I'm dressed up now.

737
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,840
I am not going to do anything to you.

738
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,560
Do whatever you need to do.

739
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,560
How can a shirt

740
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,640
almost made me lose my virginity.

741
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,920
I made this myself.

742
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,920
Really? Looks pretty good.

743
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,720
Oh! Oab, you're back.

744
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,880
Hello, mom, grandma, dad.

745
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,720
Of course he's back.

746
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,160
How would he be standing here otherwise?

747
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,040
Could it be Oab's spirit?

748
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,240
Again.

749
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,800
That's right.

750
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,880
I am actually a spirit.

751
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,600
Hey, how is this fun?

752
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,400
What nonsense are you doing? His dad is at fault here.

753
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,040
Please don't be angry, I miss you so much.

754
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,800
Don't bother.

755
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,720
Who jokes about things like death?

756
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,080
It doesn't matter if you're playing or not.

757
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,160
Answer me.

758
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,320
What's up?

759
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,960
Did Angkab tell you if Dao went to see her or not?

760
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,280
Well... I didn't go to Auntie Angkab's house.

761
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,280
Why?

762
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,600
I told you to go there.

763
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,840
Why are you so sloppy?

764
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,880
Grandma.

765
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,280
Please calm down.

766
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,680
I didn't go to see Auntie Angkab because

767
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,120
I found this at Dr. Param's house.

768
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,400
- What? - What's that notebook?

769
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,000
It's Dao's recipe book.

770
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,840
(Food recipe.)

771
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,520
(Stir-fried crab with curry powder.)

772
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,480
It's true.

773
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,400
This is Dao's handwriting.

774
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,720
What is it doing at Dr. Param's house?

775
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,880
That's right.

776
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,840
Could Dr. Param mistakenly take the notebook home?

777
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,960
Huh?

778
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,840
My future husband, Dr. Param,

779
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,120
is inviting me to move into his house.

780
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,240
(Next episode.)

781
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,280
Isn't she moving in here?

782
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,840
Riga is moving into my house?

783
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,080
But I didn't say it to the media.

784
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,360
I recall someone else at the scene.

785
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,760
Who?

786
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,120
That foul mouth interior designer, Lomdao.

787
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,840
Who has a foul mouth?!
