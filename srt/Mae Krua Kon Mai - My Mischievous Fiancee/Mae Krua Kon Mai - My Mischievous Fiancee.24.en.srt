1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,800
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,920
No need to be scared of me.

3
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,280
There's a clinic nearby here. I'll take you there.

4
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,240
(Previously...)

5
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,800
Lomdao?

6
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,480
Go pack your things.

7
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,040
And get out of this house.

8
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,120
You don't need to find an excuse to not marry Param anymore.

9
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,360
Even if you want to marry him now,

10
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,720
I will no longer allow it.

11
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,080
I am in Bangkok now.

12
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,880
Huh? You...

13
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,560
You're already in Bangkok?

14
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,240
Please marry me.

15
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,960
- Can you take me to Max's condominium? - Sure.

16
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,160
Dao!

17
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,360
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

18
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,840
I heard you're back so I want to see you.

19
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,920
I'm sorry...

20
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,880
that things have become this way.

21
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,120
I understand.

22
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,480
Your family wants you to get married.

23
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,760
That's why I decided to come back before you do.

24
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,240
So, I don't have to see you're dating someone else.

25
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Why did you come here?

26
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,240
To say yes for his proposal.

27
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,440
I was in the shower.

28
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,800
There's something I need to talk about.

29
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,520
And I don't want to wait until tomorrow.

30
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,120
Then, please come inside first.

31
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,280
Have a seat here, Honey.

32
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,680
I'll go get changed then I'll be back soon.

33
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,720
- Okay. - Alright.

34
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,320
You use this kind of bag now?

35
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,640
Honey.

36
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
What's the matter?

37
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,840
I...

38
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,160
I don't want to wait until tomorrow.

39
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,680
I want to give an answer that you asked me in the garden.

40
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,680
I'll marry you.

41
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,520
Honey.

42
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,320
Back then in the garden...

43
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,240
you made me feel so uneasy.

44
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,120
I'll come back in a bit.

45
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,480
Why does he leave it here?

46
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,720
He's used to wear only boxers.

47
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,280
You said you don't like this kind.

48
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,080
When I arrived,

49
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,320
were you really in the shower?

50
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
Yes.

51
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,680
You saw me,

52
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,360
I was in a towel.

53
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,360
Then, whose is this?

54
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,960
Well, I...

55
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,480
Dao.

56
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,240
Please listen to me, Dao.

57
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,880
Dao.

58
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,920
Listen to me, Dao.

59
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,280
Dao.

60
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,160
This underwear isn't mine.

61
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,120
I really don't know how it got here.

62
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
Really.

63
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Dao.

64
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
Dao.

65
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,520
Dao...

66
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,760
Dao!

67
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,520
You...

68
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,080
It seems like before I arrived,

69
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,680
you were really in the shower.

70
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,080
Mr. Atsawin.

71
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,480
For your underwear,

72
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,920
you can get it from Max.

73
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,760
I'm sorry, Win.

74
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
Dao!

75
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,400
Why isn't anything going the way I expected?

76
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
Taxi.

77
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,880
Taxi! Taxi!

78
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,640
Get in.

79
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
Hey.

80
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,200
If you don't get in now, he'll be here soon.

81
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
Let's go.

82
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Get in.

83
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,160
Dao!

84
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,760
Dao! Dao!

85
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,120
Dao, please let me explain.

86
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,880
Dao, please listen to me.

87
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,120
- Dao! Dao! - Just go, Doctor.

88
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,160
Dao! Dao!

89
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,640
Dao! Dao! Dao! Just listen to me please! Dao!

90
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,400
Are you okay?

91
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,640
How did you get there?

92
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,640
To be honest?

93
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,400
I'm not trying to annoy you.

94
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,160
I just want to know if...

95
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,000
you asked because you really want to know or...

96
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,000
you asked just to kill sometimes,

97
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,160
that we're here together.

98
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,600
I do want to know.

99
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,400
I followed you there ever since you left with Mr. Wat.

100
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,040
Why?

101
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,240
I want to know where you two were going.

102
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,920
(Uncle To's wonton noodles)

103
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,320
What do you want?

104
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,560
You can go to sleep.

105
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,640
I'll wake you up when we arrive.

106
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,680
Welcome to call back service.

107
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,320
Welcome to call back service.

108
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,800
Welcome to call back...

109
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,240
Why haven't you come home yet, Dao?

110
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,400
What's wrong, Wat?

111
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,520
Dao told me dropped her off at Max's room.

112
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,920
She said she'll come home but she isn't here.

113
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,120
Then make a call and ask if she was staying over at Max's room.

114
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,440
I called hundred times, I couldn't get a hold of her since last night.

115
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,080
She would've told us if she stayed overnight.

116
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,280
You're right. Dao isn't irresponsible.

117
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
Right?

118
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Mr. Wat.

119
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,960
Someone's here to see you. It's urgent matter.

120
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,080
I never have any business before 10 am.

121
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,400
Tell them to leave first.

122
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
He's a man.

123
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,320
A man?

124
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,760
A handsome one.

125
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,000
Keep it together.

126
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,280
You're crazy!

127
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,840
Here's some water.

128
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,800
Mr. Wat.

129
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,880
Once you see a handsome man,

130
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,880
you're all happy and smile.

131
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,960
That's crazy.

132
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,120
Is it obvious?

133
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,240
Not at all.

134
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,240
- Go. - Of course.

135
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,680
I want to know where Dao is.

136
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,880
Well, last night she went to see you.

137
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,240
She came there then she ran away afterwards.

138
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,240
I can't contact her.

139
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,960
I don't know what to do that's why I'm here.

140
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,120
But if she's not with you,

141
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,560
where is she now?

142
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,240
I'm sorry that I take you here.

143
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,560
I should thank you for bringing me here.

144
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,360
So,

145
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,280
why didn't you wake me up?

146
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,200
I was afraid you wouldn't stay.

147
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,600
So, did you have a fight with your boyfriend?

148
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,680
He proposed to marry me.

149
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,240
What was your answer?

150
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,320
I...

151
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,280
I went to see him.

152
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,640
To...

153
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,760
To say yes.

154
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,800
Did you tell him?

155
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,480
I wanted to give him a surprise.

156
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,720
But I was the one surprised.

157
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,960
Do you know what I saw?

158
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,120
I saw a man,

159
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,840
who is my boyfriend's boyfriend.

160
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,040
A man?

161
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,440
Boyfriend's boyfriend?

162
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,120
We've dated for years but I had never suspected...

163
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,480
that my boyfriend was gay.

164
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,880
You're not sad?

165
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,760
You're still laughing.

166
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,960
At first,

167
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,640
I was shocked.

168
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,800
But whether or not I'm sad.

169
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,760
I don't feel sad at all.

170
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,960
I'm actually relieved.

171
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,080
Because I don't love him anymore.

172
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,280
I love the man...

173
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,040
who's standing right in front of me now.

174
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,400
Then...

175
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,840
why did you still go to say yes to Max's proposal?

176
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,280
Because it's impossible between us.

177
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,440
Even though I know...

178
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,720
you aren't going to marry me for my money

179
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,440
and Riga isn't your woman,

180
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,920
but...

181
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,560
your mom hates me.

182
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,240
Never mind a wedding.

183
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,360
Right now, walking into your house without getting

184
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,840
kicked out by your mom won't be easy.

185
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,440
Hey, Doctor.

186
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,240
I already confessed.

187
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,840
Won't you say it as well?

188
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,680
If I didn't love you,

189
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,000
I wouldn't bring you here.

190
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,080
You just got here, please drink some water.

191
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,520
- Thanks. - Here.

192
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,400
Is something wrong? Why are you making that face?

193
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,080
What do you want me to do?

194
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,240
I came here from Ubon Ratchathani.

195
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,040
To give Pisamorn an apology

196
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,920
that my grandchild had humiliated everyone.

197
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,880
When are you going?

198
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,680
I can let Phon knows first.

199
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,280
I want to end this today or tomorrow.

200
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,360
I don't want things messy for too long.

201
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,600
Otherwise, we can't look at each other's faces.

202
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,160
Then, why not have something to eat first?

203
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,960
Take a rest from your journey.

204
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,040
Then you can go tomorrow, Grandma.

205
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,360
Sounds good.

206
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,280
I'll take my things upstairs first.

207
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,960
Yes, go ahead.

208
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,040
How is Young Miss?

209
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,040
Dao?

210
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,640
I'm not sure if she had repented or anything.

211
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,440
But I think she's good with Pisamorn,

212
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,040
that's why she's cared about her feelings.

213
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,560
Afraid Pisamorn will be sad about what she'd done.

214
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,960
I wonder if it's already too late.

215
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,280
Where's Param?

216
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,400
He hasn't come home since yesterday.

217
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,120
Is Taew's cooking not tasty?

218
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
I could...

219
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,760
make you a new one.

220
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,840
No need.

221
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,840
I'm full.

222
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,320
(Brother)

223
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,240
Brother! Where are you now?

224
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,160
You're with Miss Dao?

225
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,840
Okay, okay.

226
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,280
If you hear anything from Dao,

227
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,400
please let me know.

228
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,520
- Alright. - Thank you, if you'll excuse me.

229
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,640
- Bye. - Bye.

230
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,160
Is my gay radar broken?

231
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,120
Why didn't I notice that he likes men?

232
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,280
What a pity! He's handsome!

233
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,040
If you don't want Dao, you can have Watsy!

234
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,040
Am I not good looking?

235
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,840
Also, who did Dao went with?

236
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,520
Mr. Wat! Mr. Wat!

237
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
Yes?

238
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,440
Brother called me and asked me to see you,

239
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,280
to tell you Miss Dao is with him and not to worry.

240
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,040
She's with Doctor?

241
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,720
So, where are they now?

242
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,960
I didn't ask him but they'll be back in a couple days.

243
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,800
Does Madam know about this yet?

244
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,360
If she knows, we'll be in trouble.

245
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,000
I also wonder how Brother will handle Auntie's situation.

246
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,960
What the hell?

247
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,280
When family wants them to date, they don't.

248
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,760
But when family doesn't allow it, they fall in love.

249
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,280
Where did he go?

250
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,400
Are you done packing up?

251
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,760
I...

252
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
All done.

253
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,440
We should go for a walk.

254
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,360
Then come back for a meal.

255
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,360
I asked a worker to buy ingredients at the market.

256
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,640
We have to go get it first.

257
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,240
Then we can cook.

258
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,280
Okay then.

259
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,880
Why is your worker's place too far?

260
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,560
Actually, I wasn't done talking.

261
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,040
What do you mean?

262
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,760
I meant...

263
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,320
he's not a worker at my house

264
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,200
but a worker at the farm next door.

265
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,880
A farm next door.

266
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,920
We're practically crossing a mountain range!

267
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Well...

268
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,200
that sounds about right.

269
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,080
Why didn't we drive there?!

270
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,080
When will we be there by walking?

271
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,440
A farm next door is very far.

272
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,080
Well...

273
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,720
I want to spend this time with you.

274
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,760
There's...

275
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,680
just only two of us at home.

276
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,840
Even if we don't walk,

277
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,400
we'll be by ourselves anyway.

278
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,920
Don't want to walk?

279
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,280
What's wrong? Are your legs hurting?

280
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,880
I thought you're tired.

281
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,720
It's a piggyback ride.

282
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,240
Don't be so nice to me.

283
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,120
Why not?

284
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,680
I don't want to be hurt later on.

285
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,440
I will not hurt you.

286
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,840
Come on.

287
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,760
Here.

288
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,400
One, two, three!

289
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,320
- Thank you, Uncle Pon. - Thank you.

290
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,000
I forgot to mention... your girlfriend is very pretty.

291
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,840
He said you're pretty.

292
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,320
I know.

293
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,320
I'm starving and got tricked into walking too far.

294
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,600
You're being shy?!

295
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,000
Entrance is this way.

296
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,120
Here.

297
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,200
Who would've known?!

298
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,720
It's not my house!

299
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,240
Here, let me help.

300
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,640
Okay, then I'll go get the blanket.

301
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,520
You're so petite and don't have any strength? Let me help.

302
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,240
No need, I can do this myself.

303
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,440
You!

304
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,920
Why didn't you tell me you're going to pull?

305
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,560
And why are you laughing?

306
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,400
Hey, Doctor!

307
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,240
Doctor. Hey...

308
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,920
What are you doing?

309
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Doctor...

310
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,320
Did you call Wat for me?

311
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,560
I already did.

312
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,960
Do you know where Doctor is?

313
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,120
Hello, Auntie.

314
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,400
Have a seat.

315
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,880
You knew, didn't you?

316
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,240
You knew about her disguising herself.

317
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,600
Yes.

318
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,600
But...

319
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,400
she feels guilty.

320
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,440
Don't make excuses for your friend.

321
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,520
Last night, Param didn't come home.

322
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,160
So I want to know...

323
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,920
was Dao at your house last night?

324
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,000
If you're stuttering like this,

325
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,520
can I assume that...

326
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,920
those two left together?

327
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,680
Auntie.

328
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,080
I think Mr. Wat probably doesn't know either.

329
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,760
Hey.

330
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,720
You can cook?

331
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,000
I've stayed at the dormitory for years.

332
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,200
I'm a master at making noodles.

333
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,680
Instant noodles?

334
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,240
Anyone can make it delicious.

335
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,880
Thank you.

336
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,840
Once you taste it,

337
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,560
I guarantee you'll love it.

338
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,560
Oh, right.

339
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,320
Do you want to get married?

340
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,200
What?

341
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,880
I said, let's get married.

342
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,840
Why are you so surprised?

343
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,280
What are you thinking?!

344
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,000
It's not that I don't want to marry you.

345
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,240
But your mom doesn't like me,

346
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,920
she doesn't want to see my face.

347
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,440
How could we get married?

348
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,520
You're proposing while eating noodles?

349
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,720
Not romantic.

350
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,960
Your hand.

351
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,080
Let's go.

352
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,080
Come.

353
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,280
Come on.

354
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,080
Will you marry me?

355
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,040
Before I know it,

356
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,080
I had already fallen for my petite cook.

357
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,960
No idea when it happened.

358
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,120
You make me happy,

359
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,360
make me smile.

360
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,440
From now on,

361
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,200
let me make you happy.

362
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,440
If we encounter any problem, we'll help each other through.

363
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,080
And I promise,

364
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,280
I will love you,

365
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,400
and care for you the best I can.

366
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,920
I promise,

367
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,320
I'll become your happiness.

368
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,280
And even in hard times,

369
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,360
I'll be beside you.

370
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,520
Does that mean...

371
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,400
you will marry me?

372
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,760
Yes, I will!

373
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,960
Do you think Madam will allow it?

374
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,600
Grandma, why do you wake up so early?

375
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,600
I couldn't sleep.

376
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,120
I'll be honest with you.

377
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,320
I still don't know how to handle Dao's situation.

378
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,000
I know Pisamorn is probably devastated

379
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,600
that knowing Dao had deceived her all along.

380
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,880
But I believe that...

381
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,880
for someone at your level,

382
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,040
you'll handle it just fine.

383
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,120
How can I?

384
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,960
You knew,

385
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,520
I was the one who went to Pisamorn

386
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,680
and asked for her son to engage to Dao.

387
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,920
I think Dr. Param is a good man

388
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,960
so I want him to get together with my grandchild.

389
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,840
I'm fear no one will look after her.

390
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,560
Then, look what happened.

391
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:45,840
But, I do remember the day you met her at the orphanage.

392
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,120
Back then, I could only send her money to support her studies.

393
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,160
Pisamorn is a good person.

394
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,840
So she had a good husband,

395
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,640
and a good son.

396
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,080
Her marriage and family life is happy.

397
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,640
I want Dao to be happy like that,

398
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,200
I can be at peace.

399
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,200
Brother.

400
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,040
Do you think Miss Dao can face Auntie?

401
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,040
I'm not sure either.

402
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,760
But if it was Faidam,

403
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,280
Mom will soften up eventually.

404
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,840
Taew!

405
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,280
Phon!

406
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:39,040
It's late! Why haven't anyone set up the table for breakfast?!

407
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,480
Taew!

408
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,920
Taew!

409
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,080
It's done!

410
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,200
Here you go, Madam.

411
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,240
Lomdao.

412
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,720
I made this, Madam so I guarantee it's delicious like before.

413
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,840
I'm so sorry, Madam.

414
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,320
(Next episode.)

415
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,360
Stop acting like Faidam,

416
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,400
and get out of my house now.

417
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,840
If you insist on getting married,

418
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,040
then you and I as mother and son are over!
