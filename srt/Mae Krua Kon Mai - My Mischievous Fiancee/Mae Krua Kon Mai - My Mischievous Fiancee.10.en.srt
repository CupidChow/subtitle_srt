1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
(My Mischievous Fiancee)

2
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,080
Grandma and Mr. Oab

3
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,040
They're suspicious of what you're doing.

4
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,400
Miss Dao, you need to get here first.

5
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,960
You're still crippled.

6
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,560
You still want to go out and walk?

7
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,760
I'll drop you off.

8
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,360
Drop me off?

9
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,320
- Dr. Param took Faidam in his car. - Huh?

10
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,800
I didn't let you go by yourself

11
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,920
because I know you well.

12
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,360
So where do you want to go?

13
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,880
Then drive

14
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,480
I'll tell you the correct direction now.

15
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,000
Which way next?

16
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,400
Well...

17
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,360
What's your problem, Faidam?

18
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,760
What are you doing?

19
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,760
Well.

20
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,240
Can't you see that?

21
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,040
It says "do not overtake" on that bus.

22
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,120
That's for the bus. They can't overtake!

23
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
Oh.

24
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,120
I didn't know.

25
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm not very educated.

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,880
But it was written there,

27
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,320
I thought you would overtake it.

28
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,000
I think you don't want to be dropped off.

29
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,840
You're wrong!

30
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,840
Fine.

31
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,520
You don't want me to drop you off.

32
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,600
Get out.

33
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,520
I don't care anymore.

34
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,680
Then...

35
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,760
I'll get going.

36
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,720
On the way back,

37
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,000
I'll get some tasty food from the temple home.

38
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,600
I'll get extra for you.

39
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,960
So Madam can be full.

40
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,080
How about two each?

41
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,000
You get two, she gets two.

42
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,200
I'll make sure of that. Bye now!

43
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,800
Do you think I'm so stupid?

44
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,640
If he finds out she's not just some cook,

45
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,000
what would you do then Mr. Wat?

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,120
You're right.

47
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,760
That means you two must help me.

48
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Sure.

49
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,120
Jeez!

50
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,040
Absolutely Mr. Wat!

51
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,920
We will both help Faidam

52
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,480
to the best of our abilities.

53
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,320
Isn't that right, baby?

54
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
Yes, baby.

55
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,560
You got Parkinson's?

56
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
No.

57
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,400
Mr. Wat!

58
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,000
I've got myself a girlfriend.

59
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,640
So I need to treat her to good food.

60
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,400
Movie dates.

61
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,520
And so on!

62
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,800
Right?

63
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,920
You two are becoming like Madam Pisamorn everyday.

64
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,520
Thank you.

65
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,600
Faidam is a student studying...

66
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,640
Buab! Keep it shut!

67
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,440
-Faidam is a stude... - Buab!

68
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,800
- Red bill isn't working! - Right.

69
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,200
Doctor...

70
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,680
Oh, thank you so much!

71
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,160
Enough.

72
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,800
Where is everyone?

73
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,680
Faidam!

74
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,120
Taew!

75
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,040
Faidam!

76
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,120
Taew! Faidam!

77
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,640
Madam!

78
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,160
- Hey! - Yes?

79
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,600
Where were you?

80
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,440
I've been yelling until my throat hurts.

81
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,840
Just went out for a stroll.

82
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,040
And Faidam?

83
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,280
Didn't you let her go outside?

84
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,920
Right! That's true.

85
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,040
Who will cook then?

86
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,360
Miss Phon.

87
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,960
No! Every time she cooks,

88
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,680
it's a waste of money!

89
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,360
It's like I'm eating fancy food in the city.

90
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,000
It's alright.

91
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,320
I'll take care of it.

92
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,760
You can just relax and watch some TVs, okay?

93
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,120
Hey.

94
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,120
Make it delicious and worth every penny.

95
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,720
Okay.

96
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,040
Just like making rice congee...

97
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,800
That was close Faidam!

98
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,840
You left the box open!

99
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,120
I know every woman are pretty.

100
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,520
you'll get caught!

101
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,080
I'm cleaning up your mess.

102
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,160
Look at this.

103
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,000
You got the protagonist like me all tired.

104
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,160
If it wasn't for the money...

105
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
Dude!

106
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,680
What an awful driver.

107
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,920
Now I'm stuck.

108
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,240
Where did she go?

109
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,640
She must be here.

110
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,120
Is he still following me?

111
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,280
Where did she go?

112
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,000
Time to confess.

113
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,800
Where are you doing?

114
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,960
Doing what I think is right.

115
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,080
But others might not like it.

116
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,600
Like getting a therapy at Tham Krabok?

117
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,840
Grandma!

118
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,400
Do you think people are stupid

119
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,840
enough to buy this kind of lie?

120
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,800
You're awful.

121
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,160
Do you know how worried everyone is?

122
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,800
I don't want them to be worried while I'm gone.

123
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,880
Don't you think they would be even more worried,

124
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,920
when they heard you're a drug addict?

125
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,400
Think before you act.

126
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,040
When she found out,

127
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,800
she was shocked and almost fainted.

128
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,960
I don't want to marry Dr. Param.

129
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,160
I know you don't want to.

130
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,480
I simply want you to get to know him, that's all.

131
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,640
Then you'll know whether or not you like him.

132
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,920
But you went missing instead.

133
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,360
Won't you give him a chance?

134
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,720
If you two talk, you'll get to know

135
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,560
how interesting and nice he is.

136
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,400
I'm not making you marry some kind of player.

137
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,200
But I know him better than you.

138
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,760
Better than Oab.

139
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,920
Better than everyone that wants me to marry him.

140
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,400
I know he's a selfish man.

141
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,440
He already has a woman.

142
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,000
But still wants to marry another

143
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,480
because he wants a rich wife.

144
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,160
But most importantly,

145
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,440
he doesn't want to marry me either.

146
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,240
How do you know he doesn't want to?

147
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,040
Well...

148
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,280
If you want to know why

149
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,840
you can ask you best friend yourself.

150
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,600
I'm sure he'll be straightforward with you.

151
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,160
That's all I wanted to say.

152
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,840
I'll be on my way.

153
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,240
Goodbye.

154
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,640
This troublemaker.

155
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,680
Grandma. Don't you think

156
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,760
it sounds like she's living with him?

157
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,360
My thoughts exactly.

158
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,160
Call Pisamorn.

159
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,160
Sure.

160
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
Tomorrow,

161
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,760
I'll have Faidam prepare tasty dishes for you.

162
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,240
I'll also tell Param to stay so you can meet him.

163
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
Yes.

164
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,720
See you tomorrow, Grandma.

165
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,960
You're back.

166
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,800
Is there a problem?

167
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,280
You look troubled.

168
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,720
It's not a big deal.

169
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,440
Phon isn't home yet?

170
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,360
She said she has to teach today so she'll be late.

171
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,520
But Taew volunteered to cook instead.

172
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,960
Just wait a bit.

173
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,360
Taew!

174
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,680
Yes!

175
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,920
Set the table.

176
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,960
It's all done.

177
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,440
This way.

178
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,160
Ta dah!

179
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,560
What's this, Taew?

180
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,600
It's Pizza!

181
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,000
I ordered it myself.

182
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,480
I made it a special. Extra bacon, extra sausage,

183
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,480
extra cheese and thick chewy dough.

184
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,640
This dinner will make you so full and bloated

185
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,000
like a sausage.

186
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,400
- Taew! - Yes?

187
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,120
This is your dinner?

188
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,720
Why is this happening?

189
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,280
Faidam. When are you coming back?

190
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,040
You like it, Doctor?

191
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,840
If I knew you were waiting for my food

192
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,760
I wouldn't have gone somewhere else.

193
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,200
Stop talking

194
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,320
and starting cooking!

195
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,880
I'm starving!

196
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,040
Right away Madam.

197
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
Here.

198
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,840
- Here you go. - Take this.

199
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,720
Is this a tip?

200
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
As if!

201
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,760
It's for tomorrow's groceries.

202
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,080
What do want for tomorrow then?

203
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,080
You even give me two hundred.

204
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,960
Tomorrow,

205
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,000
A special guest will be coming over.

206
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,360
I'm guessing they must be very special.

207
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,480
Otherwise,

208
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,600
you wouldn't invest this much.

209
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,240
If I want her granddaughter,

210
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,840
all the more reason to invest!

211
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,760
Who could be that special?

212
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,480
Grandma Pathum.

213
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,480
Lomdao's grand...

214
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
Hey!

215
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,320
Why did you drop my spatula!

216
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,320
I'm sorry, Madam!

217
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,520
It's all dirty now!

218
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,720
So clumsy!

219
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,320
Why do troubles keep coming my way?

220
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,720
What to do?

221
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,280
You're really asking for trouble.

222
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,240
I'm here to confide in you.

223
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,680
Not to be lectured by you.

224
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm running out of options.

225
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,400
So what?

226
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,080
You want me to tell Madam Pisamorn

227
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,360
that you're coming with me?

228
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,440
Can you?

229
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,440
I guess.

230
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,760
If you think you can get away with that.

231
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,760
Then okay.

232
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,520
Thank you! You're the cutest!

233
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,240
Sure.

234
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,120
Interior sketches.

235
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,560
Here...

236
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,160
your purse.

237
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,320
Going this far?

238
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,800
You think others are that stupid?

239
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,920
I have to leave.

240
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
Help me.

241
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,480
Wait! Come down.

242
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,200
Wat! What's going on?

243
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
Listen.

244
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Secrets can't be kept forever.

245
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,880
If they catch on,

246
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,280
you'll be in trouble.

247
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,600
Thanks. I'll be careful.

248
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Good luck.

249
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,280
- I'm going. - Okay.

250
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,720
Help me.

251
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,320
Slowly. My leg still hurts.

252
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,000
One, two, three!

253
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,200
Doctor!

254
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,600
Why are you standing in the dark?

255
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,560
Which boyfriend were you with this time?

256
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,120
Doctor. What are you talking about?

257
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,080
I asked. Which boyfriend were you with this time?

258
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,120
Hmm?

259
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,960
I'm a woman.

260
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,560
How could I say I have many boyfriends?

261
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,760
Pretty girl like me gets to choose.

262
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,920
I know every woman are pretty.

263
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,840
Pretty in their own way.

264
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,880
But more important than beauty,

265
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,960
is a good heart.

266
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,520
That's right!

267
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,720
I....

268
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,360
am pretty, smart, kind and loves children.

269
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,440
A true beauty queen.

270
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,840
Some are perfect in every way.

271
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,280
But fake.

272
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,080
Lies to themselves.

273
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,480
and to other people.

274
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
Sure.

275
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,120
Who could be rich and smart

276
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,080
like your girlfriend, Miss Ega?

277
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,480
There is.

278
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,640
My fiancee.

279
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,800
But it's a pity.

280
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,640
I don't fancy her.

281
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,040
Why are you upset?

282
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,240
I'm talking about her,

283
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,240
not you.

284
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,080
Or do you know Lomdao?

285
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
No.

286
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,680
I don't know Miss Lomdao.

287
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,880
I've never met her.

288
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,200
I just pity her.

289
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,120
A good woman like Miss Lomdao

290
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,760
is engaged to someone

291
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,520
who doesn't appreciate her worth!

292
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
Faidam!

293
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,440
Doesn't appreciate her worth?

294
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,720
Is this how you'll play,

295
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,600
Lomdao?

296
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,600
Grandma!

297
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,760
Are you aiming for the Olympics?

298
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,920
Get up!

299
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,760
I thought you were doing boxing?

300
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,840
Why did you kick me?

301
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,280
Why does it have to be me?

302
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,920
Well, who should it be?

303
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,240
Angkab?

304
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,320
Oh.

305
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,000
Grandma.

306
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,280
Pretend I'm not here.

307
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,440
Here's the water.

308
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,680
Enjoy.

309
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,240
She took off.

310
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,920
Nobody wanted to be your training partner.

311
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,800
You punch like Khaosai.

312
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,960
It's just me left.

313
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,400
When well someone replace me?

314
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,920
I have an idea!

315
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,160
You want to go again?

316
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
No?

317
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,320
Grandma!

318
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,440
A nuisance in my granddaughter's life.

319
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,040
Let me ask you something.

320
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,000
Do you hate me?

321
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,280
Hey!

322
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,280
What happened to your face?

323
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,440
It was your kick!

324
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,480
Is this necessary?

325
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,920
Of course!

326
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,600
You see.

327
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,720
Know thyself, know thy enemy.

328
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,480
A thousand battles, a thousand victories.

329
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,400
Come on.

330
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,000
Go change. Get a new one!

331
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,080
- You want a new one? - Yeah!

332
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,280
I have to train! Train!

333
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,880
Come. Hurry.

334
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,960
Hold still.

335
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,720
- Hold it tight. - Be gentle Grandma.

336
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,720
Hold it tight!

337
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,840
Take that!

338
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,760
That's what I'm talking about.

339
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,200
If that's the real one.

340
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,760
My win!

341
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,480
Pick up the pace. How are you doing?

342
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,440
Still washing the vegetables?

343
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,200
You want it clean. I'm already rushing.

344
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,040
Wasting so much water.

345
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,560
You're not done with the seafood?

346
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,560
My goodness.

347
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,200
I'm boiling them Madam.

348
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,880
Will this before in time

349
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,960
to welcome Grandma Pathum?

350
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,440
Madam.

351
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,000
Actually...

352
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,440
After I'm done.

353
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,920
May I go over to Mr. Wat's

354
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,520
Again! Mr. Wat's house again!

355
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,120
Did he forget that I'm the one paying your salary?

356
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,360
I'm reaching my limit.

357
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,720
If he keeps calling you over like this,

358
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,520
I'll make him pay your salary!

359
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,000
Yes, Madam.

360
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,920
I'll tell him that.

361
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,240
Thank you so much!

362
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,960
But I won't let you.

363
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,480
Why is it, Doctor?

364
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,000
Riga is coming over today.

365
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,120
I want you to take care of her.

366
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,320
What?

367
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,240
I invited her over today.

368
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,400
Why?

369
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,960
I won't let her.

370
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,040
I didn't invite her!

371
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,640
But I already did.

372
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,720
(Riga)

373
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,920
She must be almost here.

374
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,120
Then she can find her way back.

375
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,960
Hello, Riga.

376
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,080
I'm on my way.

377
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,200
Oh my God!

378
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,880
Come here you two!

379
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,840
You need to do whatever you can,

380
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,320
and keep that Riga from meeting Grandma Pathum.

381
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,400
Understood?

382
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,160
Got it.

383
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,680
Where are you going?

384
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,040
Going over to Mr. Songsawat's?

385
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,600
I already got Madam's permission.

386
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,760
But I heard that

387
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,240
Mom told you to take care of Riga.

388
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,000
Doctor.

389
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,080
Are you deaf?

390
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,200
She told me to stop Miss Riga

391
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,960
from entering the house at all costs.

392
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,920
Then do what she told you to.

393
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,160
Doctor!

394
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,960
Where are you going?

395
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
Wait!

396
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,800
Doctor! Where are you going?

397
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
Won't you greet the guests?

398
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,840
Why should I?

399
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,120
When I don't want to marry that Lomdao.

400
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,400
Therefore,

401
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,000
I don't need to see her family.

402
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,880
Alright. Don't ask.

403
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,760
Your job is to follow Mom's orders.

404
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,360
Got it?

405
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,360
You think I'll believe you?

406
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,480
Just you wait.

407
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,320
I'll take that Riga to Grandma and Oab.

408
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,440
They'll finally know that

409
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,440
he already has a girlfriend.

410
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,280
Doctor.

411
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,840
Go all out, Riga.

412
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,280
Show everyone that I'm going to marry you.

413
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,840
Sure.

414
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,800
Everyone will know you won't marry Lomdao

415
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,520
but you will marry me.

416
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,720
What are you doing?

417
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,400
- Getting rid of filth before it enters! - Taew!

418
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,080
It's Madam's order!

419
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,040
Taew! Stop right there!

420
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,920
Open the door!

421
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,760
She won't let you inside!

422
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,760
Please go home!

423
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,720
Hey! I'll tell Doctor to cut your salary!

424
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,240
Open the door right now!

425
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,600
Taew! Come back!

426
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,160
Come back and open the door! Taew!

427
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,720
Open the door fo...

428
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,680
What are you doing?

429
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,800
I'm taking you inside.

430
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,480
You already heard,

431
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,400
Madam forbids you from entering.

432
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,280
But if you want to enter and

433
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,040
show them you're Doctor's girlfriend,

434
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,440
follow me.

435
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,560
Don't touch me!

436
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,040
Quite stalling!

437
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,840
Hurry!

438
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
Faidam!

439
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,600
What did you stop?

440
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,400
There's something we must discuss first.

441
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,480
What is it?

442
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,440
If I help you,

443
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,760
you must help me in return.

444
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,240
Help with what?

445
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,200
Tell Madam you sent me to go and buy some things.

446
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,720
Why do I have to do that?

447
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,480
If you don't, I won't help you either.

448
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,080
Hey.

449
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,600
Alright.

450
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,600
First, take me inside.

451
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,040
Follow me.

452
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,760
What is it, Doctor?

453
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,960
Is Auntie Ranee home?

454
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,760
Yes she is. She and Mr. Wat are inside.

455
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,000
Please come in.

456
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,680
This way Grandma, Mr. Oab.

457
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,600
- Grandma. Hello! - Hello.

458
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,480
- Hello Auntie. - Hello.

459
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,600
- Please head inside. - Alright.

460
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,880
Make yourself comfortable.

461
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,160
Hey. Is she gone?

462
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,520
I did it.

463
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,080
She's soaking wet.

464
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,240
Serves her right!

465
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,480
She came asking for it!

466
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,480
You can dream on!

467
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,600
Excuse me.

468
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,160
Dr. Param is here to see you.

469
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,440
Hello.

470
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,040
Hello. What's the matter, Doctor?

471
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,480
I apologize for bothering you.

472
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,520
But may I observe something by the fence?

473
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,960
Why? What is going on?

474
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,840
Please.

475
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,560
Something must be happening

476
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,040
Of course, Mom.

477
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,760
You think someone like him

478
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,880
would just take a walk along the fence?

479
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,560
That's Faidam and Miss Riga.

480
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,760
- Wait! - Hurry, Miss ga!

481
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,920
Wait! Where are you going?

482
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,240
Where are you going?

483
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,880
Move aside, Buab!

484
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,840
How can I?

485
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,720
- Jeez! - Just stop!

486
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,040
I'm in a hurry.

487
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,680
How can I stop?

488
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,520
I'll talk to Mr. Wat. Don't worry!

489
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,520
Enough! Let's go!

490
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,680
Come on. I didn't say anything.

491
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,680
Where are you taking me?

492
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,320
Climb.

493
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,400
Climb the fence?

494
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Yes.

495
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,560
Just climb, Miss Riga.

496
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,080
Go.

497
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,520
You make me do something weird like this,

498
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,040
you must be planning something!

499
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,080
Don't you want to go inside?

500
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,880
If so, then climb.

501
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,640
Will you climb?

502
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,520
If you don't, you can't go in.

503
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,600
Smells nice.

504
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,160
Looks delicious.

505
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,920
Auntie.

506
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,080
Where is Phon?

507
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,120
I heard she's on her way here.

508
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,080
She wants to see Grandma and you.

509
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,200
She's probably close.

510
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,200
Don't worry.

511
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,840
Grandma, go ahead and eat first.

512
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,560
We can wait.

513
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,960
Speaking of the devil.

514
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,880
Phon.

515
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,880
Let me help.

516
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,840
Sit here then.

517
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,480
Hello, Grandma.

518
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,840
Come. Join us.

519
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,440
How does it taste?

520
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,280
This is cooked by my favorite cook.

521
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,000
Miss Ega. Will you climb or not?

522
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,160
If you won't, then go home.

523
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,160
Let them get married.

524
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,480
And you'll end up as an old maid.

525
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,480
Fine!

526
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,480
I'll climb!

527
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,120
Let's do it. Climb over!

528
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,200
Don't touch me!

529
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,160
Go! Move!

530
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,760
Go.

531
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,360
Can you manage? Here.

532
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,600
Find a place to hide Miss Riga.

533
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,000
Once you see an opportunity,

534
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,640
Make a grand debut as

535
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,360
Monthianrak's daughter-in-law!

536
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,600
I know what I'm doing!

537
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,920
Now Grandma and Oab

538
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,080
will finally see his girlfriend in person.

539
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,800
What, Buab?

540
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,280
Stop it!

541
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,840
Hey!

542
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,760
I'm busy! Stop bothering me!

543
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,840
What now Buab? I told you...

544
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,640
Doctor!

545
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,760
Yes, it's me.

546
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,080
It's so delicious.

547
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,360
She's got skills. Call her here. Let me see her.

548
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,560
Sure.

549
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,680
Faidam!

550
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,720
Oab.

551
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,320
Tastes like our home cooking.

552
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,640
- Faidam! - It might be Dao.

553
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,560
Really?

554
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,200
Taste it.

555
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,520
Hey Taew. Go get her.

556
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,320
I've been calling for her. Where is she?

557
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,480
Yeah, what's she doing?

558
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,800
Faidam isn't home.

559
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,160
I sent her off to buy some things.

560
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,560
Let me go, Doctor!

561
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,040
Where are you taking me?

562
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,960
Go home with me right now!

563
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,960
What's so scary?

564
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,520
I'm not!

565
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,880
If not, then go.

566
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,000
If you don't, I'll consider you a coward.

567
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Come here.

568
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,000
Come.

569
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,520
I already chased you away.

570
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,040
Who invited you in?

571
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,360
It's just...

572
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,360
Doctor, my boyfriend,

573
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,040
told me to join you for the meal, Mom.

574
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,920
Probably didn't know you have guests.

575
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,760
Don't you dare call me that.

576
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,240
I only have one child!

577
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,720
Taew.

578
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,440
Bring me a plate.

579
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,440
- Yes. - Don't!

580
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,480
Yes.

581
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,760
Phon, please introduce me the guests.

582
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,520
Sure.

583
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,400
That's Grandma Pathum,

584
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,800
And that's...

585
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,080
Oab.

586
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,240
I apologize.

587
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,760
I only know elites.

588
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,240
Not some country millionaires.

589
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,760
I'm not interested in you either.

590
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,400
Had you not shown up with no manners like this,

591
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,640
I wouldn't have wasted my breath on you.

592
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,840
I'm Doctor's girlfriend.

593
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,680
We plan on getting married.

594
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,800
Grandma!

595
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,080
Grandma!

596
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,960
But I don't want you as daughter-in-law!

597
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,760
That's what you say,

598
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,840
but Doctor wants me as his wife.

599
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,680
I suggest you talk to him again,

600
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,200
to update new information.

601
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,520
I heard Dr. Param has a girl

602
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,120
leeching off of him and never let go.

603
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,720
That must be you, isn't it?

604
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,680
What?

605
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,840
But if the man hates it,

606
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,440
he would do his very best

607
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,000
to get rid of that leech.

608
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,240
Isn't granddaughter actually

609
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,120
more of a leech than I am.

610
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,320
She still tries to cling onto him.

611
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,200
- Grandma, let's head back. - Let go.

612
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,680
- No! - We can come back later!

613
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,720
I won't go!

614
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,280
Today,

615
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,160
- let me slap that woman for once! - Grandma!

616
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,600
Grandma!

617
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,600
Grandma!

618
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,600
Grandma.

619
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,720
Save you energy for when you walk.

620
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,800
Pisamorn!

621
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,400
The fine is only

622
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,400
five hundred for

623
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,960
infinite slaps, right?

624
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,680
Stop Grandma!

625
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,680
I don't want to be regarded as

626
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,640
someone who bullies old people!

627
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,160
Ouch!

628
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,760
Bullies old people?

629
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,400
Again! Do it again!

630
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,000
Miss Riga! You should leave!

631
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,960
Please leave, Miss Riga. Go!

632
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,200
I guess I'll go.

633
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,000
Let me tell you...

634
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,160
I will not let go of Doctor.

635
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,800
Because we are both so in love with each other.

636
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,480
Oh.

637
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,200
Besides,

638
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,240
he doesn't want to marry that woman called

639
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,520
Lomdao.

640
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,280
I'll pay one thousa...

641
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,200
Grandma!

642
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,960
Don't! Grandma!

643
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,240
Let me go! Oab!

644
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,040
Are you on her side?

645
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,800
Grandma?

646
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,640
- You too? - Ouch!

647
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,960
Stop screaming!

648
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,320
Here you go.

649
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,320
Enough!

650
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Oab!

651
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,400
You touch me again, I'll kick your ass!

652
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,000
Doctor! Let me go!

653
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,800
- Don't be stubborn. Come here! - Let go!

654
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,240
What are you doing?

655
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,560
Madam help me! Help!

656
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,760
Doctor!

657
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,280
Can you do it?

658
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,600
I'll try.

659
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,280
If you can do it.

660
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,760
I guarantee you

661
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,040
your cousin-in-law won't be that woman

662
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,360
named Riga.

663
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,280
Madam!

664
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,000
Madam! Miss Phon! There's a problem!

665
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,520
Help me, Madam! He's gone crazy!

666
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,560
- Doctor! - Stop it, Param!

667
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,720
What's going on?

668
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,280
Hold on, Mom. I'll show you something good.

669
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,040
- Don't struggle! - He's trying to

670
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,360
get her to strip!

671
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,960
Are you crazy, Taew?

672
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,680
Phon. Call Oab and Grandma over.

673
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,280
They both left already.

674
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,160
What did you say?

675
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,120
Madam! Miss Phon! Help me!

676
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,080
He was splashing water on me out of nowhere.

677
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,080
I'm not a rabid dog, Madam.

678
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,960
Hey. What kind of play is this?

679
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,320
You're wasting water. Turn it off!

680
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,720
- Mom. - Do as I say!

681
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,760
Mom!

682
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,800
It's a waste!

683
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,400
- Inside! - But...

684
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,920
We need to talk!

685
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,200
Faidam?

686
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,880
- Hmm? - What happened?

687
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,920
That.

688
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,600
I guess he wanted to play.

689
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,160
- Why did you have to humiliate me? - What, Mom?

690
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,640
How could I live with this shame?

691
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,640
I'm sorry, Mom.

692
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
But...

693
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,160
I want Grandma Pathum to know

694
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,960
that I don't want to marry her granddaughter.

695
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,960
I already have a girlfriend.

696
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,680
And how do you know

697
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,520
that a woman like her

698
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,400
won't turn out to be a gold digger?

699
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,840
No, Mom.

700
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,400
If she knew we're broke,

701
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,080
plus a ton of debt,

702
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,320
she'll go running for sure.

703
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,160
Want me to prove?

704
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,120
Invite her over.

705
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,960
Give me the date.

706
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,160
I'll prove it to you.

707
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,720
I assure you

708
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,400
she'll want to break up.

709
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,720
Want to bet?

710
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,920
Oh my God! I think Dr. Param...

711
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,480
Stop! Taew!

712
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,560
Stop walking in around. I feel dizzy!

713
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,160
He's trying to give you a wash.

714
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,440
I think he knows something.

715
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,120
What you should do

716
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,920
is gather all the evidence

717
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,360
you need and finish the report

718
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,760
before he catches you!

719
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,200
Sounds good?

720
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,000
Thanks for the warning.

721
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,760
How's that?

722
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,800
Harder. Didn't you eat quite a lot?

723
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,000
Even harder?

724
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,640
- Yeah. - Alright.

725
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,880
Ow!

726
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,640
This part,

727
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,280
the tendon needs more pressure.

728
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,640
Let me know if it hurts.

729
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,560
Ow!

730
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,240
Phon!

731
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,680
Where did you go?

732
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,800
You bought so much

733
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,280
are you donating them or what?

734
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,360
These were on sale.

735
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,400
So I took the chance to do some shopping.

736
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,560
Here. This is for you.

737
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,120
Thanks, Phon.

738
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,960
And this

739
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,240
it's yours, Auntie!

740
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,840
Madam!

741
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,920
You're not going to complain?

742
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,240
It's on sale.

743
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,520
What's wrong with buying a few?

744
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,040
Right?

745
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,720
I'll put this away.

746
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,640
It's okay, Auntie.

747
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,360
I can put yours and Param's away.

748
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,920
It's alright. I can do it.

749
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,680
I want to check it out.

750
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,760
Faidam.

751
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,080
Help me put it away.

752
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,280
Of course.

753
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,400
Madam.

754
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,160
I'll take a break just for a moment.

755
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,080
I'll be back!

756
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,600
Here, Miss Phon.

757
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,040
Thanks.

758
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,400
Mom.

759
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,800
I'm going to change.

760
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,080
Today, I have presentation.

761
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,120
Go ahead.

762
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,200
Alright.

763
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,560
There must be an evidence

764
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,400
of the debt or something that I can use as proof.

765
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,880
Nothing.

766
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,040
The safe!

767
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,760
What's the pass code?

768
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,920
One, two...

769
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,960
Shoot! He's here!

770
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,680
Hey!

771
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,800
Why did you enter my room?

772
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,240
Doctor!

773
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,440
Doctor!

774
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,880
Please don't do this!

775
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,480
Just you wait.

776
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,400
I'll make a unforgettable meal for...

777
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,680
I'll make a unforgettable meal

778
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,120
for that crazy doctor!

779
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,960
Vegetable soup needs a bit of vinegar!

780
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,880
Taew, mustard.

781
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,720
Faidam.

782
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,320
- Yes? - Join me.

783
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,760
