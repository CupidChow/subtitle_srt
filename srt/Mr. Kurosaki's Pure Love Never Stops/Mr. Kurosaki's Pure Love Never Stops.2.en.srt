Yes, Yuio bought it for me. Your younger brother?

Yes, actually yesterday...➡

45
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:51,531
I was able to become acquainted with that person.

Let's just be friends! That's a common refrain!

00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,504
Isn't an acquaintance even worse than that?

56
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:35,008
However, he told me that we should start with a conversation...

57
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,509
Okay?

58
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:41,014
For those of you who have never experienced love, I say this clearly.

59
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:44,517
What is the possibility of something happening with that woman?

Fortunately, you have a novel.

65
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:07,369
The heat of a love that has nowhere to go can be poured into a novel.

This is a thank you candy.

Kurosaki-san helped me➡

"Let's become acquaintances" is ➡

139
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:40,908
I heard that this is a common phrase for refusing a relationship.

140
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:42,910
Eh... no, that's...

141
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:47,414
I should be happy just to be an acquaintance➡

142
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:50,414
I'm a greedy person.

143
00:10:55,422 --> 00:11:01,428
When I'm around you, I can't let go of my selfish expectations.

144
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:04,928
If that's the case, I think it's better to leave.

145
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:08,934
I'm sorry.

146
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:16,944
Even though I refused the proposal, I still keep it➡

At that time...

150
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:29,456
When Mr. Kurosaki told me he wouldn't come to the store anymore...➡

151
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:33,894
I thought that I would hate not to be able to see you again.

152

I don't really know why I thought that, but...

153
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,901
But with Kurosaki-san➡

154
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:45,405
It's true that I wanted to talk more with you.

I'm so happy that my heart hurts.

163
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:32,452
Once again, I would like to thank my acquaintances for their support.

175
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,923
No, because I was worried...

176
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:12,926
Maybe that's a sword?

177

00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:25,439
Ku-chan, let's play hero.

181
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:35,882
♬～

182
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,884
that….

183
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:41,388
How should I play hero?

184
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:43,390
Don't you know?

185
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:48,395
Ah, that... I haven't had any friends for a long time➡

186
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:52,399
I have almost no experience playing with people like this.

187
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,402
picture? Seriously?

188
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:57,404
yes….

189
00:13:57,404 --> 00:14:00,407
I'm sorry for disappointing you.

190
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,909
picture? Why?

191
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:05,912
I guess I'm a bad person if I don't have any friends...

192
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:08,415
No, that's not the case.

193
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:11,418
I think people with good communication skills are amazing➡

194
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:14,921
It's wonderful to have your own world.

195
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:19,426
Now, don't worry about that and let's have fun today.

196
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:20,927
Mr. Koharu...

197
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,927
(Natsuki) I'll teach you!

198
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:26,431
(Natsuki) Wait!

199
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:32,937
Ugh, I was defeated!

200
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,877
Damn it! Fang of justice!

201
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:40,881
Wow! Well… I lost…｡

202
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,383
(Natsuki) I came to help you, hey princess!

203
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,883
Thank you, Nacchan, you're strong.

204
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,891
OK?

205
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:53,894
Well... Nacchan-san is strong.

206
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:57,397
Children have unlimited physical strength, so please don't overdo it.

207
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,901
No, I'm glad you were able to play with all your might.

208
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:04,404
Hey Princess, how about a chew as a reward?

209
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,404
Yes, it was cool.

210
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:12,913
If you help the princess, you will receive a reward!

211
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,415
Ah... that's right.

212
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:19,920
Ku-chan is the hero this time! picture? That means➡

213
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,422
Does that mean you can kiss me too?

214
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,926
Huh? I... I won't do that to Mr. Kurosaki!

215
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:28,929
Ah, that's right.

216
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,931
Even if there is no reward➡

217
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,868
I will play the role of a hero with all my heart and soul!

218
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:37,371
(Natsuki) That's it! Ah yes.

219
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:41,875
《Kurosaki-san is strange, but as pure as a child➡

220
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:46,375
Hardworking and somehow cute》

221
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:54,321
Thank you very much for playing with my brothers today.

222
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:56,824
Yes, I learned a lot.

223
00:15:56,824 --> 00:16:00,327
It might be useful for a novel someday.

224
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:02,327
novel….

225
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:10,337
Um... I read Kurosaki-san's novel.

226
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:12,339
Is it “first thunder love”?

227
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:15,843
Yes, I borrowed it from a friend.

228
00:16:15,843 --> 00:16:18,846
I was very impressed.

229
00:16:18,846 --> 00:16:20,848
move….

230
00:16:20,848 --> 00:16:24,351
When I finished reading it, my heart was full.

231
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:29,356
I wonder if someone who writes such wonderful novels will propose to me? Or something.

232
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:34,361
I started thinking that homemade sweets might be a nuisance.

233
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:36,363
Is this it?

234
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:37,863
yes.

235
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:41,869
I'll make this an heirloom. Huh?

236
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:44,872
This is something Koharu-san made just for me.

237
00:16:44,872 --> 00:16:47,374
I can't eat it... No, please eat it!

238
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,877
I made it because I wanted you to eat it.

239
00:16:49,877 --> 00:16:52,813
I'm very sorry for that.

240
00:16:52,813 --> 00:16:56,316
picture? No, I don't mean right now...

241
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:58,816
Ah, no, I'll eat now. Ah...｡

242
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,831
sweet….

243
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:13,333
Was it too sweet?

244
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:17,337
Yes, it's sweet and delicious.

245
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:19,840
This is the world's most delicious cookie.

246
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,340
Hehe...

247
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:29,850
Well, I'll be waiting for you at the store again.

248
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,350
Thank you very much for today.

249
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,859
Mr. Koharu.

250
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,868
actually….

251
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:51,872
The first love depicted in “Love of First Thunder” is ➡

252
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:56,310
This is exactly how I felt about Koharu-san.

253
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,810
picture?

254
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:01,315
The story from earlier➡

255
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:06,820
I don't know how to fall in love, and I cause trouble and misunderstand.

256
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,320
I feel sorry for myself.

257
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:13,827
but….

258
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:17,331
If there is even a sliver of possibility➡

259
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:20,331
I won't give up on you again.

260
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:26,340
I'm with Koharu-san➡

261
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,340
I want to have my first and last love.

262
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:34,848
So for starters...

263
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:54,801
♬～

264
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,804
♬～

265
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,807
From now on, I will go to the store three times a day.

266
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,309
Huh?

267
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:05,312
Carry luggage, relieve boredom, call pest extermination ➡

268
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,814
I'll be there any time! Oh no...

269
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,317
If it was to become friends with Koharu-san and get married...

270
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,817
Stay!

271
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,324
Please calm down and take a deep breath.

272
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:19,324
Yes... Yes.

273
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:24,827
(sound of deep breathing)

274
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,836
Um... I've been thinking that since the beginning➡

275
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,839
Mr. Kurosaki is going too fast!

276
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,339
Rushing forward...

277
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:42,849
To rush towards a goal like a boar without thinking about what comes next.

278
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,351
that's right.

279
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:47,854
First of all, I don't usually propose marriage out of the blue.

280
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:52,359
First of all, I'm not old enough to think about marriage yet.

281
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:55,796
I'd like you to slow down a little.

282
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:58,298
speed….

283
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:02,302
So, what kind of action would you allow me to do next?

284
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:03,804
What, next?

285
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:06,306
I want to match Koharu-san's speed.

286
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:11,311
Ah... In that case, let's put marriage aside for now...

287
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:13,311
marriage⁉

288
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:17,317
Kiriya-san, it's still time for a meeting...

289
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:22,317
Could it be that this kid is the one in your proposal?

290
00:20:23,824 --> 00:20:25,325
(sound of bag falling)

291
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:28,328
What on earth are you thinking, Kurosaki?

292
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:31,331
Is it a crime to stalk a minor?

293
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:33,333
This is not an afterthought...

294
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,336
Even if you don't think so, that's how it is in the world!

295
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,839
Think about your position! Ah... that!

296
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:41,839
I invited you today.

297
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:44,845
picture?

298
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:46,345
I.

299
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:03,797
Go over there for a while.

300
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:05,797
Ah, sorry...

301
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:10,303
excuse me.

302
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:14,803
My name is Kiriya, and I am the editor in charge of Kurosaki.

303
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,812
Kurosaki to you➡

304
00:21:18,812 --> 00:21:21,314
I thought it was following me.

305
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:25,318
Does that mean you really became acquainted?

306
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:28,318
Yes, please ask me.

307
00:21:29,823 --> 00:21:33,827
Was there a reason for that?

308
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:35,328
picture?

309
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:37,831
No, as far as I've heard from Kurosaki➡

310
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:42,335
Suddenly, he proposed marriage with 1 billion yen.

311
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:43,837
Huh...

312
00:21:43,837 --> 00:21:48,842
What should I do with such a suspicious man? That's what I thought.

313
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:50,343
Yeah….

314
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:53,280
I was definitely surprised.

315
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,782
But now...➡

316
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:58,285
I wish we could be friends.

317
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:00,285
friend?

318
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:03,789
yes.

319
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:09,794
is that so.

320
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,304
Being a novelist is a lonely profession ➡

321
00:22:17,304 --> 00:22:22,309
I would appreciate it if you could support me as a friend.

322
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:26,813
He's a little different, but he's not a bad person.

323
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:30,817
Thank you for your understanding of Kurosaki.

324
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:33,817
Yes, welcome.

325
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:41,826
friend…?
