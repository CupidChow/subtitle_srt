1
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,007
(Koharu) First, let's start with my acquaintances.

2
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:10,009
(Kiriya) Huh? They're acquaintances, right?

3
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:12,011
(Kurosaki) He told me that we should start with a conversation...

4
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:16,015
(Kiriya) Okay? There is zero chance that anything will happen with that woman.

5
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:18,518
This is the world's most delicious cookie.

6
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,521
Now... I wish we could be friends.

7
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,021
friend…?

8
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,527
(Reception) Thank you for coming.

9
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,530
(Kurosaki's voice) As expected, I won't be able to attend the award ceremony.

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,030
Please do it without me.

11
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:37,036
(knock)

12
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:40,039
Sigh… Kurosaki!

13
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,542
If you don't leave soon, you won't be able to get ready in time!

14
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,042
⚟Not available⚞

15
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:49,045
(Kiriya) ⚟Are you worried about the previous award ceremony? ⚞

16
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:55,054
No one noticed that I ran to the bathroom➡

17
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:57,557
If your stomach hurts while greeting you again➡

18
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,559
You can go home with just one word.

19
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,060
⚟What? ⚞

00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:08,001

⚟As expected, it's impossible for me⚞

23
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,509
You say it's impossible...

00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,509
⚟It's impossible⚞

25
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:22,515
(Kiriya) ⚟Understood⚞

26
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:25,515
I'll come out in a bit, so please wait here.

31
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,525
(Kiriya) Mr. Shirase.

32
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,528
I've been waiting for you. Eh... Kiriya-san?

33
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,030
Right away, as Kurosaki's friend➡

34
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,033
I would like to ask you to lend me your strength.

35
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:50,036
Sorry, I don't have time, so I'll go over the details in the car.

36
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,539
No, wait... where are you going? I have to go to the store...

37
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,041
I have already received permission from my father to go out.

38
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,544
Also, thank you to the store.

39
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,546
Please. 《What... what is this? 》

40
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,047
(Kiriya) Fasten your seat belt.

41
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,982
(Akihira) Koharu~! Father!

42
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,485
《What is this~⁉》 (Akihira) Koharu Welcome!

43
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,987
Father!

44
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,989
What I would like to ask Mr. Shirase is➡

45
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,993
Encourage Kurosaki to attend the award ceremony.

46
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,495
that….

47
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,498
I have to attend, right?

48
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:19,999
yes.

49
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:23,503
As long as I apologize, I'll bow my head as much as I want➡

50
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:26,506
As expected, if it is canceled on the day➡

51
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:30,009
This is related to Kurosaki's evaluation.

52
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,009
Understood.

53
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,013
(sound of unlocking)

54
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,020
(knock)

55
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,022
Mr. Kurosaki?

56
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:49,526
OK?

57
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,533
Why…?

58
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:57,537
I heard about the award ceremony from Kiriya-san.

59
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:01,037
I wish I could be of some help.

60
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:08,982
I'm... trash...

61
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,984
Jinkai?

62
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,987
Dust and sludge.

63
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:17,991
It's worthless, like trash.

64
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:21,995
Because of me, Kiriya-san and Koharu-san are inconvenienced.

65
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,497
It's not a nuisance at all.

66
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:27,000
I had some help at a store the other day.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,503
Friends help each other in times like this.

68
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,505
Mr. Koharu...

69
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,007
Oh, and➡

70
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,010
I received a large order for rice balls from Kiriya-san➡

71
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,510
In fact, it's helping me.

72
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,016
Was that so...?

73
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:46,519
I can't believe you took on such trouble➡

74
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,019
Koharu-san is really kind.

75
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:57,530
They care about the store and their customers.

76
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,030
Compared to that, I...

77
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,975
I…➡

78
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,975
I just want to protect my mother's dream.

79
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,986
(Koharu's voice) My mother taught me this when I was little.

80
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:24,991
It's such a wonderful thing to make someone feel better.

81
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,493
Your mother...?

82
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,495
(In a whisper) Mr. Shirase.

83
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,498
Ah... Oh, it's fine with me!

84
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,001
Rather than that, it's Kurosaki-san.

85
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:39,001
I'm going with you, so can you come to the award ceremony?

86
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,508
sorry.

87
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,508
I feel sorry for Koharu-san, but...

88
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,515
I'm scared.

89
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,515
scared?

90
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:56,022
I gave a pitiful greeting➡

91
00:05:56,022 --> 00:06:00,526
To those who appreciate my novels➡

92
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,963
I wonder if the author himself is such a bad person➡

93
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:07,463
I'm afraid of disappointing you.

94
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:14,474
I... Even if Kurosaki-san fails➡

95
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,976
You won't be disappointed, will you?

96
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,978
picture?

97
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,980
Because the important thing is➡

98
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,484
That's what Kurosaki-san wanted to convey, right?

99
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:28,984
Mr. Kurosaki, I think it's great that you did your best.

100
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,989
Wonderful...?

101
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,995
Koharu-san...?

102
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:39,499
Well, if you really don't want to come out➡

103
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,999
You don't have to force yourself... (sound of lock opening)

104
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:54,013
Without running away, I would like to express my gratitude from the podium.

105
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,515
yes!

106
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,015
Well then...

107
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:02,955
Why not try putting your bangs up like this today?

108
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,958
《Well... it's dazzling! 》

109
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,965
Mr. Koharu?

110
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,467
a….

111
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,467
I think this one gives a better impression.

112
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,474
Arrange your clothes...

113
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:25,478
If you smile with this, it will be perfect!

114
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,979
Nico?

115
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:31,484
Ah... Even if there's no "Nico"...

116
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,986
Ah... yes.

117
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:36,989
Now, hurry up and get ready!

118
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,992
Shirase-san, change your clothes. Huh?

119
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,495
I don't think I'll wear my uniform to the award ceremony➡

120
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,498
I have prepared a dress for Shirase-san.

121
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,998
Dress⁉ Dress⁉

122
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,506
Ah... I'm sorry.

123
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,006
I will concentrate on greetings...

124
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:11,024
(people talking)

125
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:14,524
(Male) Now, Mr. CURO, please.

126
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:32,045
(applause)

127
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:34,481
《Good luck Kurosaki-san》

128
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:39,981
(applause)

129
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,993
Well…｡

130
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:56,503
This time... I received a wonderful award➡

131
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,505
Thank you very much...

132
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,507
(sound of collision) It hurts...

133
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:02,507
Ah... It hurts.

134
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:24,531
As you can see, I'm an incompetent person➡

135
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:29,531
Living in this world was extremely difficult.

136
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:37,977
Writing novels was a relief and an escape for me.

137
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,480
(camera shutter sound)

138
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,486
To the editor Kiriya who found me and guided me➡

139
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,986
I can't thank you enough.

140
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:57,497
There is one more person I would like to express my gratitude to.

141
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,999
The work that received the award this time is ➡

142
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:03,002
It was my first love story that I tried➡

143
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:08,508
I have lived my whole life without knowing love.

144
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:10,508
"picture…? 》

145
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:15,515
The person who taught me the joy of love.

146
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:17,517
《No way...》

147
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:21,517
He was like a spring light that illuminated my frigid world.

148
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:29,025
Thank you, I love it.

149
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,969
⚟Confession? ⚞ ⚟Girlfriend...? ⚞

150
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,971
⚟What? She...? ⚞

151
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,971
《Isn't gratitude to the reader?》

152
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,480
Supporting my creative activities➡

153
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,483
Thank you also to the onigiri shop “Shirase”!

154
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:55,488
Thank you for always providing delicious rice balls.

155
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,490
That idiot...

156
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,993
Thank you for your attention.

157
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:04,497
《This... this has turned into a big problem》

158
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,499
Mr. Shirase, go outside before it becomes a commotion.

159
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,499
Ah yes.

160
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,004
(sound of door opening)

161
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,506
Ah... haha...｡ (applause)

162
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,006
(Kiriya) Bravo!

163
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:28,521
Sigh... Sigh... I guess it's okay if I get this far...

164
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,023
(footsteps)

165
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,025
Koharu-san!

166
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,961
Mr. Kurosaki, why?

167
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,961
I saw Koharu-san leaving.

168
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,968
I'm sorry for causing a fuss because of me.

169
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,971
It's true. I'm already surprised.

170
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:47,974
I wanted to thank Koharu-san➡

171
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,974
I want to promote my store...

172
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,982
I was surprised though➡

173
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:59,482
Kurosaki-san did his best and was cool.

174
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,490
Ah, that's right.

175
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,493
Please allow me to congratulate you as well.

176
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,495
Celebration?

177
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:13,499
I also wanted to thank you for advertising the store.

178
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:17,003
Kurosaki-san, is there anything you want?

179
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,505
What I want...

180
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,008
I can't think of it right away.

181
