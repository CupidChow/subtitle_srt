Why are you going home and listening to me?

124
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,973
(Natsuki) No one who doesn't know.

125
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:30,477
Yes, that's true, but that person is a regular customer.

126
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:34,915
Sister, aren't you too carefree? Hey, your father was there too, right?

Don't ban that person.

It's okay if you don't go that far.

130
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:46,427
I politely refused, and the other party understood.

131

132
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:52,433
Yes, you are still an important regular customer➡

00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,453
《Ah... Huh? 》

140
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:14,955
I refused yesterday, right?

141
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:18,459
Yes, I regret that it was too abrupt.

142
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:20,461
So…➡

143
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:24,965
I brought some materials to help you get to know me.

144
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,967
It's a license.

145
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,967
《Eh...》

146
00:09:30,471 --> 00:09:31,972
It will be your passport.

147
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,907
《It's personal information⁉》

148
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:37,307
Graduation albums for elementary, junior high, and high schools... No, no... That's fine!

149
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:42,912
Um...I'm at work right now.

150
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,418
I apologize for that.

151
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,428
I'll come back out.

152
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:57,428
《Starting again... Starting again⁉》

153
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:01,935
《Kurosaki-san...》 He has expressed my feelings.

154
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,437
《Mr. Kurosaki again》

155
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,439
I thought it would suit Koharu-san.

156
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,940
《Mr. Kurosaki again! 》

157
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,443
I heard that he is a popular character among high school girls.

158
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:13,947
《Mooo! Kurosaki-san is unstoppable! 》

159
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,949
It's a snack. Eat a lot.

160
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,949
Yay!

161
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,456
Are you worried about your stalker?

162
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:26,456
Sister, whenever I have a problem, I immediately turn to cooking.

163
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,466
That's why I should have banned it.

164
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:37,404
Hmm...but you're a customer➡

165
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:39,406
It doesn't seem like he's a bad person.

166
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,408
Because she has such a beautiful attitude➡

167
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,410
You can't give up on that one either, can you?

168
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,414
Neene told me that she was worried.

169
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:49,917
If my sister can't say it, then I...

170
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:53,420
thank you! Sorry for making you worry.

171
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:58,420
That's right, for the sake of that person, I'll clearly and flatly refuse.

172
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,932
I brought a foot massager today.

173
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:07,434
It looked like it would be hard to work standing up➡

174
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:10,437
The latest model is highly effective in relieving swelling...

175
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:11,937
that….

176
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,945
I…➡

177
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:22,445
I have no intention of getting married for money.

178
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:28,455
Besides... if I get married someday➡

179
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:32,955
I want to meet someone I love like my parents.

180
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:37,898
I'm really sorry➡

181
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:43,904
I'm really having trouble with this...➡

182
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:46,404
Please stop.

183
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:58,919
A year ago, I fell into a slump at work.

184
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,420
picture?

185
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,424
I'm just a novelist...➡

186
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:07,928
I couldn't write even a single line.

187

188
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:16,937
(Kurosaki's voice) I have no value because I can't create novels.

189
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:21,942
I haven't been able to sleep for days and my appetite has decreased ➡

190
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:24,945
Still, the deadline is coming.

192
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:35,889
(Kurosaki's voice) Anyway, if you don't say something, it's going to be really bad.

193
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:38,892
With that in mind, I left the house...

194
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:42,392
I stopped by this shop that caught my eye.

195
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,902
((sound of door opening))

196
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:51,902

((Ah, it's okay, please choose slowly))

202

((Sorry...))

203
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:24,438
((I have no appetite for a long time➡

204
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:26,440
Anything is fine as long as it's edible))

205
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,442
((Eh, that's tough!))

206
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:31,945
((If so, I recommend rice balls with plum or salmon))

207
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:35,382
((It is gentle on the stomach if you add dashi soup to make ochazuke)

((Ah... then then))

209
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:42,389
((Okay, then I'll write down the recipe for Ochazuke!))

((Yes!))

((If you don't mind the yuzu you gave me!))

214
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:54,401

Considering the expectations of our readers...

230
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:48,376
I want my next work to be a romance novel, what do you think?

00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,822
(Kiriya) Hey, are you listening?

Ah, sorry...

233
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:01,828
Well... it was the next work, wasn't it?

234
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:03,830
Erm...

235
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,830
Did something happen?

236
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,833
Huh.

237
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,336
I'll listen to anything.

238
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:23,349
I lost my love...

239
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:27,854
picture? Oh, is that the kid from the rice ball shop?

240
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:31,357
Yes, go to the store➡

241
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,861
He proposed to me and asked me to marry him for 1 billion yen...

242
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,864
1 billion yen? What is that?

243
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:42,368
Eh... previously, if Kiriya had 1 billion yen➡

244
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:46,372
I was told that I could become the man of my dreams.

245
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:51,377
Ah... no, that's in a romance novel ➡

246
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:56,816
It's about the image of a hero, okay? So?

247
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:59,819
Because my proposal was rejected➡

248
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:05,825
I asked him to stop bringing me presents every day.

249
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:09,829
Depending on how you look at it, it's a stalker. Are you a stalker?

250
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,832
If the other person feels uncomfortable with your passionate approach➡

251
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,832
It's just a nuisance.

252
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,339
That's so...

253
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,843
I'm glad the police weren't called.

254
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:27,847

Ah, now that I think about it. Yes.

268
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,830
I was told that I would get married.

Ah, I think that person probably won't be here anymore.

270
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:26,339
Oh, is that so? Good, it was disgusting, right?

271
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:29,842
Maybe I misunderstood that I was being treated kindly since I was dealing with customers?

272
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,344
Hahaha...!

273
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:34,844
He was definitely a different person, but he wasn't that bad...

274
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,852
Ah, that's right, that was an unnecessary hassle.

275
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,854
Ah, no, that's not what I meant...
