1
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:08,508
(Chifuyu) Isn't this that weirdo?

2
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,009
(Koharu) Eh!

3
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:12,011
There are people who win big prizes for their novels➡

4
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,514
Are you going to propose to me?

5
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,514
(Kurosaki) I love it.

6
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:29,529
(cry)

7
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,532
Please don't cry anymore.

8
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,532
Yeah….

9
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:40,540
No... Kurosaki-san...

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,040
I can't see the screen because of my tears...

11
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:46,546
Koharu-san, what happened?

12
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:50,049
Ah~ I'm sorry...

13
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:54,554
I was so moved when I heard the continuation of "First Thunder Love"...

14
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,055
picture….

15
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:59,058
(cry)

16
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:03,997
``Today I'm here to ghostwrite Kurosaki-san's novel.''

17
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:08,001
``The other day, I injured Kurosaki-san's right hand...''

18
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,503
((Sorry!))

19
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:13,006
((That's right! Substitute writing?))

20
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:16,009
((Please let me help you with that typing!))

21
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:20,013
《I pushed myself to apologize to Mr. Kurosaki, who doesn't blame me➡

22
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:23,513
I decided to visit the store during its regular holidays.

23
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,020
I'm totally hooked...

24
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,521
Ugh…｡

25
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:33,526
The love between these two clumsy people was truly the best...

26
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:37,530
Ugh... I'm extremely happy...

27
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,530
Ah, please.

28
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:48,041
It was only planned for one book➡

29
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:52,045
There were so many requests for a sequel... Ah, that's amazing...

30
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:56,045
As a writer, I have never been so happy.

31
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:02,989
I will do my best to meet your expectations.

32
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,992
I'll do my best, even though it's a small effort!

33
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,992
thank you.

34
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:12,499
《What an amazing house...》

35
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,501
《I can't believe I can live in a house like this➡

36
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:18,501
Kurosaki-san is truly an amazing person.

37
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:22,509
《Stories are being created more and more》

38
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,509
``What's going on in your head? 》

39
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:31,017
《Now that I think about it... I wear glasses when I work》

40
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:36,523
《Perhaps because of that... Kurosaki-san today...》

41
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:39,023
Here and now...

42
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:43,026
《You look very adult...》

43
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,036
Ah... are you tired?

44
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,539
No, it's okay.

45
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,040
"fool! 》

46
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,043
``I'm Kurosaki-san's right hand now!'' 》

47
00:02:57,043 --> 00:03:00,046
《I have to concentrate! 》 Here and now...

48
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,982
Can I hug you?

49
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,985
When I told her that...《That was a line...》

50
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,988
Her eyes flickered in confusion.

51
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:10,490
《That's right》

52
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,494
I'm sorry, I can't stop myself anymore.

53
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,497
《But I am conscious of it...》

54
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:21,000
I want everything about you so badly.

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,003
《So I become nothing~! 》

56
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:27,503
(Sound of keyboard hitting)

57
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,512
Kurosaki...

58
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,014
What? What happened?

59
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:38,518
Ah... I was worried about the development.

60
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,020
This is how I often come up with ideas.

61
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,022
Ah...｡

62
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:47,527
Or just clap your hands...

63
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,529
Hey...! Let's stop doing that now.

64
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,031
Because I’m injured…｡ Ah…｡

66
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:59,038
that….

67
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:02,542
If it's okay with me, I'll consult with you.

68
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,977
picture?

69
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,979
Sorry for interrupting an amateur.

70
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,481
Ah, no, that's it.

71
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,984
I'm grateful.

72
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:15,989
Oh...then could you please sit on the sofa?

73
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,989
Ah yes.

74
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,508
How can I say I love you and love you so much that I can’t stand it➡

75
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,508
Can you understand?

76
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,513
Tch... it's close! Ugh...!

77
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,016
Mr. Koharu? What are you doing?! Suddenly!

78
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:47,520
Ah... I wanted to recreate the scene from the novel...

79
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,024
I wonder if this will convey my feelings to the heroine...

80
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,027
Is that so?

81
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,030
it's okay! I think it gets across!

82
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,530
Thank you very much, that was helpful.

83
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,969
Shall we take a break now?

84
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,471
Well... let's do that!

amazing…!

91
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:16,476
Ah...I'm sorry, I had to make lunch for you.

92
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:21,481
No, it's a menu to improve concentration and immunity.

93
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:22,982
Hehe...

94
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,482
Ah, me too.

Please. Oh, I don't have wine...

96

Ah, it's grape juice.

97
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,993
With glucose and polyphenols➡

98
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:36,496
I thought it would improve my concentration and immunity.

99
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,998
Ah, thank you very much.

100
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:41,501

I also need to improve my concentration.

105

《Something is going wrong today...》

106
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:13,966
Koharu-san, how did you feel about the sequel so far?

107
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,468
Huh?

108
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,970
I would love to hear your thoughts.

109
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,474
Well, my heart is already pounding.

110
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,976
As expected, Mr. Kurosaki is amazing!

111
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,976
Ah, good...

112
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,483
From here➡

113
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,485
How will it develop?

114
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:36,489
Ah... the hero proposes to the heroine.

115
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,489
Wow, that's exciting!

116
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:48,000
Actually, I long for a warm family.

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,503
It's in the novel➡

118
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:55,007
I want the main character to build a family like that.

119
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,510
Do you admire it?

120
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,512
yes.

121
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:04,412
When I was young, I grew up in a home where my parents loved each other deeply.

122
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:09,952
Until my mother died and my father remarried.

123
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,461
My father and my new mother.

124
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,961
My younger brother was born during that time.

125
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:24,965
I was the only one who couldn't adjust well to the new family my father had created...

126
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:32,478
Oh, I'm sorry for talking like this.

127
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:34,480
home….

128
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,985
But I can't believe Kurosaki-san had such a past.

129
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,987
I don't have the same happiness as before➡

130
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:45,491
I had given up thinking I would never be able to get it again.

131
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,994
but….

132
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:51,497
When I met Koharu-san, I had a dream.

133
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,499
picture?

134
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:58,504
Warm, beautiful and very adorable➡

135
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:02,508
I dream of building a happy family with my beloved Koharu.

136
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,944
《That's right...》

137
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:08,447
I'm different from the main character➡

138
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:11,450
I proposed right away, but...

139
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,953
Hehe.

140
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,454
Ah... Ah, that's right!

141
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,456
I also brought dessert!

142
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,958
a….

143
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,958
(sound of hitting table)

144
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,463
Ah~ Excuse me! OK?

145
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:25,965
No problem at all.

146
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,466
Please take it off. Huh?

147
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,969
Okay, I need to wash that quickly! Mr. Koharu?

148
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,971
Please take it off! Mr. Koharu?

149
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,472
Yes, yes…! Koharu-san!

150
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,474
Where is the washroom? Wait...

151
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,974
I'll borrow the bathroom!

152
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:53,493
Good, it fell...

153
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,495
Koharu-san, I'm sorry.

154
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,997
I would like to ask for a little help.

155
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,499
yes.

No, it's my fault.

159
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,514
Could you please bend down a little?

160
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:16,516
Ah yes.

161

162
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:30,530
《Kurosaki-san's back is… wide》

163
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:33,032
《Think something strange again! 》

164
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,932
Excuse me before.

165
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,472
Huh?

166
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,974
《That's strange》

167
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,976
《Even though I'm used to Nacchan changing clothes...》

168
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,978
I... I'm sorry, I'm so bad...

169
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:48,978
It's okay, it's okay to take it slow.

170
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:54,988

00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:05,999
Ah... what were you doing all the time?

173
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:10,503
Ah, if you choose clothes that are easy to wear, you'll be fine.

174
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,505
Although it takes time ➡

175
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,508
It's not something I would ask my brother to do.

176
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,511
younger brother? Did you say that earlier?

177
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,013
yes.

178
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,515
I decided to attend a university in Tokyo➡

179
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,515
We live together.

180
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,022
Huh... Is that so?

181
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:32,525
Well, we're good friends now.

Well... that's right.

183
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:40,964
Okay, one more thing.

184
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:48,969
I was thinking of just thinking about work today...

185
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:57,483
Koharu-san is working hard for me...➡

186
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,983
I love it so much that I can't stand it anymore.

187
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:10,496
I'm sorry, I got carried away even though I'm an acquaintance of mine.

188
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:14,500
I also look at Koharu like a novel➡

189
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,000
I want to be the kind of man who makes your heart flutter.

190
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:25,011
《My heart is already so excited by Mr. Kurosaki...》

191
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:29,511
``But if I say that, I'm sure he'll go berserk again...''

192
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,518
"but…"

193
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,418
Mr. Koharu?

194
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,958
Mr. Kurosaki…➡

195
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,458
We are no longer acquaintances.

196
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,468
Mr. Kurosaki➡

197
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:51,468
I've become someone you care about.

198
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:55,975
picture…?

199
00:12:55,975 --> 00:13:02,982
♬～

200
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:07,987
In other words... one step closer to becoming a lover from an acquaintance➡

201
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,990
Can I interpret it?

202
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,993
Well… well…｡

203
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:15,495
Well then...!

204
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,495
⚟That's it! ⚞

205
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:22,001
Mr. Kiriya! I was surprised...

206
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,003
(Kiriya) Even when I rang the intercom, there was no response.

207
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,005
I got worried and came here.

208
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,507
Ah... that...

209
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:31,010
This time, I received my precious novelist's right hand...

210
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,513
I'm really sorry! Ah, no.

211
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,948
As for the book, Kurosaki is at fault.

212
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:39,452
I am very sorry.

213
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:40,953
More than that.

215
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,968
I agreed to have Mr. Shirase write for me, but➡

216
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:59,972
Should physical contact be prohibited?

217
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:03,976
Eh... I haven't touched Koharu-san at all...

218
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,479
You let me change your clothes...!

219
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,982
It's dangerous enough even if you don't actually touch it.

220
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,984
Kiriya-san, since when...?

221
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,986
Mr. Shirase is about to have a meeting➡

222
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,988
It's fine for you to go home today.

223
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,990
Thank you for writing on my behalf.

224
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,493
Ah, yes, please excuse me today.

225
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,495
Ah, if you'd like a lunch box, the two of you.

226
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,995
Please excuse me. Koharu-san...!

227
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:29,498
(Sound of door opening and closing)

228
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,506
《I said it was someone I was interested in》

229
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:36,442
``But does this mean I like it? 》

230
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:39,946
《Are you just excited because Kurosaki-san is being kind to you? 》

231
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:42,448
(Yui) Koharu-chan Hello!

232
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,951
Ah, Yui-chan, hello Fujita-san.

233
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,954
(Fujita) Hello, Koharu-chan, you seem happy today.

234
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:49,455
picture?

235
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,958
(Yui) Because I've been smiling ever since.

236
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,961
Did you see it? Well... that's not the case.

237
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,963
You look like something good happened, right?

238
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:59,966
I fell in love, I fell in love...! No... that's not it...!

239
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:03,469
It's cute. Being embarrassed like that feels like youth.

240
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,471
No, that's not right... Um... (Fujita) Enjoy it.

241
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,473
(Yui) Bye!

242
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,473
Ba... bye...

243
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,980

245
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,485
《It’s love after all~⁉》

246
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:31,492
Are the words “I like someone” and “I like someone” the same thing?

247
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,501
You were thinking the whole time during the meeting, right?

248
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:39,001
Sorry, I can't concentrate.

249
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:45,511
Someone who cares, that is, someone who is aware.

250
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:49,515
There are times when your heart beats faster for me.

251
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,952
Ha! Is this okay to propose again?

252
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,453
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

253
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:59,458
Do you realize that work is important right now?

254
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,458
This is not the time to be obsessed with love.

255
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,466
“CURO’s first romance novel will be made into a movie!

256
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,968
The director is master Mr. Yanagi!

257
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:13,472
The leading role is Rei Arisugawa, a talented young actress who is currently making waves! ”｡

258
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:17,476
There's a big project underway that will put our company's fortunes at stake, right?

259
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,479
I am aware of this.

260
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:25,479
But... I can't stop my feelings for Koharu-san.

261
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:34,489
I will be careful not to interfere with my work.

262
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,495
Could you please watch over me?

263
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,999
Sigh…｡

264
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:49,008
I hope my love will have a positive impact on my work➡

265
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,510
I was watching...

266
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,410
Relationships with minors cannot be overlooked any longer.

267
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,955
Kurosaki, I didn't say it because I thought you'd be depressed.

268
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,457
(sound of writing)

270
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,467
It's still too early to get excited.

That's so...

272
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,981
So... But Kiriya-san said it before➡

273
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:33,485
"Acquaintances have zero chance" was wrong, right?

274
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,988
I'm also learning about love.

275
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,490
I won't be confused this time.

276
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,993
Huh? Learning?

277
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,996
Haha... ah.

278
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,498
I'm sure I took it off at that time.

279
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:51,998
But if your love experience level is 5, then I...

280
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,445
1 billion.

281
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,451
Shall I tell you about my journey as a woman?

282
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:08,954
I know that Mr. Kiriya is highly sought after.

283
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,456
So let's make a suggestion.

284
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:13,459
If pushing doesn't work, try pulling.

285
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,959
It's a game of love.

286
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,969
I'm not telling you not to contact me.

287
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:28,469
It's an important time, so we should refrain from meeting together.

288
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:33,479
If you end up being chased by a weekly magazine like the other day➡

289
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,479
Shirase-san will be in trouble.

290
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:41,984
That may be true.

00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:58,937
picture? A special appearance in a movie?

294
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,939
Is it Kurosaki?

295
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:05,439
Ah... a request from Mr. Arisugawa...｡

296
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,448
Understood, I will look into it positively.

297
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:21,956
It might be better than being rumored to be underage.

298
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,964
I'm home.

299
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:29,468
(Akihira) Will it disappear? (Chifuyu: Natsuki) Eh!

300
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,970
(Akihira) Lie! Yeah! It'll be gone.

305
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:42,481
Huh? Dad, what about this?

306
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:46,485
(Akihira) The store has been busy lately, and Koharu seems to be in her youth➡

307
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,488
I decided to hire a part-time worker. Eh!

308
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:52,491
I wanted to introduce you to Koharu, so I asked her to wait for me.

309
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,426
This is Yuo-kun.

310
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,929
I've heard from the store manager.

311
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,931
Nice to meet you, Koharu-chan.

312
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,933
Ah yes.

314
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:06,438
It's amazing that Yuio attended Kamikei University.

315
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:10,442
I also have a strong nervous breakdown! thank you.

316
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,444
I can't compete with Nacchan though.

317
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,946

Um... why are you here?

320
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:23,455
I saw CURO being advertised on TV and it's close to my house.

321
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:26,458
Eh... Are you a fan of CURO by any chance?

Sometimes the person himself is at the store...

325
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,468
Of course, as long as I have a part-time job➡

326
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,971
I won't do anything that will cause any inconvenience.

327
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:43,475
That's right. I'm sorry for asking something strange.

328
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,978
We are a small shop, but please visit us.

Okay, I'll be serious!

00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,438
I'm sorry for barging into your place of work.

339
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,941
There will be schools and shops, so it's best not to be forced into it.

340
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,443
If you want to write for me, I can prepare it for you here.

341
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,945
it's okay.

342
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,447
I wanted to work with Kurosaki-san until his hand healed.

343
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,949
is that so.

Well, today I only have a meeting with the director➡
