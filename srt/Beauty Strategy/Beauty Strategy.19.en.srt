[The Death of Consort Huan]

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,220
Mother, Consort Huan rose up
and tried to assassinate you.

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,940
She should be executed.

12
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,380
Mu Xuanjue,

13
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,660
you're indeed
the most treacherous man in the palace.

14
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,180
It's a great chance to get me killed.

15
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,140
How would you just let it go?

16
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:18,660
Mother,

17
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,260
please allow me
to punish her personally.

18
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,780
Do I even have to die the way you want?

19
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,500
I won't let it happen.

is how you'll end up later.

24
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,420
I've heard a lot about the miraculous
techniques of the Snow clan.

25
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,860
It's as marvellous as it's said to be.

26
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,820
I'm at your service, Your Majesty.

27
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,020
You're meritorious
of what you've done today.

28
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,900

Consort Huan killed herself
in the dungeon!

33
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,180
Why?

34
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,340
Why did you have to kill Consort Huan?

35
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,580
She did all kinds of evil in the past.

Sit and tell me about it.

88
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,580
First,

89
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,020
His Majesty asked someone
to send Consort Huan's body

90
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,620
out of the palace,

91
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,060
claiming to bury her in her hometown.

92
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,980
Second, last time, you asked me to check

93
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,420
where the Spring Water
from the Spirit Mountain went,

94
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,340
I've figured it out.

95
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,980
After being stored in the
Pharmaceutical Bureau for a short time,

96
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,740
it's transferred
to an underground palace.

97
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,700
Underground palace?

98
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,540
So, it seems that Moxing
has been imprisoned there

99
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,140
and forced to make the Dark Viper Toxin.

104

113
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,180

found the entrance
