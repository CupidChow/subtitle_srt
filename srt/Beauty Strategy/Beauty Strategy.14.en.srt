[The Consort Crisis Part 2]

10
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,740
Your Majesty,

11
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,140
Lady Ling asked for something
when she left.

12
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,140
What was it?

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,220
The poison that takes effect quickly

14
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,940
but kills slowly.

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,940
She wants to fake Qingyan's death
to save her.

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,740
But the efficacy won't last long.

17
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,460
Once it's been found out, I'm afraid...

18
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,020
Silly woman.

19
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,460
Who does she think she is?

20
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,420
Don't push me too far.

21
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,300
Can't I even

22
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,060
take away my own maid?

23
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,980
She's dead.

24
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,020
She's of no value to you now.

25
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,500
Who says a dead person is of no value?

26
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:19,860
Don't.

27
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,020
Let go of me!

28
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:21,780
No!

29
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,620
I'm just going to dismember her body

30
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,420
and show everyone in the harem

31
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,500
how they'll end up for defending you.

32
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:31,780
Don't!

33
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:32,940
Let me go!

34
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:38,700
Don't.

35
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,420
Let me go!

36
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,500
Idiot.

37
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,460
Do you think being a consort

38
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,980
can make you powerful enough
to stand up against me?

39
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,980
What do you have to fight against me?

40
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,140
Let me go!

41
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,100
Stop!

42
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,780
What backs me up

43
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,340
is the entire Phantom army.

44
00:01:59,020 --> 00:01:59,940
What about you?

45
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,060
You're just a mongrel
without any support.

46
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,020
He who backs you up

47
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,380
is a cowardly and powerless Emperor.

48
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,340
Qingyan!

49
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,660
No!

50
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,900

51
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,740

52
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,820
Your Grace, bad news!

53
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,180
Someone broke in.

54
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,460
His Majesty is never fed up

55
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,660
with the rescuing thing.

56
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:29,860
Fine.

57
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,900
I'll then show him

58
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,700
how I tread his new consort

59
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,740
underfoot.

60
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,780
Consort Huan,

61
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,540
who are you going to tread underfoot?

62
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,580
You don't even show any respect
to the Human clan's imperial family?

63
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,660
A decree from Her Majesty.

64
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,940
Consort Huan ignored her duty
as the connection of the two clans,

65
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,260
threatening consorts
and torturing maids of the Human clan.

66
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,700
She shows no respect or awe.

67
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,700
So, she'll be grounded for 30 days.

68
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,460
How's that possible?

69
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,620
Her Majesty is in charge of the court.

70
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,140
She never interferes
with the harem thing!

71
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,620
Her Majesty has a message for you.

72
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,700
She didn't restrain you
for all these years

73
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,500
only for the marriage
between the two clans.

74
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,780
For the supremacy you have in the harem,

75
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,180
she can

76
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,180
destroy it at any time.

77
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,100
Your Grace,

78
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,340
take the decree.

80
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,420

Qingyan,

82
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,660
wake up.

83
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,780
Qingyan, wake up.

84
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,620
Qingyan,

85
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,380
I'll buy you a lot of sugar cake.

86
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,060
Qingyan!

87
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,540
Qingyan!

88
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,860
Sorry.

89
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,500
I thought I could protect you

90
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,740
by getting you out of the palace.

I didn't say anything.

96
