00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,580
Lingzhi,

11
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,540
with me by your side,

12
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,180
if anyone dares to bully you again,

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:43,940
- I'll...
- Qingyan.

14
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,980
I'll get you out of the palace
as soon as possible.

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,260
But why?

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,060
Don't you want me to stay by your side?

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,620
I made you my maid

18
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,060
to help you
get rid of your slave status.

19
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,100
Only in this way

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,900
can I get you out of this cruel palace

21
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,820
and help you live with dignity.

22
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,140
But...

23
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,580
I have no family outside the palace.

24
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,940
My village was hit hard by a disaster.

25
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,900
I'm the only survivor.

26
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,380
Don't worry.

27
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,460
I've saved a lot of gold for you.

28
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,980
Even outside the palace,

29
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,980
you can always have enough food.

30
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,260
His Majesty is here.

31
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,220
This is the girl
you got from the Room of Factotum?

32
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,260
I picked her randomly.

33
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,020
I don't even remember her name.

34
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,900
Since you don't care about her,

35
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,620
then make her my maid.

36
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,060
Your Majesty, she's too young.

37
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,740
And she isn't very smart.

38
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,060
She may act rashly or carelessly

39
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,580
to annoy you, Your Majesty.

40
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:14,860
It doesn't matter.

41
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,500
I like clumsy and innocent kids.

42
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:19,860
But I don't want...

43
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,660
Lady Ling,

44
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,700
if you still reject me,

45
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,700
I'll think

46
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,660
you're jealous of your maid.

47
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,660
It's not good to stand in her way

48
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,820
for your selfish desires.

49
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,100
Young girl,

50
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,740
would you like to work for me?

51
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,380
If you do, your pay will be doubled.

52
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,060
You can even become a female official
and gain power.

53
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,940
It's what the maids
strive for all their lives.

54
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,340
Would you like a try?

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:06,940

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,140

57
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,220

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,780
To work for Lady Ling.

59
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,540
Silly girl.

60
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,340
For your powerless former master,

61
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,580
you actually refuse
to work for the Emperor.

62
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,420
Do you know

63
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,820
how you'll end up for disobeying me?

64
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,140
I'm ready for any punishment.

65
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,940
I take Lady Ling as my family.

66
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,340
How can family members
stop protecting each other

67
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,540

68
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,980
Don't flatter yourself.

69
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,940
We're not family.

70
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,820
Don't think you can talk nonsense

71
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,860
just because you're young.

72
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,300
Your Majesty,

73
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,340
a reckless girl like her

74
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,100
can't be a female official.

75
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,340
Leave now.

76
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,700
You would only disgrace me.

77
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,500
Your Grace, Lady Ling
has His Majesty's favor now.

78
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,500
I think we might not be her enemy.

79
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,420
Instead, we should win her over

80
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,620
and make her one of us.

81
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,380
Shut up!

82
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,140
Since the battle has begun,

83
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,100
there can be only one winner.

84
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,060
The girl you care about
has stood the trial.

85
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,820
However,

86
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,500
in the palace,

87
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,420
pure care can be a double-edged sword.

88
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,580
I just offended you, Your Majesty.

89
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,580
Please punish me.

90
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,340
What kind of punishment do you want?

91
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,140
Didn't I teach you?

92
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,300
Anyone in this palace

93
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,180
must not be soft-hearted

94
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,260
or have a weakness.

95
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,020
Your Majesty, are you caring
too much about me?

96
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,100
You even personally

97
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,620
test my maids.

98
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,100
Your Majesty, do you really have
a feeling for me?

99
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,340
Feeling?

100
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,620
I don't know what it is.

101
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,700
But you look guilty.

102
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,180
This is the pastry
I made for His Majesty.

103
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,700
I want to give it to His Majesty
so he can have a taste.

104
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,100
Thank you, Your Grace.

105
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,300
Unfortunately, His Majesty is out there,
taking care of state affairs.

106
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,500
I'll be waiting here, then.

107
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,060
I want to surprise His Majesty.

108
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,540
Please be seated for some rest.

109
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,020
I'll take my leave.

110
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,060
It's the smell of the Shuoye Flower.

111
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,940
It is, indeed.

112
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,740
But why is it here?

113
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,380
Is this the place

114
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,740
where my brother is imprisoned?

115
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,220
It's hollow.

116
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,060
Why is it a burial chamber?

00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,820
[Memorial Tablet of Mrs. Mu]

118
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,420
So, this is Mu Xuanjue's mother.

Your Majesty.

120
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,660
How dare you

121
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,100
break in and blaspheme my mother?

122
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,540
I got in here by accident.

123
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,180
I'm guilty, Your Majesty.

124
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,100
Get out.

125
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,500
I don't want to see you again.

126
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,780
Yes.

127
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,700
Sorry, Mother.

128
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,700
I'm an unfilial son.

129
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,900
I'm soft-hearted for my enemy.

130
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,300
Please give me some more time.

131
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,460
I'll give you an explanation.

132
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,980
This is the purified Dark Viper Toxin?

133
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,500
Yes.

134
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,060
It's highly toxic.

135
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,460
However powerful
the ones of other clans are,

136
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
when they're poisoned,

137
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,740
they'll feel like they're burned by fire

138
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,300
and they'll end up dead in pain.

139
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:00,900
Very good.

140
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,500
I can't wait to see

141
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,060
those humble ones of other clans

142
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,580
die without a trace.

143
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,340
This toxin is destructive.

144
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,220
Its dose

145
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,980
needs to be further tested.

146
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,300
Besides that Phantom woman,

147
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,500
there's another one
of the other clans in the palace.

148
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,060
Test it on him first.

149
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,300
Yes.

150
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:34,860
Bingjian!

151
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,460
Didn't I tell you not to come here?

152
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,780
I heard Her Royal Highness
made the Dark Viper Toxin

153
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,860
and would test it on you.

154
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,020
You have to get out of here now.

155
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,780
You stay out of this.

156
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,580
You know nothing
about the Dark Viper Toxin.

157
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,180
It's made of the Shuoye Flower

158
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,340
of my clan,

159
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,980
restraining all the skills
from other clans.

160
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,340
If you're poisoned,

161
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,900
you will die.

162
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,020
If I escape,

163
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,460
Her Royal Highness will
reasonably start a war against my clan.

164
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,060
As a hostage,

165
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,060
I've let go of my personal safety.

166
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,500
You just leave.

167
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,540
This place is dangerous.

168
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,020
Neither of you can run away!

169
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,660
Lady Ling,

170
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,460
I didn't expect you to be

171
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,260
the spy who escaped last time.

172
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:19,980
Snow King,

173
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,260
you and Lady Ling have to come with us.

174
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,620
Somebody coming!

175
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,420
Tie her up and take her
to Her Royal Highness!

176
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,460
Your Majesty,

177
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,340
I just stalked Lady Ling.

178
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,500
She went to Snow King's place

179
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,780
