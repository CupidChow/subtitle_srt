10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:39,900
Your Majesty,

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,100
if you want to support Lady Ling
against Consort Huan,

12
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,500
you don't need to promote her this much.

13
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,060
I make her Consort Ling.

14
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,140
I would rather call it a trial

15
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,220
than...

16
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,220
a reward.

17
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,380
Shuoye,

18
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,860
hope you won't let me down.

19
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,460
Lady Ling, you're going
to be Consort Ling.

20
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,620
That's what other women can't be

21
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,980
all their lives.

22
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,500
You must not give it up

23
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,380
for a useless maid.

24
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,740
- That's right, Lady Ling.
- That's right, Lady Ling.

25
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,740
Lady Ling, don't hesitate for too long.

26
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,180
The later you arrive,

27
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,780
the sooner Qingyan will die.

28
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,700
Go tell Consort Huan

29
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,060
to let go of Qingyan.

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,180
I'll do what she wants

31
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,260

Your Grace,

35
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,900
we've gone through so much

36

Qingyan's life

41
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,380
is just nothing?

What am I keeping?
Heartless and shameless maids?

43
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,060
In this palace,

44
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,740
life can't matter more than power.

45
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,580
Your Grace, why do you think

46
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,100
we dare to disobey Consort Huan?

47
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,660
If we didn't think

48
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,500
you would be a powerful person,

49
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,220
we wouldn't risk our lives
to defend you.

50
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,820
Now you want to be
a soft-hearted person.

51
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,940
You don't care

52
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,300
if Consort Huan will avenge us.

53
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,140
Outside the palace,
we have our families to raise.

54
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,100
If we die here,
who else will raise them?

56
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,540
you're actually
the heartless and shameless one.

57
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,780
You're right.

58
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,060
In this palace,

59
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,660
we have no chance to make choices.

60

Unless we obey the rules,

61
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,980
we can't survive.

70
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,900
Consort Huan kidnapped Qingyan

71
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,420
and tortured her

72
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,220
to force me to quit my position.

73
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,660
I've stalled for time,
claiming I didn't feel very well.

74

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,100
No.

82
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,780
