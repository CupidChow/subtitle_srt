Your Majesty,

187
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,740
please spare my life.

188
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,140
I will help you get rid of Mu Xuanjue.

189
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,900
Then kill him
at the ceremony of rain praying.

What? You're being soft-hearted?

194
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,460
I'm not being soft,

195
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,300
but excited.

196
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,620
I'm excited to kill that betrayer.

197
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,620
After you kill him,

198
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,340
I'll take the throne as the Empress.

199
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,260
By then,

200
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,900
you'll be meritorious.

201
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,860
Your Majesty, after that,

202
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,380
please make me a female official
in the name of the Empress

203
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,180
so that I'm no longer
an imperial consort.

204
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,620
I want to work in the court

205
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,220
