Your Grace, here are
some refreshments I've prepared for you.

105
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,300
really cared about you.

106
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,300

107
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,980
Please forgive me, Your Grace.

108
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,060

111
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,380
Don't touch it.

112
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,420

121
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,860

Wish you have a baby soon.

124
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,420
Come on.

125
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,260
It was hard to get

126
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,300
this food, huh?

127
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,580

130
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,180
I've asked you to come

131
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,580
to inquire about someone for me.

132
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,860
Sure. I'll do it for you.

133
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,500
Silly girl, don't you ask

134
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,780
whether it's a hard mission

135
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,860
or what reward I will offer you?

136
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,620
Lingzhi, you've already bribed me

137
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,580
with such delicious pastries.

138
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,460
After I gain a foothold in the palace,

139
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,180
I'll make you no longer a slave.

140
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,740
I've heard His Majesty favors you a lot.

141
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,540
I really feel happy for you.

142
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,780
I don't know how long His Majesty's
sudden indulgence

143
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,620
can keep me safe here.

144
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,100
Lady Ling works for Her Royal Highness.

145
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,700

146
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,140
Instead of killing her,

147
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,380
I'll give her even more love.

148
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,980

149
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,420

150
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,820

151
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,380
how capable she is.

152
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:15,980
Your Majesty,

153
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:16,900
most of the civil officials

154
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,460
have secretly turned to you.

155
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,820
Shall we accelerate
to get back the reign?

156
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:21,700
Be patient.

157
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,460
The Royal Empress Dowager
has command over the military.

158
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,540
We need to be careful.

159
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,580
Don't try to stop me.

160
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,780
Get out of my way!

161
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,420
Your Majesty, I know I'm wrong.

162
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,380
For the sake of our previous love,

163
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,220
please spare me.

164
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,100
Love?

165
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,540
There's no such thing in this palace.

166
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,540
Your Majesty, was your love toward me

167
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,340
not real?

168
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,540
Lady An,

169
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,780
you haven't got real yet?

170
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,140
No wonder you lost.

171
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,500
You're of no value to me now.

172
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,900
Value?

173
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,420
So,

174
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,100
I was just wishing for the impossible?

175
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,980
How much do you really love me, then?

176
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,220
How many secrets of mine
have you told to Her Royal Highness?

177
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,820
Your Majesty, I'm sorry.

178
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,260
I was forced, Your Majesty.

179
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,260
Take this sinner out.

180
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,380
Never let me see her again.

181
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,180

186

The maids, treasures, and silk fabrics

187
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,380
are all for you.

188
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,900
In three days, I'll meet
the ambassadors of the Fire clan.

189
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,460
I allow you

190
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,460
to keep me company.

191
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,100
Thank you for all this, Your Majesty.

192
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,100
You've been living here alone

193
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,980
for quite a few days.

194
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,740
Tonight, I'm going to stay here.

195
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,780
- I'll take my leave, Your Majesty.
- I'll take my leave, Your Majesty.

196
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,260
Lingzhi, why do you hesitate?

197
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,620
Aren't you trying to save
your brother and other clansmen?

198
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,060
Getting his love with your body

199
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,860
is what you should do, isn't it?

200
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,700
Lady Ling,

201
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,780
why are you not coming over to me?

202
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,740
I order you to sleep with me now.
