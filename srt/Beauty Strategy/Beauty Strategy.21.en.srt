10
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,420
Once Her Majesty starts a war,

11
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,740
all the other clans will be plunged
into an abyss of misery.

12
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,260
For now, we have to trust Mu Xuanjue.

13
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,020
Mu Xuanjue

14
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,300
racked his brains to get Consort Huan
out of here by faking her death,

15
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,140
which shows his sincerity of alliance.

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:01,980
But I...

17
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,860
I'm not sure if I should trust him.

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,500
There's no need to dwell on it.

19
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,220
Whether you kill him for revenge

20
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,900
or ally with him for now

21
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,020
to fight against Her Majesty,

22
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,380
I will help you.

23
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,620
You're not alone.

24
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,380
Bingjian,

25
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,620
thank you.

26
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,940
But I...

27
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,180
Don't bother to explain.

28
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,340
You have no feelings for me.

29
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,180
But I'm doing everything

30
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,220
just because I want to.

31
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,420
Your Majesty,

32
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,260
according to our informant,

33
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,500
Snow King was meeting
Consort Ling privately.

34
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,220
Consort Ling?

35
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,220
Yes.

36
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,540
How would Snow King get involved

37
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,700
with an imperial consort?

38
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,540
In order not to alert them,

39
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,380
the informant didn't get too close

40
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,980
and failed to hear
what they were conspiring about.

41
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,140
Go check it out.

42
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,780
If he's up to something evil,
kill him immediately.

43
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,340
Yes.

44
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,980
Hope all this can be over soon

45
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,820
and we can leave this sinister palace.

46
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,060
Go ahead and do it.

47
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,980
However it ends up,

48
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,540
I'll be with you all the time.

49
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,420
How dare you covet my woman?

50
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,020
I'm going to kill you.

52
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,780
Someone is listening.

53
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,060
Your Majesty,

54
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,660
when I was little,
Snow King saved my life.

55
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,260
I have nothing but gratitude for him.

56
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,940
I...

57
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,820
I'm innocent.

58
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,420
Are you saying

59
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,900
that there's nothing
between you and him,

60
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,300
he has one-sided love for you,

61
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,660
and threatens you with your gratitude?

62
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,380
You're right, Your Majesty.

63
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,260
I...

64
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,180
I only care for you, Your Majesty.

65
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,140
How can I believe you?

66
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,380
How shall I prove it?

67
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,460
Prove it with your action, of course.

68
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,380
How about a more direct way?

69
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,180
Kill him and I'll believe you.

70
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,060
Snow King actually
covets an imperial consort?

71
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,740
Interesting.

72
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,580
Yes.

73
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,500
Your Majesty,

74
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,660
why don't we catch them
and interrogate them with torture?

75
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:39,820
No need.

76
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,780
They aren't colluding for rebellion.

77
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,700
It's just His Majesty and Snow King

78
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,180
are fighting for a woman.

79
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,740
I'd be glad to see that happen.

80
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,140
I taught you what to do, didn't I?

81
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,220
Do I have to teach you again?

82
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,340
Your Majesty,

83
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,140
Snow King works for Her Majesty.

84
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,580
If I kill him,

85
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,180
I'm afraid

86
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,580
Her Majesty will punish me.

87
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,900
He dares to covet my woman.

88
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,860
Her Majesty will have
no objection to killing him.

89
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,460
Your Majesty,

90
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,180
how do you know I'll have no objection?

91
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,020
Mother, I'm dealing
with the private affairs of the harem.

92
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,740
Please do not interfere.

93
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,220
I want you to do me a favor.

94
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,060
Let go of Snow King, will you?

95
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,540
I don't dare to disobey you, Mother.

96
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,460
He's just a humble man
from another clan.

97
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,420
This is the Human clan's palace,
after all.

98
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,340
You should behave yourself, Snow King.

99
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,060
Your Majesty, thank you for saving me.

100
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,060
I will speak and act cautiously.

101
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,820
If you really like Lingzhi,

102
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,380
you should work harder for me.

103
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,860
When it's over,

104
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,180
I will bestow her to you.

105
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,380
I pledge loyalty to you, Your Majesty.

106
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,740
Your Majesty, are you satisfied
with my performance?

107
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,860
No.

108
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,180
It only temporarily dispelled

109
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,500
Her Majesty's doubt on you.

110
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,780
You must not see
Snow King privately again.

111
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:45,900
Otherwise,

112
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,380
I may kill him personally.

113
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,340
You won't kill Snow King.

114
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,820
You don't need to pretend

115
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,620
you're jealous in front of me.

116
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,380
Do you still not know

117
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,660
how I feel for you?

118
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,140
We're just
taking advantage of each other.

119
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,820
Don't get too obsessed.

120
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,340
Mu Xuanjue,

121
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,420
don't make me feel disgusted.

122
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,540
Disgusted?

123
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,460
Don't push me.

124
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,780
Your Majesty,

125
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,540
as you expected,

126
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,900
Consort Ling has a special identity.

127
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,580
We just got the last words of Lady An.

128
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,780
She insisted that Lingzhi was
of the Spirit clan.

129
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,740
What?

130
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,740
She's of the Spirit clan?

131
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,300
Yes.

132
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:57,940
Lingzhi,

133
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,100
are you quarreling with His Majesty?

134
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,500
No. We're good.

135
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,060
You're lying.

136
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,500
You don't even smile lately.

137
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,060
Your Majesty keeps a cold face, too.

138
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,420
At the command of Her Majesty,

139
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,260
we're here to arrest
the evil woman of the Spirit clan.

140
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,740
Don't touch Lingzhi!

141
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,420
Don't hurt her.

142
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,580
Mother, please show some mercy

143
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,980
and let go of Consort Ling.

144
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,020
Your Majesty, for this woman,

145
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,380
you've begged me many times.

146
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,540
Before, I was all right with it.

147
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,060
But she's of the Spirit clan.

148
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,340
Whoever she is,

149
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,580
I just want to protect her.

150
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,620
Do you insist on saving her?

151
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,460
Please spare her, Mother.

152
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,540
I have a good idea

153
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,380
to make you forever live

154
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,540
a happy life together.

155
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,140
What idea?

156
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,220
You declare

157
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,100
that the Emperor, being seriously ill,

158
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,820
will abdicate
to the Royal Empress Dowager

159
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,780
and live with Consort Ling in seclusion

160
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,180
and will never get his power back.

161
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,060
Mother, are you saying

162
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,380

my throne for Lingzhi?
