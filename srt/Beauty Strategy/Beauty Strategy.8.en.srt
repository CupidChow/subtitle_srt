00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,220
Your Grace,

11
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,980
the clothes have been washed.

12
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,060
Shall I put them in the case?

13
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:07,860
Wait.

14
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,260
Who are you?

15
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,420
Why haven't I seen you before?

16
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,620
I'm just transferred here,

17
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,620
in charge of your chores.

18
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,540
You're working here
at such a young age.

19
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,300
Life must be hard for you.

20
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,180
What about you, Your Grace?

21
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,940
You were once a slave,
yet shortly after you've been promoted,

22
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,420
His Majesty only cares about you.

23
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,860
You must be complacent, right?

24
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,020
Consort Huan is here.

25
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,260
Greetings, Your Grace.

26
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,100
I lost a treasure

27
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,700
and I suspect that someone stole it.

28
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,580
So I'll search your chamber first.

29
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,740
- Yes.
- Yes.

30
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,140
Stop.

31
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,620
All these things
are bestowed by His Majesty.

32
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,820
You smash them so randomly.

33
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,260
Don't you fear
His Majesty will punish you?

34
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,820
If my treasure is found here,

35
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,260
you will actually be the one
to be punished.

36
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,220
Your Grace,

37
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,380
I found it.

38
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,460
It's hidden in Lady Ling's case.

39
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:51,980
Your Grace,

40
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,780

Shall I put them in the case?

42
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,020
Darn it. I underestimated my enemy.

43
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,020
It's the wedding present
from my clan.

44
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,380
How did it end up in your case?

45
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,860
Lady Ling stole a valuable present.

46
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,740
Her hands will be chopped off.

47
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,380
Your Grace, you framed me
and sentenced me terribly.

48
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,260
What if you're held responsible later?

49
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,340
Frame you?

50
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,620
It was found in your case.

51
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,140
All the maids here can be my witness.

52
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,340
Even Her Royal Highness
can't hold me responsible.

53
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,140
As for His Majesty...

54
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,300
He's been surviving so carefully

55
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,620
under the control of Her Royal Highness.

56
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,060
How would he offend me,
a general of the Huan clan,

57
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,100
for a mere slave like you?

58
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,100
Your Majesty,

59
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,780
Lady Ling's maid is here to see you.

60
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,580
Your Majesty, please go save Her Grace.

61
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,020
Consort Huan
is going to cut off her hands.

62
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,580
I get it.

63
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,500
You may leave.

64
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,260
Yes.

65
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,260
Your Majesty,

66
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,540
will you really not
go and save Lady Ling?

67
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,100
Why do I have to save her?

68
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,500
To her, I'm just an Emperor.

69
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,220
Let go of me!

70
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,020
Go.

71
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,660
What are you trying to do?

72
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,420
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

73
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,540
How dare you try to hurt my woman?

74
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,300
Your Majesty, this is really unexpected.

75
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,700
You've come here for a humble slave.

76
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,660
Over all these years,

77
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,780
I've always been confused.

78
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,940
You're such a smart person.

79
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,860
But you would rather care about a slave

80
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,180
and even stand up for her

81
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,060
than accept my kindness.

82
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,340
You can call me Saya.

83
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,340
My clan has been threatened
by the Royal Empress Dowager's army.

84
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,900
You're also oppressed by her power.

85
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,980
Since you and I are married,

86
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,380
we should consider an alliance.

87
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,060
As long as we join forces,

88
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,380
we'll be able to...

89
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,260
Shut up.

90
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,940
Even if we're not an alliance,

91
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,260
you shouldn't have hurt
my beloved woman.

92
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,060
Don't talk to me like this.

93
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,340
In front of me,

94
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,020
you're always a concubine.

95
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,860
You keep flattering me

96
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,100
just to get some power.

97
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,420
If you're not an alliance,

98
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,020
you're an enemy.

99
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,940
Maids of the Phantom clan,
at my command!

100
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,700
Chop off the thief's hands.

101
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,460
In the harem,

102
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,380
I can kill any woman as I want!

103
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,220
I dare you!

104
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,540
If anyone dares to hurt my woman,

105
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,180
she should be prepared to die.

106
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,420
Your Majesty, you'd better

107
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,300
not try to save a little but lose a lot.

108
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,020
You're way too arrogant.

109
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,100
Please don't, Your Majesty.

110
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,660
Her Grace is the general
of the Phantom clan

111
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,100
who maintains the peace
between the two clans.

112
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,420
Mu Xuanjue,

113
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,100
come and kill me.

114
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,500
See if Her Royal Highness

115
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,220
will dethrone you

116
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,100
with this excuse!

117
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,020
Lady Ling,

118
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,940
what are you doing?

119
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,940
Calm down, Your Majesty.

120
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,060
If the loss of my hands

121
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,260
can weaken the Phantom clan,

122
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,060
it'll be worth it.

123
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,420
All the other concubines

124
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,940
are obliged to remain silent
about their resentments to you.

125
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,900
Today, if you chop off my hands

126
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,420
so randomly,

127
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,740
tomorrow,

128
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,820
they'll be against you with this excuse.

129
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,980
Don't be ridiculous.

130
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,140
In the harem,

131
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,620
no other concubine can overwhelm me.

132
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,460
Lately, Her Royal Highness
has blamed your clan for state affairs.

133
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,380
If she has anything on you now,

134
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,580
what will she do?

135
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,180
Maybe someone can't wait

136
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,060
to give you a fatal blow

137
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,460
with the loss of my life.

138
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,220
Say no more to her.

139
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,420
You're injured.

140
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,500
Mu Xuanjue,

141
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,620
you know well
about my position in my clan.

142
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,020
But you still reject
an alliance like me. You...

143
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,260
If you don't leave now,

144
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,900
I'll blame you for framing her.
