[Who Killed His Mother?]

10
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,540
Unexpectedly,

11
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,420
to save my life,

12
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,580
you would rather expose yourself.

13
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,700
The next time we meet,

14
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,340
I'll be coming to marry you.

15
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,340
What kind of wedding do you want?

16
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,220
I heard

17
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,220
the wedding of common people
of your clan is interesting.

18
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,900
The bride has a red veil on her head.

19
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,500
They'll eat and drink at night.

20
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,780
You care so much for me.

21
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,220
I won't disappoint you.

22

25
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,740
This is really weird.

26
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,060
No imperial physician
went to check on him.

27
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,100

00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,860
Yes.

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,460
Your Majesty.

31
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,740
Your Majesty, you're awake.

32
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,740
I'm all right now.

33
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,900
Did anyone else see
what happened last night?

34
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:40,740
No.

35
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,340
But Her Majesty's men just came.

36
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,620
I guess they want to figure out

37
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,060
how you came back to life, Your Majesty.

38
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,860
I've recovered without any treatment.

39
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,460
It's really hard to explain.

40
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,260
Your Majesty,

41
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,700
I know Consort Ling
is meritorious for saving you.

42
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,620
But please focus on the big picture.

43
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,940
With Her Majesty's power,

44
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,300
she will figure out who Consort Ling is
sooner or later.

45
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,420
By then, you can hardly
distance yourself from her.

46
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,500
Why was I so impulsive last night?

47
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,380
Do I have true feelings for Mu Xuanjue?

48
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,620
You want me to sell her out

49
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,660
to calm Her Majesty?

50
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:45,900
Your Majesty,

51
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,060
being soft-hearted will
cause you to lose everything.

52
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,780
This is what you said.

53
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,380
We've been hibernating
to fight back against Her Majesty.

54
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,260
We can't give up for a mere consort.

55
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,220
Say no more.

56
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,180
I have my plan.

57
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,380
She's still useful to me.

58
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,900
Your Majesty, please don't forget

59
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,340
that Princess Shuoye killed your mother.

60
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,740
You've been using and torturing her

61
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,500
just for revenge.

62
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,340
Lingzhi, hear me out.

63
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,660
Why?

64
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,020
Why did you say I killed your mother?

65
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,620
I didn't even know her.

66
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,660
How could I possibly kill her?

67
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,740

69
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,540
Six years ago?

70
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,740
I don't remember anything.

71
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,900
Did I really kill your mother?

72
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,220
Did you see it with your own eyes?

73
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:02,860
Yes.

74
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,300

00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,700
I knew who you were.

83
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,100
I was planning to take revenge.

84

You're a mere maid.

123
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,820
You are in no position to plead for her.

124
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,980
I'd like to exchange a secret

125
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,020
for Her Grace's life.

126
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,860

129

130
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,900
in the palace of the Phantom clan.

131
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,900

00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,580

How do you feel now?

135
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,580
Thanks to your blessing, Mother.

136
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,380
I was wearing a soft armor

137
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,100
so Consort Huan only pierced my flesh

138
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,620
instead of my heart.

139
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,180
Don't worry, Mother.

140
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,260
Is that true?

141
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,140
The night you were injured,

142
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,180
was Consort Ling keeping you company?

143
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,660
Your Majesty,

144
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,620
I know some simple medical skills.

145
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,260
I then took care of His Majesty
when he was asleep.

146
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,060
Simple medical skills?

147
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,660
I didn't know

148
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,300
you who was once a slave
could cure people.

149
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,860
Before I came to the palace,

150
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,980
I once

151
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,700
was a quack doctor's apprentice.

152
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,460
I wonder how much more

153
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,420
you're going to surprise me.

154
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,860
Consort Ling is meritorious
to protect me.

155
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,980
But Mother, you're so indifferent.

156
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,620
Does my survival

157
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,740
upset you?

158
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,460
I think you're shocked
by Consort Huan's assassination.

159
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,980
You seem to forget
you should kneel to me

160
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
when you meet me alone.

161
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,140
His Majesty hasn't fully recovered

162
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,180
and it's inconvenient
for him to kneel now.

163
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,900
Your Majesty, please forgive him.

164
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,780
How about I kneel
on behalf of His Majesty?

165
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,380
You're in no position to talk here!

166
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:08,980
Mu Xuanjue,

167
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,100
I'm the Royal Empress Dowager,
after all.

168
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,620
Don't forget

169
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,380
who made you the Emperor.

170
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,940
When the Human army
broke into the Spirit Shrine,

171
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,540
the Royal Empress Dowager
threatened our clan to send an assassin

172
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,620
with the extinction of our clan.

173
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,140
Disguised as Princess Shuoye

174
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,060
with our forbidden spell,

175
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,380
he killed your mother

176
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,820
and framed the Spirit clan.

177
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,060
The one behind this tragedy

178
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,420
is Her Majesty.

179
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,260
I'm wrong.

180
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,380
I won't forget how you've raised me.

181
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,620
I'll always keep it in mind

182
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,700
and never forget it.

183
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,380
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

184
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,740
Reflect on yourself.

185
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,140
If you dare to contradict me again,

186
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,460
you'll have to bear the consequences.

187
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,260
Mother,

188
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,740
I've found out the real murderer
who killed you.

189
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,140
When I can tell everyone

190
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,540
what she has done,

191
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,860
I will kill her

192
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,300
and avenge you.

193
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:08,820
Sorry.

194
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,340
Your Majesty, don't say this.

195
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,420
Just now, you helped me out.

196
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,060
I'm really grateful.

197
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,140
Wait a minute.

198
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,060
Go somewhere with me.

199
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,340
I'll explain everything to you.

200
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,820
Are you saying

201
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,900
that the one who killed your mother

202
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,860
wasn't me,

203
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,140
but Her Majesty?

204
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,140
Before, I was deceived by the illusion

205
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,260
and got you wrong.

206
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,100
Can you forgive me?

207
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:05,940
Yes, of course.

208
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,380
We've been through this much.

209
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,900
I'll continue to assist you

210
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,660
as your consort.

211
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,140
Will you only

212
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,980
be my subordinate?

213
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,780
Your Grace, His Majesty
wants to see you.

214
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,220
It's so late.

215
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,100
What does His Majesty want me for?

216
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,780
His Majesty is waiting for you
in the Chenning Palace.

217
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,340
