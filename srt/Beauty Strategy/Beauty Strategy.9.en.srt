Don't miss even a single detail.

41
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,180
Your Majesty, are you trying
to deceive Her Royal Highness

42
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,140
by making use of the fact
of defending Lady Ling?

43
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,180
For a humble slave, the Emperor

44
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,460
actually offended the daughter
of the commander of Phantom's army.

45
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,500
I used to worry

46
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,780
he would launch an attack
with Consort Huan

47
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,540
when I sent my army
to deal with the Phantom clan.

48
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,060
Congratulations, Your Royal Highness.

49
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,340
When His Majesty misses
the great chance for a woman,

50
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,620
you'll have nothing to worry about.

51
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,620
That's not true.

52
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,980
The Emperor is the most shameless
and insidious person in the palace.

53
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,740
He'll never act rashly

54
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,300

56
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,620
Yes.

Your Royal Highness

63
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,940
will unify the five clans.

64
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,140
What are you doing?

65
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,820
- Sorry, Your Grace. Please forgive us.
- Sorry, Your Grace. Please forgive us.

66
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,660
How will you punish them, Lady Ling?

67
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,460
Punish them?

68
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,900
Why do you say that, Your Majesty?

69
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,780
These maids are careless, ignorant,

70
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,100
cowardly, and useless.

71
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,020
They remained indifferent
when their Lady was framed.

72
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,580
They deserve to be executed.

73
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,220
Please spare us,
Your Majesty and Your Grace.

74
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,460
Your Majesty, they were indeed at fault.

75
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,500
But it was because I failed
to discipline them well.

76
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,820
They don't deserve to die.

77
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:31,820
Lingzhi,

78
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,340
I can't always keep you safe.

79
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,940
So, from now on,

80
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,660
you must learn
how to survive in the palace.

81
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,620
Lady Ling, I don't want to die.

82
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,300
I still need to take care
of my sick parents outside the palace.

83
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,460
- We don't want to die, either.
- We don't want to die, either.

84
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,780
Keep it in mind.

85
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,660
Being soft-hearted

86
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,500
is the deadliest weakness in the palace.

87
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,780
You're right, Your Majesty.

88
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,340
They should be punished.

89
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,180
But please, Your Majesty.

90
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,220
Let me punish them personally.

91
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,340
Good.

92
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,620
Lady Ling,

93
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,500
I hope you will not let me down.

94
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,860
From this day on,

95
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,540
we're in the same boat.

96
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,060
I've paid the price

97
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,660
for my carelessness.

98
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,100
Now, it's your turn.

99
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,060
I need you to remember only two rules.

100
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,740
First,

101
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,420
if anyone fails her job
or colludes with my enemy,

102
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:24,940
I will...

103
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,260
I will...

104
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,260
Lady Ling,

105
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,180
from now on,

106
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,500
learn how to survive in the palace.

107
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,740
"First,

108
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,740
if anyone fails her job
or colludes with my enemy,

109
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,900
however much I'm hurt,

110
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,820
I'll give her the same pain."

111
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,380
- Please punish me, Your Grace.
- Please punish me, Your Grace.

112
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,620
My second rule.

113
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,860
For the one,
who is loyal and keeps her duty,

114
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,500
every time I'm honored,

115
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,900
you'll be rewarded.

116
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,460
Peixin went to beg His Majesty
to help me.

117
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,340
From now on,

118
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,940
she's the maid in charge.

119
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,900
Thank you, Your Grace.

120
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,180
Thank you, Your Grace.

121
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,540

122
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,620
Lady Ling,

123
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,380
do you like this present

124
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,700
I give you?

125
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,900

126
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,860
- We'll obey your rules.
- We'll obey your rules.

127
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,500
Your Majesty, I'll carefully remember

128
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,540
what you've taught me.

129
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,660
Go to die!

130
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,460
Madam.

131
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,980
Madam, I beg you.

132
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,300
Let me go and see Lady Ling.

133
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,780
I'll kowtow to you.

134
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:55,700
Please, Madam.

135
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,380
That slave's hands

136
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,180
have been chopped off by Consort Huan.

137
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,220
This is how mongrels like you
should end up!

138
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,580

147
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,060

who insulted her master.

148
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,140
Knock out all her teeth

149
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,780
so that she can never
say the word "mongrel" again.

150
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,180
- Yes.
- Yes.

151
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,380

00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,180

160
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,780
Get up.

Qingyan,

162
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,700
I'm taking you out of here.

163

You're no longer a slave,

164
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,020
but my personal maid.

165
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,940
Thank you, Lingzhi.

166
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,140
