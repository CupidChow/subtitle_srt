Do you have any idea

369
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,767
what you're talking about?

370
00:24:30,767 --> 00:24:32,000
I'm serious.

371
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,433
I'm seriously asking you now.

372
00:24:38,033 --> 00:24:39,267
Hey.

373
00:24:39,267 --> 00:24:40,667
You get out of here with these.

374
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:53,200
This one is for Balgeum.

375
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,267
Buy one get one.

376
00:24:56,633 --> 00:24:59,167
Right, he's the one who's
too familiar with being loved.

377
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:00,400
She asked me for my number.

378
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,667
So everything is easy to get for him.

379
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,833
Why am I not asking you out?

380
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:08,667
Yeah.

381
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:10,333
I like you, Jeong Gi Seop.

382
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:12,267
Then you can just say something like that.

383
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:15,833
What are you going to do then?

384
00:25:16,867 --> 00:25:18,133
I have to accept it.

385
00:25:18,867 --> 00:25:20,300
That's why I'm not asking you out.

386
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:23,933
'Cuz I hate you.

387
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:34,033
I was really just going to stay one night.

388
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,300
What?

389
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,433
I don't think it's enough.

390
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:40,867
Listen, Kim Jin Woo.

391
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,900
Now.

392
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,100
Exactly one week from now,

393
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,200
at 10:14 p.m.,

394
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:52,200
you're going to ask me out.

395
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,833
I'm not asking someone like you.

396
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:56,467
- You are.
- I'm not.

397
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,733
I won't.

398
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:04,467
Here's what's going on.

399
00:26:04,467 --> 00:26:05,533
First,

400
00:26:05,533 --> 00:26:07,700
Jeong Gi Seop came to my place.

401
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:10,133
Second,

402
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:11,867
he's garbage.

403
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:14,600
Third,

404
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:17,667
Jeong Gi Seop…

405
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:20,967
I think you're cool.
What do you think about me?

406
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
I like him.
