Excuse me, but may I know what time it is?

179
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:24,945
Oh, it's 2:15 now.

180
00:15:24,945 --> 00:15:28,114
Thank you. Can I ask you one more favor?

181
00:15:28,114 --> 00:15:29,157
What?

182
00:15:29,157 --> 00:15:30,825
I made a reservation.

183
00:15:30,825 --> 00:15:34,204
Can I borrow your phone?
I'd like to get directions on a map.

184
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,124
Thank you.

185
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:44,422
But

186
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,008
why do you look so familiar?

187
00:15:54,641 --> 00:15:56,393
You are the one

188
00:15:58,228 --> 00:15:59,229
who played piano?

189
00:15:59,229 --> 00:16:03,775
Oh, I saw you too when I was in school.
Balgeum's friend.

190
00:16:03,775 --> 00:16:07,821
Right, you were with Balgeum
at that time, right?

191
00:16:07,821 --> 00:16:09,656
Let me find the directions with map.

192
00:16:13,994 --> 00:16:15,370
Where do I go from here?

193
00:16:30,802 --> 00:16:31,970
What are you doing now?

194
00:16:33,555 --> 00:16:35,348
I happened to meet your friend.

195
00:16:35,348 --> 00:16:37,058
What wrong with your hair?

196
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:42,230
I met your friend right here.
Isn't it really amazing?

197
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,523
Who's my friend?

198
00:16:43,523 --> 00:16:44,607
What?

199
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,696
Let's go.

200
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:50,947
Choi Balgeum.

201
00:16:51,781 --> 00:16:53,742
Please go away, huh?

202
00:16:55,535 --> 00:16:57,871
Choi Balgeum, look at me.

203
00:17:00,165 --> 00:17:01,374
Can't you see this?

204
00:17:01,374 --> 00:17:07,797
Can't you notice this?
How many times do I have to say this?

205
00:17:07,797 --> 00:17:10,300
Please don't follow me.

206
00:17:12,385 --> 00:17:15,513
Don't ever appear in front of me again.

207
00:17:15,513 --> 00:17:16,973
Because it's so embarrassing.

208
00:17:20,727 --> 00:17:21,728
Let's just go.

209
00:17:21,728 --> 00:17:23,313
Why are you doing this?

210
00:17:27,484 --> 00:17:29,235
[Tattoo shop]

211
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,615
Hey.

212
00:17:33,615 --> 00:17:36,242
Uh? Kim Jin Woo?

213
00:17:40,747 --> 00:17:42,499
- Hey.
- Hurry and get on.

214
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,251
Hey, Kim Jin Woo.

215
00:17:45,251 --> 00:17:47,420
Ah. Wait.

216
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,005
I said "get on".

217
00:17:49,005 --> 00:17:50,840
Why are you doing that?

218
00:18:11,194 --> 00:18:15,448
[It's the tattoo shop. 30 minutes past the time.
Reservation canceled.]

219
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:30,964
I'm so frustrated.

220
00:18:30,964 --> 00:18:32,006
What's frustrating?

221
00:18:32,006 --> 00:18:34,884
Why are you doing this?
Why did you bring me here?

222
00:18:37,846 --> 00:18:39,806
I have to go meet Kim Jin Woo.

223
00:18:45,937 --> 00:18:47,147
Oh my. What should I do?

224
00:18:47,147 --> 00:18:51,526
I have to get a mole tattoo.
No, I have to meet Kim Jin Woo first.

225
00:18:52,402 --> 00:18:53,528
I'm off now.

226
00:19:45,121 --> 00:19:46,706
That's right.

227
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:02,013
Kim Jin Woo.

228
00:20:12,357 --> 00:20:13,775
Kim Jin Woo.

229
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:20,823
Kim Jin Woo. Are you in there?

230
00:20:23,284 --> 00:20:24,369
Kim Jin Woo.

231
00:20:33,294 --> 00:20:35,797
Why did I hide?

232
00:20:38,341 --> 00:20:40,176
So, I have something to tell you.

233
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:45,974
One, the guy from earlier
was Choi Balgeum's friend.

234
00:20:46,808 --> 00:20:48,017
I don't know his name.

235
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,313
Two, but there seems to be a story behind it.

236
00:20:52,313 --> 00:20:55,316
So, Choi Balgeum overreacted

237
00:20:55,316 --> 00:20:57,318
and took advantage of me

238
00:20:57,318 --> 00:20:58,987
to get him off.

239
00:21:05,535 --> 00:21:06,577
Three,

240
00:21:09,372 --> 00:21:11,165
Choi Balgeum is just like my family.

241
00:21:16,629 --> 00:21:19,173
We can never be in a relationship like that.

242
00:21:19,173 --> 00:21:21,718
So, don't get me wrong.

243
00:21:21,718 --> 00:21:24,012
Because I have nothing to do with anyone.

244
00:21:44,073 --> 00:21:45,325
You're running away again?

245
00:21:47,744 --> 00:21:48,745
I told you.

246
00:21:49,996 --> 00:21:51,331
I'll sleep with you today.

247
00:21:56,419 --> 00:21:58,129
Why are you doing this?

248
00:21:59,422 --> 00:22:02,091
What is this?
Why did you suddenly appear like this?

249
00:22:02,091 --> 00:22:04,385
You like surprises.

250
00:22:04,385 --> 00:22:08,681
What should I do? What can I do for you?

251
00:22:10,475 --> 00:22:13,603
Why did you come here?
Don't you still have to be in the US?

252
00:22:13,603 --> 00:22:14,937
What about playing piano?

253
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:35,291
Why do you keep hiding?

254
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:40,296
I thought it would be fine if I avoid him.

255
00:22:40,296 --> 00:22:41,798
Why do you keep hiding?

256
00:22:46,969 --> 00:22:50,807
I thought it would be fine
if I pushed him away as possible as I can.

257
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,522
I don't…

258
00:23:02,902 --> 00:23:04,570
I don't know.

259
00:23:08,783 --> 00:23:09,784
I like you.

260
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,665
I still like you.

261
00:23:15,665 --> 00:23:16,707
So, I came here.

262
00:23:20,795 --> 00:23:22,004
And you?

263
00:23:26,426 --> 00:23:29,345
- No, don't tell me.
- I still

264
00:23:31,556 --> 00:23:32,932
hate you.

265
00:23:33,975 --> 00:23:36,227
Then and now, I ran away because I hated you.

266
00:23:36,227 --> 00:23:39,439
So, don't ever appear
in front of me again. Please.

267
00:23:40,606 --> 00:23:41,941
No, you don't.

268
00:23:41,941 --> 00:23:43,401
Think whatever you want.

269
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:46,112
Don't do this to me.

270
00:23:46,112 --> 00:23:48,948
I really regret it every day. Because of you.

271
00:23:48,948 --> 00:23:51,951
Why did I do that with a guy like you?
It's so disgusting.

272
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:53,911
- So…
- Bastard.

273
00:23:57,088 --> 00:23:58,291
So, please.

274
00:24:23,191 --> 00:24:26,444
The more I run away,
the more I have to face it head on.

275
00:24:26,444 --> 00:24:27,778
Lights off.

276
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,324
Did I find it out too late?

277
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:36,204
Or, did I find it out too early?

278
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:08,546
Please meet me three times.
Then I'll do as you say.

279
00:26:08,546 --> 00:26:09,797
Let go.

280
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,091
If we meet three times…

281
00:26:12,091 --> 00:26:13,134
All right, so

282
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,973
let go. I understood.
