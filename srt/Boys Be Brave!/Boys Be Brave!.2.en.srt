You live only once.

Why does everyone live so difficult?

Excuse me.

7
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,010
Hi, oh, my God.
You've got a lot of blessings on your face.

8
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:22,100
But I can see something weird in my eyes.

9
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,140
You'll be in trouble if you let it be.

10
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,850
Can I talk to you for a moment?

11
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:29,940
Sure!

12
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,860
I'll do as you say, yes.

13
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,323
I think you need to

14
00:01:34,323 --> 00:01:36,992
make a big ritual to your ancestors.

15
00:01:36,992 --> 00:01:38,780
Okay.

It seems like this might take a lot of time.

17

- Do you

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,830

Yes.

- Yes, great.

Don't just make a decision,

That's how things work.

32
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,160
What the hell. You're such a weirdo.

33
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,330
You look so attractive.

34
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,840
- What about talking with me?
- I don't want to.

35
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,550
- Just for a moment.
- No, what's wrong with you?

36
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,090
It's her.

37
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,550
- What about go somewhere quiet and have a talk?
- No, I don't want to.

38
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:47,890
No? Have I ever said no in my life?

39
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:53,270
I don't know when it started
and why it happened.

40
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,980
I think I had a reason for that.

41

No.

42
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,530
And then I met Kim Jin Woo.

Grab his hand.

00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,200
Grab his hand.

46
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,210
- Let me just drink.
- You're drinking this?

47
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,540
Hey, Kim Jin Woo.

48
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,880
Just grab my hand. I'm embarrassed here.

49
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,750
Wait, wait.

50
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,720
I want to drink as well.

51
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,300
Oh.

52
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,340

53
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,350
Black knight!

54
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,930
Black knight!

55
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,260
It's no big deal to hold a hand. It's nothing.

56
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,470
He said he didn't want to do
anything he didn't like.

57
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:13,520
He had a really challenging life.
So that was interesting.

00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,270

I think you're cool.
What do you think about me?

62
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,990
I already knew he likes me.

63
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,580
I'm used to the way they look at me

00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,160

65
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,710
You were exactly like them.

67

I'm not. I won't.

I'm not surprised.

70
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,770
You've got so many people
asking you out like that.

71
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,730
You think I'm one of them, right?

72
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,690
- What?
- I'm different

73

What?

75
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:11,290
I will never ask out someone like you because…

76
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,290
Because?

77
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:17,420
You're not my type.

78
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,290

What's wrong with you?

158

Okay.

160

Wrong. You need to become a spicy

173
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,543
That'll make him at least look at you, right?

the detailed criteria that he likes, right?

Dig?

180

Dig deep to see what's inside him.

181

Then you'll figure out what he likes,
what he likes more,

183
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,060
Perfectly understood.

184
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,690
It's weird you've got smart all of sudden.

185
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,570
Here's the pork cutlet that you ordered.

186
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,260
What was that chase with him yesterday anyway?

187
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,180
Oh, that was fun.

188
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,850
Did you go back home?

189
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,810
I must've been seeing things these days.
Yesterday as well.

190
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,100
Who did you see?

191
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:17,810
Ji In Ho?

192
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,940
I imagined that.

193
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,980
Isn't that what you bought yesterday?

194
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,240
Oh, your present.

195
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,490
What, did you buy my present yesterday?

196
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,990
I bought both yours and Jin Woo's.

197
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:36,000
Thank you so much. Did Jin Woo get the present?

198
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,500
Yeah, his shoes are red.

199
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,340
I'll take it guilt-free, my friend.

200
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,420
Let me

201
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,380
repay you later. Good! Let's dive in.

202
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,840
Help yourself.

203
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,930
I've gotta go now.

204
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,220
To where?

205
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,430
To find out Kim Jin Woo's type.

206
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,180
What are you talking about?

207
00:14:05,632 --> 00:14:09,152
[One last thing to give you. Can you come out?]

208
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:22,590
Are you saying I'm going to eat this all alone?

209
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,880
Exactly.

210
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,300
I bought it for you.

211
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,380
I had a hunch you'd like the spicy
sweet potato cheese pork cutlet.

212
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,720
I'm the one who buy you something delicious.

213
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,226
Don't you want to ask me out?

214
00:14:33,226 --> 00:14:34,890
Not at all.

215
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Why not?

216
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,060
I hate pork cutlets.

217
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,060
Oh my.

218
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,240
Was it cold?

219
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,280
What?

220
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,240
Yesterday.

221
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,040
Was it cold?

222
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,290
I found this morning that
the windows wouldn't close.

223
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:06,090
I told you. But you kept trying to kick me out.

224
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,130
I didn't know they were broken.

225
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,840
It's fine.

226
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,050
But if it weren't for you,

227
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,680
I'd have been sleeping outside.

228
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:15,890
Kim Jin Woo.

229
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,230
Are you going somewhere today?

230
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,190
Are you staying home today?

231
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,870
You're getting a fever, aren't you?

232
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,990
Am I?

233
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,760
It's hot.

234
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,970
What did I eat yesterday?
I just drank the banana milk.

235
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,100
Banana milk?

236
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,310
Banana milk in the fridge.

237
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,060
That's six months past its expiration date.

238
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,060
Huh?

239
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,810
What were you thinking?

240
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,360
Am I getting an upset stomach?

241
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,070
Hey.

242
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,190
What?

243
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:12,030
I've got an upset stomach
and my heart just started hurting.

244
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,280
What?

245
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,360
Well.

246
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,280
My heart just started beating faster.

247
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,250
I'll get some medicine.

248
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,620
Medicine?

249
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,670
What do you take when you're sick? You want to
get something with acetaminophen in it?

250
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,220
Acetaphen what?

251
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,220
What do you eat when you don't feel very good?

252
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,300
Chicken?

253
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,890
Okay.

254
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,810
Am I sick for real?

255
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,290
It's not the time to do this.
I need to dig it through.

256
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,830
Now.

257
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:09,670
There will be hints about
Kim Jin Woo's type in this forbidden area.

Why did you give me Xs?

Hey!

269
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,170
Did you look through my house?

270
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,250
Erase it.

271
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,340
Or put a circle behind them…

272
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,670
Who said it's okay to do that?

273
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,800

What are you to rummage through my house?

276
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,350
It's not a rummage. I didn't mean to see it.

277
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,440
Get out now.

278
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,360
It's not my fault.
The box over there just fell off.

279
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,620
I said "get out."

280
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,240
I don't want to.

00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,992

- I won't.

00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,000
Just one last time, please check
I am absolutely not your type.
