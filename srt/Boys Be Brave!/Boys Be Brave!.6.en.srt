Okay. We'll bring them right away.

181
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,240
You did that last time too.
You ordered a lot again.

182
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,320
Eat them up.

183
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,780
If we get sleepy after eating again,
should we just stay here?

184
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,620
That's a bit…

185
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,200
I need to use the restroom.

186
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,210
Okay.

187
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,380
[Coupon 80,000 won]

188
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,780
Weren't you using the restroom?

189
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,490
I stepped out for a second.

190
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,700
It's my gift to you.
Thanks so much for everything today.

191
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,080
A gift?

192
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,290
I got another one when I was buying mine.

193
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,460
You can't really check your messages
when you're doing your part-time work.

194
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,050
I want to check your messages right away too.
I asked a nearby place to hold it for me,

195
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,170
so that I can surprise you.

196
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,020
Your food is ready.

197
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,570
Balgeum, it looks delicious. Let's enjoy it.

198
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,950
Enjoy your food.

199
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,910
Are you okay? Is something going on?

200
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,920
I never asked you for this.

201
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,420
Come on. I just wanted you to have it--

202
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,420
I don't need things like this.

203
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,560
You barely ate anything.

204
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,310
My stomach feels a little funny.

205
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,690
- Shall we go now?
- Okay.

206
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,410
Please charge this card.

207
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,160
That would be 83,000 won.

208
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,160
Pardon?

209
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,040
Isn't it 79,000 won?

210
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,550
You ordered three dishes and two drinks.
So the total is 83,000 won.

211
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,760
No way.

212
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,938
Can I see your menu again? I'm sure--

213
00:19:28,938 --> 00:19:30,020
One moment.

214
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,100
Please use this one.

215
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:36,190
But I'm sure I saw it correctly.

216
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,280
Thank you for the food.
I really enjoyed it, Balgeum.

217
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,120
Choi Balgeum.

218
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,290
We finished eating too quickly.
Where should we go next?

219
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,500
Do you want to go get a drink?
We never had a drink together.

220
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,510
I looked up a bar nearby
and it had a good ambiance.

221
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,600
You don't feel like going to a bar?

222
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,350
Then should we just go home?

223
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,600
We can just get some drinks
from a convenience store and drink at home--

224
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Shouldn't you go home?

225
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,850
What?

226
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,320
You didn't quit piano, right?
When are you going back?

227
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,900
You should go back to your house, not mine.

228
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,250
Should I quit piano

229
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,410
and just stay here with you?

230
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,840
- I like the way things are now--
- No.

231
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,510
I don't like the way things are now. Go back.

232
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,180
Sorry. I'll get going first.

233
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,140
Choi Balgeum.

234
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,820
Choi Balgeum.

235
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,280
Let's just end this.

236
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,240
What's the matter with you today?

237
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,410
It's not just today.

238
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,500
I knew it wouldn't work from the beginning.

239
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,960
I shouldn't have started it.

240
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,750
Is it because I didn't go ahead
and watch the movie first?

241
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,550
Or because I can't eat much?
If not, because of the gift?

242
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:23,340
Just tell me and I'll change.
I'll do as you say.

243
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,880
It's not like that.

244
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,760
Then what is it?
How would I know if you don't tell me?

245
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,390
I can't just let you go again like this
without even knowing why.

246
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,020
It's because I feel ashamed.

247
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,390
I feel ashamed that I'm broke
and that my family has become poor.

248
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,860
I'm struggling to earn
a meager income to be with you

249
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,030
and to spend a day together.

250
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,280
But I'm even ashamed to be happy for a second
when I received an expensive gift.

251
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,950
It was the same back then.

252
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,870
I was ashamed that my family had become poor.
That was the reason.

253
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Ji In Ho.

254
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:06,340
I still like you.
I lied when I said I didn't like you.

255
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,640
I still like you so much,

256
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,390
but I really hate myself.

257
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,680
I really hate myself for being like this.

258
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,480
Choi Balgeum.

259
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,310
I hate myself even more when I'm with you.

260
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,650
Even this moment.

261
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,400
So…

262
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:31,820
So, please. Let's just end it here.
