But yesterday…

14
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:46,533
That's because I hadn't resolved an issue.

15
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,233
Resolve what?

16
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:51,467
I finally took care of it all.

It was total nonsense to begin with.

I just said I would because you asked me to.

even now,

I don't even want to think about it.

now I know how to calm it down.

you meant you were moving there?
Not just traveling or studying there?

Yes.

00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:43,600
You improved from the way
you used to be in high school.

186
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,467
You tried to go out with him at least,
you know?

187
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:50,300
It's true, right?

188
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,967
How can I be hungry right now?

189
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:05,233
It's natural to be hungry.
You're a human. Let's go eat.

190
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:09,000
Okay.

191
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:13,200
One second. Let me go put on a jacket.

192
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,233
Okay.

193
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,700
Oh, right. Jin Woo's outside too.

194
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,033
I know, you punk.

195
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:20,700
Let's go together.

196
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,667
How did you know?

197
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:26,167
How would I not?

198
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:27,767
You look so happy right now.

199
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,967
Hey! Did you know?

200
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:34,500
Jin Woo lied about hating pork cutlet.

201
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,800
I thought he really hated it, you know?

202
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,000
Okay, I heard you. Let's go.

203
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,133
Yes, okay. I'll give you a call. Thank you.

204
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,367
So, are you going to work part-time again?

205
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:51,300
I'll see how it goes.

206
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,700
I'll go to my old work first and apologize.

207
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,833
Hey, the owner of Kojubu
where I filled in last time called me.

208
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:01,567
He wanted me to ask you
if you'd be interested in this.

He'll pay us a lot too.

212
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:11,333
- Interested?
- Yes.

213
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:14,867
But it'll be a lot of work for just two people.

214
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,167
Why just two?

215
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:20,233
You and me.

216
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,500
You're going to do it too?

217
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:25,667
But aren't you busy studying or something?

218
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:26,967
Well…

219
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:29,300
If Gi Seop does it, I'll do it too.

220
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,367
Do you want to do it?

221
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:38,667
Okay.

222
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:40,867
Hey, then give him a call.

223
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:42,333
You go call him.

224
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,900
I'll go talk to him tomorrow.

225
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:46,500
Okay.

00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,233
Yes?

00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,100
Yes.

229
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,567
Yes, the three of us will be there.

230
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:10,000
Okay.

00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:24,333

What do you mean?

235
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:36,033
Well, I don't mean anything else.

236
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:38,167
You're smart,

237
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:39,533
so I'm just curious what you think.

238
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:43,633
I've just been doing part-time jobs
or whatever to pay off my debt,

239
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,667
but I don't want to do that anymore.

240

But I'm not sure what to do.

241
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:51,500
I think I should study,
but I have to earn money too.

242
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,633
Well, I just want to live differently
for the first time.

243
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,900
Talking to Jeong Gi Seop wouldn't help much.

244
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,300
No, I'm not looking down on him.

245
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:07,033
Actually, I've been wanting
to ask you for a while

246
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:08,533
why you always work only part-time.

247
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,933
Let me think it through for you.

248
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,700
Thank you.

00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,167
Oh, right. Kim Jin Woo.

250
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,167
Yes?

251
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,933
I think Gi Seop really likes you.

Gi Seop, because you promoted it,
it's a total hit.

257

Why don't you just work here from now on?

What?

00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,000
He's doing a good job.

266

That's not easy to do.

I'm sorry that I made you feel that way.

302
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,567
It's because I liked you.

303
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:17,300
I didn't feel ashamed or care at all
in front of others,

304
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,967
but because I liked you,
I could only see my shortcomings.

So,

306
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,300
it's not your fault.

for making you feel that way.

340
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:42,767

to get 100 of my wishes granted.

One. To be happy with Jeong Gi Seop.

Three. To laugh every day.

Four. For Gi Seop to be healthy.

351
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:47,700
Honestly, too many wishes. What do I do?

352
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,967
How am I going to write them all down?

353
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,333
- What are you doing?
- What?

354
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:55,933
What about work?

355
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:58,333
It's sold out, so he said
we can just relax and enjoy ourselves.

356
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,033
Really?

357
00:23:00,033 --> 00:23:01,167
Did you finish writing down your wishes?

358
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:05,467
I'm going to do it now.

359
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,533
Did you guys finish writing yours?

360
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,700
- Yes.
- Yes.

361
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:10,733
Already?

362
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:14,233
Okay. May I have your attention, please?

of the year.

365
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:25,567
Let's all do it together.

366
00:23:27,267 --> 00:23:28,900
You already wrote down your wishes?

367
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,200
Yes. I only have one wish anyway.

368
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,200
You too?

369
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,267
Yes, me too.

370
00:23:34,267 --> 00:23:35,633
What's your wish?

371
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:37,733
Ten.

372
00:23:38,933 --> 00:23:39,933
Nine.

373
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,933
Eight.

374
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,767
We're not supposed to say it before midnight.

375
00:23:45,767 --> 00:23:47,967
- It won't come true then.
- Really?

376
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:49,200
Seven.

377
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,300
- You're not going to tell me, either?
- No.

378
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,433
Six.

379
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,200
Write it down now. Time's almost up.

380
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,467
Five.

381
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:04,300
Four.

382
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,233
Please help me become a better person.

383
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,100
At our third date,

384
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,467
please help me confess
my feelings to Balgeum properly.

385
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,733
My wish is…

386
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:33,367
Jeong Gi Seop,

387
00:24:33,367 --> 00:24:35,233
your wish could come true.

388
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:40,967
Two.

389
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:42,400
One.

390
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:11,533
Kim Jin Woo.

391
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:13,933
My wish is

392
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,067
to see next year's first "snow" together.

393
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:20,333
[Hope Jeong Gi Seop's wishes come true.]
[To see next year's first snow with Kim Jin Woo.]

394
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:23,767
And to recognize each other at first sight.

395
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,600
[Thank you for watching "Boys Be Brave!"]
