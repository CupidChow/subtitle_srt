- Hello, Jin Woo.

00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,433
I'm a student in Professor Kim's lab.

00:00:55,433 --> 00:00:58,000
There was an accident
while I was going to pick up

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,433
the documents he asked for.

6
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:00,500
What?

7
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,100
The professor said
he asked your friend to do it.

8
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,600
To Jeong Gi Seop?

00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:11,400
Ah, yes.

12
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,667
I think the professor requested it urgently

13
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:16,333
because it was such an important document.

14
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,300
