1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,980
Let's just save the country,

2
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,900
and we'll certainly be together forever."

3
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,300
Our action material files.

4
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,500
Don't forget to check them.

5
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,620
OK.

6
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,540
Be careful.

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,200
Hu

8
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:12,940
Creations

9
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,540
Keep an eye on the front and back gate.

10
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,440
Don't let anyone really know it.

11
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:17,540
Yes.

12
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,760
A little되 Capoditch

13
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,000
Well well well

14
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Great.

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Master, we have a guest.

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Which guest?

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Come in.

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Enough.

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Grandfather, it's the third son of the Zhuang family, Zhuang Hanyan.

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He didn't invite himself.

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
He must have some ulterior motives.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I've seen him before.

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
He's a smart and capable man.

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Grandfather, didn't you hear?

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He has many tricks and is good at climbing.

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
This year,

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Noble Consort Miao personally gave him a jade bracelet.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He has a good relationship with Noble Consort Miao?

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Greetings, Lord Deng and Childe Deng.

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I didn't know that

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
you came.

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Zhuang Hanyan, we didn't

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
write any letter to the Fu family, did we?

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I heard that you are a beautiful lady.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Now you have the imperial edict

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and you're getting a good reputation.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I came to visit you.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I hope that you can forgive me.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Young Mistress,

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
you're so kind and considerate.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This is a good thing.

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Come in and have some tea.

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Madam Fu, this way, please.

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Congratulations, Deng Gong.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Congratulations, Deng Gong.

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Brother Wen Zheng, congratulations.

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Congratulations, Deng Gong.

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Congratulations, Deng Gong.

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Congratulations, Deng Gong.

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Congratulations, Deng Gong.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Congratulations, Deng Gong.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Congratulations, Deng Gong.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Congratulations, Deng Gong.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Congratulations, Deng Gong.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Congratulations, Deng Gong.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Congratulations, Deng Gong.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Congratulations, Deng Gong.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Congratulations, Deng Gong.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Congratulations, Deng Gong.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Congratulations, Deng Gong.

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Good.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This is really good.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This is the imperial edict of His Majesty.

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The family is so glorious.

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I am very happy.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Brother Wen Zheng, you're wrong.

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Everyone in the court knows

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
that you care about the family's reputation.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Today, you're so honored.

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's a matter of a couple.

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Congratulations.

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Sister Deng Chan,

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Sister Deng Chan.

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Miss, this is the young mistress of the Fu family.

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The virtue of a woman is greater than the real.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You, Mr. Zheng, are still lucky.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Your family Ziyan and Deng Gong's granddaughter

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
are married.

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Your daughter is a mother.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
By then, your family will be able to

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
have this great honor.

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Brother Wen Zheng, don't talk nonsense.

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You're cursing my family.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Come, come, come.

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Please.

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Greetings, everyone.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
My mother is the leading role today.

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Please come in.

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Please come in.

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yes.

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Everyone, come, come, come.

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Take a look.

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Please come in.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Thank you for waiting.

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Madam Zhang is here.

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Come, come, come. Please sit inside.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Everyone, please sit.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Okay, okay, okay.

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Madam has been a widow for many years.

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I think it's not easy for her to be with you.

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
In my opinion,

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
how can a woman be easy?

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I think being a widow is hard.

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's hard to protect your husband and children.

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's hard to protect your husband and children.

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Each has its own hard way.

108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Madam, at the end of the day,

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
at least there is a way to protect them.

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But we...

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What's wrong with you?

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's a happy day.

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Come, come, let's have a toast.

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Come. Madam.

115
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Madam.

116
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Come, come, come.

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let's drink again.

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Okay, okay.

119
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Come.

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's okay.

121
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Come, come, come.

122
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Don't be a little rascal.

123
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You can't waste your money.

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You're so good.

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Look at you.

126
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Qing'er, have you seen Zhuang Hanyan?

127
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Young Master, Madam Fu said she was coming to change.

128
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I was afraid she was lost, so I followed her out to see her.

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But I didn't see her.

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Wu'er,

131
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
your mother has been ill for many years.

132
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I pray that

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
you will be in heaven

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and be our master.

135
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Now,

136
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
it's all in our hands.

137
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
For sixteen years,

138
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
you have been the best in the world

139
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and always be filial.

140
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Now,

141
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
you are the best.

142
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
For sixteen years,

143
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
you have been the best in the world

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and always be filial.

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Today,

146
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,920
you have the

147
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,920
honor of being the master.

148
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,920
Grandfather.

149
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,920
Third Master,

150
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,920
come here.

151
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,920
Grandfather,

152
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,920
I saw Zhuang Hanyan

153
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,920
sneak out of the banquet hall.

154
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,920
I followed her out.

155
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,920
I don't know why she disappeared.

156
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,840
I don't know why she disappeared.

157
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,840
How is it?

158
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,840
I didn't see any news.

159
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,840
The banquet is about to end.

160
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,840
Is it because you have the wrong news?

161
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,840
Yes.

162
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,840
Who are you?

163
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,840
I should be the one asking you.

164
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,840
May I ask who is this young master?

165
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,840
Why did he sneak into

166
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,840
the back room of the Deng's house?

167
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,760
I am the heir of the Imperial College.

168
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,760
I came here tonight

169
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,760
to give you something.

170
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
It's you.

171
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,760
What do you mean?

172
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,760
It's not appropriate to sneak into the back room of the Deng's house.

173
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,760
It's you who asked me to wait here

174
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,760
and give me the thing.

175
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
This thing...

176
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,760
This thing is very valuable.

177
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,760
I should give it to you.

178
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760
You...

179
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,760
You are the most frugal person.

180
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,760
You drank so much tonight.

181
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,760
Let's go.

182
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,760
I am so happy.

183
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,760
I thought we would be free.

184
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,680
But we finally got it.

185
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,680
Why is it a novel?

186
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Where is the memorial?

187
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,680
It seems that the man just now

188
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,680
is not a messenger.

189
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,680
Then why did he sneak into the Deng's house

190
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,600
and give us this?

191
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
It's a young man.

192
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
It's obvious that it's a girl's handwriting.

193
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Look.

194
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,600
The whole of the story is written in writing.

195
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
It seems that it is a man.

196
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
What is the name in it?

197
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Cheng Lei?

198
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Did the young master say it was named Cheng Lei?

199
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Yes.

200
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
That's right.

201
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,880
must be Deng Chan.

202
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,920
They...

203
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,640
The music is coming back and forth.

204
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,280
Let's see

205
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,560
how they met

206
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,680
and what their relationship is.

207
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,760
The night of Shangyuan Lantern Festival

208
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,920
was accidentally cut off by me.

209
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,480
Chan.

210
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,120
Chan.

211
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,480
Chan.

212
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,720
You're here.

213
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,880
The night of Shangyuan Lantern Festival

214
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,880
was accidentally cut off by me.

215
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,040
I've never been able to

216
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,600
enjoy the taste of it.

217
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,240
I wrote down the note

218
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,720
and left it in Linjiang Pavilion.

219
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,080
If you wish to take it back,

220
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,440
you can ask me later.

221
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,680
Can you still remember the note

222
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,560
and ask me every day?

223
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,840
I hope you can continue to read it.

224
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,400
Qu Niang is a good person.

225
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,800
She left the capital and went to the other side of the road.

226
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,000
She's a noble lady.

227
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
She broke into the Heavenly Realm with her

228
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,240
and that's what she's meant to be.

229
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,080
I'm surprised.

230
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,800
I've known her since I was young.

231
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,720
I hope I can meet her.

232
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,440
People only like to make fun of each other.

233
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,800
I'm a man of my own soul.

234
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,320
Meng Lang and Qu Niang are from the Heavenly Realm.

235
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,280
And I and Lady Zhixue

236
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,720
are friends.

237
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,360
Is it also fate?

238
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,080
I fell in love with a woman

239
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,840
who is unique in the world

240
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,320
like Meng Lang.

241
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,080
Even if we're in a dream,

242
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,760
we can't be together.

243
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,720
I don't know the heart of a goddess

244
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,840
when I'm with her.

245
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,880
I was born into the city

246
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,800
and I'm not good at family affairs.

247
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,320
I'm only sincere

248
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,440
and I'm willing to ask for your help.

249
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,400
The guy plans to hobby

250
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,880
and family matters.

251
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,120
Meng Lang is old.

252
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,960
He's meant to write about love in Pourquoi.

253
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:27,020
He is beautiful but not until the

254
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,680
bornhappy look.

255
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,120
I'm glad to be convenience

256
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,480
while loving her.

257
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,120
Today, the divorce letter is broken.

258
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,480
There is no one in this world who knows the truth.

259
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,560
I hope you can return to your old life

260
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,200
and live a glorious life.

261
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,240
It seems that they know each other

262
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
and love each other,

263
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,600
but they can't be together.

264
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,880
That's why Dengchan

265
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,880
made this letter.

266
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,320
Cheng Lei is really going to

267
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,800
find Miss Deng tonight.

268
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,720
He has already married the young master of the Zheng family,

269
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,080
but he met a reason.

270
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,880
It's really difficult.

271
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,640
What Mr. Deng values most is

272
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,880
the reputation and reputation.

273
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,640
Today, he is invited to

274
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,960
the real-life interview.

275
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,960
But Miss Deng

276
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,240
has a private relationship with a man from outside.

277
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,560
You mean...

278
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,600
Sir.

279
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,400
Something seems to have happened to the Zhaiyue of the Deng family.

280
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,360
Childe Cheng.

281
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,120
My father is a member of the Qingliu family.

282
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,560
Today, he just got the title of Liu Fang.

283
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,680
But you are married

284
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,120
in the back of my house.

285
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,440
If you want to spread this word,

286
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,960
how can I get married?

287
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:41,880
Please don't be angry, sir.

288
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,840
I was wrong.

289
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,440
Why did you break into the back of my house?

290
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,400
Tell me.

291
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,200
I came here tonight

292
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,040
because I want to see you.

293
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,640
Grandfather.

294
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,640
Grandfather.

295
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,000
Why did you come to my house?

296
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,040
I came to see you.

297
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,240
Chan'er.

298
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,160
Childe Cheng is here to see you?

299
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,200
Grandfather.

300
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,320
Let's drive him away first.

301
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,520
Greetings, Mr. Deng.

302
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,720
The banquet is over.

303
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,320
You two are...

304
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,160
We just came back from the banquet.

305
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,080
We accidentally found a sketchbook in your mansion.

306
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,280
We came to return it.

307
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,520
Open it.

308
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,200
Cheng Lei.

309
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,080
Don't be ridiculous.

310
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,320
Is this your sketchbook?

311
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:42,840
줍

312
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,460
Tell me.

313
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,120
Yes, it's me.

314
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,200
Mrs. Deng.

315
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:49,840
Don't lieитель

316
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,600
andyo

317
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,400
And collude with your own business.

318
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,040
It won't be you.

319
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,200
Who are you lying to?

320
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,960
Why did you come here?

321
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,280
and the whole family will be killed.

322
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,200
Chan'er.

323
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,600
You and the Zheng family are engaged.

324
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,120
How can you do such a stupid thing?

325
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,600
Grandfather, please calm down.

326
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,440
I...

327
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,880
I know my mistake.

328
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,080
Thank you.

329
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,160
Our family will handle the family affairs.

330
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,160
Please go back.

331
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,000
Mr. Deng,

332
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,720
if this matter is spread outside,

333
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,520
it will definitely damage your family's reputation.

334
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,920
But don't worry.

335
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,080
We will keep our word.

336
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,480
We will never reveal it.

337
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,240
What do you mean?

338
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,960
We have our own secret.

339
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,720
In the memorial,

340
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,760
who else

341
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,720
but you?

342
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,080
As expected,

343
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,280
you two came for this matter.

344
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,640
Sister Deng Chan and I

345
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,160
had a meeting.

346
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,680
I won't harm her.

347
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
We will definitely...

348
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
Shut up!

349
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,080
As a woman,

350
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,640
you don't stay in the back house and watch the father's house.

351
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,520
You show up every day.

352
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,240
You even call the concubines your concubines.

353
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,120
Do you have any shame in your heart?

354
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,160
Grandfather!

355
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,640
You...

356
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,160
Mr. Fu.

357
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,920
I'm afraid it's not Mr. Deng's turn

358
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,160
to teach him how to behave.

359
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,320
You...

360
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,320
I

361
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,080
have done everything

362
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,960
for our dynasty for thousands of years.

363
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,320
I will die for it.

364
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,040
Are you going to say that you are

365
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,880
a lowly concubine?

366
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,400
I will go to the Zheng family tomorrow

367
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,880
to confess my guilt.

368
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,800
Since you two have committed a grave mistake,

369
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,880
you two will get married immediately.

370
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,800
Don't delay it.

371
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,960
Never!

372
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,720
Never, father!

373
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,160
Father, please think twice.

374
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,560
You dare to come?

375
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,760
This is your good daughter?

376
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,880
Father.

377
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,680
I will go to the ancestral hall to take punishment.

378
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,800
But I can't marry Childe Cheng.

379
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,560
I will marry the Zheng family.

380
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,680
The people of the capital know it.

381
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,840
If I suddenly get married and get married again,

382
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,760
how can I see my father in the future?

383
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,080
Childe Cheng.

384
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,360
Mother.

385
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,400
I'm willing to.

386
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,160
Miss Deng.

387
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,080
Childe Cheng.

388
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:19,880
What?

389
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,680
You fell in love with another woman

390
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,520
just a few days ago?

391
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,160
No.

392
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,160
I didn't.

393
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,760
Then marry me.

394
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,840
Chan'er.

395
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,360
Don't be silly.

396
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,480
Mother, I know

397
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,480
you chose my marriage with Ziyan.

398
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,320
But

399
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,800
I only have Childe Cheng in my heart now.

400
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,000
Mother, don't persuade me.

401
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,440
Maybe it's good for us.

402
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,800
The family is not a good match.

403
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,240
You will regret it if you marry him.

404
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,960
If I'm not a good match,

405
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,160
may I ask what you think?

406
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,280
What is a good match?

407
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,080
You...

408
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,840
I...

409
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,960
I've been asking you for a long time.

410
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,320
Although you were born for the Imperial College,

411
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,960
you don't have many real talents.

412
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,960
Your parents were in the valley of the lowland

413
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,680
when they died.

414
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,680
You became a concubine

415
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,840
and married into the Imperial College.

416
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,080
You will be a failure in the future.

417
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,080
How can I give up my sister

418
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,200
and marry you

419
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,880
to Childe Cheng?

420
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,680
I've heard about it

421
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,440
since you died.

422
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,440
Everyone said you were virtuous and well-educated.

423
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,840
But I didn't expect

424
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,400
you were so arrogant and unreasonable.

425
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,360
You...

426
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,800
I was born in the valley of the lowland.

427
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,920
I have my own interests.

428
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,360
My parents

429
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,200
left many farmhouses.

430
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,080
I may be a loser,

431
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,720
but I can support my family.

432
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,840
Shut up!

433
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,880
It's your turn to decide

434
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,120
when to leave this family.

435
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,000
You're laughing at me.

436
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,720
You're laughing at me.

437
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,760
This is a personal order.

438
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,360
Father.

439
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,440
As a mother,

440
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,240
you can't raise your children.

441
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,840
Why are you still kneeling

442
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,400
and making excuses?

443
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,000
Father.

444
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,240
You two

445
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,000
can't succeed either.

446
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,040
The Deng family has been in the green for hundreds of years.

447
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,120
It's not a trick.

448
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,200
Our ancestors passed on the etiquette

449
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,840
to us.

450
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,880
Even if we die,

451
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,960
even if we die,

452
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,440
our whole family

453
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,480
will be

454
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,160
as good as dead.

455
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,120
Send the guest out.

456
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
Father.

457
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,800
Father.

458
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,240
Episode 15

459
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,880
I didn't expect

460
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,040
you would let Deng Chan

461
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,240
cancel the marriage.

462
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,720
Do you think

463
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,400
Cheng Lei and Deng Chan

464
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,200
are still in love?

465
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,320
It's not a good thing

466
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,600
to have a couple get married in public.

467
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,080
But they are so close.

468
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,000
They are so well-educated.

469
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,880
It's really strange.

470
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,400
How about I ask Mu Feng and Mu Yan

471
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,800
to keep an eye on them?

472
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,880
Okay.

473
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,440
Godfather.

474
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,920
This is a fake dream.

475
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,240
Remove it away.

476
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,040
No.

477
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,360
It's real.

478
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,200
What?

479
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,760
Mu Feng just reported that

480
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,880
someone was sneaking secretly

481
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,800
into the shrine of Deng Chan.

482
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,000
The marriage will take place tomorrow.

483
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,960
He's trying to cancel it?

484
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,920
She went out with a ghost.

485
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,280
She must have gone to the east of the city.

486
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,280
Or she went to see Miss Deng.

487
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,200
Mo Feng said

488
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,360
Miss Deng went to the west of the city.

489
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,160
Let's split up.

490
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:55,960
Okay.

491
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,120
Just go.

492
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,800
Leave the capital at once.

493
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,720
Just take it as my begging you.

494
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,080
I won't go.

495
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,520
We have to go together.

496
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,200
You've suffered enough in your life.

497
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,440
You don't owe anyone.

498
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,280
Why are you so stupid?

499
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,480
I'm also a dead man.

500
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,680
I'm a locked up person.

501
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,520
Don't hurt yourself anymore, okay?

502
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,000
You're self-righteous.

503
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,280
In your dream,

504
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,920
I never dreamt about you?

505
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,920
I only love Chen Zhi Xue.

506
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,520
I don't care if you're old or young.

507
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,280
Don't you understand me?

508
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,640
It's my fault.

509
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,800
The love plant sent out

510
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,040
can't be taken back.

511
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,560
I'll break it for you.

512
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,800
Just forget about me

513
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,080
when I'm with you.

514
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:44,520
deceased

515
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,280
I don't understand

516
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,960
You have a childhood sweetheart

517
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,280
and have infancy for life.

518
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,400
It's better than

519
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,960
an outsider?

520
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,480
I don't believe you really have a Tutcy-TFP title.

521
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,960
Don't ask me anymore.

522
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,000
I'm sorry

523
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,800
to let you compete with me.

524
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,320
What has Ch Month been going through?

525
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,640
Tell me.

526
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,760
Let's figure out a way together.

527
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:18,920
I...

528
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,240
I've never loved Cheng Nan.

529
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,840
You're the only one in my heart.

530
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,200
It's about family.

531
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,560
I...

532
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,280
I'm not interested in anything else.

533
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,680
Zheng Lang.

534
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,560
If you really care about me,

535
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,720
don't force me anymore, okay?

536
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,200
My Lady, let's go back.

537
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,280
Let's go.

538
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,680
It's wrong.

539
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,360
It's all wrong.

540
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,560
It's my fault.

541
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,160
I was ungrateful.

542
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,200
I was too hasty.

543
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,080
I shouldn't have written such a ridiculous thing.

544
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,600
It's me.

545
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,720
I caused...

546
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,720
I caused Chan Er's...

547
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,120
Not bad!

548
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,840
Mother.

549
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,320
Here you are.

550
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,800
I'm so sorry.

551
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,560
So,

552
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,480
this is the truth.

553
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,000
The famous legend of the capital,

554
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,920
Lady Zhang of the Deng family,

555
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,560
was famous and famous for her loyalty.

556
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,400
I also thought

557
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,480
you were a demon-slayer

558
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,240
with no feelings and no heart.

559
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,320
But I found out that

560
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,480
you were the Chanchi Xue who wrote the Flowing Moon.

561
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,400
Do you know

562
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,240
what I thought?

563
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,680
I don't want to know.

564
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,200
I don't want to know.

565
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,400
But my father is still here.

566
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,040
I once mentioned Qi Ru Sect.

567
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,320
But my father

568
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,760
locked me in the dark corner

569
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,920
for three days and nights.

570
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,920
After three days and nights,

571
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,120
I walked out of the room

572
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,360
and looked up at the sunrise.

573
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,480
You and I

574
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,520
were the sunrise that day.

575
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,720
But I'm a double-fou.

576
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,520
I just got the acupuncture.

577
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,600
I'm a double-fou who is 12 years older than you.

578
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,640
Acupuncture?

579
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,040
Have you ever cared about me?

580
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,840
Your Majesty's wife

581
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,120
once gave me courage

582
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,680
to fight against the wounds.

583
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,120
But now,

584
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,040
why don't you dare to fight against this?

585
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,760
As long as you have a conscience,

586
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,240
you're just a young man.

587
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,760
Why are you wronged?

588
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,840
Madam, don't go.

589
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,640
Someone is following us.

590
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,440
Who?

591
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,200
Who is there?

592
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:08,960
Someone.

593
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,360
Let's split up.

594
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,200
Okay.

595
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,120
Be careful.

596
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,720
Father.

597
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,440
Father.

598
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,360
The servants reported that

599
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,600
you left home at midnight.

600
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,520
I didn't believe it.

601
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,600
Are you really

602
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,560
having an affair with an outsider?

603
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,880
Father, I'm not.

604
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,040
Then who was the man who spoke just now?

605
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,960
He seduced my brother-in-law

606
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,680
and sent him to the government.

607
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,440
It's a capital crime.

608
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,560
Father.

609
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,760
I did it.

610
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,560
I didn't tell father.

611
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I went out without permission.

612
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,480
It has nothing to do with others.

613
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,600
Please forgive me.

614
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,360
You're still telling him the truth.

615
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,440
You can't protect yourself.

616
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,440
Someone.

617
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,240
Stop.

618
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,640
Sir, it's me.

619
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,400
I forced you to meet me.

620
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,320
It's all my fault.

621
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,600
No, father.

622
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,400
Cheng Lei.

623
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,400
You...

624
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,760
So,

625
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,400
the silver powder is

626
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,800
what you two secretly stole.

627
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:23,640
No, father.

628
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,640
Do you have any shame?

629
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,200
Father.

630
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,840
Shut up.

631
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,640
You're a father who doesn't obey the law.

632
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,080
May I ask what is the law?

633
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,740
If your brother is free of magazines and

634
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:39,420
you don't carry any

635
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,240
happiness breathing,

636
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,400
then how will you shouldNET

637
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,160
seek good life?

638
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,040
Never.

639
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,080
I'm theió

640
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,040
by by?

641
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,000
ah?

642
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:57,880
I can't.

643
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,080
Should a woman be born to destroy the imperial jade?

644
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,680
If this is the so-called fatherly love,

645
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,360
then it's fine if you don't obey.

646
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,480
Zhuang Hanyan, it's you again.

647
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,240
You are the one who set the rules

648
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,720
and instigated them to collude with each other

649
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
to ruin my family.

650
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,680
You vicious woman!

651
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,640
When you were still in the Zhuang family,

652
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,640
I could see that you were not a good person.

653
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,840
Now you are married into the Fu family,

654
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,360
and you are more and more shameless.

655
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,960
If you don't obey,

656
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,640
then I will teach you a lesson.

657
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:36,960
Father.

658
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,640
Chang'er.

659
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,360
Mr. Deng,

660
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,680
we are husband and wife.

661
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,640
Are you going to slap me

662
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,400
and hurt my father?

663
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,400
Good. Good.

664
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,160
The world is changing.

665
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,040
The law is going to be destroyed.

666
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,480
Chang'er.

667
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,000
Grandfather.

668
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,760
Grandfather.

669
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,280
For the sake of my mother's more than ten years

670
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,480
of being the head of the Deng family,

671
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,800
please let her go.

672
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,360
You are pleading for her.

673
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,040
Do you want to be a bitch like this?

674
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,720
I...

675
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,480
Chang'er.

676
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,240
Chang'er.

677
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,080
Let me see.

678
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,720
If I could have the blood,

679
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,200
I would rather see

680
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,560
a good woman

681
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,160
than

682
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,600
a bitch like me.

683
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,200
A good woman who is praised by everyone.

684
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,320
Mr. Deng.

685
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,200
How dare you say those

686
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,800
ridiculous words!

687
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,640
I just told the truth.

688
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,480
Can't you stand it?

689
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,280
Get up, Chang'er.

690
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,720
I'm sorry.

691
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,720
I'm sorry.

692
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,800
Then today,

693
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,120
I'll tell you all the truth.

694
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,040
It's been seventeen years.

695
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,560
The so-called missing your husband day and night

696
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,240
and being with your father

697
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,280
are all fake.

698
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,360
Your son and I have never been in love.

699
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,480
I even forgot his appearance.

700
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,560
You...

701
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,200
He was my test subject

702
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,480
and returned my letter of resignation.

703
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,440
But I know

704
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,040
he was just jealous.

705
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,120
He was afraid

706
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,120
that a talented and talented man

707
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,000
would be born

708
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,320
in a family of scholars like you.

709
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,080
You...

710
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,280
Do you know

711
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,320
the articles

712
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,520
your son gave you

713
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,720
were all written by me.

714
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,680
He stole my talent

715
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,600
and suppressed me.

716
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,760
He made me suffer

717
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,920
every time he was so selfish.

718
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,400
I've had enough.

719
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,280
I don't want to endure it anymore.

720
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,880
I've had enough.

721
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,920
You're a liar.

722
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,160
You're just a woman.

723
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,800
How can you believe a woman's words?

724
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,040
What do you mean by a woman?

725
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,800
If you're a woman

726
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,840
and you're a woman,

727
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,480
I'll be a woman.

728
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,640
What's the point?

729
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,160
I've been sacrificing myself for 17 years.

730
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,280
I've been sacrificing myself for 17 years.

731
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,520
For a useless person,

732
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,600
I've been

733
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,880
trapped in

734
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,640
a fake family.

735
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,040
I can't bear to see him

736
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,200
and my son together.

737
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,200
But today,

738
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,200
I don't want to

739
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,480
be a prostitute

740
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,480
for your sake

741
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,000
and your vanity.

742
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,320
I want to find my life back.

743
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,240
My name˜

744
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,200
is поп increased fingeroster.

745
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,120
Tom and Jerry,

746
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,960
all choppy..?

747
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,400
I've worked very hard

748
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,080
for my brother.

749
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,400
In my family life,

750
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,680
all the extra trouble

751
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,880
I've faced

752
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,160
for years.

753
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,920
But today,

754
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,920
I want to live for myself.

755
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,040
I want to live well.

756
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,600
You're crazy.

757
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,720
You're crazy!

758
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,760
I'm crazy! I'm crazy!

759
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,080
These seventeen years,

760
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,520
I've been a high-ranking official

761
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,160
with a high reputation.

762
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,280
Today,

763
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,520
I want to break this statue!

764
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,720
Even if it's broken,

765
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,720
I can still stand up.

766
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,360
I can.

767
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,120
I can.

768
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,120
Even if it's hurtful,

769
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,960
even if it's bloody,

770
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,560
as long as my life is still here,

771
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,120
I...

772
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,200
I'm just

773
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,000
a complete person.

774
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,320
Why can't I

775
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,640
have an animal

776
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:02,880
to love me

777
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,160
and cherish my confidant?

778
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,800
Why can't I

779
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,800
live a fearless life

780
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,160
for a while?

781
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,720
Guards!

782
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,800
Madam has a speech.

783
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,560
Take her back to her house

784
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,680
and stop her treatment.

785
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,680
Miss, take her back to watch over her.

786
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,520
She'll get married tomorrow.

787
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,560
If you dare to stop our family's affairs again,

788
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,720
I'll punish you.

789
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:32,800
Go!

790
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,480
No!

791
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,680
I don't want to!

792
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,440
No!

793
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,000
Go!

794
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,120
I won't marry!

795
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,240
I won't marry!

796
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,760
I only have the money to buy blood!

797
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,720
Let me go!

798
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,160
Let me go!

799
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,240
Wit!

800
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:35,020
Castle

801
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,780
Your Lordship

802
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,600
Your Lordship, bad news

803
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,680
A fire broke out in the back home

804
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,720
Let's go

805
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,820
In this littlep sự,

806
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,200
I've never seen War mortal

807
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,760
on my way.

808
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,640
Bring some water here.

809
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,560
currently!

810
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,140
Bandits are still inside the mansion.

811
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,680
They fight monsters.

812
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,320
Personalize Dlass and Fire!

813
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:16,840
I...

814
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,200
Mr. Deng,

815
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,840
if you want to have a peaceful life,

816
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,080
you really need to destroy

817
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,800
your stubborn and stubborn heart.

818
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,080
It's you.

819
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,800
You let her go.

820
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,760
There is no more Mrs. Deng in this world.

821
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,800
There is no more Cheng Lei.

822
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,920
When did you let her go?

823
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,520
I'm so angry with you.

824
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,880
My parents have known each other for many years in Dali Temple.

825
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,880
I don't know

826
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,520
if I can do it or not.

827
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,360
Fu Yunxi.

828
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,920
You and your husband are so bold.

829
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,560
Aren't you afraid

830
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,760
that you'll be killed by the rain?

831
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,560
Deng's brother-in-law

832
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,120
was shocked

833
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,600
and thought of his husband.

834
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,880
He was so sad.

835
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,600
Today, he committed suicide

836
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,240
and went with his husband.

837
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,440
Is all this

838
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,920
the order of Imperial Consort Miao?

839
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,200
You can do the justice for the heaven.

840
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,360
No one needs to know it.

841
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,920
What crime did I commit?

842
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,520
The heaven will kill me, too.

843
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,680
You know that you are a wise woman.

844
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,360
But you still insist on giving the credit to the deep palace

845
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,040
because you have no children.

846
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,640
You are so ungrateful.

847
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,080
Isn't this

848
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,200
a crime?

849
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,120
Mr. Deng said

850
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,320
that he would protect Qingyu for a hundred years

851
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,760
and keep the foundation for ten thousand years.

852
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,440
Even if he is broken,

853
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,000
even if he is dead, he will do it.

854
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,040
Since Zhang Wanjun has left the capital,

855
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,840
he is a good son of Liu Fang.

856
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,400
Why don't you burn him

857
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,920
in the fire?

858
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,640
No, no, no.

859
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,640
I'll say it.

860
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,840
I'll say it all.

861
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,800
Listen to me.

862
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,520
I know that

863
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,600
you did everything

864
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,120
to save Imperial Consort Miao.

865
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,200
But you don't need to

866
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,840
bother others.

867
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,400
Then who should we go to?

868
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,440
One person

869
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,080
will take care of everything.

870
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,000
The rest

871
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,600
is just a little work.

872
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,600
If you insist on forcing Imperial Consort Miao to die,

873
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,560
the inner palace, the college of the Cultural Hall,

874
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,920
and the monster's cave,

875
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,320
what I can do

876
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,000
is to withdraw from this trip.

877
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,120
But Mr. Yao

878
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,120
is in the middle of Qingliu.

879
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,840
As long as he doesn't stop,

880
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,880
more people will go with him.

881
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,560
I've said it all.

882
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,920
You have to promise

883
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,880
not to let anyone

884
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,360
get into Zhang's house.

885
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,320
As long as you don't deny it,

886
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,760
we'll keep our word.

887
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:45,720
Let's go.

888
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,920
Mr. Lian.

889
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,360
Our family's hundred-year-old Qingyu

890
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,240
is guarded.

891
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,000
It's guarded.

892
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,360
help

893
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I'm not sincere

894
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
He has entered this battlefield

895
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Not allowed to be separated

896
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
How much love and how much hate

897
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
No need to ask

898
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Who is fake and who is real

899
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Still need to be changed

900
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Fear is in the heart of the old

901
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Can't help but be laughed at

902
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
The waves are so good

903
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Who can break through

904
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
He is willing to turn into a person

905
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
The situation is not right

906
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Silly as this old city

907
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Even if the road is like a wind

908
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Blood and eyes are not willing to hate

909
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Not willing to give up the world

910
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Not asking for a return

911
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
In my hands

912
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Han Dong Xun is also difficult to be sad for him

913
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
But only for the sake of the truth

914
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
He is willing to be a person

915
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Love is not in the back

916
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Silly as this old city

917
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Even if the road is like a wind

918
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Blood and eyes are not willing to hate

919
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Not willing to give up the world

920
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Not asking for a return

921
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
In my hands

922
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Han Dong Xun is also difficult to be sad for him
