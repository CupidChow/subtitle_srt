1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

5
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Is Chen'er here?

6
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Is it her?

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's her.

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Chen'er.

9
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Mother.

10
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Chen'er.

11
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
From now on,

13
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
you can't stay with me for long.

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I've been worried.

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
After I got married,

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I was lonely and alone in the back house.

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I felt so lonely.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I couldn't bear it.

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But now,

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
we both have our own home.

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Good girl.

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Good girl.

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Good girl.

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Don't cry.

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't cry.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Childe Chong.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
My mother left Deng's mansion.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But she's not alone.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Wherever she goes,

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll always be her daughter.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I hope you won't bully her.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Otherwise, I'll chase you to the end of the world.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I won't let you go.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Don't worry.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'll take good care of her.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Mother.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Madam.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Why don't you go to Min'an?

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Why Min'an?

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Childe Zheng's hometown is in Min'an.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
In the future,

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Deng Chan will go home with his husband every year.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Your mother and daughter can reunite.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's great.

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Thank you, Sister Hanyan.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Sister.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You're the best.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Please accept our bow.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Mother.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Madam.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Get up.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I can't express my gratitude.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I can only report it in the next life.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We're husband and wife.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
We're also married.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We're also planning something.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
We're just doing what we need.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You don't have to do this.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Madam Fu.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If it's just a plan,

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
you won't come to see me off today.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Thank you for your kindness.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's not far from the capital.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Let's hurry up.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Good boy.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Take care of yourself.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll wait for you in Min'an.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Mother.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Mother.

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I agree with you that

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
making this is also responsible to you.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Can't you please not use it?

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Dearily Ave.

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
This time,

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
we'll make a little more money.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
2 million 시간的财地

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
ingredients

80
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,800
Finally, there is no accident

81
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,320
and no more mistakes.

82
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,760
Now we've found the mastermind behind everything.

83
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,360
As long as we can get the Cave of Yao,

84
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,440
we can solve the crisis for Noble Consort Miao.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We're one step closer to the Zhuang Shiyang.

86
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes.

87
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,520
Let's go to Yao's Mansion now.

88
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,720
Let's go now.

89
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,000
From the moment you said the Cave of Yao,

90
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,880
I knew

91
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,400
how to proceed to the next step.

92
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,880
You mean

93
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,280
Princess Qi?

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,640
Yes.

95
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,080
If you have something to discuss,

96
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,760
please come to the official office.

97
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,120
I won't stay here.

98
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,880
I'm honored to meet you,

99
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,440
and I dare not to talk to you in private.

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,480
Deng Gong and I

101
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,000
have written a letter

102
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,960
to show that Noble Consort Miao is kind

103
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
and righteous.

104
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,760
But you and your wife

105
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,000
are just playing tricks.

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,800
Now you've already given up.

107
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,080
Didn't you come here

108
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,080
to be a guest today?

109
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,280
Recently, someone in the capital

110
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,880
has sent the female scholars of the harem to all places.

111
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,680
The mastermind behind this

112
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,280
is also you, right?

113
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
In the past,

114
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,120
the Zhou You King was a man of dignity.

115
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,760
He was always a man of honor.

116
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,720
Tang Minghuang adored Noble Consort Yang for many years.

117
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,920
He made the world

118
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,440
a better place for all women.

119
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,760
He has been in the court for generations.

120
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,880
The court is in chaos.

121
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,360
It's not because of women.

122
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,680
Noble Consort Miao has been favored for many years.

123
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,240
Now she wants to interfere in the state affairs.

124
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,680
We are the emperors.

125
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,600
How can we let this country

126
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,240
be destroyed by women?

127
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,360
The story of Lord Yao is really good.

128
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,720
Since the beauty of the harem is enough to make a country,

129
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,880
who sent her

130
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,360
into the palace

131
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,840
with such a red face?

132
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,440
The King of You is unpretentious.

133
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,000
The court officials are convinced by the sword

134
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,320
but the King of You is accused of murder.

135
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,840
His family

136
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,520
sent the most beautiful woman in the harem into the palace.

137
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,400
The court officials were able to get rid of the trouble.

138
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,000
This woman

139
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,720
is Baosi.

140
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,320
Do you know that women in this world

141
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,080
can't even control their own fate?

142
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,400
How can they control the world?

143
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,160
If Lord Yao faces this situation today,

144
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,880
if there is a woman like Baosi,

145
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,640
are you willing to help her get rid of the trouble?

146
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,640
You two

147
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,760
came here today for a little girl?

148
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,040
I heard that

149
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,360
Lord Yao has a single daughter

150
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,800
named Wang Shu.

151
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,640
But she was forced by the King of Qi to marry into the palace.

152
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,520
This King of Qi is a man of character.

153
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,000
He has been in the capital for many years

154
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,040
and has been tormented day and night.

155
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,760
I have a way

156
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,800
to help her get rid of the trouble.

157
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,640
The so-called martial arts is not accepted.

158
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,760
If you two

159
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,480
want to show me mercy

160
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,640
for the matter of the little girl,

161
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,520
I will withdraw the sword manual.

162
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,800
I will not

163
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,080
obey your order.

164
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,000
Guards.

165
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,920
Send the guest away.

166
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,560
Master.

167
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,000
I just asked someone to send a message again.

168
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,800
It's really hard to make a living.

169
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,440
Please think of a way.

170
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,440
This person is indeed insincere.

171
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,440
It's not easy to make her cry.

172
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,400
No.

173
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,680
If she is a selfish and evil person,

174
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,160
it's really not easy.

175
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,080
If she only dares not to force herself

176
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,280
because of the power of the King of Qi,

177
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,600
there is still a chance to survive.

178
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,640
We can't just help Miss Yao

179
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,680
get rid of the trouble for a while.

180
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,120
We need to help her get rid of the King of Qi completely.

181
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,000
Let's go to the King of Qi's Mansion now.

182
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:47,840
From the kindness in Hotel

183
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,320
Do they look alike?

184
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,360
The late princess is a natural person.

185
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,360
If others want to imitate her,

186
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,400
it will take some time.

187
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,360
I can only let go of tea

188
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
when the soup is boiling.

189
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,680
Is it boiling?

190
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,520
How many times have I taught you?

191
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,880
Why can't you learn it?

192
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,120
You are pregnant for three months.

193
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,040
The tiger is waiting for you.

194
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,960
I only ask you to do one thing.

195
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,800
That is to act according to the rules.

196
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,280
But the sword between the legs

197
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,880
is the same as my daughter.

198
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,560
When I do things,

199
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,080
I always do it well.

200
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,880
I'm good at making things clear.

201
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,480
Why can't you do it?

202
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,080
Because I'm not her.

203
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,560
I'm Uncle Yao.

204
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,480
Wrong.

205
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,680
You are Pei Ying Yue.

206
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,160
She is my daughter.

207
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,960
Yu'er.

208
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,920
Yu'er.

209
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,000
It's my fault.

210
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,800
Did it hurt?

211
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,280
Little Fushui.

212
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,720
I don't want to drink.

213
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,520
I don't want to drink.

214
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,960
I beg you.

215
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,880
I beg you.

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,440
I don't want to let her go.

217
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,280
I beg you.

218
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,080
I don't want to...

219
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,720
Say it.

220
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,840
I'll ask you again.

221
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,080
What's your name?

222
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,440
Yao.

223
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,400
I...

224
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,600
Say it.

225
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,000
Your Highness.

226
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:33,840
Pei Ying Yue.

227
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,360
You can't...

228
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:34,920
Get out.

229
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,080
Get out.

230
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,840
I won't see you.

231
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
Please go back.

232
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,480
Your Highness, you have something important to do.

233
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,600
It's inconvenient to see you.

234
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,960
I heard

235
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,400
that Prince Qi is strict with Uncle Yao.

236
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,760
If we can't enter Prince Qi's mansion,

237
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,440
I'm afraid it's hard to meet him

238
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,440
and discuss the plan.

239
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,360
The mansion is not a normal official residence.

240
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,920
We can't break in.

241
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,600
We have to find a way out.

242
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,280
Do you have any case

243
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,480
that can be used as a lie?

244
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,800
Even if we offend him first

245
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,240
and then apologize to him,

246
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,800
we can still enter the mansion smoothly.

247
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,080
Shi.

248
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,360
What's wrong?

249
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,400
Father.

250
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,840
I heard that Uncle Zhen has a fourth uncle.

251
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,920
All the boys went.

252
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,080
Zhi wants to go, too.

253
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,800
Zhi wants to go to school, too?

254
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,200
Father will take me to see it today.

255
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,960
Okay?

256
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,080
Slow down, Zhi.

257
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,640
Who told you to put the ball in the water?

258
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,480
Explain it to me.

259
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,360
I didn't mention it. It's you.

260
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,320
Did he put the ball in the water?

261
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,160
Yes, it's you.

262
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,400
Hurry up. Get down.

263
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,360
Get down.

264
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,480
Get down.

265
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,880
You put the ball in the water.

266
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,960
Why did you make fun of others?

267
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,320
You're so righteous.

268
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,560
Get down and help him.

269
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,680
Get down.

270
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,240
Zhi.

271
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,880
Zhi.

272
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,480
What's wrong?

273
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,680
Which girl doesn't know the rules

274
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,400
and dares to hurt others?

275
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,120
Are you okay, Zhi?

276
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,080
It's your young master who was timid

277
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,360
and didn't want to get into the water.

278
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,160
How dare you!

279
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,920
Do you know who my young master is?

280
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,960
I'm Fu Yunxi from Dali Temple.

281
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,080
If you want to be punished, please come to our mansion.

282
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,160
Come to our mansion?

283
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,920
I think you should prepare a gift

284
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,120
and apologize to us in person.

285
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,720
Go home.

286
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,920
I'm going to tell father.

287
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,240
Father.

288
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,760
You're so kind.

289
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,640
I'm sorry.

290
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,400
Father.

291
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,200
You can go to Prince Qi's mansion now.

292
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,680
That's the crown prince of Prince Qi's mansion.

293
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,760
It's him.

294
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,600
And, aunt.

295
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,520
Am I amazing?

296
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,400
Thank you, Zhi.

297
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,640
Greetings, Your Highness.

298
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,480
Greetings, Your Highness.

299
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,800
How dare you

300
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,040
to hurt my prince's son?

301
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,880
Do you know...

302
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,800
Are you

303
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,600
the wife of Fu family, Zhuang Yanhan?

304
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,680
To be honest,

305
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,920
I am Zhuang Hanyan.

306
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,440
It's okay.

307
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,160
I came to play with Your Highness

308
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,080
but there were accidently

309
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,080
hit me and fell into the pond.

310
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,760
You are the legitimate daughter

311
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,060
of Zhuang family here

312
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,840
in the Political Scholar's spirit.

313
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,360
It's because of our example

314
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,360
that saw the disaster .

315
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,280
I sincerely apologize to you here today.

316
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,240
Please have a rest.

317
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,940
she would sew a songbook to sing the jade

318
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,660
with you.

319
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,060
You know porcelain!

320
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,260
engaged her well enough to beemplified in the new city.

321
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,220
She also learned a lot from you, Mother.

322
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,260
In that case,

323
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,500
I'll have to ask atonement from the Young Lady.

324
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:42,700
Let's go.

325
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,580
Young Master,

326
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,820
we're at the airport now.

327
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,460
Are we at the airport?

328
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,580
How come I can't see theischen eccentric children?

329
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,440
Please come to the garden.

330
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,800
Sit down.

331
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,240
Your Highness,

332
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,720
the Princess Consort is asking for your presence.

333
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,200
I've been calling for a long time.

334
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,640
She said she didn't want to see you.

335
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,640
She didn't want to see me?

336
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,800
Good.

337
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,720
A guest?

338
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,880
Good.

339
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,040
I'll go and invite her myself.

340
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,920
Your Highness,

341
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,960
I'm sorry for coming to the capital today.

342
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,840
I shouldn't have bothered you

343
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
and made you feel uncomfortable.

344
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,440
Why don't you let Zhuo Qing

345
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,240
go to the back house and ask for a visit?

346
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,200
You and I can wait for a while here.

347
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,280
I'm sorry.

348
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,280
I should have invited her myself.

349
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,280
I wonder if you agree.

350
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,360
Forget it.

351
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,600
Take the couple there.

352
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,880
Yes.

353
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,400
You should've brought both of them in.

354
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,680
You will see what I did to them soon!

355
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
Your Highness, Madam Fu is here to visit you.

356
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,920
Your Highness.

357
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,160
Madam, you...

358
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,320
Wait outside.

359
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,280
Who are you?

360
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,600
Your Highness,

361
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,040
you want to burn charcoal to kill yourself?

362
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,120
What does it have to do with you?

363
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,000
You deserve to die.

364
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,720
If you know about this,

365
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,440
you'll be heartbroken.

366
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,520
You are...

367
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,880
You are sent by my father?

368
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,560
I visited the Yao Mansion yesterday.

369
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,400
Did you think of any way

370
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,840
to get me out?

371
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,800
Why don't you tell me first

372
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,000
how His Highness

373
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,120
treats you?

374
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,680
He is so obsessed with the royal family.

375
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,880
He wants me to imitate his eyes every night.

376
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,160
He even orders me to learn to make tea.

377
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,800
He even forces me to drink water regularly.

378
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,120
He even teaches me to think

379
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,480
if I don't leave,

380
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,560
I am a human.

381
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,360
I am not a beast.

382
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,680
I am not his toy.

383
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,920
If Father doesn't think of any way to get me out,

384
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,160
instead of being tortured in the prison,

385
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,520
he might as well die.

386
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,960
What is Fu Shui?

387
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,440
After the death of Consort Xian,

388
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,240
Prince Qi met an old man

389
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,360
named

390
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,040
Duan Tianshi.

391
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,080
He was so suspicious

392
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,040
that he said that as long as he married a woman,

393
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,760
he would water her with a soul-saving potion every ten days

394
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,440
and he would use Pei's identity to kill himself.

395
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,800
As long as he hid the nine-tree-tree-sauce,

396
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,120
he would have a chance

397
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,960
to make Pei's soul come back to his body.

398
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,600
He even took the risk

399
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,560
to kill himself by the words of the God of Chaos.

400
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,880
It's Duan Tianshi again.

401
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,240
It turns out that the rumors outside are just a few.

402
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,880
You have suffered.

403
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,160
Who are you?

404
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,680
Did Father send you here?

405
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,920
You just need to know

406
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,160
that I came here today

407
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,320
to help you get out of the prison.

408
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,120
Prince Qi is a noble man.

409
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,520
I'm married into the Prince's Mansion.

410
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,120
Even Father

411
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,840
wouldn't dare to be a burden to you.

412
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,640
How can you help me?

413
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,160
I'm looking for a way to die.

414
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,560
I'm looking for a way to live.

415
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,200
If you're not even afraid of death,

416
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,240
do you dare to fight?

417
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,400
You look more like him than I do.

418
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,240
Who?

419
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,600
Pei Yingyu, the daughter of Prince Qi,

420
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,640
is his ex-wife.

421
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,360
You don't look

422
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,640
very similar to him.

423
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,720
But you look so cold

424
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,080
and similar to him.

425
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,260
I heard that Her Highness

426
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,100
is having working things.

427
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,220
I was Frosted with glucose.

428
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,720
The cure for that has been met with a young master.

429
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,720
The patch had wormwood.

430
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,080
Mission 0.

431
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,880
The gleaming red ritual

432
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,640
saw in Mountain Queen gameplay

433
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,760
from the бืь Bra'r Wu Sui.

434
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,380
Father,

435
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,860
Your Ladyship is indeed good at tea.

436
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,540
You even make good tea.

437
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,700
As far as I know,

438
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,780
Miss Zhuang isn't your match.

439
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:28,780
Yes.

440
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,060
I'm the eldest brother of the Zhuang family.

441
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,620
You miss me so much,

442
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,380
so you didn't marry her.

443
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,180
You can't pursue the past.

444
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,020
I only know

445
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,700
to pity the people in front of me.

446
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,380
Who are you finding foripsay on?

447
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,460
Even龍견×陛下

448
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,820
can't find millennia kernel.

449
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,260
I just want to marry the yin directly

450
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,820
with Miss Zhuang in hand.

451
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,300
Of course.

452
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,460
No farm?

453
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,820
Then I'm looking for it myself.

454
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,140
Please find

455
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,860
the future kilo for the yin.

456
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,780
Hurry up!!

457
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,860
Can you hold this for me?

458
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,780
What do you mean?

459
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,500
I heard that the previous princess died of illness.

460
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,260
Yes.

461
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,740
That year, the day before Mid-Autumn Festival,

462
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,260
we agreed to kneel down and enjoy the moon together.

463
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,660
But

464
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,220
she didn't survive that night.

465
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,100
Wu Tong died of a mild cold.

466
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,460
She was innocent and had no child.

467
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,900
His Highness loved her for many years.

468
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,180
But he didn't forget the old days.

469
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,180
Such a boy is rare.

470
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,580
If all women in the world can have such a husband and wife,

471
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,620
there will be no more kneeling down in the world.

472
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,340
So many years,

473
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,780
only Miss Zhuang

474
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,980
can make me cry.

475
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,220
People with different nationalities are different.

476
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,180
Some people forget the old ones.

477
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,260
Some people forget the dead ones.

478
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,620
My eldest sister, Ling Wei, was promoted to the Fu's family.

479
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,940
But she has already fallen into the dust.

480
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,700
She is no longer loved.

481
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,740
Miss Zhuang is a new woman.

482
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,860
How can she beg you to miss her?

483
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,180
The spring comes and goes, the years pass.

484
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,180
The new ones will always be the old ones.

485
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,540
The night is just a night.

486
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,220
Seeing the situation today,

487
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,300
I know what will happen in the future.

488
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,780
I'm talking too much.

489
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,980
Don't blame me.

490
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,860
You are just saying what you want.

491
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,700
Why are you saying that?

492
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,940
I've disturbed you for a long time.

493
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,340
I'll leave with my wife.

494
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,380
Then you can ask Miss Zhuang for a tea another day.

495
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,340
Thank you for your kindness.

496
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,180
I dare not refuse.

497
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,980
What are you up to again?

498
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,420
How many times have I told you

499
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,900
that you are not willing to change the size of the carriage?

500
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,700
It's hard to go home

501
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,060
when you are so crowded.

502
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,540
How about

503
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,140
I send a carriage to send you two back?

504
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,620
I'm sorry to make you laugh.

505
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,260
I dare not bother you.

506
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,860
Hurry up.

507
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,620
Ask around

508
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,820
about their relationship.

509
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:57,860
Yes.

510
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,980
Do you want to marry into the Prince's Mansion

511
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,900
and exchange for Miss Yao?

512
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,420
What if I really mean it?

513
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,220
What are you going to do?

514
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,340
Just perform.

515
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,060
What should I do

516
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,260
for the next performance?

517
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,740
For the next performance,

518
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,660
you should sing with Ying Yue.

519
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,020
Yue.

520
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,660
Even if the women in the world

521
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,180
are similar to you,

522
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,340
none of them is as good as you.

523
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,340
Your Highness.

524
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,180
Your Highness, bad news.

525
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,780
Her Highness is dead again.

526
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:40,940
Hurry up.

527
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,940
Get me some water.

528
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,820
Yue.

529
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,300
Yue.

530
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,740
Yue.

531
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,820
Yue.

532
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,060
You can't die.

533
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:54,860
You can't die.

534
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,260
Get me some water.

535
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,420
Yue.

536
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,260
You can't die.

537
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,220
You can't die

538
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,980
without the last drop of water.

539
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,380
Yue.

540
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,540
Get me some water.

541
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,820
Get me some water.

542
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,020
Hurry up.

543
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,740
Yue.

544
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,020
Yue.

545
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,060
Yue.

546
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,220
Imperial doctor.

547
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,940
Call the imperial doctor.

548
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,860
The Princess is awake.

549
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,940
I'll go tell His Highness

550
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,060
to11 room.

551
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,940
Your Highness.

552
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,140
Your Highness.

553
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,740
Your Highness.

554
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,700
Yue.

555
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,580
Your Highness.

556
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,180
You...

557
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:29,860
You...

558
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,380
Why are you so scared?

559
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,180
Am I

560
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,700
sick for too long?

561
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,220
Am I not beautiful?

562
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,220
You...

563
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,020
Are you really Yue'er?

564
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,420
Of course I am.

565
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,580
Otherwise, who else could it be?

566
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,620
Why...

567
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,740
Did I sleep for too long

568
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,660
and lose my family?

569
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,060
Why did I lose my family's

570
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,100
fragrance?

571
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,300
A commoner

572
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,820
is a drunkard.

573
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,940
Who can remove the fragrance of tea?

574
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,540
I'm late for a night.

575
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,220
I'm a tea lover.

576
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,060
It's not the first time we met.

577
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,300
We were having tea together.

578
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,500
Why are you...

579
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,140
Yue'er,

580
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,460
it's really you.

581
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,060
You're back.

582
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,660
I miss you so much.

583
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,780
Chu Lang,

584
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,900
what's wrong with you?

585
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,660
Uncle Yao,

586
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,100
I really...

587
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,300
It's been three years.

588
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,540
That bitch

589
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,660
dared to smash your memorial tablet

590
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,860
and kill herself in front of you.

591
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,380
Yet

592
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,900
just because of this,

593
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,880
you were finally

594
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,780
back in this body to live again.

595
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:22,200
platform His Lordship's

596
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,200
We will never separate.

597
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Yes.

598
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,200
We will never separate.

599
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,200
Go.

600
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Are you tired?

601
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,200
You...

602
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
You are a human and a ghost.

603
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Zhu Lang.

604
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
I am lucky to have returned my soul.

605
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,200
I don't know how long I can stay in Yang Jian.

606
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,200
This is not a long-term plan.

607
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
After I thought about it,

608
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,200
only Zhu Lang and I could return to the imperial palace.

609
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,200
Only by returning to the imperial palace with me,

610
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,200
we could live and die together.

611
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
Zhu Lang,

612
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
are you willing to travel with me?

613
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,200
I... I... I...

614
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
I'm alive!

615
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,200
This butterfly is our love token.

616
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
Let's use it

617
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,200
to break the spell and kill them!

618
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,200
No!

619
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,200
Someone is coming!

620
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,200
The queen is crazy!

621
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,200
The queen is crazy!

622
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Go!

623
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,200
Your Highness,

624
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,200
let's go back to the mansion.

625
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,200
The queen is looking for you.

626
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,200
Shut up!

627
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,200
Let her go to your father!

628
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,200
Please stay, if you have a reason.

629
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,200
Who are you?

630
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,200
I am an old acquaintance.

631
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
I am a man of my heart.

632
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,200
It's a pity that you are not a good friend.

633
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,200
I'm afraid you will be in trouble.

634
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,200
What do you mean?

635
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,200
Well...

636
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,200
I can't say it.

637
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,200
You can't say it.

638
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,200
It's a long story.

639
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:55,200
It's a long story.

640
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Go back to the mansion.

641
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,200
Your Highness,

642
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
half of the capital's news has spread.

643
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
It's said that Fu Yingxi and Zhuang's family

644
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,200
had a big fight.

645
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
Yang Yan is going to get married.

646
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,200
Do you know the reason?

647
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
Fu Yingxi and Zhuang's family are not allowed to marry.

648
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,200
They are not allowed to marry.

649
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,200
They are fighting for their lives.

650
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,200
They are getting more and more considerate.

651
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
Your Highness, Zhuang's family is going to get married.

652
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
They want to see the queen.

653
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,200
They want to know the truth.

654
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,200
Yes.

655
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,200
Please go to the back garden.

656
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Yes.

657
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
Send the queen to the other house.

658
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,200
I won't allow it.

659
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
I won't let her go in and out.

660
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,200
Yes.

661
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,200
Go.

662
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,200
I made the tea.

663
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Please forgive me.

664
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,200
Why didn't you see the queen?

665
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,200
She is not feeling well.

666
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,200
She is still resting.

667
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,200
I haven't tasted the tea

668
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,200
you made.

669
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,200
There are three types of tea.

670
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,200
Which one do you want to use?

671
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,200
The top one.

672
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,200
Then we need to take the sugar

673
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
when the water is slightly heavy.

674
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,200
Then we won't know the damage to the tea.

675
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,200
The tea is very soft.

676
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,200
The tea should not be boiled and the water should not be heavy.

677
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,200
And the person who makes the tea is not a good person.

678
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,200
Would it be too much?

679
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,200
You are a very good person.

680
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,200
You are not like a commoner.

681
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,200
That's why you know the taste of the tea.

682
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,200
You know people's feelings.

683
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
A good person will marry a bad person.

684
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,200
Why don't you change your mind?

685
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,200
I insisted on marrying into the Fu family.

686
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,200
I had a fight with my father.

687
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,200
If we get divorced now,

688
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,200
I'm afraid that I have no way out.

689
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,200
I have no other choice.

690
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,200
Why is it difficult?

691
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,200
I can marry you.

692
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,200
Are you serious?

693
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,200
Then the queen...

694
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,200
As long as you are willing to marry her

695
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
and divorce her,

696
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,200
it's not difficult.

697
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,200
Well...

698
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,200
Han Yan,

699
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,200
do you still have doubts?

700
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,200
I am satisfied with your friend.

701
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,200
Although I have a relationship with the queen,

702
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,200
I can't bear to see her be divorced because of me.

703
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,200
You can write a divorce letter

704
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,200
and leave some dignity to my sister.

705
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,200
As you said.

706
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,200
You won't marry me.

707
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,200
I love you too.

708
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,200
Your Highness.

709
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,200
The queen was unwilling to see you

710
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
and made unwellfe undergoing wrinkles.

711
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,200
These people believe a fake I could-be-dressed.

712
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,200
They dare to easily stop women.

713
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,200
Zhu Lang! Zhu Lang!

714
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,200
Zhu Lang!

715
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,200
Zhu Lang!

716
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,200
You won't see me again!

717
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
Zhu Lang!

718
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,200
Get out!

719
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,200
Let me in!

720
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,200
Zhu Lang!

721
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,200
Hurry! Let her go back to her home!

722
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
Don't let her enter the palace again!

723
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,200
Yes!

724
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
I'll go in myself!

725
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,200
Your Highness!

726
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,200
His Highness has decided to leave with you.

727
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
Please take Uncle He Li away!

728
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,200
If he refuses to leave,

729
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,200
I'll drive him out!

730
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,200
Don't bother me again!

731
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
Your Highness, His Highness took Uncle He Li away

732
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,200
and left on his own.

733
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,200
He left?

734
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,200
Yes!

735
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
He didn't bother you anymore?

736
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Yes!

737
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,200
No! No!

738
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,200
Hurry!

739
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,200
Stop him!

740
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,200
Bring him back to me!

741
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,200
Yes!

742
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,200
Thank you for your kindness!

743
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,200
I'll repay you!

744
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,200
Thank you!

745
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,200
You're welcome!

746
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,200
Your Highness, please wait!

747
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,200
Your Highness, please go back!

748
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,200
Hurry! They're afraid of the plague!

749
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,200
Miss Yao, as you promised,

750
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,200
I'll help you get rid of the plague.

751
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,200
But I'll take care of Uncle He Li for you.

752
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
What do you want from Uncle He Li?

753
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,200
You'll know when you get back to Yao's Mansion.

754
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,200
Give it to me!

755
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,200
Go back!

756
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,200
Go back!

757
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,200
Your Highness!

758
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,200
Why is the door locked?

759
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Your Highness!

760
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,200
Miss is back!

761
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
Father!

762
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,200
Uncle!

763
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,200
Father!

764
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,200
Uncle!

765
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,200
Father!

766
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,200
Uncle, why are you back?

767
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,200
Thanks to you two!

768
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,200
I'm out of the house!

769
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
Father,

770
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Prince Qi has written the divorce agreement.

771
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,200
You can go back to your room.

772
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
You don't have to take me back.

773
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
You two are so smart!

774
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,200
You saved my daughter!

775
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,200
Miss Yao,

776
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,200
don't say that.

777
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,200
Father,

778
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,200
Mrs. Fu not only wrote the divorce agreement

779
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,200
for me,

780
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,200
but also promised Prince Qi to marry her.

781
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,200
I'm afraid

782
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,200
I'll have to

783
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,200
make things difficult for my father and me.

784
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,200
Mrs. Fu,

785
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,200
this...

786
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,200
It's not only me who can get the good result

787
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,200
by working hard on it.

788
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,200
You two

789
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,200
helped my daughter

790
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,200
because you were so kind to me.

791
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
After what happened,

792
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,200
I know that you're not a heartless person.

793
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
The country is in danger.

794
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,200
The country is in danger.

795
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,200
It could be destroyed by the wedding

796
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,200
or the power of the witch.

797
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
But it won't be destroyed by a woman

798
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,200
who's trapped in the palace and can't see the sun.

799
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,200
It's because the world is so talented

800
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,200
that no one is willing to

801
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,200
compare the women with the men.

802
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,200
That's why there are so many

803
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,200
evils and witches.

804
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
I believe

805
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,200
you have your own thoughts.

806
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,200
Miss Yao,

807
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,200
you love your daughter so much.

808
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,200
Your mother is also a member of the family.

809
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
She's also the pearl of other people's hearts.

810
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
I believe you can also

811
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,200
help her to win her heart.

812
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,200
Please

813
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,200
accept my bow.

814
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
Mr. Zhao,

815
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
don't kill Wan Mei.

816
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,200
I'm really

817
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
ashamed of my father.

818
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,200
I didn't dare to

819
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,200
stand against the King of Qi.

820
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,200
I'm afraid that my daughter

821
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
will be in a more difficult situation in the future.

822
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,200
I don't know

823
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,200
how to deal with it.

824
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,200
If the King of Qi

825
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,200
dares to make things difficult for the Fu family,

826
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,200
I will definitely

827
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,200
do whatever I can.

828
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,200
But

829
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,200
I can only

830
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,200
postpone the memorial

831
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,200
about the alliance.

832
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,200
If the Miao Concubine

833
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,200
doesn't return,

834
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
I will never

835
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,200
give up.

836
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,200
How is it?

837
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
I've asked around.

838
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,200
No one has ever done anything like this.

839
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,200
If that's the case,

840
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,200
then you don't need to

841
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,200
be in the hands of the Miao family.

842
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,200
Send it to the Yao family.

843
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,200
After the Miao Concubine heard the news,

844
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,200
she must have been moved.

845
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,200
I will find a way to let her know

846
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
that this can be done.

847
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,200
I must

848
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,200
get the Miao Concubine's letter

849
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,200
and go to the palace to see her.

850
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
Don't worry. I've asked the palace

851
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,200
to send a message.

852
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,200
There will be news soon.

853
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,200
Young Madam, Master,

854
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,200
the King of Qi has sent someone

855
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,200
to save you.

856
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,200
As long as the Miao Concubine is protected,

857
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,200
even if the King of Qi is in the capital,

858
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,200
it's not a big deal.

859
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,200
Go and call Madam back.

860
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,200
Yes.

861
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,200
Your Highness, Madam Fu

862
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,200
is still sick and can't see the guest.

863
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,200
The guest?

864
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,200
It's only been a few days.

865
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,200
She has become

866
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,200
a guest from a friend.

867
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,200
Your Highness, don't be angry.

868
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,200
Be careful of your health.

869
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,200
Where is that bitch Yao?

870
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,200
Your Highness, she...

871
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,200
Yao is now in hiding.

872
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,200
Lord Yao is talking to her.

873
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,200
I think she wants to get married

874
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,200
and completely forget about the King.

875
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,200
Bitch!

876
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,200
All are bitches!

877
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,200
How dare you lie to me?

878
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,200
You are so unruly!

879
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,200
I thought I was easy to mess with.

880
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,200
I dare you to ask Prime Minister.

881
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,200
Get lost!

882
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,200
Fu Yunxi!

883
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,200
Zhuang Hanye!

884
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,200
Come out!

885
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,200
Fu Yunxi!

886
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,200
Your Highness,

887
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,200
what are you doing?

888
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,200
Fu Yunxi,

889
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,200
I heard that you are getting married again.

890
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,200
Today,

891
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,200
I want to be your witness.

892
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,200
Write a divorce letter

893
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,200
and drive Miss Zhuang

894
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,200
out of the door of the mansion.

895
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,200
Why do you want to fight?

896
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,200
I can't do that.

897
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,200
Fine.

898
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,200
It's fine if it's fake.

899
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,200
I have decided today

900
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,200
to make the marriage real.

901
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,200
This divorce letter,

902
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,200
will you write it

903
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,200
or not?

904
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,200
If I say no,

905
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,200
you are dead.

906
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,200
You are dead.

907
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,200
As the saying goes,

908
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,200
you'd rather break up than break the engagement.

909
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,200
You are so passionate.

910
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,200
You even come to someone's house

911
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,200
to force them to get married.

912
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,200
Mrs. Fu, you are really a good sister.

913
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,200
How dare you show up?

914
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,200
I didn't force anyone to marry me.

915
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,200
I am just a wife.

916
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,200
I am not as strong as a wall.

917
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,200
Why would I be afraid of showing up?

918
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,200
You!

919
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,200
Although you are a noble,

920
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,200
you should follow the etiquette.

921
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,200
You'd better not make a scene.

922
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,200
Otherwise,

923
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,200
if the family of the king is exposed,

924
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,200
you won't be able to get any benefits.

925
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,200
Fu Yunxi,

926
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,200
Zhuang Hanyan,

927
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,200
today

928
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,200
is your death day.

929
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,200
The emperor is under your feet.

930
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,200
The prince has been mobilizing the army of the royal family.

931
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,200
Aren't you afraid of being blamed in the palace?

932
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,200
I will kill you first.

933
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,200
What's the crime?

934
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,200
I will take the responsibility.

935
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,200
Kill!

936
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,200
Stop!

937
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,200
Your Highness.

938
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,200
Eunuch Feng, what are you doing here?

939
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,200
Where is Mrs. Fu?

940
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,200
You are...

941
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,200
under the order of the imperial concubine.

942
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,200
Call Mrs. Fu Zhuang Hanyan

943
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,200
to enter the palace to meet you.

944
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,200
I, Zhuang Hanyan,

945
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,200
will take the order.

946
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,200
I will go to the palace to meet you.

947
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,200
I will go to the palace to meet you.

948
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,200
I will go to the palace to meet you.

949
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,200
I will go to the palace to meet you.

950
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,200
I will go to the palace to meet you.

951
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,200
I will go to the palace to meet you.

952
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,200
I will go to the palace to meet you.

953
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,200
I will go to the palace to meet you.

954
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,200
I will go to the palace to meet you.

955
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,200
I will go to the palace to meet you.

956
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,200
I will go to the palace to meet you.

957
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,200
I will go to the palace to meet you.

958
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,200
I will go to the palace to meet you.

959
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,200
I will go to the palace to meet you.

960
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,200
She forgot who she is,

961
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,200
pretending to be a noble.

962
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,200
The night is dark,

963
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,200
the sky is deep,

964
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,200
the fog is thick.

965
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,200
She has entered the battlefield,

966
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,200
and is not allowed to be distracted.

967
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,200
How much love, how much hate,

968
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,200
there is no need to ask.

969
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,200
Who is fake, who is real,

970
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,200
love needs to be changed.

971
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,200
In the middle of the grievance,

972
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,200
the autumn is warm,

973
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,200
it is hard to face the sadness,

974
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,200
and the smile is not real.

975
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,200
The waves are hot,

976
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,200
the flag is high,

977
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,200
who can escape?

978
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,200
She is willing to be a person who leaves,

979
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,200
but she is not right.

980
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,200
She is like an ancient city.

981
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,200
Even if we meet on the road,

982
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,200
our eyes will be blood-red,

983
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,200
and we will have no grudge or hatred.

984
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,200
The road is deep, the sky is not clear,

985
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,200
and the fog is thick.

986
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,200
Please hold my hand.

987
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,200
She is willing to be a person who leaves,

988
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,200
but she is not right.

989
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,200
She is willing to be a person who leaves,

990
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,200
but she is not right.

991
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,200
She is willing to be a person who leaves,

992
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,200
but she is not right.

993
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,200
She is willing to be a person who leaves,

994
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,200
but she is not right.

995
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,200
She is like an ancient city.

996
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,200
The waves are hot,

997
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,200
the sky is not clear,

998
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,200
and the fog is thick.

999
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,200
The road is deep, the sky is not clear,

1000
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,200
and the fog is thick.

1001
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,200
Please hold my hand.

1002
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,200
She is willing to be a person who leaves,

1003
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,200
but she is not right.

1004
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,200
She is willing to be a person who leaves,

1005
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,200
but she is not right.

1006
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,200
She is willing to be a person who leaves,

1007
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,200
but she is not right.
