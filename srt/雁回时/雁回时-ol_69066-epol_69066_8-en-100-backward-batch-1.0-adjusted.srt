00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,100
=Episode 8=

3
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,590
Zhuang Hanyan.

4
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,680
(Scholarly Glory)

5
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,710
It's only been a few days,

6
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,760
and now you're acting
all virtuous and graceful.

7
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,120
This is...

8
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,230
Greetings, gentlemen.

9
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,320
I am Yang Ping,

10
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,510
a scholar from Nanzhang Town
in Danzhou.

11
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,950
I live next door
to Mr. Zhang Youchang and his wife,

12
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,000
and have long been acquainted
with Miss Hanyan.

13
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,230
Forgive me.

14
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,240
I didn't notice you earlier, Mr. Yang.

15
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,560
But if I recall,
you failed the provincial exams.

16
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,120
What brings you to the Capital?

17
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,000
I came with fellow townsmen

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,150
to broaden my horizons.

19
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,150
What's it to you?

20
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,560
Of course, it doesn't.

21
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,080
It's been a while.

22
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,960
Here's a toast to you.

23
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,520
I wouldn't dare.

24
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,190
Miss Hanyan, please keep your distance.

25
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,360
I fear you might
bite my other ear as well.

26
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,870
What do you mean?

27
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,080
Mr. Zhuang, haven't you heard?

28
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,630
Miss Hanyan was truly remarkable

29
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,120
back in Danzhou.

30
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,400
Biting off ears was nothing for her.

31
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,910
Stealing from the neighbors

32
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,630
and beating up children was also her doing.

33
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,280
She's known as the wild and unruly girl.

34
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,960
When I saw her just now,

35
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,220
I didn't dare to recognize her.

36
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,150
How come she's changed completely

37
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,680
since coming to the Capital?

38
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,000
She's even acting like a proper lady now.

39
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,030
Not just in Danzhou,

40
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,190
she was domineering even in our household.

41
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,750
What an embarrassment.

42
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,030
Look at her now.

43
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,840
Only when leaving the house,

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,190
does she act so pretentious.

45
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,400
Yuchi.

46
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,280
Mr. Yang, is there some misunderstanding?

47
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,120
- Hanyan is…
- No misunderstanding.

48
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,520
Everything he said is true.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,710
Beating up children?

50
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,150
That was giving back what I got.

51
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,000
Stealing from the neighbors?

52
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,680
That was reclaiming my jewelry
after it was taken,

53
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,080
with nowhere to seek justice.

54
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,960
In a fit of rage,

55
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,590
I bit off half your ear.

56
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,310
Was it not because you called me
the Barefoot Ghost,

57
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,120
stole my shoes and socks,

58
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,030
and forced me to walk barefoot
on thorns and brambles

59
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,910
until my feet bled for your amusement?

60
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,560
I only fought back in desperation.

61
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,080
You've studied classics since childhood,

62
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,800
yet you took delight
in tormenting a helpless girl

63
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,960
without even the slightest sense of shame.

64
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,840
Still sharp-tongued as ever.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,360
I was raised in the rural lands of Danzhou,

66
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,680
lacking proper manners and refinement.

67
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,890
But the Zhuang family is strict and upright,

68
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,270
and Father is strict
in disciplining his children.

69
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,560
I've been home but two short months,

70
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,680
yet under my father's guidance,

71
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
I've worked hard to shed my old habits,

72
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,830
lest I bring shame upon my parents.

73
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,300
The ancients said, "A gentleman,
even when parting ways, does not speak ill."

74
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,070
Yet when you saw me today,

75
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,950
you cast aside propriety

76
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,600
and humiliate me over past grievances.

77
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,630
Who would dare befriend you after this?

78
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,470
You…

79
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,510
Mr. Yang.

80
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,720
This is a joyful gathering.

81
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,360
Let's not dampen the mood.

82
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,680
Hurry back and enjoy your meal.

83
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,040
Mr. Zhuang, with such a daughter,

84
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,680
your home may soon know no peace.

85
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,470
How insolent.

86
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,020
Ms. Zhou,

87
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,300
why did you choose to ride
in the same carriage with me?

88
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,660
For the incident at the banquet,

89
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,020
thank you for stepping up

90
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,180
and saving our family from disgrace.

91
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,220
I'm deeply grateful.

92
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,980
Naturally, I must properly thank you.

93
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,380
No need for the courtesy.

94
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,420
We are family. Don't mention it.

95
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,020
You've suffered injustice today.

96
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,340
Back in Danzhou,

97
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,050
your foster parents should've protected you.

98
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,980
How could they allow that scoundrel

99
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,300
to humiliate you so?

100
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,100
Foster parents have cared for me tirelessly.

101
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,740
I don't want to worry them anymore.

102
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,140
You've always been so thoughtful and caring.

103
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,060
Unlike my two little troublemakers.

104
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,580
The household matters are many,

105
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,020
and it's my first time managing them,

106
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,420
so there are bound to be lapses.

107
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,380
Miss Hanyan, please assist me
whenever you can.

108
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,620
This is all for the sake of our dignity.

109
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,620
You handle everything with care.

110
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,140
There is no need for me to worry.

111
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,660
It's just that during today's banquet,

112
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,020
Yuchi claimed he's confident
about tomorrow's test.

113
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,660
All the elders are to see his fine work.

114
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,980
You may need to remind him to stay focused.

115
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:55,020
If he falters, and Father is shamed,

116
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,380
I fear Father's anger may turn on you,

117
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,220
blaming you for poor upbringing.

118
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,980
Thank you for your advice, Miss Hanyan.

119
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,340
This spot is indeed secluded.

120
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,300
Is it convenient for you to live here?

121
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,020
I'm fine.

122
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,700
Why are you here?

123
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,580
Do you remember Yang Ping?

124
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,900
The one whose ear you bit off?

125
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,700
He's in the Capital.

126
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,780
He's staying at the Yinan Guild Hall.

127
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,100
I never expected

128
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,740
I'd run into that scoundrel again.

129
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,100
What's he doing here?

130
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,540
It's likely Ms. Zhou's doing.

131
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,820
Zhou Ruyin?

132
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,820
She sent someone to Danzhou?

133
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,460
I'm just speculating.

134
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,540
Since she already sees me as a rival,

135
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,940
she'd want to know her enemy.

136
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,340
I don't know what other tricks
she has up her sleeve.

137
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,460
Yang Ping has held a grudge for years,

138
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,900
and he is a threat.

139
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,940
Should we get rid of him first?

140
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,140
Fu Yunxi is watching you.
Don't act recklessly.

141
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,260
But right now, there's another matter.

142
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,860
Today's incident was just an appetizer.

143
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,940
Maybe we don't have to start with the key.

144
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,380
If we aim to bring them down completely

145
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,700
and seize the power in their hands,

146
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,980
we must address the root cause.

147
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,860
That country girl

148
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,620
puts on the airs of a noble lady,

149
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,660
flaunting her pathetic literary skills.

150
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,260
Now she managed to win Father's favor.

151
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,380
Because of her, I'm stuck here studying.

152
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,500
You're acquainted with the frivolous.

153
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,180
Why not spread the word about our

154
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,780
Miss Hanyan?

155
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,940
Find her a husband and marry her off.

156
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,660
Then, she'll stop attracting trouble

157
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,020
and clinging to Yunxi.

158
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,060
Dear sister,

159
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,740
that's not hard at all.

160
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,340
Other girls are flawless,

161
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,580
even under a magnifying glass.

162
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,020
I told you to watch your brother study,

163
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,820
but you're gossiping here.

164
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,300
My sister doesn't know poetry or literature.

165
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,100
Having her watch over me is useless.

166
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,060
If you had any talent,

167
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,140
Mom wouldn't have sent me here.

168
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,260
Enough.

169
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,900
I've started managing.

170
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,860
The slightest mistake could
be used against me.

171
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,380
The last thing we need is more trouble.

172
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,020
You troublemakers had better shape up!

173
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,940
Shape up.

174
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,140
(Analects, Volume 15)

175
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,620
Regarding tomorrow's test,

176
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,500
are you fully prepared?

177
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,180
Yuchi, sit down.

178
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,300
Here.

179
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,300
Read this passage.

180
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,900
Made him leader of all the princes,

181
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,780
and brought order to the world.

182
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,070
To this day,
people benefit from his gifts.

183
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,580
But for Guan Zhong, we might now

184
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,460
be folding our robes to the left.

185
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,780
What does "brought order to the world" mean?

186
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,740
Mom, why are you suddenly asking this?

187
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,380
Mom,

188
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,060
could it be in tomorrow's test?

189
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,820
You don't need to excel in tomorrow's test,

190
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,860
just handle it calmly and steadily.

191
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,700
Don't disgrace the Zhuang family again,

192
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,820
and don't make your father angry.

193
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,180
Today,

194
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,980
you must not step out of this room.

195
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,630
Work on that phrase

196
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,380
and burn it into your brain.

197
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,680
No more questions.

198
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,580
Yes.

199
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,520
I won't embarrass you, Mom.

200
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,100
Even with this question in hand,

201
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,100
you still wouldn't know how to answer it.

202
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,340
You always understand me.

203
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,940
If you want my help,

204
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,380
say something nice.

205
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,220
Dear sister.

206
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,140
Dear sister, come on.

207
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,140
Sit.

208
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,620
I'll handle Zhuang Hanyan for you,

209
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,580
just help me one this time.

210
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,420
Deal.

211
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,100
Do you have a plan?

212
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,420
Of course.

213
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,940
Zhuang Hanyan's demeanor.

214
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,380
I can manage that too.

215
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,300
Awesome.

216
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,900
(Yinan Guild Hall)

217
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,700
(Everlasting Glory, Eternal as Sun and Moon)

218
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,140
Mr. He, you're studying hard.

219
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,860
Have some tea and snacks.

220
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,940
You must be Miss Zhuang Yushan.

221
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,690
I dare not trouble you.

222
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,160
A meeting this late might be…

223
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,920
I heard your grandfather
once passed the imperial exam.

224
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,600
You're from a noble family, too.

225
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,020
Grandfather earned the title
in his twenties.

226
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,460
My father is a county-level scholar.

227
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,500
Now, he barely manages to support the family.

228
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,980
Miss Yushan, what brings you here?

229
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,100
When I read earlier today,

230
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,340
I came across a sentence in the Analects

231
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,900
that I couldn't quite grasp.

232
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,420
Word has it

233
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,660
that among the scholars from Yinan,

234
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,460
you're the most gifted in literature.

235
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,040
(Brought order to the world)
I was hoping you could enlighten me.

236
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,540
You flatter me.

237
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,820
(Brought order to the world)

238
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,220
So it's this sentence.

239
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,740
It's also in Cao Cao's

240
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,580
"Short Song Ballad".

241
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,780
"His achievements top the hegemons.

242
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,540
He united the lords
and brought order to the world."

243
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,940
That phrase means…

244
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,100
Wait a moment.

245
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,700
I have no extraordinary memory skills.

246
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,540
Could you, perhaps, put your insights

247
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,040
into an essay so that I may take it back

248
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,860
and study it in detail?

249
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,580
Alright.

250
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,060
Many thanks, Mr. He.

251
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,140
By the way, at today's banquet,

252
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,580
Miss Hanyan was…

253
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,860
What about her?

254
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,220
I…

255
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,420
Nothing.

256
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,740
Miss Hanyan is quite talented.

257
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,060
If you have any questions,

258
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,540
it's more convenient to ask her.

259
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,980
Are you unwilling

260
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,540
to enlighten me?

261
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,660
No.

262
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,660
I'll start writing now.

263
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,020
(Brought order to the world)

264
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,380
(Yinan Guild Hall)

265
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,540
How did it go?

266
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,580
Like fish in a barrel.

267
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,420
Let me see.

268
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,580
I don't quite understand his essay.

269
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,340
You'd better read through it carefully.

270
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,440
No mistakes allowed.

271
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,540
Yes.

272
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,560
Thank you, sister.

273
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,780
If there's no issue,

274
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,060
it's best to memorize it all.

275
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,020
If someone asks about it someday,

276
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,340
make sure you can answer.

277
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,340
I'll surely do well on the test.

278
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,660
Let's go.

279
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,230
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

280
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,380
- Greetings.
- Good day.

281
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,350
Please, come inside.

282
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,220
Father.

283
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,780
Your son is truly outstanding.

284
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,860
He must have inherited your wisdom.

285
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,460
You flatter me.

286
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,300
Greetings, gentlemen.

287
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,180
Greetings, gentlemen.

288
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,100
I appreciate your efforts.

289
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,460
The hour has come.

290
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,660
Test begins.

291
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,360
(Test One, Guan Zhong served
and brought order to the world.)

292
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,780
(The Emperor)

293
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,340
Sir.

294
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,860
May I withdraw

295
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,260
from this test?

296
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,340
Why is that, Scholar He?

297
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,460
While casually reading last night,

298
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,900
I came across an essay on this topic.

299
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,220
If I simply replicate it now,

300
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,900
it'd be the same as cheating.

301
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,700
Scholar He, you are upholding integrity.

302
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,980
I deeply admire that.

303
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,980
This is a small test among our Yinan peers

304
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,940
for our own enjoyment.

305
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,220
If you wish to withdraw, you may do so.

306
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,020
Thank you.

307
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,220
(to bring order to the world)

308
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,420
Your son indeed has the talent
of a top scholar.

309
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,060
This topic is drawn
from "The Analects: Xian Wen."

310
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,100
(Virtue and Vice)
It refer to Confucius' praise of Guan Zhong,

311
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,260
meant to assess one's
understanding of humanity.

312
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,060
Mr. Zhuang's essay,

313
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,540
has a polished beginning,

314
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,900
cites classical references in the middle,

315
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,170
and ends seamlessly as one cohesive piece.

316
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,190
Truly a masterpiece.

317
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,180
- A masterpiece.
- Indeed.

318
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,700
My son happened to catch the timing.

319
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,060
It's nothing remarkable.

320
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,540
Mr. Zhuang, you are too modest.

321
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,160
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

322
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,030
Kneel!

323
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,300
Kneel.

324
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,300
Recite the original line from The Analects

325
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,080
that mentions bringing order to the world.

326
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,100
Father, why do you ask this?

327
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:50,160
The Master said, "Guan Zhong acted
as prime minister to Duke Huan,

328
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,000
made him leader of all the princes
and brought order to the world.

329
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,900
To this day,
people benefit from his gifts.

330
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,580
You can't even remember the original text.

331
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,500
How can you write such a compelling article?

332
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,620
Father is well-read and is renowned

333
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,780
for your incredible memory.

334
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,260
But I was not blessed with the same gift.

335
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,380
Then repeat what I just said.

336
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,590
Confucius said…

337
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,340
Said...

338
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,580
This is the son you've raised.

339
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,580
Master, this is my fault.

340
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,460
Yuchi lacks a quick mind,

341
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,420
so I had him prepare in advance

342
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,300
to uphold your honor.

343
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,820
What do you mean?

344
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,500
I...

345
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,540
I caught a glimpse

346
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,540
of the question in your study.

347
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,980
So I told Yuchi in private.

348
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,140
You...

349
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,020
Did you write this essay yourself?

350
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,620
"A ruler must possess
the virtue of governance,

351
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,830
thus, the gentleman
will choose to serve him."

352
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,050
Yes, Father, I wrote it.

353
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,340
Even if the question was known beforehand,

354
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,220
producing such a work
is quite an achievement.

355
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,700
Ruyin, you're Yuchi's mother

356
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,660
and in charge of household affairs.

357
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,100
You should not have resorted to such act.

358
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,620
Master, it is entirely my fault.

359
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,220
Please punish me.

360
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,660
Forget it.

361
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,540
A few words of praise today mean little.

362
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,740
Once the Spring Exam comes,

363
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,780
the truth will be revealed.

364
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,380
Let's take it one step at a time.

365
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,580
Master, is there anything in this essay

366
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,460
that might cause trouble?

367
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,620
Only the three examiners have seen it.

368
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,460
I've already filed it away.

369
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,580
Do not let word spread.

370
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,460
If anyone praises or flatters you,

371
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,300
remember to remain humble.

372
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,980
Just say it was a coincidence.

373
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,240
Do you understand?

374
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,100
Understood.

375
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,700
Rest assured, Master.

376
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,380
I will make sure to guide Yuchi properly.

377
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,180
Yuchi, tell me the truth.

378
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,020
The examiner said the essay
has the makings of a top scholar.

379
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,840
But you've only studied for a few days.

380
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,260
How could you write
something of such quality?

381
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,300
Why? Are you unhappy

382
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,780
that I'm talented?

383
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,860
In your eyes,

384
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,300
am I nothing but a useless fool?

385
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,660
Sister.

386
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,820
Look at you.

387
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,380
(Nurturing Grace)

388
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,220
Mr. You.

389
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,660
Bottom up.

390
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,500
Cheers.

391
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,020
To be honest,

392
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,860
Miss Hanyan is more stunning
than the actresses

393
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,290
(You Yong)
of the Music Institution.

394
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,780
When can I visit her in person?

395
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,860
Leave it to me.

396
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,780
Mr. You, if you're interested,

397
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,260
you can visit anytime.

398
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,160
Deal.

399
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,100
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

400
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,420
You've been stealing the light these days.

401
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,220
I heard your essay

402
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,380
was highly praised recently.

403
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,900
Tell me, what exactly did you write?

404
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,060
Come on. Share it with us.

405
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,780
Young Master Yuchi,

406
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,020
I heard your essay is comparable

407
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,340
to "Ode to the Three Capitals."

408
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,140
How did you approach the topic?
Could you share?

409
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,140
Please.

410
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,300
Tell them.

411
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,460
Just humble work.

412
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,820
- So modest.
- You're too humble.

413
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,180
They say the scholars of Yinan
are unmatched.

414
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,540
And upon meeting today, I see
there are always

415
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,860
mightier men.

416
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,100
Well said.

417
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,820
- Let's drink.
- Cheers.

418
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,660
Please.

419
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,820
Join us at the table.

420
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:55,860
Alright.

421
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,700
- Please.
- Please.

422
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,020
Mr. Zhuang comes from a scholarly family.

423
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,380
We are truly humbled in comparison.

424
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,220
My father serves in the Hanlin Academy.

425
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,420
He personally taught me.

426
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,340
I have mastered all the classics.

427
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,180
That's a true scholarly family.

428
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,180
Indeed.

429
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,020
Mr. Zhuang,

430
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,740
why not seize the moment today

431
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,220
and emulate the ancients?

432
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,460
Recite a few lines from your essay,

433
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,580
then join the songstress in harmony.

434
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,980
Let us all learn.

435
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,820
Excellent suggestion.

436
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,980
Recite for us.

437
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,250
- Alright.
- Share a few lines.

438
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,180
Here we go.

439
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,980
A ruler must possess
the virtue of governance,

440
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,820
thus, the gentleman…

441
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,260
The gentleman.

442
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,600
Thus, the gentleman
will choose to serve him.

443
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,660
Serve him.

444
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,040
Mr. Zhuang, have you forgotten?

445
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,180
You forgotten?

446
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,050
No, I haven't.

447
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,320
I haven't.

448
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,020
The next line is "Gentleman."

449
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,740
Gentleman…

450
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,740
A gentleman values fairness and virtue.

451
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,100
Haven't you all not seen it?

452
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,180
How would you know?

453
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,140
I haven't seen it. Have you?

454
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,140
Let's have a drink.

455
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:02,980
Let's drink.

456
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,420
Full of talk about sages, reeking of alcohol.

457
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,110
How can one write like this?

458
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,620
Who's causing a ruckus here?

459
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,320
Who are you?

460
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,900
- Let's check it out.
- Let's go.

461
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,740
Let's go.

462
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,500
Mr. Zhuang, such vile men must be punished.

463
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,620
Please.

464
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,740
Go take a look.

465
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,060
Yes.

466
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,940
Who are you?

467
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,700
Where did you come from?

468
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,220
Showing off before the son
of a Junior Compiler?

469
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,180
Exactly.

470
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,620
A gentleman

471
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,220
must seek wisdom

472
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,130
from the great emperors,

473
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,540
governing with virtue

474
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,860
and using law as the last resort.

475
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,820
If Confucius knew a scholar like you,

476
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,060
he'd die of shame!

477
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,140
What nonsense!

478
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,460
That quote was from your essay.

479
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,260
You don't even recognize your own words?

480
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,700
I don't need to.

481
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,020
Exactly.

482
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,540
Memorize it all you want.

483
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,540
That's right.

484
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:09,460
It seems you hardly live up to your name.

485
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,610
Just an empty reputation.

486
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,460
Not worth my time.

487
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,570
- Let's go.
- Go.

488
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,700
Who are you?

489
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,540
Utter foolishness.

490
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,020
Mr. Zhuang, he's not worth your attention.

491
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,860
Let's go up and drink.

492
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,340
- Ignore him.
- Drink up.

493
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,580
Seems Young Master Zhuang

494
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,660
is about to cause trouble again.

495
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,620
Mr. Zhuang's essay…

496
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,220
Zhuang Hanyan.

497
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,500
What a coincidence.

498
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,580
Mr. You, come here.

499
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,340
It must be fate.

500
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,820
Isn't the one you seek right here?

501
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,820
Greetings, Miss Zhuang Hanyan.

502
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,660
That's right.

503
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,420
I am You Yong.

504
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,100
It seems fate has brought us together.

505
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,980
I just heard…

506
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,320
Mr. You.

507
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,620
Be careful.

508
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,360
Watch your step.

509
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,840
Are you alright?

510
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,540
Zhuang Hanyan,

511
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,980
apologize to your future husband.

512
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,140
Yuchi, this is a public setting.

513
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,500
I advise you to restrain yourself.

514
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,740
Don't disgrace your own family.

515
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,740
Zhuang Hanyan,

516
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,860
don't be ungrateful.

517
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,060
Mr. You,

518
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,980
tonight, I shall decide for her.

519
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,700
She will be betrothed to you.

520
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,190
Prepare a fine guest room.

521
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,030
Go.

522
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,460
- They'll consummates the marriage tonight.
- Yes.

523
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,420
It's too fast.

524
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,500
Congrats, Mr. You.

525
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,500
Congratulations.

526
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,220
Zhuang Hanyan.

527
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,300
Did I say you could leave?

528
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,420
From the Judicial Review?

529
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:40,900
Why are you here?

530
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,540
Miss Hanyan, Mr. Fu summons you.

531
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,500
We'll find another chance.

532
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,620
Miss Hanyan, what an elegant evening.

533
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,380
Drinking alone?

534
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,340
Aren't you the same?

535
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,220
We're tracking a female bandit.

536
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,540
It's said she appeared at Chaling Tavern.

537
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,060
Miss Hanyan's fish took the bait tonight.

538
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,780
But mine hasn't yet.

539
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,180
Fishing always requires bait.

540
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,460
What bait are you using?

541
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,740
Isn't she sitting right in front of me?

542
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,180
She's got excellent sword skills.

543
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,420
I'd actually like to spar with her again.

544
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,340
Must you force me this way?

545
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,020
Miss Hanyan, what do you mean?

546
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,980
Could it be that you know that bandit?

547
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,020
I don't know her.

548
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,620
What is her background?

549
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,040
How long have you known her,
and what's your relationship?

550
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,460
I don't know what you're talking about.

551
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,920
Since you arrived in the Capital,

552
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,300
I've helped you multiple times.

553
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,900
Yet you still don't trust me.

554
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,220
Please forgive me,

555
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,980
I don't know

556
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,060
what exactly you want me to say.

557
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,660
Your guard is impressive.

558
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,220
In the Capital, fewer words
mean fewer troubles.

559
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,540
A fish keeps its mouth shut

560
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,100
is often harder to catch with a hook.

561
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,300
If there's nothing else,

562
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,220
I'll take my leave.

563
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,620
What are you doing?

564
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,460
If I were to kill you right now,

565
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,460
do you think she would show herself?

566
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,900
Even the vice minister of Judicial Review

567
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,660
cannot take lives so recklessly.

568
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,580
Not if it's a commoner.

569
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,660
But if it's a bandit criminal,

570
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,860
then it's simply execution before reporting.

571
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,500
Finally took the bait.

572
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,220
Run. He's tricking you.

573
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,780
Who are you, really?

574
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,820
Speak.

575
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,020
Let her go.

576
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,860
Run.

577
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,180
Zhuang Hanyan,

578
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,400
this is the second time
you tried to kill me.

579
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,580
I thought you were just a sly fox.

580
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,780
Turns out, wolves hunt in pairs.

581
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,780
You forced me to do this.

582
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,380
Mr. Gao.

583
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,220
Mr. Gao, please.

584
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,060
This way, please.

585
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,570
This way.

586
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,420
Mr. Gao, please.

587
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,660
Serve the dishes.

588
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,620
Yes, sir.

589
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,900
Mr. Gao, any news
from the Ministry of Punishments?

590
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,420
Though the Three Judicial Offices
are working together

591
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,480
to eradicate the remnants
of Pei's faction,

592
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:18,460
but all power lies
within the Judicial Review.

593
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:23,220
The Ministry of Punishments
is merely a group of errand boys.

594
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:27,020
There are rumors that Pei Dafu
had an adopted son

595
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,780
still hiding in the Capital.

596
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,420
Are you aware of that?

597
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,660
Two years ago, Pei Dafu held a banquet.

598
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,780
I happened to catch a glimpse
of his adopted son.

599
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:41,780
The man stood nine feet tall,
with a face full of bristling whiskers.

600
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,140
When he spoke,

601
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,980
his voice rolled like thunder.

602
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,600
It was truly awe-inspiring.

603
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,580
You really saw him?

604
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,500
Why would I lie?

605
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,320
Here.

606
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,260
Mr. Gao.

607
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,660
What do you want?

608
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,960
Miss Hanyan is smart and resourceful.

609
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,660
Why don't you take a guess?

610
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,460
The most frequented

611
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,500
Chaling Tavern of capital officials

612
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,780
hides a secret chamber.

613
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,060
If you push me any further,

614
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,020
I'll spread the word

615
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,260
about what I saw and heard.

616
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,560
Chaling Tavern will never
get customers again.

617
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,740
As for the adopted son they mentioned,

618
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,580
I will reveal that as well.

619
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,940
Miss Hanyan,

620
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,860
play with fire, and you might get burned.

621
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:39,940
Play with fire?

622
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,780
I am the fire.

623
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,460
Sir.

624
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,980
Those two at Hongyun Hall.

625
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,280
Their words are hard to discern.

626
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,420
Bring them back for interrogation.

627
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,820
Yes, I will handle it at once.

628
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:06,130
I won't interrupt your fine evening
with Miss Hanyan.

629
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,100
Cut it out.

630
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,900
Sir, about that other matter.

631
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,260
Are we going to proceed?

632
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,100
Get lost.

633
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,580
What is the matter?

634
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,220
Does it concern me?

635
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:24,900
Miss Hanyan,

636
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,620
the case of the adopted son is critical.

637
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,460
If you're interested,

638
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,420
why not join the Judicial Review?

639
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,060
We have secret informants
across the capital.

640
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,660
As you saw tonight,

641
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,180
Chaling Tavern is part of our property.

642
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,140
If you're willing to work as one,

643
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,380
I'll ensure you're well compensated.

644
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,260
I'm not capable of such things.

645
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,260
Just use a fraction of the skills you have

646
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,460
to deal with Zhuang Yuchi.

647
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,420
Yuchi and I are bound by blood.

648
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,660
Why would I go against him?

649
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,060
What about those instigators earlier?

650
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,580
Weren't they hired by you?

651
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,180
I only just arrived in the Capital.

652
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,100
I just wanted to see the bustling taverns.

653
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,980
How could I know anyone?

654
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,180
Where is she?

655
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,540
She's here.

656
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,340
Here she is.

657
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,540
Miss, we finally found you.

658
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,460
We thought

659
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,780
you ran off.

660
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,660
Indeed.

661
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,260
Everything you asked for is done,

662
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,300
but there's still half the payment left.

663
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,500
- Right.
- Right.

664
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,580
Take the silver and leave quickly.

665
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,180
- Thank you.
- Much appreciated.

666
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,100
- Let's go.
- Call us next time.

667
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,260
Back to drinking now.

668
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,780
You two put on quite a show.

669
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,860
Your double act

670
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,580
is more entertaining than the opera.

671
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,420
It's getting late. I'll be going now.

672
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,140
We should stay out of each other's way
from now on.

673
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,540
Take care, Miss Hanyan.

674
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,540
Does it hurt?

675
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,540
Nothing serious.

676
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,900
You were too reckless.

677
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,980
He wouldn't actually kill me.

678
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,820
Why did you have to fight him?

679
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,500
His mind is as deep as a pool.

680
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,340
It's unfathomable.

681
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,980
Never trust him easily.

682
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,100
He may not want to arrest you.

683
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,220
Moreover, today,

684
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,740
I've also found a handle against him.

685
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:41,220
In recent days, he may not dare act rashly.

686
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,900
Be careful not to anger him.

687
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,460
Don't worry.

688
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,300
However,

689
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,740
his subordinates mentioned
one unfinished task.

690
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:55,420
Their words seem to involve me in some way.

691
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,980
Leave me alone.

692
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,300
Mr. You,

693
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,140
does your grandfather know

694
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,300
you're indulging in pleasure
and neglecting your duties?

695
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,500
Mind your own business.

696
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,380
Who are you, anyway?

697
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,260
I'm passing along a message.

698
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,220
Stay away from Miss Zhuang Hanyan.

699
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,660
Don't think about pursuing her.

700
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,860
Well, I'm telling you now.

701
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,990
I will have

702
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,040
any woman I fancy.

703
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,060
Just watch me.

704
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,340
Help.

705
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,380
I can't swim.

706
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,020
The water's shallow.

707
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,820
You won't drown.

708
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,660
Help.

709
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,660
Hello?

710
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,020
Is anyone there?

711
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,780
Get me out.

712
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,380
Hurry.

713
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,380
Don't let him escape.

714
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,620
Stop him.

715
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,620
How is he?

716
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,300
He's drunk.

717
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,580
He spilled alcohol on me. Disgusting.

718
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,500
That was a personal matter for you.

719
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,320
It can't be counted in the stipend.

720
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,660
(Hanlin Academy)

721
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,620
Mr. Zhuang, you're here.

722
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,540
(Endless Learning)
Congratulations, Mr. Zhuang.

723
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,380
A son should aspire to be like Zhuang's son.

724
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,340
Indeed.

725
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,140
What's there to celebrate?

726
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,460
You always said
your son was unambitious,

727
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,900
uninterested in scholarly pursuits.

728
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,620
Turns out it was deliberate modesty.

729
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,600
A punishment's in order.

730
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:47,460
That's right.

731
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,540
Don't pretend you don't know.

732
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,820
Your son's essay has stunned the Capital.

733
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,020
Even the Emperor has heard of it.

734
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,060
This morning, His Majesty
summoned Yinan Guild Hall,

735
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,860
requesting the finest essays for review.

736
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,560
Your son's bright future is about to come.

737
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,140
His Majesty reviewed the papers?

738
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,460
I knew nothing of this.

739
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,860
Mr. Zhuang, stop pretending.

740
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,620
When you host the victory banquet
after the Spring Exam,

741
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,380
be sure to invite us.

742
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,180
Yes, that's right.

743
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,220
Mr. Zhuang may have an excellent memory,

744
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,460
capable of reciting the classics,

745
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,100
but when it comes to literary talent,

746
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,620
you might be overshadowed by your son.

747
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,860
The student surpasses the teacher.

748
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,620
Excuse me.

749
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,390
- Mr. Zhuang.
- Mr. Zhuang.

750
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:34,260
(Unfulfilled Talent)

751
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:48,100
It's no trivial matter. It must
be investigated thoroughly.

752
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,900
Mr. Zhuang is truly anxious.

753
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,460
You've come just in time.

754
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,460
What's going on?

755
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,300
Mr. Zhuang, your arrival is timely.

756
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,460
Saves us the trouble of sending for you.

757
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,340
Fifty catties of white cogongrass.

758
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,060
Five loads each of jujube, peach,
hazelnut, plum, and water caltrop.

759
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,330
Got it.

760
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,180
Before the ritual,

761
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:17,140
all offerings must be placed
atop the white cogongrass

762
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,300
- to show reverence.
- Yes.

763
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,340
Mom.

764
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,680
It seems you're the one
managing the household now.

765
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,860
You've got everyone
running around tirelessly.

766
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,820
You should be studying.

767
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,020
No need to concern yourself with the ritual.

768
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,370
You might not have heard yet.

769
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,380
His Majesty has requested my test paper.

770
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,060
This is a great honor for our family.

771
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,540
I had to come share the good news.

772
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,900
The Emperor reviewing your paper?

773
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,620
Are you serious?

774
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:49,940
Scared?

775
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,660
What's the use of reading
the useless books all day?

776
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,340
You're nothing but a foolish woman

777
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,730
who's not qualified for the exams.

778
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,280
If I achieve greatness in the future,

779
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,220
the Zhuangs will certainly not keep you here.

780
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,500
Though we were not born of the same mother,

781
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,100
we are still bound by blood.

782
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,900
Why must you be so cruel?

783
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,600
Ruan Xiwen was in charge for years.

784
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,180
Do you know how much my mom has endured?

785
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,180
I'll make sure you and your mother
pay it back in full.

786
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,220
I will never let you off the hook.

787
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,740
Don't drive a dog into a corner.

788
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,380
Don't you understand that?

789
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,900
What do you mean?

790
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,300
If you push me too far,

791
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,180
you'll force me to fight you.

792
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,560
Are you certain you can defeat me?

793
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,070
Yuchi?

794
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,580
Mom.

795
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,380
What brings you to the kitchen?

796
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,820
His Majesty reviewed my paper.

797
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,740
How did it reach His Majesty?

798
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,340
If word of the leak of question spreads,

799
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,500
it would be a grave crime.

800
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,220
It's only known to us.

801
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,660
How could it get out?

802
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,860
No way Yushan is trying to hurt me.

803
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:58,860
Mom.

804
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,860
Yuchi, bad news.

805
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,220
Mr. Han and the Judicial Review have arrived.

806
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,060
They're summoning everyone
to the guild hall.

807
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,100
- Let's go.
- Go.

808
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,700
(Eternal as Sun and Moon)

809
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,060
Young Master Zhuang,

810
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,980
"Brought order to the world",

811
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,820
was this essay written by you?

812
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,700
It was.

813
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:34,060
Very well. Then explain this to me.

814
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:36,300
Why is the essay you wrote recently

815
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,820
identical to the essay

816
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,420
composed by Vice Minister Han Wenzheng

817
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:41,860
twenty years ago?

818
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,500
That piece has been seen by few,

819
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,460
and the manuscript's kept
in Mr. Han's residence.

820
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,060
I have no idea.

821
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,260
The examiner should explain

822
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,540
why this topic was set.

823
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,020
This question was indeed created by me.

824
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,020
In previous tests,

825
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:04,460
students were often tasked with topics

826
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,260
on livelihood and governance.

827
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:11,380
The phrase may seem simple,

828
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,940
but it encompasses countless meanings.

829
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:16,660
It tests the students' knowledge
of various schools of thought.

830
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:20,580
I wonder how Young Master Zhuang came to…

831
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,420
It seems Mr. Zhuang has raised a fine son.

832
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:27,260
Even before the imperial exam,
he resorts to cheat,

833
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,580
causing such an uproar

834
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,060
that His Majesty has taken notice.

835
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,380
To put it bluntly,

836
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,620
it's a crime of deceiving the Emperor.

837
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,300
Kneel.

838
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,580
I am guilty.

839
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,820
My son is young and ignorant,

840
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,760
bringing disgrace to the exam and my family.

841
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,700
I plead for His Majesty's forgiveness.

842
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,420
I shall punish him strictly.

843
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,260
Sir.

844
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:53,220
The essay was not written by my brother.

845
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,220
It was He Wenshen who wrote it.

846
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,860
Yes, it was He Wenshen.

847
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,700
Yes.

848
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,980
Where is He Wenshen?

849
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,460
I'm here.

850
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,500
Greetings, sir.

851
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,420
What do you have to say?

852
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,540
Sir,

853
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,380
on the night before the test,

854
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,860
Miss Yushan took "The Analects,"

855
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,020
seeking my guidance.

856
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,420
She asked how that phrase
should be explained

857
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,420
and requested me to write it down for her.

858
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,260
Only then did I…

859
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,620
Mr. Zhuang, blinded by fatherly devotion,

860
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,540
had revealed the question himself.

861
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,760
Yushan,

862
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,420
where did you get that question?

863
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:34,980
Father, I sought guidance from Mr. He.

864
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,300
But the essay was indeed written by him.

865
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,500
He plagiarized it.

866
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,020
Sir, may I have a look?

867
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,620
The essay Young Master Zhuang wrote

868
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,080
is not the same as the one I wrote.

869
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,060
Although I have studied for a few years,

870
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,440
I could never produce

871
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,020
such a brilliant work.

872
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,170
That night, I drafted multiple versions

873
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,100
while refining my thoughts.

874
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,060
I have the drafts.

875
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,660
You can check them to verify.

876
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:06,940
Present them.

877
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:20,460
This is indeed completely different.

878
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,460
How could this have happened?

879
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:26,740
Although I inadvertently
learned of the question early,

880
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,620
I dared not engage in any dishonest act.

881
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,580
I withdrew on the day
of the test.

882
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,260
All the sirs can vouch for me.

883
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,060
Zhuang Yuchi,

884
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:39,340
do you have anything else to say?

885
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,060
I'm innocent, Mr. Yan.

886
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,060
Someone must be trying to set me up.

887
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,420
This essay was clearly written by He Wenshen.

888
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,180
How could it be Han Wenzheng's work?

889
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,180
Zhuang Yuchi, silence.

890
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:51,330
Father.

891
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,580
The Emperor has issued a decree.

892
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,620
Zhuang Yuchi has acted dishonorably.

893
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,980
He is accused of plagiarism
and moral corruption.

894
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,140
Considering it's not formal,

895
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,100
he will not face severe punishment.

896
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:05,540
However, he is permanently barred
from future exams.

897
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,590
Take him to the entrance
of the Judicial Review

898
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:08,880
and display him for three days.

899
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,780
Mr. Yan, I am innocent.

900
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,060
Junior Compiler Zhuang Shiyang.

901
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,300
Poor parenting. Dock half a year's salary

902
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,420
as a warning to others.

903
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,060
Guards, take him!

904
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:17,900
Have mercy.

905
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,780
Your Majesty, please have mercy.

906
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,940
- Father, please save Yuchi.
- Father.

907
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,860
- Father.
- Father.

908
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,260
- Yuchi.
- Yuchi.
