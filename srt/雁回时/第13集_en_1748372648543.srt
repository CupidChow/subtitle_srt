Oh wait, did my

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

3
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

4
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

5
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

7
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

8
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

I'm not sure if you can hear me.

I'm not sure if you can hear me.

I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

I'm not sure if you can hear me.

I'm not sure if you can hear me.

I'm not sure if you can hear me.

I'm not sure if you can hear me.

I'm not sure if you can hear me.

38
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

41
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

51
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

52
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

54
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

55
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

56
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

57
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,980
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

58
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,980
Why do you have to leave me?

59
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,980
Love is a destiny.

60
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,980
Actually, you are my heart.

61
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,980
You are my body.

62
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,980
Don't be so heartless.

63
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,980
Let's go.

64
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,980
The sound of falling rain.

65
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,980
It's the closest to you.

66
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,980
It's like a life.

67
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,980
The blood of destiny.

68
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,980
It's the blood of destiny.

69
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,980
The world is too shallow.

70
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,980
I don't want to live in the world.

71
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,980
I don't want to live in the world.

72
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,980
The blood of destiny.

73
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,980
It's the blood of destiny.

74
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,980
What do you want?

75
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,980
What exactly is it?

76
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,980
What I want is

77
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,980
just a home.

78
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,980
Did you find a home?

79
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,980
The blood of destiny.

80
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,980
The world is too shallow.

81
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,980
I don't want to live in the world.

82
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,980
I don't want to live in the world.

83
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,980
The blood of destiny.

84
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,980
The world is too shallow.

85
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,980
I don't want to live in the world.

86
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,980
I don't want to live in the world.

87
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,980
The blood of destiny.

88
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,980
The world is too shallow.

89
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,980
I don't want to live in the world.

90
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,980
I don't want to live in the world.

91
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,980
The blood of destiny.

92
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,980
The world is too shallow.

93
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,980
I don't want to live in the world.

94
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,980
I think I saw you in my dream.

95
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,980
I'm in the dream.

96
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,980
At this moment, you are by my side.

97
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,980
I see you.

98
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,980
Brother-in-law is coming to the house so soon.

99
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,980
The house is under the control of the Dali Temple.

100
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,980
Please forgive me, Miss San.

101
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,980
The Zhuang family is in trouble.

102
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,980
There is nothing to forgive me.

103
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,980
What are your plans?

104
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,980
Fuyun Xi.

105
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,980
There are many changes these days.

106
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,980
I don't believe you can't find the truth.

107
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,980
You know what?

108
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,980
Right?

109
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,980
Do you know what is the difference?

110
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,980
They were just in the rain.

111
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,980
They will be in the dead of dawn tomorrow.

112
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,980
I still have a day.

113
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,980
What else do you want to do?

114
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,980
I can't do anything.

115
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,980
No matter what,

116
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,980
I will do everything.

117
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,980
I don't care.

118
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,980
No matter what,

119
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,980
I will save my mother and Zhuang family.

120
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,980
I will go to Zhao Yu's house.

121
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,980
Even if it's a dead end,

122
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,980
I should have the right to investigate.

123
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,980
Don't forget.

124
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,980
Your life is already being stolen.

125
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,980
Now, you are not pretending to be your family.

126
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,980
My lord.

127
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,980
My lord.

128
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,980
The Duchao Academy sent someone to urge you.

129
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,980
Let's go.

130
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,980
Where are you going?

131
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,980
Zhao Yu.

132
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,980
Even if she let you in,

133
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,980
she won't be willing to see you again.

134
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,980
She will make you feel at home again.

135
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,980
If the family is gone,

136
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,980
what else can we do in this world?

137
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,980
If we can't save our mother,

138
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,980
I will have nothing to do with it.

139
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,980
If you have nothing to do with it,

140
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,980
I am willing to offer you a place to live.

141
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,980
Thank you, brother.

142
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,980
But you don't understand.

143
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,980
What kind of position does the family have?

144
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,980
I don't want to live like that in this life.

145
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,980
My lord.

146
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,980
When Zhuang Shiyang was in the prison,

147
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,980
he was back again.

148
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,980
He wanted to see someone.

149
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,980
Who?

150
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,980
Zhuang Han Yan.

151
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,980
My lord.

152
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,980
My lord, wake up.

153
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,980
Wake up.

154
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,980
Our Zhuang family is in a mess.

155
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,980
Only one daughter is left.

156
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,980
We should ask our parents to meet

157
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,980
and talk to them.

158
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,980
They should give us a lesson.

159
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,980
Han Yan.

160
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,980
Father, Zhu Yu is here.

161
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,980
Han Yan.

162
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,980
Father.

163
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,980
What can I do for you?

164
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,980
Just tell me.

165
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,980
Thank you, father.

166
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,980
Can you let us have a talk

167
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,980
and talk to them alone?

168
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,980
It's not a rule.

169
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,980
I will try.

170
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,980
Father.

171
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,980
What happened to the knife?

172
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,980
Did you really have a relationship with Pei Dang?

173
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,980
You really did it.

174
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,980
You can't say that.

175
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,980
I have a hard time.

176
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,980
Pei Da Fu is a reasonable person.

177
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,980
He has a lot of trouble.

178
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,980
I just want to be a little bit more modest.

179
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,980
I have no right or wrong.

180
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,980
I want to protect my family's life.

181
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,980
Sometimes, I can't do anything.

182
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,980
So,

183
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,980
it's hard to get a knife.

184
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,980
In short,

185
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,980
we are all in the same boat.

186
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,980
Only you can save our family.

187
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,980
We can make a living.

188
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,980
We can make a living.

189
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,980
We can make a living by climbing the mountain.

190
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,980
I believe you have a way.

191
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,980
This is...

192
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,980
Now,

193
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,980
we are in the same boat.

194
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,980
Someone is in a hurry.

195
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,980
We are pretending to be dead.

196
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,980
Even if we have evidence,

197
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,980
we can't let them take our words.

198
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,980
We can't just tell them.

199
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,980
We are afraid that they will kill us.

200
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,980
We will be in danger.

201
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,980
What should I do?

202
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,980
Remember.

203
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,980
There is a head and a head.

204
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,980
The crime of the descendant

205
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,980
shouldn't be linked to the former.

206
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,980
The crime of the former

207
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,980
shouldn't be linked to the latter.

208
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,980
Our family's life

209
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,980
is in your hands.

210
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,980
Lord Zhuang.

211
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,980
You want to ask for a woman's consent.

212
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,980
I want to explain the matter.

213
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,980
I'm sorry.

214
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,980
I'm sorry.

215
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,980
Zhai Yang.

216
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,980
Zhai Di.

217
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,980
The maid.

218
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,980
The housekeeper is indeed

219
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,980
a good buyer.

220
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,980
But

221
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,980
this is the old thing

222
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,980
two or three years ago.

223
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,980
I don't think

224
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,980
there is a record

225
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,980
of the brand.

226
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,980
That means

227
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,980
Zhai Di is not a new maid.

228
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,980
She is a good buyer.

229
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,980
That's not true.

230
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,980
This girl.

231
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,980
Who are you?

232
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,980
Why do you ask?

233
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,980
You found out the record.

234
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,980
My maid

235
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,980
is a good buyer.

236
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,980
I dare not offend you.

237
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,980
You.

238
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,980
You'd better go.

239
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,980
Go.

240
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,980
You.

241
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,980
What are you doing?

242
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,980
Amber.

243
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,980
I'll give you all these.

244
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,980
I just want you to tell the truth.

245
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,980
The former owner of the Zhuang family

246
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,980
is the prince of the court.

247
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,980
Why do you look for him?

248
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,980
Prince of the court?

249
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,980
Prince of Shunping.

250
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,980
How could you know?

251
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,980
The good man's crime

252
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,980
shouldn't be linked to the former.

253
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,980
The past is a crime.

254
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,980
And it shouldn't be a retribution

255
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,980
to the future.

256
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,980
Do you mean

257
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,980
the maid is the former owner of the house?

258
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,980
I know what she is talking about.

259
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,980
Amber.

260
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,980
Do you know

261
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,980
who Prince of Shunping is?

262
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,980
He seems to be

263
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,980
a man.

264
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,980
He is mysterious.

265
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,980
He is over 40 years old.

266
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,980
He is a man

267
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,980
who is a man.

268
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,980
He is a man.

269
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,980
Over 40 years old.

270
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,980
He is also

271
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,980
connected to the person

272
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,980
who is the one who is the one.

273
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,980
Whether he is a man

274
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,980
or not,

275
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,980
if I can find him,

276
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,980
I might be able to find him.

277
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,980
Amber.

278
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,980
I advise you

279
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,980
not to

280
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,980
talk about Prince of Shunping.

281
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,980
Why?

282
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,980
Although he is a foreign prince,

283
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,980
he is not a real man.

284
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,980
But he is a royal family.

285
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,980
Moreover,

286
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,980
he is a foreign man.

287
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,980
He is not a good man.

288
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,980
It is said that

289
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,980
after he left the house a few days ago,

290
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,980
he disappeared again.

291
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,980
He disappeared.

292
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,980
Isn't that so?

293
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,980
I think

294
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,980
he should

295
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,980
meet some enemies

296
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,980
and then be kidnapped by enemies.

297
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,980
Now, in the Prince's Mansion,

298
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,980
there is only one

299
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,980
Princess Consort.

300
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,980
Amber.

301
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,980
You just said

302
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,980
you are still a man.

303
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,980
What?

304
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,980
Are you going to sell people

305
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,980
or sell people?

306
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,980
Sell people.

307
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,980
Who?

308
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,980
Me.

309
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,980
I am going to sell people.

310
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,980
I am going to sell people.

311
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,980
I am going to sell people.

312
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,980
I am going to sell people.

313
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,980
I am going to sell people.

314
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,980
I am going to sell people.

315
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,980
I am going to sell people.

316
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,980
I am going to sell people.

317
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,980
I am going to sell people.

318
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,980
I am going to sell people.

319
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,980
I am going to sell people.

320
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,980
I am going to sell people.

321
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,980
I am going to sell people.

322
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,980
I am going to sell people.

323
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,980
Your Highness, be careful.

324
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,980
You girl.

325
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,980
Don't touch me.

326
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,980
Your Highness, please forgive me.

327
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,980
Why did I see you for the first time?

328
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,980
You are so handsome.

329
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,980
I am Yan'er.

330
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,980
I am the maid of the new house.

331
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,980
The new house?

332
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,980
You were sent to the house.

333
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,980
Who sent you?

334
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,980
The Prince sent me.

335
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,980
Prince?

336
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,980
Where is the Prince?

337
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,980
What nonsense are you talking about?

338
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,980
Who said the Prince is back?

339
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,980
Why did the Princess come back?

340
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,980
What are you afraid of?

341
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,980
Who are you?

342
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,980
You are the Prince of the capital.

343
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,980
You have a lot of injuries.

344
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,980
Prince is always treating you badly.

345
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,980
Why did the Princess

346
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,980
think Prince wouldn't come back?

347
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,980
Did you kill her?

348
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,980
You are a coward.

349
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,980
You girl.

350
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,980
What are you doing here?

351
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,980
I have been feeling uncomfortable for days.

352
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,980
You are at home.

353
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,980
You are so naughty.

354
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,980
You are so elegant.

355
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,980
Comfortable?

356
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,980
We Wu family

357
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,980
have long suspected that you are the secret agent.

358
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,980
You should tell the truth.

359
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,980
Otherwise, we will be in the palace and we will be in peace.

360
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,980
Go.

361
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,980
Why do I dare not?

362
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,980
I married you Wu family.

363
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,980
A few years ago,

364
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,980
I had a few questions.

365
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,980
But after the marriage,

366
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,980
she was like a ghost.

367
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,980
She trapped me in this courtyard.

368
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,980
She trapped me in this mansion.

369
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,980
I don't want her to die.

370
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,980
She is dead.

371
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,980
No one dares to hit me.

372
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,980
Like me.

373
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,980
Even I go to the village

374
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,980
and find a husband and wife to marry.

375
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,980
I am here.

376
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,980
I suffer and suffer.

377
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,980
So,

378
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,980
do you really not know what she is doing?

379
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,980
I wanted to leave some face to her.

380
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,980
I don't want to talk about it.

381
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,980
But you Wu family

382
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,980
have been bothering me twice.

383
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,980
Why don't you go to the red-leaved courtyard

384
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,980
to ask the witch

385
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,980
and the little girl

386
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,980
who is the right woman for me.

387
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,980
You Wu family

388
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,980
are so rude.

389
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,980
Red-leaved courtyard?

390
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,980
I spent a lot of money

391
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,980
to get this dress from my mother.

392
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,980
Answer my question first.

393
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,980
Your Highness is my master.

394
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,980
That day,

395
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,980
she left the red-leaved courtyard

396
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,980
and left alone in the morning.

397
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,980
Then I heard that she didn't see the witch.

398
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,980
I really don't know

399
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,980
what she is doing now.

400
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,980
What does she have to say

401
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,980
when she meets you?

402
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,980
What does she mean?

403
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,980
If you don't say it,

404
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,980
I will tear this dress.

405
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,980
From now on,

406
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,980
you will be a heartless,

407
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,980
heartless, and unprotected woman.

408
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,980
No, no, no.

409
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,980
Forget it.

410
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,980
You have already done for me.

411
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,980
You don't have to do this anymore.

412
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,980
I will tell you everything.

413
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,980
That prince

414
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,980
is indeed a bit inappropriate.

415
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,980
What is wrong with him?

416
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,980
When I was with him,

417
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,980
he drunk.

418
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,980
I went up to help him

419
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,980
to unwind the dress.

420
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,980
I didn't want to

421
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,980
attract him to be angry.

422
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,980
Later,

423
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,980
he had been working for me for a long time.

424
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,980
He went to the room

425
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,980
to drink and sleep.

426
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,980
He never got married to a bedside man.

427
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,980
He even told me

428
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,980
not to tell anyone about this.

429
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,980
I already guessed it.

430
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,980
I heard that

431
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,980
the princess in his mansion

432
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,980
must be because of

433
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,980
her bad temper.

434
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,980
She is in a state of displeasure.

435
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,980
Two years ago,

436
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,980
there were still some mosquitoes.

437
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,980
But after the marriage,

438
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,980
she was in a state of displeasure for three years.

439
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,980
She was like a ghost.

440
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,980
She trapped me in this courtyard

441
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,980
and lived in this mansion.

442
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,980
Su Wen was buried in the valley

443
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,980
and was taken to the body.

444
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,980
Could it be that

445
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,980
the mansion was a separate courtyard

446
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,980
three years ago?

447
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,980
She was buried in the valley

448
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,980
and was taken to the body.

449
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,980
As soon as she found the way,

450
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,980
she was in the camp.

451
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,980
She could prove that

452
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,980
she was the one.

453
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,980
She could save the whole family.

454
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,980
You are

455
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,980
more affectionate

456
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,980
than the officials in Dalisi.

457
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,980
Dalisi?

458
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,980
Yes.

459
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,980
The day before the prince passed away,

460
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,980
he came to the palace

461
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,980
and asked me about it.

462
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,980
He was quite handsome.

463
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,980
But he was

464
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,980
a poor and unruly Luo Chani.

465
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,980
Do you know the woman's name?

466
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,980
I remember her name.

467
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,980
Fu.

468
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,980
My lord.

469
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,980
After Miss Zhuang Jia

470
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,980
came out of the camp,

471
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,980
she went to find a maid.

472
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,980
She went to the Prince of Shunping's mansion

473
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,980
with a maid in the back.

474
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,980
She was so angry

475
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,980
that she left the mansion.

476
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,980
But she couldn't take care of

477
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,980
her for hours.

478
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,980
If you think

479
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,980
what she said

480
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,980
is true,

481
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,980
then you are right.

482
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,980
I am not a maid.

483
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,980
I just want to say

484
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,980
what Zhuang Shiyang said in the prison.

485
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,980
She really wants to

486
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,980
turn the case against the Prince of Shunping.

487
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,980
There is a head and a head.

488
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,980
The latter should not be charged with the crime.

489
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,980
The criminal

490
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,980
should not be the latter.

491
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,980
Now Zhuang Shiyang is in the dark room

492
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,980
to ask Zhuang Hanye

493
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,980
to find the former member of Zhuang Jia's house.

494
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,980
All the secrets

495
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,980
are on her head.

496
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,980
If Zhuang Hanye

497
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,980
can really do this,

498
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,980
no matter how strong she is,

499
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,980
she can really

500
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,980
take the blame for Zhuang Jia's full power.

501
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,980
But my lord,

502
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,980
Prince of Shunping is so ignorant.

503
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,980
Wait and see.

504
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,980
Go to the Prince of Hongliu

505
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,980
and you will be

506
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,980
punished by me.

507
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,980
My lord.

508
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,980
Miss Zhuang Jia came out of the door to see her.

509
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,980
She came quite quickly.

510
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,980
This is beautiful.

511
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,980
I want this.

512
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,980
What a pity that the seal

513
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,980
sold in the shop

514
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,980
is all flower pots.

515
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,980
It doesn't look better.

516
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,980
What else?

517
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,980
For example,

518
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,980
your father's waistline

519
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,980
has a magic beast.

520
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,980
It will look better

521
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,980
when it is printed.

522
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,980
Ah-Chi.

523
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,980
Brother.

524
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,980
Brother.

525
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,980
Look at Hanye's

526
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,980
flower shop.

527
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,980
Is it beautiful?

528
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,980
Yes.

529
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,980
Hanye's little aunt.

530
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,980
Brother, the waistline

531
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,980
has a magic beast.

532
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,980
Brother.

533
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,980
Can you lend me

534
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,980
your waistline?

535
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,980
Brother.

536
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,980
Okay.

537
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,980
Here.

538
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,980
Why are you here today?

539
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,980
Brother-in-law said today

540
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,980
that if I can't find

541
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,980
the seal of the body,

542
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,980
I can come to the Fu's house

543
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,980
and borrow it.

544
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,980
Is this going to be a disaster?

545
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,980
Are you serious?

546
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,980
It seems that

547
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,980
what you said today

548
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,980
is just a talk.

549
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,980
Why are you giving up suddenly?

550
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,980
I just recognized the reality.

551
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,980
I lost the identity of the Zhuang family's enemy.

552
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,980
I didn't even

553
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,980
find the meal today.

554
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,980
Don't mention it.

555
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,980
I saved Zhuang family's door.

556
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,980
If Brother-in-law

557
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,980
just keeps his mouth shut today,

558
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,980
I will be the one to blame.

559
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,980
I will take my leave.

560
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,980
Wait.

561
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,980
What else do you have to say?

562
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,980
If you really want to

563
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,980
find the place to live,

564
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,980
I will arrange it for you.

565
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,980
You don't have to

566
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,980
ask about the meaning of the family's mother.

567
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,980
I can make the decision on this.

568
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,980
Thank you, Brother-in-law.

569
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,980
I don't know

570
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,980
if I can prepare some food for me.

571
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,980
I haven't been able to get close to the rice today.

572
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,980
I'm already hungry.

573
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,980
That's good.

574
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,980
You go to the restaurant first

575
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,980
and wait for the guests.

576
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,980
Stop him.

577
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,980
Miss San, please forgive me.

578
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,980
I'm sorry.

579
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,980
What can I do for you?

580
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,980
Do you want to go to A-Zhi

581
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,980
to play with her new tricks?

582
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,980
I don't want to.

583
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,980
Brother-in-law is smiling.

584
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,980
I'm here for the second time.

585
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,980
I don't know the place.

586
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,980
It's okay.

587
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,980
Please.

588
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,980
My Lord.

589
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,980
Do you trust her?

590
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,980
No.

591
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,980
Is she going to

592
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,980
steal your waist?

593
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,980
Go and see.

594
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,980
My Lord.

595
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,980
Are you okay?

596
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,980
No.

597
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,980
My waist is naturally firm.

598
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,980
Mo Mo.

599
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,980
Miss San from Zhuang's family is coming to the restaurant.

600
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,980
Go and prepare some food for her.

601
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,980
And prepare a room.

602
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,980
Remember, don't be late.

603
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,980
I just saw that

604
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,980
Miss San from Zhuang's family

605
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,980
was leaving from the backyard.

606
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,980
That's right.

607
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,980
Mo Yan,

608
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,980
do you have a waist belt?

609
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,980
Of course.

610
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,980
My Lord.

611
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,980
I...

612
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,980
Stop her.

613
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,980
What a good trick.

614
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,980
We both got it.

615
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,980
Mo Fang.

616
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,980
Mo Yan.

617
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,980
Mo Yan.

618
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,980
Mo Fang.

619
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,980
Miss San.

620
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,980
Fuyun Xi, it's hard.

621
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,980
Mo Yan has been rescued.

622
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:51,900
He asked me to come to the Grand

623
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,980
What?

624
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,980
What's going on?

625
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,980
It's from the left bank.

626
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,980
It seems that

627
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,980
there's a person named Wu You Zhi.

628
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,980
But I don't understand the situation.

629
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,980
I didn't understand.

630
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,980
They are looking for Wu You Zhi's whereabouts.

631
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,980
Wait.

632
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,980
I'll go with you.

633
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,980
Open the door.

634
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,980
Miss San from Zhuang's family has been here.

635
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,980
My Lord, I don't know who is Miss San from Zhuang's family.

636
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,980
But a woman just now came here.

637
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,980
I don't know what she said.

638
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,980
They are both in a panic.

639
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,980
They are going to the north.

640
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,980
Let's go.

641
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,980
Yes.

642
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,980
Where are we going?

643
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,980
We are going to find Wu You Zhi.

644
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,980
Who is she?

645
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,980
She is also a female.

646
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,980
Yes.

647
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,980
Why is she in Fuyun Xi's hands?

648
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,980
It's complicated.

649
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,980
I'll wait for the people to tell you.

650
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,980
My Lord.

651
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,980
Brother.

652
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,980
My Lord.

653
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,980
Wu You Zhi is locked up here.

654
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,980
My Lord.

655
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,980
Where is my brother?

656
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,980
Why is he in the crowd?

657
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,980
Did they take the left bank to another place?

658
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,980
Miss San.

659
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,980
What do you mean?

660
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,980
Please give me an explanation.

661
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,980
Where is Wu You Zhi?

662
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,980
I want to see him.

663
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,980
Put down your knife.

664
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,980
Zhuang Hanyan.

665
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,980
I underestimated you.

666
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,980
Fuyun Xi.

667
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,980
I underestimated you.

668
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,980
You said I was lying.

669
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,980
But you are honest to me.

670
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,980
Where is Wu You Zhi?

671
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,980
Why did you hide him here?

672
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,980
You two are in the room.

673
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,980
I'm outside.

674
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,980
Yes.

675
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,980
Don't look for Wu You Zhi.

676
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,980
He is not in the room.

677
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,980
You don't have the weapon you are holding.

678
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,980
Sit down.

679
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,980
What did Zhuang Shiyang tell you?

680
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,980
Isn't he in the room?

681
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,980
I heard the wind in the 13th floor of the 2nd floor.

682
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,980
But I don't understand the words of a poor man.

683
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,980
I'm from the Prince's Mansion.

684
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,980
You dare to steal the waist belt from the palace.

685
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,980
You are willing to come to find Wu You Zhi.

686
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,980
You think my father is a master in the prison?

687
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,980
You follow me?

688
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,980
You will be sweating.

689
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,980
Yes.

690
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:58,980
So your father is not a cruel person.

691
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,980
The saying goes that the merchant is a witness.

692
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,980
Why doesn't the president of the Danzhou Chamber of Commerce

693
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,980
leave the capital and go to the capital to make a witness?

694
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,980
This man is a good man.

695
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,980
If he goes to the capital,

696
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,980
he will have a relationship with the country.

697
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,980
That's a coincidence.

698
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,980
He has been in the capital for a long time.

699
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,980
He has never thought about it.

700
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,980
Until Mr. Fu went to Danzhou once,

701
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,980
he suddenly went to the capital and only recognized the word.

702
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,980
You dare to say that you have never seen him in Danzhou?

703
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,980
Never.

704
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,980
Then he went to the capital this time

705
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,980
and it's possible that he was under your control.

706
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,980
It's possible.

707
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,980
I already guessed that when you took the Zhuang Fu Yuzhu Xuan,

708
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,980
you were trying to investigate the wealth of Pei Da Fu's chair.

709
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,980
Is it related to the business of Danzhou?

710
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:51,980
It seems that you found the president of Danzhou

711
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,980
and already got his statement.

712
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,980
You knew that Pei Da Fu was missing a year ago.

713
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,980
It's not true.

714
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,980
You knew that the president of the Chamber of Commerce

715
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,980
was not good enough to be a witness.

716
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,980
You didn't want to move.

717
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,980
Later, you forced me to listen to the family's situation.

718
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,980
You knew that my mother had a lot of evidence

719
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,980
and that it was enough to prove that my father was Pei Da Fu's son.

720
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,980
At that time, you only ordered the president to go to the capital

721
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,980
and let him find Yuwen Chang'an to provide evidence

722
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,980
to prevent my mother from making a big trouble.

723
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,980
So when we were trapped in the Chamber of Commerce,

724
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,980
you were able to do such a thing.

725
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,980
So you were able to know that something big was going to happen in advance.

726
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,980
You sent the family out of the capital to avoid the trouble.

727
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,980
Did I say something wrong?

728
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,980
Now that our Zhuang family is in this disaster,

729
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,980
it seems that my mother and Yuwen Chang'an are in a trance

730
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,980
and everything is in your hands.

731
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:49,980
You are the one who pushed Zhu Lan behind.

732
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:54,980
You are the real mother and son.

733
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,980
Why did I do that?

734
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,980
I heard that His Majesty had you in the palace that day.

735
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,980
You were able to find out your son's identity within 30 days.

736
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,980
This is a very serious matter.

737
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,980
If you still have nothing to do in 30 days,

738
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,980
His Majesty will be sorry for what he did

739
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,980
and you will be dead.

740
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,980
Miss San, you are really smart.

741
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:35,980
You are so smart that you really made a big deal out of it.

742
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,980
As long as you push the result forward,

743
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:43,980
even though there are many flaws, it's not that hard.

744
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,980
You really know what's going on.

745
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,980
Zhuang Shiyang is not that good at speaking.

746
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,980
He has been through a lot since he was born.

747
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,980
But he has already admitted that he is the son of the Party.

748
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,980
Now, he is really in the past.

749
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,980
No matter how many times I have tried,

750
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,980
I have never forgiven him.

751
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,980
Even if he is really the son of the Party,

752
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,980
even if he is the biggest evil,

753
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,980
why would my mother have to be buried with him?

754
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,980
He is really innocent.

755
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,980
But all of this is not as he wishes.

756
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,980
If I tell you the truth,

757
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,980
do you really want to save Zhuang Shiyang

758
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,980
and make him pay for his long-awaited plan?

759
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,980
I want to save him.

760
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,980
Of course I want to save him.

761
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,980
I have been living for 17 years.

762
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,980
This is the first time I know

763
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,980
what kind of position my mother has to protect.

764
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:49,980
I finally found my mother in my life.

765
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,980
But I will lose everything tomorrow.

766
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,980
Whether he has a grudge against me,

767
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,980
no matter what kind of grudge he has,

768
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,980
whether it is a grudge against me or not,

769
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,980
I can help him in the future.

770
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,980
But he must not be so ignorant and innocent

771
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,980
and act with Zhuang family.

772
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,980
So,

773
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,980
where exactly am I?

774
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,980
He is dead.

775
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,980
His corpse

776
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,980
is buried in the empty space in the house.

777
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,980
It's okay.

778
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,980
His life is good.

779
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,980
Now, the sky and the earth are moving.

780
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,980
As long as the corpse is not broken,

781
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,980
it will prove that he is a thief.

782
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,980
What medicine?

783
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,980
Sleep well.

784
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,980
Don't make a sound.

785
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,980
Fu Yunxi.

786
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,980
Please.

787
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,980
Let me go.

788
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,980
Zhuang Hanyin.

789
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:47,980
I should be the one who asked you to let me go.

790
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,980
There is something you guessed wrong.

791
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,980
I am not a person who is not ignorant and innocent.

792
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,980
He is a spy.

793
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,980
He is a hard-working man.

794
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,980
A month ago, I caught him in the Daris' prison.

795
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,980
But I didn't expect that he would be killed

796
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,980
even if he didn't even have a single round of interrogation.

797
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,980
Although he is dead,

798
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,980
I can't tell whether he is dead or not.

799
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,980
He is a person who is not well-known

800
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,980
and has a very good reputation.

801
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,980
He is a royal blood.

802
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,980
If you let him go,

803
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,980
I will be punished for my crime.

804
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,980
Zhuang Hanyin.

805
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,980
Since you entered the capital, I have been taking you with me.

806
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,980
Now, you have decided to use my life

807
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,980
to change the lives of your Zhuang family.

808
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,980
Fu Yunxi.

809
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,980
You don't need to be so insincere.

810
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,980
You decided to use my mother

811
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,980
to make my Zhuang family suffer.

812
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,980
Have you ever thought about my life?

813
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,980
To the end,

814
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,980
we are all selfish people.

815
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,980
Don't worry.

816
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,980
If you die because of this,

817
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,980
I will definitely

818
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,980
be the emperor and be the emperor to you.

819
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,980
The End

820
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,980
Zhuang Hanyin.

821
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,980
This is the third time you want to kill me.

822
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,980
In the first place,

823
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,980
I thought

824
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,980
we had another possibility.

825
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,980
I...

826
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,980
I...

827
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,980
He is dead.

828
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,980
His corpse is buried in the empty space

829
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,980
in the middle of the forest.

830
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,980
The End

831
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,980
The End

832
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,980
The End

833
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,980
Did I do something wrong?

834
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,980
If you really want to be the emperor,

835
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,980
you just want to be the emperor.

836
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,980
You can't be the emperor.

837
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,980
What about Yu Sini?

838
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,980
She is trying to protect her mother.

839
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,980
But you have your own way of life.

840
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,980
And Wu Youzhi

841
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,980
has the power to do the work.

842
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,980
You let her take the corpse away.

843
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,980
Then, Dali Temple

844
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,980
will investigate her death.

845
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,980
You have to bear the consequences.

846
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,980
It's not just death.

847
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,980
We can investigate it again.

848
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,980
But her mother

849
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,980
might be the last one

850
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,980
to be buried in this world.

851
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,980
Let her go.

852
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,980
Dali Temple

853
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,980
The End

854
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,980
The End

855
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,980
Yesterday, we saw

856
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,980
that Dali Temple

857
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,980
has never been so cool.

858
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,980
Yes.

859
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,980
Listen to me.

860
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,980
Only the lord of the capital

861
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,980
knows how to use the help of the god.

862
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,980
Let's go.

863
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,980
The End

864
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,980
She is a dead person.

865
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,980
Isn't she the third lady of the Zhuang family?

866
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,980
I heard that the Zhuang family is going to the execution.

867
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,980
Oh, it's time to go.

868
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,980
Let's go.

869
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,980
Let's go.

870
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,980
Wu Youzhi is here.

871
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,980
Get ready to go.

872
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,980
I have a request.

873
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,980
What request?

874
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,980
The Zhuang family is going to the execution.

875
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,980
There is a secret passage in the family.

876
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,980
It's the same as Pei Dafu's

877
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,980
garden.

878
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,980
This house

879
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,980
is the same as the one

880
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,980
that was built by

881
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,980
the lord of Shunping three years ago.

882
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,980
The passage is the same as the one

883
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,980
that was built by him.

884
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,980
There is no evidence of it.

885
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,980
There is no evidence of it.

886
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,980
It's the same as the one

887
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,980
that was built by him.

888
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,980
It's the same as the one

889
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,980
that was built by him.

890
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,980
Zhuang Shiyang.

891
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,980
The case is now

892
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,980
confirmed.

893
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,980
Moreover, the lord of Shunping

894
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,980
has been missing for many days.

895
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,980
You have no evidence

896
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,980
of the so-called wrongdoing.

897
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,980
You should still take the order.

898
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,980
The cabinet is ready.

899
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,980
Now.

900
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,980
The court is closed.

901
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,980
The court is closed.

902
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,980
The court is closed.

903
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,980
The court is closed.

904
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,980
The court is closed.

905
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,980
The court is closed.

906
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,980
The court is closed.

907
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,980
The court is closed.

908
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,980
The court is closed.

909
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,980
The court is closed.

910
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,980
The court is closed.

911
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,980
The court is closed.

912
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,980
The court is closed.

913
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,980
The court is closed.

914
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,980
The court is closed.

915
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,980
The court is closed.

916
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,980
The court is closed.

917
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,980
The court is closed.

918
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,980
The court is closed.

919
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,980
The court is closed.

920
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,980
The court is closed.

921
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:33,980
The court is closed.

922
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,980
The court is closed.

923
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,980
The court is closed.

924
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,980
The court is closed.

925
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,980
The court is closed.

926
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:11,980
The court is closed.

927
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,980
The court is closed.

928
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,980
The court is closed.

929
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:17,980
The court is closed.

930
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,980
The court is closed.

931
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,980
The court is closed.

932
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,980
The court is closed.

933
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,980
The court is closed.

934
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,980
The court is closed.

935
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,980
The court is closed.

The court is closed.

938
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,980
