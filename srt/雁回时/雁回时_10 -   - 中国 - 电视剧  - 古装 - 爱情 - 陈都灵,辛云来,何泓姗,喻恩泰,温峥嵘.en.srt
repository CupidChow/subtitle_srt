1
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:41,220
=The Glory=

2
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,150
(The memories of my origins)

3
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,510
(have long since faded.)

4
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,310
(I do not know where I was born,)

5
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,760
(nor do I know)

6
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,400
(where my parents are.)

7
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,870
(Since I can remember,)

8
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,840
(I have made a living on a boat.)

9
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,070
(For a long time,)

10
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,790
(I did not understand emotions.)

11
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,070
(I only knew what exchange was.)

12
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,430
(The old boat master gave me food)

13
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,230
(and a bed to rest upon.)

14
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,150
(So, he was my master,)

15
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,430
(and I had to be loyal to him.)

16
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,960
(Even if I was trained
to be an assassin,)

17
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,910
(I had to become)

18
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,870
(the sharpest blade
in my master's hand.)

19
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,030
What are you doing?

20
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,680
Who are you?

21
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,360
Where is this place?

22
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,630
My name is Chai Jing.

23
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,920
What is your name?

24
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,430
My name is Zhuang Hanyan.

25
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,870
They all call me

26
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,070
the barefoot ghost.

27
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,120
Do you have any food?

28
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,590
Eat slowly.

29
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,600
What is that on your hand?

30
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,070
My foster mother wants to lock me up.

31
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,080
Do not be afraid.

32
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,350
Come on.

33
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,150
Give me your hand.

34
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,160
(I drifted across the sea for years.)

35
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,830
(I thought)

36
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,480
(I'd be cut off from the world forever.)

37
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,190
(Yet I never expected)

38
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
(to form)

39
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,920
(such a bond with her.)

40
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,870
After an hour,

41
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,360
we will reach the Capital.

42
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,360
You are already free.

43
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,910
Why must you return

44
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,830
to the Zhuang Residence?

45
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,000
I've missed that place since childhood.

46
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,510
At least, I want to see

47
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,830
what my home looks like.

48
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,720
Do you not want to go to sea with me?

49
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,640
Chai Jing,

50
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,190
I know you are not used to life on land.

51
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,120
You can leave on your own.

52
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,830
You do not need to stay by my side.

53
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,600
I can take care of myself.

54
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,120
(She saved my life,)

55
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
(tended to my wounds,)

56
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,600
(and gave me food.)

57
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,800
(It was she who made me realize)

58
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,000
(my life)

59
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,100
(was not as insignificant
as an insect's.)

60
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,190
(In those years,)

61
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,720
(she treated me as a sister,)

62
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,160
(but I knew)

63
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,390
(she was my new master.)

64
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,290
(If she wished to pluck the stars,)

65
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,000
(I would carve my bones into steps.)

66
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,160
(If anyone sought to harm her,)

67
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,680
(I would stand)

68
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,750
(as her strongest shield.)

69
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,830
(No matter what she wanted to do,)

70
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,270
(I'd give my all to help her)

71
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,110
(and protect her)

72
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,240
(until death.)

73
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,000
Speak.

74
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,430
Where are your accomplices hiding?

75
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,630
I would like to see

76
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,320
just how tough you can be.

77
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,350
Do you regret it?

78
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,150
No.

79
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,780
=Episode 10=

80
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,320
Miss, you are awake.

81
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,420
I'll go inform the master at once.

82
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,350
Don't.

83
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,390
Hanyan.

84
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,960
I'm glad you are awake.

85
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,670
I'm glad you are awake.

86
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,240
Thanks to the Bodhisattva.

87
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,360
Miss Hanyan is so fortunate.

88
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,480
She even escaped the bandits.

89
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,440
Even if the Judicial Review
is like hell,

90
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,000
she has nothing to fear.

91
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,790
I am so overjoyed

92
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,880
that I forgot to ask.

93
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,360
Why did the Judicial Review
suddenly release you?

94
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,790
That officer did not explain it.

95
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,750
I know

96
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,040
nothing of this.

97
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,960
Did they torture you?

98
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,840
What happened to your face?

99
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,960
It is just a small injury.

100
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Sorry for being unfilial

101
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,360
and making Grandmother and Father worry.

102
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,360
Miss Hanyan, you must rest well.

103
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,630
You just escaped death.

104
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,510
You mustn't exhaust yourself.

105
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,510
Father,

106
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,270
I am weary today.

107
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,750
I would like to rest early.

108
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,200
Very well.

109
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,480
We will speak in detail tomorrow.

110
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,020
Mother,

111
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,560
you should go rest as well.

112
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,870
Rest well.

113
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,600
Master,

114
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,790
Mr. Fu is here.

115
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,750
The culprit has been caught?

116
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,840
During the sacrifice yesterday,

117
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,230
with many irrelevant people present,

118
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,790
I could not reveal the truth.

119
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,470
In fact, the culprit
of the Danzhou bandit case

120
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,720
was captured long ago.

121
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,090
As this case may be linked

122
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,030
to another classified case,

123
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,510
I kept the matter secret

124
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,870
and had the culprit detained elsewhere

125
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,100
for further interrogation.

126
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,440
Since this has escalated

127
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,000
and damaged Miss Hanyan
and my reputation,

128
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,270
I had to hand the culprit over

129
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,270
to the Judicial Review
for investigation.

130
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,910
What is the classified case
you speak of?

131
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,910
I cannot disclose it now.

132
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,000
Sorry for asking too much.

133
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,600
Please forgive me.

134
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,140
Yunxi, thank you for solving the case.

135
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,260
Youchang and his wife can rest in peace,

136
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,940
and my daughter's name has been cleared.

137
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,980
I do not know
how to repay this kindness.

138
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,140
Mr. Zhuang, I just did my job.

139
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,960
If there's nothing else,

140
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,020
I shall take my leave.

141
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,400
I'll see you off.

142
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,740
Mr. Fu,

143
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,780
what does the culprit look like?

144
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,300
Was it truly a woman?

145
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,220
As Miss Hanyan testified,

146
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,740
it was done by bandits.

147
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,380
I can say no more for now.

148
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,140
Since returning to the Capital,

149
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,460
the Danzhou case has weighed heavily
on my mind.

150
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,420
The other day,

151
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,060
before the Bodhisattva, the deities,
and the ancestors,

152
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,540
I was falsely accused

153
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,340
of murdering my foster parents.

154
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,980
The grievance in my heart
was beyond words.

155
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,200
Thankfully, the truth has been revealed,
and the culprit has been captured.

156
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,780
I am the only eyewitness
to the Danzhou case.

157
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,780
Both emotionally and logically,

158
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,900
I should go to the Judicial Review
as a witness with you.

159
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,660
Hanyan makes a good point..

160
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,260
- Why not...
- It's not necessary.

161
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,940
The Judicial Review has its procedures.

162
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,500
If Miss Hanyan is needed,

163
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:41,940
I will summon her.

164
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,220
Yunxi, let me walk you out.

165
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,220
Ms. Zhou,

166
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,700
that maid Lang...

167
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,500
The day she was cast out,

168
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,700
I ordered her to go to Danzhou
to investigate.

169
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,740
Good for her to track down Yang Ping.

170
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,500
Give her some money and have her

171
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,980
leave the Capital quietly.

172
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,420
She must never return.

173
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,660
Understood.

174
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,660
Nanny Tao,

175
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,300
tell me.

176
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,620
Were Zhang Youchang and his wife

177
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,020
truly killed by bandits?

178
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,140
I don't think so.

179
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,500
Miss Hanyan

180
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,460
can't be innocent.

181
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,740
But he said the culprit had been caught.

182
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,220
Could they have found someone

183
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,780
to be the scapegoat for Zhuang Hanyan?

184
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,020
Yet Chief Minister Yan
has always been strict.

185
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,740
How could he be deceived so easily?

186
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,660
- Indeed.
- And he also said

187
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,540
that this is connected
to another classified case.

188
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,020
I really do not understand

189
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,940
what game they are playing.

190
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,140
Ms. Zhou, how cunning of you.

191
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,540
You knew Zhuang Hanyan was watching me,

192
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,900
so you discarded me like a used pawn.

193
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,380
Mr. Yang, you are being paranoid.

194
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,220
That day,
I waited for you for a long time.

195
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,380
You acted so recklessly,

196
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,260
and Zhuang Hanyan still escaped.

197
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,940
Anyway, I gave you the autopsy report.

198
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,060
Did you bring the money

199
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,980
we agreed upon?

200
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,220
This is not enough.

201
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,060
You only completed half the task,

202
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,020
so you only get half the payment.

203
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,460
A fellow scholar says

204
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,420
there is a way to buy
an official position,

205
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,100
but it requires 300 taels.

206
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,580
Yet my pockets are truly empty.

207
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,540
What does that have to do with me?

208
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,220
If you cannot raise the money,

209
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,660
I cannot guarantee what I might say.

210
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,940
The commotion at the Yinan Guild Hall

211
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,060
has brought disgrace to the Zhuangs.

212
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,720
Everyone will be surprised to know
you're behind it.

213
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,020
How dare you?

214
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,220
Why should I be afraid?

215
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,540
This time, for the sacrifice
at the Yinan Guild Hall

216
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,740
and delicacies for the Spring Festival,

217
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,140
the accounts have been running
at a deficit.

218
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,300
Where would I find 200 taels of silver?

219
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,940
You've been favored
in the family for years

220
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,220
and now oversee the household.

221
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,020
You will find a way.

222
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,420
Deliver the money

223
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,220
to this guild hall
by tomorrow at the latest.

224
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,660
I know you are a ruthless woman

225
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,900
and have prepared a backup plan.

226
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,220
If you try to harm me in secret,

227
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,540
this will spread like wildfire,

228
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,740
and the entire city will know.

229
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,380
I take my leave.

230
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,740
You...

231
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,420
Leave me.

232
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,740
Miss Hanyan, rest well.

233
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,500

00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,660
(Court of the Judicial Review)

235
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,500
Stop.

236
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:01,980
Who are you?

237
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,400
I am Zhuang Hanyan
from the Zhuang family.

238
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,500
I want to see Mr. Fu.

239
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,620
Mr. Fu is busy.

240
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,920
He's not receiving guests today.

241
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,360
Please inform him.

242
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,500
Mr. Fu told us this morning.

243
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,680
He is not seeing anyone today.

244
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,900
Miss Hanyan, please return.

245
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,580
You mustn't trespass
on a restricted area.

246
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,380
Sorry, Miss Hanyan.

247
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,620
(Court of the Judicial Review)

248
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,740
(Court of the Judicial Review)

249
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,940
What's the name of the bandit captured

250
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,260
by the Judicial Review yesterday?

251
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,000
(Study Room)
It concerns a classified case.

252
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,060
I can't disclose it.

253
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,300
Have you seen Chai Jing recently?

254
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,580
Who is Chai Jing?

255
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,420
I do not know.

256
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,660
Mr. Fu,

257
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,660
everything you said

258
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,780
at my home today

259
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,820
was a lie, right?

260
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,860
You knew Chai Jing was innocent,

261
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,460
yet you branded her a murderer
and had her imprisoned

262
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,460
and tortured, right?

263
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,680
As the Vice Minister
of the Judicial Review,

264
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,100
you violated the law despite knowing it.

265
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,420
It's punishable by death, right?

266
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,160
I'm the culprit
of the Danzhou murder case.

267
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,220
I killed Zhang Youchang and his wife.

268
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
I've come here today to turn myself in.

269
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,300
Mr. Fu, please release the innocent.

270
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,020
I offer my life in exchange.

271
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,940
Fu Yunxi, let go of me.

272
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,200
She came to prison voluntarily.

273
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,140
I did not force her.

274
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,600
If you continue to make a scene,

275
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,560
you'll fail to save her,

276
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,860
and both of you will die.

277
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,460
Is there a way to save her?

278
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,580
She's confessed in the imperial prison.

279
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,500
She can never retract her statement.

280
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,060
Is there no other way?

281
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,460
At this point,

282
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,660
there is no need for us to lie.

283
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,900
Tell me everything

284
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,980
and all the hidden details

285
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,860
about the Danzhou murder case.

286
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,100
According to Zhang Youchang,

287
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,860
he came from a poor family

288
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,100
and studied hard since childhood.

289
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,380
He claimed to be well-versed
in the classics

290
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,460
but failed the exams repeatedly.

291
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,660
He watched helplessly as my father,

292
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,060
Zhuang Shiyang, a mediocre man,
rose to fame.

293
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,260
He'd been secretly hating him
for a long time,

294
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,900
and he also began to resent me.

295
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,410
Youchang...

296
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,240
- Over the years,
- Stop, stop.

297
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,860
his life was difficult,

298
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,900
and his temper grew more violent.

299
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,580
As his wife could not conceive,

300
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,940
he often beat her.

301
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,500
My foster mother, angered by this,

302
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,860
would vent her frustrations on me.

303
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,020
Since childhood,

304
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,100
I'd endured countless tortures
in that house,

305
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,980
as if I were in hell.

306
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,220
I could bear all of this

307
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,060
but

308
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,980
on my 17th birthday...

309
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,780
Where did the money go?

310
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,460
What are you doing?

311
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,900
Where did you hide the valuables?

312
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,980
Bring them out.

313
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,940
I have no money left.

314
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,460
You've spent it all.

315
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,700
What valuables are left?

316
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,060
If you have the guts, sell me.

317
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,380
Who would want you?

318
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,380
Sell her. She's worth something.

319
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,340
You've raised her for 17 years

320
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,400
without gaining anything.

321
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,060
Sell her to a brothel,

322
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,540
and you'll have money for wine.

323
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,220
At that moment,

324
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,140
Zhang Youchang's gaze towards me

325
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,500
still sends chills

326
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,500
down my spine.

327
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,500
Hold her down. Bring the rope.

328
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,020
You want to run?

329
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,300
Where can you run to?

330
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,980
Come here.

331
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,860
Be good.

332
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,180
Why are you only

333
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,300
telling me all this now?

334
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,140
A murderer will be sentenced to death.

335
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,380
Would the law and the Judicial Review

336
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,580
show mercy for my grievances?

337
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,540
I have no evidence

338
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,340
or witnesses.

339
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,300
(Justice and Reasoning)
My words alone

340
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,020
weren't enough to convince
the officers in Danzhou.

341
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,940
What is your purpose for coming

342
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,500
to the Capital with Chai Jing?

343
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,100
When I first entered the Capital,

344
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,540
I told you the truth.

345
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,620
I just wanted to live

346
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,940
and have a family.

347
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,020
Do you believe me?

348
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,100
For you,

349
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,420
what is family?

350
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,300
I want to have my blood relatives

351
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,620
with me.

352
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,940
So, without a blood bond,

353
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,460
that would not be your family?

354
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,740
I once had such a family

355
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,940
in Danzhou,

356
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,100
in Nanzhang.

357
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,240
That was not the kind of family
I wanted.

358
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,420
I have told you everything

359
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,740
you wanted to know.

360
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,060
Now, let me sign the confession

361
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,220
and send me to prison.

362
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,220
Are you truly willing to trade your life

363
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,100
for Chai Jing's?

364
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,500
Yes.

365
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,860
It's too late.

366
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,420
What do you mean?

367
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,540
The bandits are Chai Jing's accomplices.

368
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,460
She knows Pei Dafu.

369
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,020
They used a ship to help him

370
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,300
transport stolen goods overseas.

371
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,580
That's why I arrested her

372
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,620
in secret.

373
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,140
I want to use her

374
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,980
to find Pei Dafu's adopted son,

375
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,060
the stolen goods, and the money.

376
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,220
What nonsense are you saying?

377
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,780
If the Danzhou murder case

378
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,700
were not linked to Pei Dafu's case,

379
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,380
how could Mr. Yan believe
my side of the story?

380
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,700
But because of this,

381
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,540
it is even harder for Chai Jing

382
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,660
to survive in prison.

383
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,300
Mr. Yan is here.

384
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,260
Miss Hanyan, please return.

385
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,940
You've been an official
in the Capital for years.

386
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,220
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)
As the Vice Minister,

387
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,380
tell me one thing honestly.

388
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,140
Do you truly have no way or opportunity

389
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,340
to save Chai Jing?

390
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,500
I have laid bare all my past to you,

391
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,300
but you

392
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,780
still hide many secrets.

393
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,740
When we first met,

394
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,220
you had seen through

395
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,740
all my lies and tricks.

396
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,180
You even went to Danzhou
and retrieved that hairpin.

397
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,980
But you didn't arrest me.

398
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,280
Instead, you always helped me.

399
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,940
When I was framed by Zhuang Yushan,

400
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,900
you guided me on how to respond.

401
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,380
When I was trapped in Jianjia Chamber

402
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,540
and nearly forced to marry,

403
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,180
you brought me to the Judicial Review
just in time.

404
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,740
When I angered Zhou Ruyin,

405
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,660
you planned ahead for me

406
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,020
and secretly monitored
Yang Ping's every move.

407
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,420
On the night
before Taoist Duan's incident,

408
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,060
I found a note in the candle.

409
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,980
It was you, wasn't it?

410
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,060
Yes.

411
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,420
There must be a reason

412
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,880
behind everything you've done for me.

413
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,260
What do you think

414
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,620

Leave me.

She's dead.

480
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,220
Go report it.

00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,500
Alright, let's go.

482

is New Year's Eve.

It's time for a family reunion.

485
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,220
We shouldn't let the house

486
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,100
be cold and quiet, right?

487
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,740
Thanks to our ancestors,

488
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,260

Thank you, Master.

491
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,220

Master. Ms. Zhou.

495
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,020
I heard a rumor outside just now

496
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,940
that the bandit died last night

497
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,020
in the Judicial Review.

498
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,750
- Dead?
- Dead?

499
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,860
Has she confessed everything?

500
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,260
Is the case closed now?

501
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,740
Don't drag Hanyan into this again.

502
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,620
I'm not sure about that.

503
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,340
I'll go find out.

504
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,500
Congratulations, Miss Hanyan.

505
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,020
The Danzhou murder case is closed.

506
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,340
You're cleared now.

507
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,300
Closed?

508
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,940
You don't know?

509
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,700
That female bandit confessed everything

510
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:28,180
and died last night
in the Judicial Review.

511
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,180
Where did you hear this nonsense?

512
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,340
It's spreading everywhere outside.

513
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,660
How can it be nonsense?

514
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,620
As expected,
the bandit is your accomplice.

515
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,860
You two killed
Zhang Youchang and his wife, right?

516
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,620
Are you tricking me?

517
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,100
No.

518
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,620
The woman is indeed dead.

519
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,420
I heard she was tortured

520
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,100
all night in the prison

521
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,100
at the Judicial Review.

522
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,900
Her hands and feet were broken,

523
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,180
her scalp was peeled off,

524
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,660
and she was no longer human.

525
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,980
Miss Hanyan,

526
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,540
how did you know that bandit?

527
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,100
She was willing to die for you.

528
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,500
Zhuang Hanyan, how dare you harm me?

529
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,420
You know what you've done.

530
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,180
Why should I be afraid?

531
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,700
Ms. Zhou, are you okay?

532
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,900
Where is Chai Jing?

533
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,540
I've secretly sent her
out of the Capital.

534
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,460
Is she still alive?

535
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,300
Yes.

536
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,500
I want to see her.

537
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,180
Stay calm.

538
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,660
Don't lose your composure.

539
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,380
When the others are not around,

540
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,100
I'll come and get you.

541
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,500
Chai Jing!

542
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,860
Why is she so seriously injured?

543
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,340
What did you do to her?

544
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,060
If she wasn't gravely injured,

545
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,820
how could she have fooled everyone

546
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,600
and allowed us to save her?

547
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,940
Hanyan.

548
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,740
Don't move.

549
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,860
Lie here properly.

550
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,100
My hands

551
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,220
were crippled.

552
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,580
I can no longer hold a saber

553
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,540
to protect you anymore.

554
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,620
I'm sorry.

555
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,980
What nonsense are you saying?

556
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:02,140
It's I who should apologize.

557
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,700
I shouldn't have let you come
to the Capital with me.

558
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,900
It's my fault.

559
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,540
From now on,

560
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,420
you must take up the saber

561
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,420
to protect yourself.

562
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,220
Recover here.

563
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,180
From now on,

564
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,020
I'll protect you.

565
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,460
Is that okay?

566
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,940
The day we first met,

567
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,340
I asked you your name,

568
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,260
and you said

569
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,540
you were called the barefoot ghost.

570
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:18,260
You almost stole my shoes.

571
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:24,340
We walked barefoot together on the beach

572
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,060
for a long time.

573
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,180
Do you remember?

574
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,340
Of course, I do.

575
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:35,420
Now, you have a family.

576
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,940
You no longer need to walk barefoot.

577
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,140
That's enough.

578
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,660
Chai Jing,

579
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,500
I've long

580
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,980
considered you my family.

581
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,220
In my 20 years of life,

582
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,500
I never knew

583
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,340
what family was

584
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,860
and what love was.

585
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,220
I only knew my master

586
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,140
and orders.

587
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,900
Meeting you

588
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,020
was the greatest fortune

589
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,860
of my life.

590
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,420
I have no regrets.

591
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,820
Don't cry.

592
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:48,070
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

593
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,090
A little higher.

594
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:49,950
Alright.

595
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,740
Go to the inner yard.

596
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,060
Go a little higher.

597
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,380
- A bit more to the right?
- Yes.

598
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:55,900
Done.

599
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,380
Zhuang Hanyan.

600
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,420
Her injuries need more time to heal.

601
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,100
I'll send someone to look after her.

602
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,740
But from now on,

603
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,460
she cannot appear in the Capital.

604
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,420
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

605
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:13,060
I will always

606
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,820
remember this favor.

607
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,740
Now, can you believe

608
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,900
that I don't want to hurt you?

609
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:22,100
You know all my secrets now,

610
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,340
yet you haven't confided in me.

611
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,740
I still can't agree to help you

612
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,880
with eavesdropping on Mother.

613
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,580
That's my bottom line.

614
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,540
What if I had asked you to do this

615
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,480
when you asked me to save Chai Jing?

616
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,180
I'd pretend to agree,

617
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,500
but I'd go back on my word.

618
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,380
How honest of you.

619
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:44,860
- Go back.
- Wait.

620
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:46,980
What's wrong?

621
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,420
Fu Yunxi,

622
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,460
can I truly

623
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,780
trust you?

624
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:16,180
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

625
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:32,580
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

626
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,700
It's almost the Spring Festival.

627
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,980
I've heard about all the trouble

628
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,420
you've caused recently.

629
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,540
I haven't intervened to help you.

630
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:24,820
Do you resent me?

631
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,180
If you can protect yourself,

632
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:28,700
that's helpful enough.

633
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,980
After this disaster,

634
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,100
do you still refuse
to leave the Capital?

635
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,900
Since the day I returned home,

636
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:41,860
you've always wanted to drive me out.

637
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,220
Even when selecting my husband,

638
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,260
you'd choose those living afar.

639
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,740
Now,

640
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,420
I know the reason.

641
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:53,580
What have you known?

642
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,860
The Capital is full
of the rich and noble.

643
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,220
Some struggle to survive,

644
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,980
and some die unwillingly.

645
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:03,410
Once caught up in these disputes,

646
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:06,340
there are no winners.

647
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,180
Things have come to this,

648
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,500
yet you still won't leave?

649
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,660
That's the terrifying part.

650
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:19,780
It's like gambling.

651
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,940
When you win, you'll want more;

652
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,620
when you lose,
you'll try to overturn it.

653
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:29,540
Once you've tasted it,
you'll fall deeper.

654
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,660
That's human nature.

655
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,780
Even I am not exempt.

656
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,420
You didn't have to suffer this cycle.

657
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:41,100
As a woman,

658
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,100
this is my fate.

659
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,300
You think you've been enlightened,

660
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:50,060
but in reality, you've only seen
the shallowest part.

661
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,620
Please, Mother, enlighten me.

662
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:58,060
Do you think there's fairness
in this world?

663
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,500
I don't know how to answer that.

664
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:06,340
Mother, what do you want to say?

665
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,900
You sacrificed a friend this time.

666
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,660
What will you sacrifice next?

667
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,220
What else can you sacrifice?

668
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:16,260
Even if you eventually win,

669
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:18,620
you'll be left with wounds

670
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,460
and loneliness.

671
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,300
What's the meaning of that?

672
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:25,220
When injustice falls upon you,

673
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:27,140
endurance is painful,

674
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,540
but so is resistance.

675
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,660
That's the essence of injustice.

676
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:35,020
It won't be long.

677
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,700
Let's celebrate the festival for now.

678
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,460
Soon, you'll understand.

679
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:44,860
Go back now.

680
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,180
(Flying Swan on Snow)

681
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,940
(As the rising sun shines
upon thousands of households,)

682
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,720
(the old peach wood charms are replaced
with new ones.)

683
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,940
(A new year is coming.)

684
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,220
(Everything has a new life.)

685

(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

686
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,380
(I now understand)

687
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,000
(Mother's words for the first time.)

688
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,220
(Was everything I've done)

689
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:25,500
(Flying Swan on Snow)

690
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:26,860
(really wrong?)

691
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,100
(Maybe from today onwards,)

692
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,500
(I can truly let go of the past hatred,)

693
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,220
(but in my heart,)

694
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,340
(I still feel uneasy.)

695
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,260
(I seem to sense)

696
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,180
(that this joy and happiness)

697
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,300
(are not as peaceful as it seems.)

698
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:22,060
