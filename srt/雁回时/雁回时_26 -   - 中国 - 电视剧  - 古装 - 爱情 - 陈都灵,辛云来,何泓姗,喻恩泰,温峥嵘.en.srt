00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,500
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

4
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,260
(Concubine Indenture)

5
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,360
I'll leave this matter to you.

6
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,560
Rest assured, Master Zhuang.

7
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,590
I'll find a suitable end for this vile woman.

8
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,880
Zhuang Shiyang,

9
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,390
what do you want to do?

10
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Ruyin,

11
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,270
you confessed in court.

12
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,440
We can no longer keep you.

13
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,760
Zhuang Shiyang,

14
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,080
stop pretending.

15
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,590
We both know

16
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,270
who poisoned Father.

17
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,400
What a treacherous man.

18
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,110
Karma will get you!

19
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,670
You wretch.

20
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,160
How dare you act so brazenly?

21
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,640
A lowly concubine with such a wicked heart.

22
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,830
If not for your looks,

23
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,600
no one would even want you.

24
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,080
I will find you a decent family

25
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,550
to teach you proper manners.

26
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,080
Zhuang Shiyang.

27
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,600
Look.

28
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,320
Now I'm disfigured.

29
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,880
Could you still sell me now?

30
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,670
I know your cunning plans.

31
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,670
I also know

32
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,950
once I step out today,

33
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,270
it would be the end for me.

34
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,270
But let me tell you.

35
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,830
Alive, I'm a Zhuang; dead, a Zhuang spirit.

36
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,160
I will never let you off.

37
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,200
I'll haunt you forever!

38
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,990
Master Zhuang…

39
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,390
Take her away.

40
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,510
I will never let you off.

41
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,390
I will never let you off!

42
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,080
Zhuang Shiyang!

43
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,200
Find her a good family.

44
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,670
A gift for you.

45
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,480
Pawn it.

46
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,680
Thank you, Master Zhuang.

47
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,390
Why isn't Wang here yet?

48
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,160
There she is.

49
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,560
Gentlemen,

50
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,950
do you really want to buy her?

51
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,880
No questions. Take the money and leave.

52
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,390
How could…

53
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,910
How could it be you?

54
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,950
I knew he wouldn't spare you,

55
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,950
so I followed all along.

56
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,120
I calculated everything,

57
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,320
yet I never expected the one who'd save me

58
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,640
to be you.

59
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,000
This place isn't safe.

60
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,920
Let's go now.

61
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,830
Where can I go?

62
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,030
Where?

63
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,080
I'll take you to see my mother.

64
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,550
This is...

65
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,680
This place

66
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,470
is my mother's resting place.

67
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,270
Your mother…

68
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,680
When did she pass away?

69
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,640
The night she left the Zhuang's,

70
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,590
she was poisoned at a stop
outside the Capital.

71
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:08,200
And also Mr. Yuwen,
Nanny Chen, and Jilan.

72
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,520
I...

73
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,200
I thought...

74
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,080
If not for my mother's murder,

75
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,830
do you think

76
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,560
I would've ever returned?

77
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,350
Was it Zhuang Shiyang?

78
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,720
It was him.

79
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,710
Though I knew him cruel,

80
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,710
I never imagined

81
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,800
he's truly gone mad.

82
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,830
Do you know

83
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,710
how your eldest daughter

84
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,880
Zhuang Yuqin died back then?

85
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,280
Yuqin?

86
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,800
You mean my Yuqin?

87
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,390
When Fu Yunxi investigated
Pei's adopted son,

88
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,150
he nearly uncovered the truth.

89
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,320
To eliminate Fu Yunxi,

90
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,080
Zhuang poisoned him.

91
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,030
Unexpectedly, Zhuang Yuqin was poisoned.

92
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,120
It was truly an accident,

93
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,030
but Zhuang Shiyang can't escape blame.

94
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,510
What do you think?

95
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,320
My child.

96
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,390
Oh, my child!

97
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,590
Zhuang Shiyang!

98
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,150
Zhuang Shiyang!

99
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,120
As for Yuchi's death,

100
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,640
he forced me out of the residence,

101
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,150
but he tripped

102
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,320
and struck the candle needle.

103
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,870
Believe it or not,

104
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,400
I do

105
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,230
carry some guilt over it.

106
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
Therefore,

107
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,350
you orchestrated

108
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,280
today's cowbane case.

109
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,470
Yes.

110
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,870
What are your intentions?

111
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,160
He's very cunning.

112
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,800
Before any wrongdoing,

113
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,630
he plans his escape.

114
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,950
If the truth ever comes to light,

115
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,950
he has long since

116
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,590
prepared a scapegoat.

117
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,400
Right.

118
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,680
In the cowbane case,

119
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,590
I'm that scapegoat.

120
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,310
Yes.

121
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,590
When I got the cowbane,

122
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,800
I already guessed this outcome.

123
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,110
Though Mother and Mr. Yuwen

124
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,080
had some evidence,

125
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,320
they didn't delve deeper.

126
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,680
They likely foresaw this too.

127
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,830
They knew about it?

128
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,280
Not just them.

129
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,280
Grandmother knew everything.

130
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,870
Why call it Zhuang Residence?

131
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,670
It's nothing more than a troupe of actors.

132
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,750
Everyone acts perfectly.

133
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,240
That man

134
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,680
thought his deeds were flawless,

135
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,150
but the women at home

136
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,950
knew it all clearly.

137
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,440
How ludicrous.

138
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,870
What else do you know?

139
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,080
Since you guessed the case's outcome,

140
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,320
yet still took it to court to set me up.

141
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,830
Now,

142
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,680
you still want me under your control?

143
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,800
I was not setting you up,

144
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,630
but saving you.

145
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,590
Of course, I have my own motives.

146
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,360
All these years,

147
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,680
even Grandmother noticed the clues.

148
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,270
You've been by his side day and night,

149
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,590
and you're clever,

150
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,470
so it's impossible you know nothing.

151
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,830
Even about the adopted son,

152
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,520
you may even

153
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,800
know something.

154
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,230
You want to use me

155
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,830
to bring him down?

156
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,230
Now even Grandmother is on my side,

157
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,200
yet you still refuse to wake up.

158
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,750
By now, you should

159
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,230
see him

160
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,830
for what he truly is.

161
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,680
Over the years,

162
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,830
his mind has twisted.

163
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,230
He seems devoted to you.

164
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,990
But think about it.

165
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,840
Every misdeed you've done,

166
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,800
was he involved,

167
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,350
manipulating and guiding you?

168
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,590
When I married him,

169
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,470
Zhuang Hanliang despised my merchant roots.

170
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,470
He only allowed me as a concubine.

171
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,800
Yet I hoped

172
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,360
that by serving him well,

173
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,110
he would care for me,

174
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,470
and life wouldn't be harsh.

175
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,470
I tried

176
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,630
to be a virtuous wife and mother.

177
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,160
But he

178
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,870
saw me as a mere pawn.

179
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,590
I spent half my life plotting,

180
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,320
hoping to be like your mother,

181
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:26,200
my daughters and I could be noble ladies.

182
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,040
But now,

183
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:35,320
my husband, my son,
my daughters, my beauty…

184
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,040
all lost.

185
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,590
I have nothing left.

186
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,910
Just like the box

187
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,800
your mother gave me on New Year's Eve.

188
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,160
Empty.

189
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,950
You saw with your own eyes

190
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,870
what end the two beauties

191
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,750
have both come to now.

192
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,750
You spent your whole life

193
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,160
chasing the title of a noble lady.

194
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,080
But do you know

195
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,680
what a noble lady truly means?

196
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,750
Blind obedience,

197
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,560
enduring hardships,

198
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,920
and living humbly to appease a husband?

199
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,680
Is that being a noble lady?

200
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,520
It never was.

201
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,350
A true noble lady

202
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,520
doesn't rely on wealth,

203
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,040
nor on status.

204
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,590
Any woman

205
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,470
who lives with dignity

206
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,950
is a noble lady.

207
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,870
You used

208
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,950
to rely on your son or husband.

209
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,080
But have you ever considered

210
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,990
living by relying on yourself?

211
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,400
When your mother left,

212
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,280
she told me the same thing.

213
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,400
Though we've not known each other long,

214
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,560
as your former rival,

215
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,830
I understand you well.

216
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,200
I know your desires, ambitions, and wisdom.

217
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,640
I know

218
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,920
you are truly capable of great things.

219
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,200
You were simply blinded

220
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,000
by the real villain

221
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,440
and took the wrong path.

222
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,950
I used to resent you.

223
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,670
But now,

224
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,110
I've chosen to understand you,

225
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,990
to let go of hatred.

226
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,800
I hope

227
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,990
we can stand together

228
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,560
and face our true enemy as one.

229
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,760
Zhou Ruyin,

230
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,560
will you?

231
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,080
To protect herself,

232
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,230
Grandmother showed me the right way.

233
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,590
She said the real evidence against Father

234
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,630
has always been in your hands.

235
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,680
Ms. Wei figured it out too.

236
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,750
I've laid everything bare.

237
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:40,830
What is the evidence you hold?

238
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,280
An IOU.

239
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,720
Mother,

240
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,200
it's Huiqiong Powder prescribed
by a fine physician.

241
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,480
It helps regulate your body.

242
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,230
Perfect for the summer.

243
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,520
Good.

244
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,670
Ma'am,

245
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,440
while washing the Master's clothes,

246
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,350
I found this IOU tucked inside.

247
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,440
Perhaps the servants

248
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,470
forgot to check the pockets.

249
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,750
I can't read.

250
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,440
Could you see what it is?

251
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,540
(Creditor, Borrower, Guarantor)

252
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,560
It seems

253
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,960
in Shiyang Village, Baicheng,

254
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,830
a farmer named Li San

255
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,590
owes us 200 taels of silver.

256
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,590
That's ten years of a farmer's harvest.

257
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,560
Baicheng is remote.

258
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,280
How could a farmer owe us money?

259
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,670
Under the creditor column,

260
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,750
you can still see the charterer "Zhuang."

261
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,200
I don't know much

262
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,470
about Master's business outside.

263
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,870
When Master returns later,

264
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,440
I'll give it to him

265
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,990
in case it's important.

266
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,320
Baicheng?

267
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,920
Shiyang Village?

268
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,200
I didn't manage the household before,

269
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,950
I was familiar with its finances.

270
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,560
Two hundred taels aren't a small sum.

271
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,080
If he hadn't saved it secretly,

272
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,800
perhaps there's a mistress involved.

273
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,430
You didn't give it to him?

274
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,030
I've been suspicious of this matter

275
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,320
and wanted to keep some money for myself.

276
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,070
So, I forged a fake copy

277
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,240
and soaked it in water.

278
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,030
When I gave it to Zhuang Shiyang,

279
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,880
he saw it was destroyed

280
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,240
and didn't ask further.

281
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,910
So,

282
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,760
the real thing is still with me.

283
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,000
You think Pei Dafu is behind this money?

284
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,270
It's said Pei Dafu's vast fortune

285
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,800
is held by his adopted son.

286
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,400
But every incident

287
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,760
seems tied to Zhuang Shiyang.

288
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,400
That's why I began to doubt

289
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,080
the source of the borrowed money.

290
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,960
Where is that IOU now?

291
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,760
It's still in Gongtong Chamber.

292
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,240
I can't go back.

293
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,110
But I can ask Nanny Tao to get it.

294
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,350
Can we trust her?

295
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,350
I just told her

296
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,240
to fetch some silver notes
and deeds from my room.

297
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,480
Get it along the way.

298
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,390
It shouldn't raise suspicion.

299
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,310
Madam.

300
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,750
- Nanny Tao.
- Madam.

301
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,430
I've brought all your valuables

302
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,350
from your room.

303
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,800
You must leave now.

304
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,080
Never return to the Capital.

305
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,960
Nanny Tao,

306
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,000
I haven't treated you well before.

307
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,350
Yet now,

308
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,590
you still call me Madam.

309
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,110
Once a servant,

310
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,350
you'll always be my master.

311
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,280
Here. Take this.

312
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,840
- This...
- Take it.

313
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,590
My valuables have disappeared.

314
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,190
Master will surely investigate.

315
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,750
Take these silver notes

316
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,310
and leave the Zhuang's quickly.

317
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,430
Go home and live in peace.

318
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,520
I'll take it then.

319
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,310
I'm leaving tonight.

320
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,590
Sooner the better.

321
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,920
Be careful on the road.

322
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,080
Hurry up and go.

323
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,280
Quickly, go now.

324
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,190
Got it.

325
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,240
Found it.

326
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,980
(Creditor Zhuang)

327
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,400
In court, why didn't you reveal this

328
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,960
to clear your name?

329
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,440
It's just an IOU.

330
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
The truth is unclear.

331
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,350
No way the Judicial Review
would convict him based on it.

332
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,080
Moreover,

333
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,400
if the adopted son matter is exposed,

334
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,310
won't I be doomed with him?

335
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,240
That'd be a dead end.

336
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,680
It's good you didn't.

337
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,000
We didn't alert him.

338
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,520
Let's investigate first.

339
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,680
You can't return to Zhuang's now.

340
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,870
Do you have other plans?

341
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,790
With this money,

342
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:22,240
I can survive for years at least.

343
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,840
However,

344
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,320
I can't leave now.

345
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,800
Yushan is still unaware.

346
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,520
I can't abandon her.

347
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,910
Besides,

348
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,630
I want to see Zhuang Shiyang's downfall.

349
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,440
Chaling Tavern's owner is an acquaintance.

350
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,630
I'll arrange for your stay.

351
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,240
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

352
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,160
Get in the carriage.

353
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,820
(Light, Fu Residence)

354
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,480
Since we have a clue,

355
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,350
let's go to Baicheng tomorrow

356
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,110
and investigate the IOU.

357
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,440
(Light, Fu Residence)
Madam, Sir,

358
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,590
you've finally returned.

359
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,800
There's trouble at home.

360
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,720
What happened?

361
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,560
Aunt Kou cleaned the study room

362
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,070
and found a divorce letter.

363
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,350
Lady Qiu found out.

364
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,080
Miss Lingzhi saw it, too.

365
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,520
What divorce letter?

366
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,760
You go find Lingzhi. I'll speak with Mother.

367
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,860
(Sincerity and Noble)
Mother, Aunt Kou.

368
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,390
Yunxi, you're finally back.

369
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,590
Don't worry, Mother. Where's the letter?

370
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,590
Yunxi,

371
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,760
tell us.

372
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,480
What's going on here?

373
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,000
We never saw you two argue.

374
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,680
How did it come to divorce?

375
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,830
Everything seemed fine.

376
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,400
- How could it…
- Mother, don't worry.

377
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,560
It's just a joke.

378
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,760
Hanyan and I won't divorce.

379
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,150
A joke?

380
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,960
You…

381
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,280
How could you joke about this?

382
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,550
If word gets out,

383
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,590
it won't affect you.

384
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,280
But Hanyan is a woman.

385
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,630
She'll face gossip.

386
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,200
Mother, you're right.

387
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,430
I was thoughtless.

388
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,350
Where is the letter?

389
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,390
Yunxi,

390
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,240
if you want a divorce,

391
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,480
you should discuss it with your mother.

392
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,390
Go check on Lingzhi.

393
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,280
We were just discussing it,

394
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,670
and she heard everything.

395
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,840
Yes.

396
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,870
Mother.

397
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,590
Lingzhi, sleep now.

398
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,560
Your father and I are home.

399
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,960
Did I misbehave?

400
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,080
Is that why you want a divorce?

401
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,760
Of course not.

402
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:49,430
Lingzhi, you're kind and smart.

403
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,110
Even if I could leave your father,

404
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,760
I could never leave you.

405
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,320
Do you not like Father?

406
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,670
Throughout this journey,

407
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,320
there were tears and laughter.

408
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,390
I took wrong paths, too.

409
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,830
But he was always by my side.

410
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,670
I have

411
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,350
been angry at him.

412
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,830
I've doubted him.

413
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,960
But now,

414
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,630
I choose to trust him.

415
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,240
What is trust?

416
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,560
Is it like affection?

417
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,830
You're too young to understand it.

418
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:42,680
Trust is more precious than affection.

419
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,670
So, you really, really like Father?

420
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,510
Say it, Mother.

421
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,960
Do you really, really

422
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,350
like Father a lot?

423
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,760
Say it, Mother.

424
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,150
Mother, please don't tickle.

425
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,800
I won't ask anymore.

426
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,240
I'm sorry.

427
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:10,950
Lingzhi.

428
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,350
I promise you.

429
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,520
If we finish what we need to do,

430
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,280
after that,

431
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,760
in the long days ahead

432
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,190
your Father and I

433
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,760
will be with you as you grow up.

434
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,390
Let's make a pinky promise.

435
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:48,420
(Lunar Radiance)

436
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,240
What is this?

437
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,960
On the wedding night,

438
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,760
you wrote a writ of divorce.

439
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,480
(Divorce Letter)
I wrote one, too.

440
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,360
Why?

441
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,150
You and I were just a deal.

442
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,430
With this divorce letter,

443
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,830
you can leave anytime you want.

444
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,480
Keep it safe. Don't lose it.

445
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,870
Fu Yunxi, wait.

446
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,280
What if I say

447
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,590
I don't need this divorce letter?

448
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,590
What do you mean by this?

449
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,190
Even now,

450
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,080
you think our marriage is just a deal?

451
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,190
After all we've been through,

452
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,350
I don't believe your heart is untouched.

453
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,320
Maybe

454
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,800
I went too far

455
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,000
and made you misunderstand.

456
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,670
I'm sorry.

457
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,800
Are you hiding something from me?

458
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,480
You should get some rest.

459
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:53,760
We'll leave for Baicheng at dawn.

It's a long journey.

470
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,480
You haven't eaten yet.

471
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,760
Have some pastries.

472
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,080
Fu Yunxi,

473
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:42,040
since our marriage is a deal,

474
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,800
from now on,

475
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,350
let's only focus on our duties.

476
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,620
(Shiyang Village)

477
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,240
This village is in the Central Plains.

478
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,680
It should have fertile land.

479
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,280
Why is it so poor and rundown?

480
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,230
It seems

481
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,590
no one has enough to eat.

482
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,000
Spare some change, sir?

483
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,390
Thank you, sir.

484
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,390
Do you know where Li San lives?

485
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,350
The crippled Li San?

486
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,320
He just went to the fields.

487
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,760
Where are his fields?

488
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,560
Such fertile land.

489
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,520
It shows last year's harvest was good.

490
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,390
Yet not a single plow ox in sight.

491
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,670
Only farmers laboring hard.

492
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,150
Poor farming on fertile land.

493
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,630
Something isn't right.

494
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,760
Father, I brought you lunch.

495
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,030
Li San,

496
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,760
your daughter brought your meal.

497
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,640
Alright.

498
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,670
Zhao, give me a hand.

499
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,080
Come on.

500
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,400
Alright.

501
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,470
I'll take a bite.

502
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,790
Here.

503
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,750
Come here.

504
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,110
Let's sit in the shade.

505
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,110
Let's see what we have.

506
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,760
We'll share this.

507
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,510
Here.

508
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,710
Excuse me.

509
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,870
Are you Li San?

510
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,110
And you are…

511
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,910
My name is Zhuang Hanyan.

512
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,590
Are you

513
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,660
the Li San on this IOU?

514
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,700
(Borrower Li San)

515
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,110
Let's go.

516
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,390
What's going on?

517
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,040
Let's go check it out.

518
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,080
Lady Creditor, please.

519
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,150
Please show mercy

520
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,520
and give me a few more months.

521
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,880
I only have one daughter left.

522
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,400
I can't sell her too.

523
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,480
Please have mercy.

524
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,670
We'll pay the interest this year.

525
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,190
Please, kind lady.

526
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,400
This year,

527
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,550
we haven't had any flour.

528
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,670
Yes.

529
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,270
Please take pity on us.

530
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,840
Madam, have mercy on us.

531
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,110
Give us more time, please.

532
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,590
Please rise. We aren't your creditors.

533
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:30,910
But my loan note is with you!

534
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,510
Mr. Li, it's a long story.

535
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,830
Could we speak in private?

536
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,320
It was five years ago.

537
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,520
I fled here with my family,

538
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,350
along with many refugees.

539
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,240
A woman

540
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,430
lent us some silver

541
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:52,160
to buy land and settle down.

542
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:54,630
We thought
we had met a kind benefactor.

543
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,240
Who would've known

544
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,160
she was an usurer?

545
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,000
Starts at five percent interest,

546
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,760
doubling each year.

547
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,760
Fair rates shouldn't exceed three.

548
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,590
We had no choice.

549
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:11,190
Our interest has exceeded the original loan.

550
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,080
She forced us to mortgage the land

551
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,520
and be guarantors for one another.

552
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,400
Though with the fertile land,

553
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,430
no farmer's wealthy.

554
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,080
We pay imperial taxes

555
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,960
while feeding greedy merchants.

556
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,350
Life has

557
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,910
become unbearable.

558
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,430
Who is the usurer?

559
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,350
What does she look like?

560
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,390
We don't know her name.

561
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,480
It's an elderly lady.

562
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,590
Judging by her attire,

563
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,630
she seems from a wealthy family.

564
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,060
(IOU)

565
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,110
On this note,

566
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,960
is the creditor Zhuang Shiyang?

567
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,100
(Creditor Zhuang)

568
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,270
Well,

569
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,110
I really don't know.

570
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,720
When the lady

571
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,830
made us sign,

572
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,390
the creditor's name wasn't on it.

573
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,560
But she did mention

574
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,960
our creditor seemed to be

575
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,870
a lady with the surname Zhuang.

576
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,150
Later, I caught a glimpse.

577
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,670
It was Zhuang something Yan.

578
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,540
(Creditor Zhuang)

579
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:33,780
(Creditor Zhuang Hanyan)

580
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,350
So,

581
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,760
from the beginning,

582
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,240
Pei Dafu's vast fortune

583
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,040
was all under my name.

584
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,800
May we have some privacy, please?

585
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,920
Sure.

586
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,430
I'll leave you be.

587
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,040
Excuse us.

588
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,320
The stolen treasures of Pei Dafu

589
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,350
were handed to Zhuang Shiyang.

590
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,590
He laundered them through
Danzhou Chamber of Commerce,

591
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,940
converting them into silver notes.

592
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,840
Then, issued loan in your name

593
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,960
so poor farmers could buy farmland,

594
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,830
forcing them to pay interest yearly.

595
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,920
This way,

596
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,590
Zhuang Shiyang stayed uninvolved,

597
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,960
keeping his assets spotless.

598
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,190
I searched for years in Danzhou,

599
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,670
but only found clues at the chamber.

600
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:58,350
Turns out, Danzhou was just a drop point.

601
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,800
There are likely

602
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,800
dozens more villages like this one.

603
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,240
Who would have thought

604
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,520
the rumored hidden fortune

605
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,630
was from these impoverished people?

606
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:17,360
It's probably not just these villages.

607
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,840
What else could there be?

608
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,440
Pei Dafu's wealth wasn't just this.

609
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,000
Perhaps over decades,

610
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,510
besides these tenant farmers,

611
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,590
businesses across the nation

612
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,740
may have borrowed money
from Zhuang Hanyan.

613
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,580
(Borrower Li San)

614
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,660
(Borrower Miao Zhuang)

615
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,420
(Borrower Wang Wu)

616
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,820
(Blacksmith)

617
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,500
(Creditor Zhuang Hanyan)

618
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,760
Now,

619
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,310
it all makes sense.

620
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,310
I should've realized earlier.

621
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,270
Wu Youzhi.

622
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,440
Zhou Ruyin.

623
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,590
He always finds scapegoats.

624
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,750
He wants to hide the money,

625
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,440
yet keep it under his control.

626
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,960
Besides me, Zhuang's lineal daughter

627
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:25,000
who's been adrift since childhood
and is defamed,

628
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,270
who could

629
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,510
be less suspicious?

630
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:32,110
From the very beginning,

631
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,840
I was also his scapegoat.

632
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,960
Don't panic.

633
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,790
There are still flaws in this.

634
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,440
Even if his crimes are exposed,

635
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,440
Zhuang Shiyang faced suspicions before.

636
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,670
You're the his lineal daughter.

637
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,150
He can't escape

638
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,440
and pin everything on you so easily.

639
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:54,440
What if I'm not his only target?

640
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,670
What do you mean?

641
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,040
Don't forget,

642
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,670
I'm the Zhuang's daughter and your wife.

643
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,670
If you're Pei's adopted son,

644
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,190
and I manage the stolen wealth for you.

645
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,880
Wouldn't that make us
a treacherous couple?

646
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,310
If he truly plans like this,

647
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,680
maybe

648
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,920
we've already fallen into his trap.

649
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,270
And that usurer lady

650
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,270
could be

651
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,270
Nanny Tao.

652
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,080
Nanny Tao.

653
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,310
Try this.

654
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,720
Master.

655
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:40,710
Master,

656
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,520
this dish, Tong'an braised pork.

657
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,510
I've eaten it for over a decade.

658
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,760
The flavor's gotten better with time.

659
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,840
Good.

660
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,670
I trust your palate.

661
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,750
Needs a bit more Sichuan pepper.

662
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,760
Now that Zhou Ruyin has left,

663
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,510
I can serve you

664
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,510
in the kitchen again.

665
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:59,880
It must be my blessing.

666
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,150
Did Ruyin suspect anything

667
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,880
when you deliver it?

668
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,750
Master, have I ever let you down?

669
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,590
Back then, Director Pei ordered

670
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,670
this fortune be kept far from the Capital,

671
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,670
yet still under his control.

672
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,000
That's why I used Hanyan's name.

673
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,040
What a shame.

674
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,480
I couldn't keep it in the end.

675
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,360
But with that money,

676
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:25,560
you could overthrow the couple entirely.

677
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,760
Master,

678
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,520
you'd have no more worries.

679
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,150
Indeed.

680
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:33,040
Consider it a trade-off for safety.

681
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,360
What isn't yours can't be kept.

682
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,590
Alright.

683
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,150
The net has already been cast.

684
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,320
Go, quickly.

685
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,000
- Don't look back. Hide
- What about you?

686
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,360
We can't both be caught.

687
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,280
Now go.

688
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:53,990
Hurry.

689
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,790
Who are you?

690
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,670
Mr. Yan.

691
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,840
Fu Yunxi.

692
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,190
Where is Zhuang Hanyan?

693
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,840
She returned to the Capital.

694
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,840
Mr. Yan, what's this for?

695
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,670
Considering our years as colleagues,

696
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,110
I won't make things difficult for you.

697
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,070
But,

698
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,790
don't resist any further.

699
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,400
Capture Fu Yunxi, the Pei remnant.

700
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,190
I'll return with you.
