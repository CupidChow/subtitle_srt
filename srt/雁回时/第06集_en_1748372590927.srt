00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,480
Hello.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,440
They're in the哪裡.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,760
That's why I asked.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,480
Hi,unal.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,460
It's nice...

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,980
JO.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,340
Aah!

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

12
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

13
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

15
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

16
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

18
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

19
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

20
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

21
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

22
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

24
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

25
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

26
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

27
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

28
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

29
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

30
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

31
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

32
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

33
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

34
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

35
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

36
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

37
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

38
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,340
I'm not sure if I can do it.

39
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,340
Episode 16

40
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,940
What do you want to do?

41
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,340
Answer my question.

42
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,140
Zhi.

43
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:01,940
Here.

44
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,740
This is the purple and white fruit.

45
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,940
And this.

46
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,340
Plum flower cake.

47
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,540
And.

48
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,140
Cucumber soup.

49
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,740
All in one try.

50
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,340
Let's see which flavor you like the most.

51
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,140
Thank you, Aunt Yishan.

52
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,340
I like them all.

53
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,540
Good girl.

54
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,540
If you like them,

55
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,940
I'll bring you some more next time, okay?

56
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,940
Okay.

57
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,940
Miss Ai, you're not here.

58
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,940
I think you're in a hurry.

59
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,140
Brother Yunxi is so petty.

60
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,340
How can you keep me in the temple?

61
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,940
I haven't seen you for a long time.

62
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,340
You're so shy.

63
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,340
I wonder if you're feeling well.

64
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,540
He's getting sick.

65
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,140
Plum flower cake.

66
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,740
Even if it's full of jade,

67
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,740
you should be full of it.

68
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,940
Don't come out again.

69
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,340
Don't scare me.

70
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,740
Daddy, is Aunt Han Yan sick?

71
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,740
Don't worry, Zhi.

72
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,740
Aunt Yushan is jealous of her beauty.

73
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,340
That's why she's so naughty.

74
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,140
I?

75
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,740
Brother Yunxi, I'm jealous of her.

76
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,740
Brother Yunxi.

77
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,740
Sir,

78
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,740
the man is here.

79
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,740
Who is it?

80
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,740
My lord.

81
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,940
How dare you leave the temple?

82
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,340
Hurry up.

83
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,140
Your mother and master haven't found out yet.

84
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,740
Go back with me.

85
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,740
Brother Yunxi,

86
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,740
did you bring this woman here?

87
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,340
Miss Ai is not a servant.

88
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,740
If she finds out,

89
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,340
she'll be punished.

90
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,540
I'm just kidding.

91
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,740
You...

92
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,340
You don't even believe me?

93
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,740
That's not my foot.

94
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,940
It's Zhuang Han Yan.

95
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,940
He's trying to scare me.

96
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,940
I was thinking of coming to the temple to see you.

97
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,940
I'm here to see Zhi.

98
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,540
I'll take care of Zhi with my mother these days.

99
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,340
Please don't bother me.

100
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,740
I'm not afraid of you, Yunxi.

101
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,540
Miss Ai,

102
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,740
stop talking.

103
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,340
Go.

104
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,140
Go.

105
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,540
Let go.

106
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,740
Who asked you to come?

107
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,540
You did?

108
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,140
Miss Ai, take care.

109
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,940
Aunt, take care.

110
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,740
Aunt, take care.

111
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,940
Sir.

112
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,740
It's normal to have a meal at this time.

113
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,940
Once you have a meal,

114
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,740
you'll have a good meal.

115
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,540
It's a good match for dried fish and seafood.

116
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,140
I like Master Yunxi the most.

117
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,340
He's going to have a big bowl of rice in the future.

118
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,340
But this year, I'm not sure.

119
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,540
Can Cui Yun find a way to get rid of that girl?

120
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,940
Yushan is a good person.

121
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,940
Cui Yun's daughter is so naughty.

122
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,540
She's done some silly things.

123
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,340
She's been thinking about her past.

124
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,940
She wouldn't say that to the criminal.

125
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,140
Wait a little longer.

126
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,340
When mother is gone,

127
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,340
let her get out of the temple.

128
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,340
I won't be able to make her feel guilty.

129
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,140
Master, Yushan is also going to have a bowl of water.

130
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,340
Miss Ai, she hasn't thought about her past for many days.

131
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,740
She's so cruel.

132
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,140
I wonder how she's feeling.

133
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,140
Don't worry.

134
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,140
She's looking for her mother.

135
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,140
I think it's time to get her.

136
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,940
You little girl.

137
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,340
I called you here personally.

138
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,540
You still don't know anything.

139
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,540
Please forgive me, madam.

140
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,740
If you want to know the situation of Miss Ai,

141
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,140
then please ask mother to come and ask.

142
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,540
We're servants. We should be able to do our part.

143
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,740
We shouldn't talk about it randomly.

144
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,140
You...

145
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,740
Forget it.

146
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,340
You can go back.

147
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,940
Yes.

148
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,740
This girl from the family of the family,

149
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,940
she has a lot of truth in her mouth.

150
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,940
Madam, she's in a serious condition.

151
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,340
Please don't worry about Yushan.

152
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,140
Our master and mother are not to blame.

153
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,940
Can you not let me worry?

154
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,740
No.

155
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:55,320
ok

156
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:00,300
STREAM

157
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,100
Ms. Sun, the feast today is here.

158
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,280
The two wolvesitos sipped yesterday.

159
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,280
Miss San is not a actor.

160
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,600
Today, I have chosen three of you as my husband.

161
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Please have a look.

162
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,280
This is Mr. Tao.

163
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,960
He is from Beijing.

164
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,960
He is a tea-maker.

165
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,520
His family is also a British.

166
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,520
This is Dao Bili from Asia.

167
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,920
He was seriously ill and had a fever.

168
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,680
He is very lucky.

169
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,680
Miss San is a good cook.

170
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
And this is Mr. Shen.

171
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,880
He is a good cook.

172
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,880
He is very gentle and warm-hearted.

173
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,320
After marriage,

174
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,320
he will be very comfortable.

175
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,840
What's wrong with him?

176
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,720
Miss San is very ill.

177
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,360
She is not a soul.

178
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,520
I wonder if these young men

179
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,520
will like Miss San.

180
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,120
It's so hard for me.

181
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,520
I have chosen so many people from afar.

182
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,040
I have wasted some of my life.

183
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,920
Is there anything else?

184
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,680
Other than these,

185
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,920
there is no place for me to live in the world.

186
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,240
These are all from the Qingzhen family.

187
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,960
They have been married for eight generations.

188
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,400
Miss San, please choose one.

189
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,920
Is there a choice?

190
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,360
The master said that

191
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,240
whoever Miss San chooses

192
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,760
will be more powerful than living in the capital.

193
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,840
I have been in the hospital for many years.

194
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,480
I have been in a relationship with my parents.

195
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,440
I have been in a relationship with my parents for many years.

196
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,680
I only want to see my parents

197
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,680
and not regret it.

198
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,080
It seems that

199
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,120
these young men

200
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,760
are still not satisfied with Miss San.

201
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,600
Let's go.

202
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,520
Miss San, I will take my leave.

203
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,200
Wait.

204
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,720
Have you changed your mind?

205
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,320
I have changed my rice soup.

206
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320
I want to eat something.

207
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
Wait.

208
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,120
I want you to stand up.

209
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,920
Auntie Cheng,

210
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,920
Xiao Chu has made some desserts.

211
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,440
I ordered some for Miss San.

212
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,520
Please open the door.

213
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,720
Auntie Cheng.

214
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,200
Auntie Cheng,

215
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,520
this is for Miss San.

216
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,000
Thank you for your concern.

217
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,520
Please go back.

218
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,240
Give it to me.

219
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,400
Give it to me.

220
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,120
It's better to give it to your mother first.

221
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,040
If Miss San has any problems,

222
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,200
I will be responsible for this crime.

223
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,920
Give it to me.

224
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,080
What are you looking for?

225
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,200
What?

226
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,360
You have been with servants for days.

227
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,120
I dare not.

228
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
I'm hungry.

229
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
I eat porridge every day.

230
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
Of course, I can't fill my stomach.

231
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,240
You have lost weight.

232
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Why don't you set a marriage

233
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,240
and marry a cold and hot husband?

234
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,240
Even if it's a simple meal,

235
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,240
it's better to stay with my mother.

236
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,240
I'm sorry.

237
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,240
I'm sorry.

238
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,240
I'm sorry.

239
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,240
I'm sorry.

240
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,240
I'm sorry.

241
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,240
I'm sorry.

242
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,240
I'm sorry.

243
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,240
I'm sorry.

244
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,240
I'm sorry.

245
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,240
I'm sorry.

246
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,240
I'm sorry.

247
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,240
I'm sorry.

248
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,240
I'm sorry.

249
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,240
I'm sorry.

250
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,240
Congratulations.

251
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,240
Zhou Ying ist going to the prompting door for me to settle mouths.

252
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,240
But he instigated my wrath by certainly sending me to the感覺 blossom.

253
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,240
I was so angry that I asked Yusui to fight for the man I had been looking for.

254
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
What did I do wrong?

255
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,240
I let my mother be so ashamed of me.

256
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,240
I was the one who made you suffer.

257
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,240
But if you were a man of your own,

258
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,240
no one would be able to help you

259
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,240
and save you.

260
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,240
You'd better take responsibility.

261
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,240
If I take responsibility,

262
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,240
I would have died in the Danzhou.

263
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,240
Why can't I blame you?

264
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,240
Even if you were born to me,

265
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,240
you'd only be able to hold your legs and be able to bear the pain.

266
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,240
You really thought I was willing to walk on this path?

267
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,240
You'd rather die than be able to take care of my own health?

268
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,240
These years, my father was also in the Danzhou,

269
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,240
and was sent to the high heaven.

270
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,240
Xie Jingfeng was so kind and kind.

271
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,240
What did you do for me?

272
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,240
I'm your good son, Zhuang's good daughter.

273
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,240
Fine. From now on,

274
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,240
we'll have no more than half of your mother's life.

275
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,240
Come! Lock her up in the room.

276
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
The door is locked.

277
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,240
Without my order, we can't go out for a half a step.

278
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,240
You've heard my heart.

279
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,240
You've ignored my eyes.

280
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:33,240
You're the most affectionate person in my life.

281
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,240
Blood is like a shadow.

282
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,240
Heart is the most miracle.

283
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,240
Why did you leave me?

284
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,240
Love is a hate.

285
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,240
Actually, you are my heart.

286
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,240
You are my body.

287
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,240
Don't blame me for being heartless.

288
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,240
Blood is like a shadow.

289
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,240
Heart is the most miracle.

290
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:16,240
Why did you leave me?

291
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,240
From now on,

292
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:28,240
we'll have no more than half of your mother's life.

293
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,240
I'm so sorry.

294
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,240
I can't protect you.

295
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
I'm sorry.

296
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,240
I'm sorry.

297
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,240
I'm sorry.

298
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,240
I'm sorry.

299
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,240
I'm sorry.

300
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,240
I'm sorry.

301
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,240
Heart is the most miracle.

302
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,240
Why did you leave me?

303
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,240
Why did you leave me?

304
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,240
Who are you talking about?

305
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,240
I'm talking to my mother.

306
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,240
I can better understand your father.

307
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,240
I want to tell there's an answer.

308
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,240
Sister-in-law Zhu Handong.

309
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,760
There must be something fishy.

310
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,920
By the way,

311
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,400
he has a few guests

312
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,480
who are not in a good mood today.

313
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,760
He has a meeting with the Chalin Hotel.

314
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,840
Inform Boss Jiang

315
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,960
to invite them to the Hongyun Pavilion in the second floor.

316
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,480
Yes.

317
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
My Lord,

318
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,920
we have been observing the world closely.

319
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,200
Please have a seat.

320
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,680
Okay.

321
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,280
Yuwen,

322
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,360
you always come here to have fun.

323
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,480
You are very welcome.

324
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,600
You are not just here to have tea, are you?

325
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,680
You two have something to know.

326
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,480
Your Majesty ordered me to make a pass on the law.

327
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,600
Although I pass the law,

328
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,880
I don't know the rules of the capital.

329
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,200
You are all men.

330
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,440
There are some business friends who are not in a good mood.

331
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,440
Can you please tell them?

332
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,400
If they can contact me,

333
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,360
it would be better

334
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,760
for them to meet with the Chalin Hotel.

335
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,880
Although I am a business man,

336
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,720
I am not afraid of being abandoned.

337
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,080
I am afraid that I will be helpless.

338
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,800
There is someone in the capital

339
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,000
who can be in the Chalin Hotel.

340
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,680
But the person is already...

341
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,080
Pei Dafu.

342
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,320
Yuwen,

343
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,160
you are so kind.

344
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,240
You can't name him.

345
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,480
Yes.

346
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,720
If we can tell the killer of the Chalin Hotel,

347
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,000
we will be in trouble.

348
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,240
My Lord.

349
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,320
Yuwen,

350
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,800
I have something to do.

351
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,280
I will leave now.

352
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,040
Yuwen,

353
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,200
I have to go now.

354
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:08,840
You two...

355
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,880
We just have to find out the truth.

356
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,400
We don't need to be so hard on the soldiers.

357
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,680
Goodbye.

358
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,240
My Lord.

359
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,080
From today on,

360
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,880
keep an eye on Yuwen Chang'an.

361
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:31,840
Yes.

362
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,880
She even attacks one of your friends.

363
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,120
She loves us by playing the role of Chu Poker Champ.

364
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:13,080
She didn't blame us for being in a

365
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,720
bad relationship withube deeply.

366
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,400
You Kansas,

367
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,920
I will kill you,

368
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,920
but I will make one day

369
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,440
due to this loss.

370
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,400
Aye, your marriage.

371
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,520
My God.

372
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,080
This must be your lesson.

373
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,540

376
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,100
five

377
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,260
five

378
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,000
Think it over.

379
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,420
Then there's nothing you can't argue with.

380
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:17,180
exhibition

381
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,460
Tan Xiao Bai is young

382
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,940
See your beauty

383
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,620
What a young young genius

384
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,700
Watch the rainbow

385
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,520
What a beautiful late night

386
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,580
When the wind arrives in the capital

387
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,640
Hanlin is a young talents

388
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:41,740
At least before he has the Hasberry

389
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,960
has the gray to Sap

390
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,640

Mi Wen

392
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,400
I think we as a whole would be a better spread

393
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,240
It's safer

394
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,700
let it be

395
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,700
I've just been

396
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,060
to Jin Diamond to pay for Direct On Guilt

397
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,980
If that's the case I gotta take it myself

398
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,100
I'm sorry.

399
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,420
Miss San, what are you doing?

400
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,180
You...

401
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:25,900
Stop!

402
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,580
What are you doing?

403
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,540
Where's Miss Lin?

404
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,220
Let go of me.

405
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:29,900
Let go of me.

406
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,020
Let go of me.

407
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,180
You are...

408
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,660
Mr. Yuwen,

409
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,060
go back first.

410
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:47,860
Let me out.

411
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,920
Let me out.

412
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,060
You heard everything?

413
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,180
I hear everything.

414
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,780
Say something to them.

415
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,060
Amanda, Madam Zhuang.

416
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,020
You?!

417
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,060
to the Shencang Army.

418
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,820
Chen Mengmeng.

419
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,580
Send the emperor to the emperor's house.

420
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,820
Then tie him up

421
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,180
and send him to the city.

422
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,140
Keep him in the village

423
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,660
until the end of the day.

424
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,140
Where are you going?

425
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,060
Let me go.

426
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,780
I'm not going.

427
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,180
I won't let you go this time.

428
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,260
I'm not going.

429
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,020
You try.

430
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,460
Wait.

431
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,300
My resumes.

432
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,700
There is a TMG worth of soaps

433
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,620
in the clothes!

434
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,260
You're really a good teacher

435
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,300
for a girl in the battlefield.

436
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,500
Miss, you can't teach me.

437
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,540
Feng Yunxi.

438
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,020
I should let you live for a few days.

439
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,580
I don't want you to get into trouble.

440
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,100
Jin Ye went to many places

441
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,580
not toılarms,

442
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,660
but to the Court of National Defense.

443
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,580
The Imperial case of勾 Rsat

444
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,500
has been rejected and unregistered.

445
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,720
Third Young Lady is the only person who has time to build Saints' Ishe.

446
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,780
Even if she looks at each one of them,

447
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,200
you must treat her well.

448
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:34,000
She left with her

449
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,980
Let me out.

450
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,600
Bi Yao's fault if

451
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,920
she came back without notice.

452
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,640
Take her away.

453
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,120
By the way,

454
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,480
before the water falls,

455
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,920
Miss San has to go to the capital.

456
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,800
Please cooperate with her.

457
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,040
Like this!

458
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,320
You must be hungry.

459
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,400
You're scaring me.

460
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,880
When Kure since early days,

461
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,080
she became so arrogant

462
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,320
that she gotよね

463
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,800
and caused her marital delusion.

464
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,000
Since then.

465
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,240
Havingena drove away my sense of smell by blood.

466
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,600
But you are still not afraid of her.

467
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,480
I came to the country all the time,

468
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,400
I've seen lots of girls

469
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,960
died of�도 cordbullio.

470
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,780
I am okay now since I heard theimmer.

471
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,520
Well,

472
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,400
fear of making you go bankrupt.

473
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,120
Why don't you move fast?

474
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,720
Don't you like the food?

475
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,120
It's the opposite.

476
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,920
It's too much.

477
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,920
glutinous rice,

478
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,920
pork belly,

479
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,720
three-year-old mountain family,

480
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,920
all of them are my favorite food.

481
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,320
Don't worry.

482
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,920
I'm used to it.

483
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,920
I'm used to

484
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,920
watching others' appetite.

485
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,920
Yes.

486
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,920
Why?

487
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
Because

488
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
I'm used to it.

489
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,920
It's more convenient to poison.

490
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,920
Aren't you afraid?

491
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
You won't poison me.

492
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
Why are you so stubborn?

493
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,920
You saved me like this.

494
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,920
Is it just to poison me?

495
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,920
I'm not saving you,

496
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,920
but God.

497
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,920
What?

498
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,920
What did Yuwen Chang'an and your mother say?

499
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,920
Why do you know?

500
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
Answer my question.

501
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,920
What did they say

502
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,920
at the secret meeting tonight?

503
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,920
What do you want to do?

504
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,920
Answer my question.

505
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,920
The two are too far away.

506
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,920
They can't figure it out.

507
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,920
They only listen to them.

508
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,920
They talk about it at the secret meeting.

509
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,920
They are so stubborn.

510
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,920
They are just like that.

511
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
Do you want me to use my power?

512
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
Do you want me to use my power?

513
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
Do you want me to use my power?

514
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,920
Yes.

515
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,920
Don't you want to know

516
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,920
what your parents and Yuwen Chang'an

517
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,920
are like?

518
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,920
What's wrong with them?

519
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
What's wrong with them?

520
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,920
It's a long story.

521
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,920
It's a long story.

522
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,920
Your parents are your grandfather.

523
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,920
They were the students of Hanlin Academy.

524
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
They were the best in the world.

525
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,920
Zhuang Shiyang and Yuwen Chang'an

526
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,920

It's a king's church acting

562
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,880
It's a king's church acting

563
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,440
To be specific

564
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,960
Most students were born in next century.

565
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:37,380
racing

566
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,780
racing

567
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,880
racing

568
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:54,880
The End

569
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,880
Since then, Yuwen Chang'an has become Zhuang Shiyang's brother.

570
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,880
The court is in a difficult position.

571
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,880
Although he has been through a lot,

572
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,880
he is still very young.

573
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,880
I have heard from him that he is still very fond of the past.

574
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:26,880
The End

575
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,880
He...

576
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,880
still loves his mother.

577
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,880
The Ruan family is also due to the fact that he is a failure.

578
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,880
I am not interested in the past of Yuwen Chang'an.

579
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,880
But they are both trying to find out the truth.

580
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,880
I must find out the truth.

581
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,880
Only three of them can help me get this answer.

582
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,880
Brother-in-law is looking at me.

583
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,880
It's hard to protect yourself now. How can I help you?

584
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,880
With the help of the Court of Judicial Review,

585
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,880
no one dares to force you to get married.

586
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,880
Besides, they are both secretly planning a marriage.

587
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,880
Are you not curious at all?

588
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,880
Miss San,

589
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,880
you must be Yan Chai.

590
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,880
Why didn't you wear it today?

591
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,880
What should I do, Mr. Fu?

592
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,880
I don't know.

593
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,880
What should I do, Mr. Fu?

594
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,880
How to investigate is your business.

595
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,880
You have shocked the Jianjia Pavilion tonight.

596
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,880
I'm afraid that they won't see you again recently.

597
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,880
You should rest well first.

598
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,880
We will quickly set up a trap and make them understand.

599
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,880
I will inform you in advance.

600
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,880
I am not in a good mood at Jianjia Pavilion.

601
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,880
What do you think?

602
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,880
The music.

603
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,880
My lord,

604
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,880
the manor sent a demon to come to the Demon Realm.

605
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,880
Are you full?

606
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,880
I'm full. Thank you for your kindness.

607
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,880
I'll take my leave.

608
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,880
I'll see you out.

609
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,880
Go.

610
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,880
Be a little bit more miserable.

611
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
You are the best.

612
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,880
Miss San.

613
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,880
Please.

614
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
Miss San.

615
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
Miss San.

616
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,880
Miss San.

617
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,880
Miss San.

618
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,880
Miss San.

619
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,880
Miss San.

620
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,880
Miss San.

621
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,880
Miss San.

622
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,880
Miss San.

623
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
Miss San.

624
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,880
Today, Xiao Jing.

625
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,880
Look at the servants in the garden.

626
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,880
Without my order,

627
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,880
you can't step out of the door.

628
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
Yes.

629
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,880
What's the matter?

630
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,880
Why do you want to see me tonight?

631
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,880
It's too dangerous.

632
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,880
The world is in danger.

633
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,880
Today, the 5th number of people has received a secret letter.

634
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,880
Please read it.

635
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,880
Gan Zhou Shang, the chairman of the meeting.

636
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,880
You have seen him last year.

637
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,880
He is not a human.

638
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,880
He is a human.

639
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,880
He is a human.

640
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,880
He is a human.

641
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,880
He is a human.

642
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,880
He is a human.

643
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,880
He is a human.

644
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,880
He is a human.

645
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,880
He is a human.

646
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
I have seen him.

647
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,880
He is not a human.

648
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,880
I have a doubt.

649
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,880
But this letter is worth a word.

650
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,880
It's a secret.

651
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,880
Where did you get it?

652
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,880
I didn't find it out.

653
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,880
I don't know who put it on my book.

654
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,880
It's true.

655
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,880
If he really wants to take the blame,

656
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,880
plus the unchangeable evidence on my hand,

657
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,880
he will kill him.

658
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,880
It's too much.

659
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,880
We have to start.

660
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,880
This matter is not the same as the past.

661
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,880
We still need to think about it.

662
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,880
You know that I have been collecting evidence these years.

663
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,880
Why don't you wait for me?

664
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,880
Maybe...

665
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,880
No, maybe not.

666
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,880
I have been planning for years.

667
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,880
It's not just about thinking.

668
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,880
You don't need to persuade me.

669
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,880
But...

670
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,880
That girl who suddenly came back from the Danzhu,

671
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,880
she has to send her out as soon as possible.

672
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,880
She is only 17 years old.

673
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,880
She has suffered a lot.

674
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,880
I don't want her to suffer any more.

675
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,880
I just hope that she can live a happy life.

676
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,880
Mother.

677
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,880
Why are you so anxious?

678
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,880
Mother, just now,

679
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,880
Mrs. Chen went to the backyard.

680
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
She brought a man.

681
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,880
He went to the courtyard of the house.

682
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,880
Do you see the person's face?

683
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,880
The night is too dark.

684
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,880
It's not true.

685
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,880
But he must not be the person in our house.

686
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,880
Give me a change.

687
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,880
Wear that red one.

688
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,880
It's a bit too much.

689
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,880
Let's go.

690
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,880
I brought a little gift for you.

691
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,880
But I found that the house was messy.

692
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,880
It seemed that someone turned it over.

693
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,880
I checked it carefully.

694
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,880
I found that the man's seal was not in the book.

695
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,880
It's over.

696
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,880
Someone stole my seal.

697
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,880
My family is in trouble.

698
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,880
Do you want to report it to me?

699
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,880
Send my order.

700
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,880
Take the man in the house to the courtyard.

701
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,880
Search carefully.

702
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,880
Maybe the man is not in the garden.

703
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,880
Yes.

704
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,880
Hurry.

705
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,880
Search carefully in every room.

706
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,880
Go.

707
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,880
Son.

708
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,880
This...

709
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,880
This is the house.

710
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,880
Son.

711
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,880
What...

712
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,880
What happened?

713
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,880
Mother.

714
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,880
The house is in a mess.

715
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,880
Son lost his seal.

716
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,880
Mother, did you hear something?

717
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,880
God.

718
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,880
I'm lying down.

719
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,880
I must search carefully.

720
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,880
I can't let the thief run away.

721
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,880
Luckily, mother is not here.

722
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,880
But where is the master?

723
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,880
I'm here.

724
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,880
You take care of the people.

725
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,880
Go to see the man.

726
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,880
Yes.

727
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,880
Be careful.

728
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,880
Follow me.

729
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,880
Go.

730
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,880
What are you doing?

731
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,880
Master Gu.

732
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,880
Master asked all the guards to guard the door.

733
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,880
Search every room.

734
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,880
Don't let anyone in.

735
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,880
I think...

736
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,880
Mother, bad news.

737
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,880
The thief in the house is in the house.

738
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,880
He stole my master's seal.

739
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,880
He has surrounded the whole house.

740
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,880
Mother.

741
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,880
Please leave now.

742
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,880
At least leave our yard.

743
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,880
Otherwise, we can't tell you.

744
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,880
Xiwen.

745
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,880
How about I leave now?

746
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,880
We were here for this.

747
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,880
I'm afraid we can't make it.

748
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,880
Mother.

749
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,880
Zhuang Hanyan.

750
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,880
You and Zhou Ruying reported this.

751
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,880
I knew you would suspect me.

752
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,880
But it has nothing to do with me.

753
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,880
I just want to know

754
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,880
what you just said.

755
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,880
What are you trying to hide?

756
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,880
These past days,

757
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,880
you have been so rude to me.

758
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,880
You just want to kick me out of the house.

759
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,880
Are you afraid I will be in trouble?

760
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,880
What do you hear?

761
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,880
Zhuang Men.

762
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,880
Yes.

763
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,880
Zhuang Men.

764
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,880
You are the one who wanted to kill us.

765
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,880
You are too old to do that.

766
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,880
You can't do that.

767
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,880
Zhuang Men.

768
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,880
We have started to pretend.

769
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,880
Please tell us what happened.

770
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,880
Let's talk about this later.

771
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,880
Uncle Yuwen.

772
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,880
You go to my room first.

773
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,880
How can I enter your room?

774
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,200
I can be damaged by it,

775
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,080
but I'm not afraid.

776
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,000
Why not?

777
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,240
You're the daughter of Wei Chu Ge.

778
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,320
Why not?

779
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,880
Just a few words.

780
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,640
It's like a ghost eating a ghost.

781
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,640
What's the point?

782
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,240
As long as I protect my mother,

783
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,960
I'll be fine.

784
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,720
If my mother dies,

785
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,000
the whole board will be finished.

786
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,400
Where did you learn this?

787
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,920
It's because of this.

788
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,520
We don't have to take this step.

789
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,440
I know you have a secret.

790
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,440
But I believe you won't hurt me.

791
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,600
I won't hurt you.

792
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,920
I'll warn you again.

793
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,360
Don't use your talents

794
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,000
on the household affairs.

795
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,320
It's not the time to talk about this.

796
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,600
Uncle Yuwen, come with me.

797
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:24,920
Aunt Chen.

798
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,280
Take her down.

799
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,240
Miss Sai.

800
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,120
Miss Sai.

801
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,440
Miss Sai.

802
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,640
Mother.

803
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,520
Even if I'm in a hurry,

804
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,640
it has nothing to do with you.

805
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,200
It's all my fault.

806
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,480
Jilan.

807
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,480
Take me out.

808
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,200
Mother.

809
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,160
Miss Sai.

810
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,920
Xiven, you can't go out.

811
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,400
Xiven.

812
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,160
Mr. Yuwen.

813
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,600
No matter what happens outside,

814
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,640
don't come out.

815
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,200
Uncle Chen, close the door.

816
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,480
Go.

817
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,920
I'm afraid that I'll be a stranger.

818
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,840
I'll be a stranger to you.

819
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,160
I'll be a stranger to you.

820
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,680
Even if I'm in a hurry,

821
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,920
it has nothing to do with you.

822
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,240
I'm not a stranger to you.

823
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,360
I'll be a stranger to you.

824
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,720
I'll be a stranger to you.

825
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:06,720
I'll be a stranger to you.

826
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,720
I'll be a stranger to you.

827
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,200
I can be a stranger to you.

828
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,080
I'll be a stranger to you.

829
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,440
I'll be a stranger to you.

830
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,920
The sea is still deep,

831
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,840
the flower is still young.

832
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,200
I want to be your caretaker.

833
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,720
My heart is in the wind.

834
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,520
I can't be your caretaker.

835
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,920
Please hold me in your arms.

836
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,260
Oops sweat blood need liquor

837
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:45,940
Morganía

838
00:44:48,260 --> 00:45:03,560
