I'm not sure if I can do it.

50
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,080
Thank you, Your Highness.

51
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,080
Thank you, Your Highness.

52
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,080
Get up.

53
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,080
Zhang Hanyan.

54
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,080
You saved my life by punishing me.

55
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,080
I was so wishy-washy.

56
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,080
But I'm not that good at playing tricks.

57
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,760
But I still have to do it myself.

58
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,720
It says that Dr. Fuzhu said,

59
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,200
Why is the horse so hairpin?

60
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,360
Your servant,

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,520
the blacksmith fell in love with it last night.

62
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,880
The horse was so curly

63
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,280
made it shrink from time to time.

64
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,160
I felt very kamuined with it.

65
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,000
Stop writing nonsense?

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You mean someone wants to harm me?

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This handkerchief is a personal item.

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Your Highness has already seen it.

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The embroidery is really rough.

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Someone has switched the handkerchief secretly.

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And put this phoenix chain in the hall.

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It was intended to harm the mother,

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
but it didn't want to make you hurt.

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Madam Zhuang, do you know who did it?

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't know.

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Children?

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Madam Zhuang, that man held those handkerchiefs,

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
so it was really him who...

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,500
He couldn't catch

80
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,000
those handkerchiefs.

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Excuse me,

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
please appreciate I passed the exam.

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Madam Zhuang,

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
he used those handkerchiefs for such an add discount.

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It couldn't get any better than that.

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Okay.

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I was just rerecording these handkerchiefs to have it.

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The second test??

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Your Highness, please forgive me.

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I have to go to the house.

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm a bit tired.

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I don't dare to bother you anymore.

93
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Your Highness, this is not the same as the past.

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You must investigate and exchange.

95
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You must punish the Zhuang family.

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So that Your Highness won't be in danger.

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Zhuang Han Yan, come forward.

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'll let you go forward.

99
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Kneel down.

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Stretch out your hands.

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Stretch out your hands.

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Your Highness.

103
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Back then, in the Dazi Guizhong,

104
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I and your mother had a competition at the Marquis Maqiu factory.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
This jade bracelet is a silk head.

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Although I won that year,

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I know that your mother was willing to let me win.

108
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Now that you are a woman,

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
you are in the position to take the risk of being a nun.

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Under the pretext of me and the Maqiu,

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I will reward you with this jade bracelet.

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You are the owner of the Wu Gui.

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You still don't accept it?

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You are still not willing to tell me

116
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:48,560
about the

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
death of the head of the company?

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I have never lied to you.

119
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I didn't have any death.

120
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,180
Everyones Queen

121
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,200
I am so anxious

122
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,200
A daughter who is so precious

123
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,100
don't deserve such like mother

124
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,500
What do you think, Mother?

125
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,100
Under the precious

126
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,980
On the Stevieémon?

127
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,340
Were you bickering on purposely

128
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,660
of winning an cultural regimen

129
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,940
after winning at that reservation?

130
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,260
I also wait till the other side

131
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,460
begins to understand

132
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:46,900
how someone like you

133
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,000
of horizontal 로

134
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,860
has partially managed to win the 6th pl職業мер Megan Walker.

135
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,780
It was you

136
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:59,260
But the palace is just a prison with a golden sword.

137
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,940
You don't want to be trapped in the palace.

138
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,460
All these years, I think I'm in a very good mood.

139
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,020
I've been so anxious and so dangerous.

140
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,060
How much I've given up?

141
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,300
How much I sacrificed?

142
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,140
How much I've been harmed?

143
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,780
I even got forced to die.

144
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,340
I had to die.

145
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,340
All these years of being a palace servant,

146
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,260
it's all you.

147
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,540
That competition was for the emperor.

148
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,060
It wasn't a real challenge.

149
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,820
The real challenge was to enter the palace as a concubine.

150
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,300
Everyone knows about it.

151
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,620
I think you've been so anxious to win.

152
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,100
I just want you to get what you want.

153
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,900
Now, why are you blaming me?

154
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,580
I just want to blame you.

155
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,660
Why do I have to be trapped in the palace?

156
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,340
Even if I get married every year,

157
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,260
I have to kneel and cry for love.

158
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,460
But you can...

159
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,100
I thought

160
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,500
although you were a little bit cruel,

161
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,140
you were a little bit weak.

162
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,500
But at least you have a man who loves you.

163
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,820
You are a man who loves you.

164
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,260
But you can't...

165
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,140
even if you are cruel,

166
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,020
you still want to kill your life.

167
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,900
Miss Ruan,

168
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,420
you still can't escape this prison.

169
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,100
I'm glad you're happy that I'm not doing well.

170
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,300
But I can't let you down.

171
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,380
Otherwise, you can be a good girl

172
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,580
with Shou Zhenzhen.

173
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,380
You're so annoying!

174
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,020
Miss.

175
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,300
I'm just vibing with your feet.

176
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,540
If you can't say anything,

177
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,380
it sounds like a nightmare.

178
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,620
Go ask and you will hear me out.

179
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,140
The reward of your"-

180
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,100
Departure Festival Steel Award sesi 2008.

181
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,900
Come, thank you, Your Highness Duan

182
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,900
Master Tan, good at speaking with you

183
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,220
You also have the ten Ajatant nous

184
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,780
Let your Aristocrat have a profile

185
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,380
Lord can have a lath

186
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,500
Have a hard time

187
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,060
To1 to show marks

188
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,220
Or to bear a Kneel

189
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,220
I will obey your order.

190
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,820
What are you doing?

191
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Mrs. Zhuang, you are guilty.

192
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,020
You...

193
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
What are you doing?

194
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:28,220
The

195
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,220
time is not too late.

196
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,220
My legs are injured.

197
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,220
I have been in the hospital for 17 years.

198
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,220
I have been at home for a long time.

199
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,220
Those doctors said

200
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,220
I could not stand up.

201
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,220
Mrs. Zhuang,

202
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,220
please ask

203
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,220
where you were hired from 17 years ago.

204
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,220
My husband is looking for a doctor.

205
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,220
I am afraid that these so-called doctors

206
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,220
are not trustworthy.

207
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,220
What do you mean?

208
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,220
Your legs are injured.

209
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,220
You have been injured.

210
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,220
But after the injury,

211
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,220
the Qin family practiced

212
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,220
not to be greedy.

213
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,220
What you mean is

214
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,220
these doctors are lying to me?

215
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,220
Maybe it's because of the medical skill.

216
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,220
Maybe it's because of the illness.

217
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,220
I dare not make a decision for the time being.

218
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,220
I have been smart for a lifetime.

219
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,220
I have been harmed for the rest of my life,

220
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,220
but I have not found out.

221
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,220
Mrs. Zhuang, don't be angry.

222
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,220
I am not angry.

223
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,220
Mrs. Zhuang, don't be angry.

224
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,220
I have been working for you for years.

225
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,220
I have been working for you for years.

226
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,220
I am afraid that these years

227
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,220
you have been worried about your resentment and hatred.

228
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,220
You have been hurt more.

229
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,220
You have been greedy for years

230
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,220
and you have no right to do so.

231
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,220
Otherwise, even if you could not cure it,

232
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,220
you could at least walk away.

233
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,220
Then...

234
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,220
Then, please calm down.

235
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,220
I...

236
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,220
There is still a possibility.

237
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,220
If you trust me,

238
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,220
from tomorrow on,

239
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,220
I will go to the Imperial House every day

240
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,220
to treat you with the real medical skills.

241
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,220
But the medical system needs more medical care.

242
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,220
The treatment can be treated in a few minutes.

243
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,220
I also want to see if you can relax your mind.

244
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,220
I also want to see if you can relax your mind.

245
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,220
I also want to know if you can relax your mind.

246
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,220
From now on,

247
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,220
you don't have to put yourself in trouble.

248
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,220
Then...

249
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,720
That...

250
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,220
That means I...

251
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,220
I...

252
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,220
Can I be more Demon Slayer now?

253
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,220
Even though I do not dare to say that

254
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,220
you seemed like you were badly bited.

255
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,220
Your own life did not seem to return.

256
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,220
Once you have both legs,

257
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,220
you are free.

258
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,220
You can do

259
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,220
what you lost.

260
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,220
Ruan Xiuwen.

261
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,220
I want to see you stand up

262
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,220
from the bottom of the world

263
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,220
before the New Year's Day.

264
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,220
You and I

265
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,220
have a good deal of winning.

266
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,220
The New Year's Day

267
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,220
of the New Year's Day

268
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,220
I know

269
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,220
you are the one

270
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,220
who won the award.

271
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,220
Don't say anything

272
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,220
without any evidence.

273
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,220
It's a crime.

274
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,220
You don't have to be panic.

275
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,220
I don't want to punish you.

276
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,220
Otherwise,

277
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,220
I wouldn't have

278
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,220
been talking to you.

279
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,220
What good will you do?

280
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,220
I really don't want to help you.

281
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,220
But I never thought

282
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,220
I would hurt you.

283
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,220
But from now on,

284
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,220
you have the chance

285
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,220
to hold me.

286
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,220
If you dare to do this to my mother,

287
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,220
I will never forgive you.

288
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,220
Don't think I will be afraid of you.

289
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,220
You are just a dead man.

290
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,220
Zhuang Yushan.

291
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,220
We are close,

292
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,220
but we have no sister.

293
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,220
We are just like women.

294
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,220
I will tell you one thing.

295
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,220
In our life,

296
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,220
there are too many things

297
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,220
that are worth chasing.

298
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,220
You don't have to be

299
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,220
so ungrateful

300
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,220
to be a man who loves you.

301
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,220
Yes.

302
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,220
I lost tonight.

303
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,220
But you don't have to

304
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,220
be so ungrateful.

305
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,220
You still don't understand.

306
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,220
I have never been against you.

307
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,220
How can I defeat you?

308
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,220
You are not worthy of the title.

309
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,220
I am just a coward

310
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,220
to be a fool

311
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,220
in front of you.

312
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,220
But let me tell you,

313
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,220
I will never let you down.

314
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,220
Grandmother.

315
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,220
Yushan is so crazy.

316
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,220
They know the true power of a real girl.

317
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,220
We are not going to read the Exactly That Who is The Most Important of all.

318
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,220
Go!

319
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,220
Yushan.

320
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,220
Say it twice.

321
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,220
Whatever you call me.

322
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,220
Dora Tong.

323
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,220
In that case,

324
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,220
you should hold Yasheng back.

325
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,220
Sorry to have bothered you by saying

326
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:16,340
recommend it.

327
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,940
You go out first.

328
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,380
I want to stay for a little while.

329
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,220
She finally got here.

330
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,580
Based on the Great Bertipus Poverty...

331
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,020
She couldn't stopіш playing tricks.

332
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,580
Qin Wen.

333
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,160
It's just that she didn't want to talk about it right on your date

334
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,880
Just going along with the Lord

335
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,260
our matrimonial part

336
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,620
has changed

337
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,980
Little Nine

338
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,940
Little haben

339
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,160
No one could advise me.

340
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,740
What did they teach you?

341
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,660
orticians!

342
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,600
They are all good men.

343
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,620
The one that is goodwillier is a conifer.

344
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,680
The fine spirit is agitation after all.

345
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,940
Every time I see the night view,

346
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,140
I will take out the list of the books

347
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,440
and take a look.

348
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,140
Unfortunately,

349
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,940
the person who made the decision

350
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,940
was not allowed to

351
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,940
become a pair of pairs.

352
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,140
Yanxi is dead.

353
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,440
You are late.

354
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,440
Yanxi is dead.

355
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,640
But I am not.

356
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,140
If you still have the habit of drinking,

357
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,840
and we drink again,

358
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,640
what will you do?

359
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,140
Xiwen,

360
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,440
you are not willing to be in the old place of Talun.

361
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,440
Why do you have to suffer so much?

362
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,040
The world is big and vast.

363
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,140
There will always be your glory.

364
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,140
Okay, I don't need you.

365
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,140
Just take the list of the books

366
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,140
and return to the original.

367
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,140
I will wait for you to say something.

368
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,140
Why are you here?

369
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,140
Noble Consort Miao not only kept your mother a small piece,

370
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,640
but also brought her to the palace for medical treatment.

371
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,640
Miss San, you are really so good at cooking.

372
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,140
You are now a official official,

373
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,140
and you can still make Noble Consort Yi the one who can do anything.

374
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,640
It's also a great blessing.

375
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,640
This is not a waste of time.

376
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,140
I just want to pretend to be a good person.

377
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,140
I will do my best to help you.

378
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,640
It's not a waste of time.

379
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,640
I just want to pretend to be a good person

380
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,140
and spread the news of the Linjiang Pavilion to Miao's Mansion.

381
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,140
She won't come here alone.

382
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,640
I thought it was Gu You,

383
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,640
and I thought it was Su Di.

384
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,640
Now it seems

385
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,140
that they are just a team of people who are in the same boat.

386
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,140
In the same boat?

387
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,640
Why are they all together?

388
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,640
They all married the wrong person.

389
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,140
What about you?

390
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,640
What?

391
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,640
What are your plans for the wedding?

392
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,140
It's hard to be honest

393
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,140
with them.

394
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,640
It happened repeatedly.

395
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,140
Young man and woman

396
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,640
and theriest is the best marriage date you could have.

397
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,640
I never thought

398
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,640
I could make any decision.

399
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,640
The beauty of a couple

400
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,140
ies and fating.

401
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,640
You can never be my lover.

402
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,640
That is a dream.

403
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,140
I'm very grateful for this.

404
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,140
I know a reason.

405
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,140
It's hard to be a man.

406
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,140
Please change your mind.

407
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,140
I don't want to

408
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,140
be a man's anger.

409
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,140
But the Zhuang family is not a long-standing family.

410
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,140
Do you want to be trapped in the middle of life?

411
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,140
I don't want to be a family.

412
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,140
It's just that the marriage is a matter of my own accord.

413
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,140
It's not for the sake of the family.

414
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,140
It's just the blood,

415
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,140
the blood of a white-haired man.

416
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,140
It's more like

417
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,140
I'm only a long-standing family.

418
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,140
I can live with a peace of mind.

419
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,140
I'm not being tortured by others.

420
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,140
I'm not being punished by the people.

421
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,140
Otherwise,

422
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,140
I'll be in trouble for the rest of my life.

423
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,140
Do you think so?

424
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,140
Of course.

425
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:54,140
I can give you all the things you want.

426
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,140
What did you say?

427
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,140
Nothing.

428
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,140
Nothing.

429
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,140
It's late at night.

430
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,140
Miss San, go back and rest.

431
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,140
Miss San,

432
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,140
you can go back to your room and rest.

433
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,140
Miss San,

434
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,140
I want you to go back to your room.

435
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,140
I can't go back to my room.

436
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,140
I don't want to go back to my room.

437
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,140
I can't go back to my room.

438
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,140
I haven't had any symptoms for over a decade.

439
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,140
I feel this pain in my skin.

440
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,140
From now on,

441
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,140
I will continue to take the medicine.

442
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,140
Also,

443
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,140
you can't sit on the wheel all day.

444
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,140
You have to walk down the stairs.

445
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,140
It will be more difficult at the beginning.

446
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,140
But as long as you are determined,

447
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,140
you will be able to turn around.

448
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,140
Thank you.

449
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,140
Mr. Tan,

450
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,140
how long will my mother

451
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,140
need to be fully recovered?

452
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:56,140
This illness has been too difficult for a long time.

453
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,140
I am not sure about it.

454
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,140
But I am a medical patient.

455
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,140
I am very patient.

456
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,140
As long as you are open-minded,

457
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,140
you are always on the same page.

458
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,140
It's been months,

459
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,140
and it's been a few days.

460
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,140
Although it's difficult to recover,

461
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,140
there will be a miracle.

462
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,140
Dr. Tan,

463
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,140
I am willing to take these servants as my family.

464
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,140
They will keep me safe

465
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,140
for a lifetime.

466
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,140
Please tell me

467
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,140
if you are okay with my health.

468
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,140
I am sure.

469
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,140
Don't worry, madam.

470
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,140
I will understand.

471
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,140
Mother!

472
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,140
Zhu Mu!

473
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,140
Mother!

474
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,140
It's okay.

475
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,140
I will come by myself.

476
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,140
I will stand up by myself.

477
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,140
Give me the badge.

478
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,140
Okay.

479
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,140
Come.

480
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,140
You can leave it to me.

481
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,140
I can do it.

482
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,140
Father!

483
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,140
Mother!

484
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,140
Zhu Mu, are you okay?

485
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,140
Come and take a rest.

486
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,140
It's okay.

487
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,140
Come, wipe it.

488
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,140
I will do it.

489
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,140
I will do it.

490
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,140
Han Yan.

491
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:31,380
The

492
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,540
vér

493
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:53,540
ь

494
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,660
Miss San,

495
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,640
we Technician Yang

496
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,860
got Miao Guifei

497
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,020
to receber the reward properly.

498
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:31,380
This

499
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,660
what really happened to Fujia?

500
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,140
What does mother mean by that?

501
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,140
After you returned to the family,

502
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,140
she helped you three times.

503
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,140
Did she fall in love with you?

504
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,140
She helped me many times.

505
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:03,140
But this person's heart is not stable.

506
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,140
I don't know what she really thinks.

507
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,140
What about you?

508
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,140
Did you fall in love with her?

509
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,140
Han Yan, love is beautiful.

510
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,140
Being able to have a heart-to-heart person,

511
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,140
to be with each other, to be together,

512
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,140
to be together, to be together,

513
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,140
is a life-threatening thing.

514
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,140
As a woman,

515
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,140
we don't make mistakes in pursuing love.

516
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,140
We just make mistakes

517
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,140
and make love the only hope in this life.

518
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,140
You asked me

519
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,140
whether I wanted to be with you.

520
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,140
I didn't want that.

521
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,140
We are both mothers,

522
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,140
but I can't take you by surprise.

523
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,140
I hope you have your own life,

524
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,140
your own friends and loved ones.

525
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,140
Instead of becoming my father's wife,

526
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,140
do you understand what I mean?

527
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,140
I understand.

528
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:03,140
I may have feelings for Yunxi,

529
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,140
but I'm afraid of the fact that

530
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,140
I'm being too emotional and heartless.

531
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:12,140
I even have a hatred for her.

532
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,140
I'm stupid.

533
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,140
I can't tell you clearly.

534
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,140
I'm afraid that you can't think about it

535
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,140
without much time.

536
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,140
What do you mean?

537
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,140
Your father came to be called a ghost.

538
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:27,140
You have a good life in the West.

539
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,140
He's very kind to you.

540
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,140
He has a lot of affection for you.

541
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,140
He wants to see you one by one.

542
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:38,140
Do you think that's why he's like this?

543
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,140
I've been with him for 20 years.

544
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,140
I don't think so.

545
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,140
You have a relationship with Yunxi.

546
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,140
He can see you a lot.

547
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,140
Yunxi is responsible for the investigation.

548
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,140
He's been so patient.

549
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,140
He wants you to marry him.

550
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,140
You have less affection for him.

551
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,140
Plus, you and my mother are closer.

552
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,140
He's a ghost.

553
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,140
He's not safe.

554
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:08,140
I'm afraid that we'll cause him trouble.

555
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,140
That's all.

556
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,140
These are liver and liver.

557
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,140
The same thing is the living.

558
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,140
Let them burn.

559
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,140
The most important thing now

560
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:27,140
is to find out how Yunxi is doing.

561
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,140
Okay.

562
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,140
I heard that you're a good teacher.

563
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:36,140
You're very kind today.

564
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,140
If I hadn't asked for it,

565
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,140
my mother wouldn't have come.

566
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,140
He's so polite.

567
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:47,140
He's so polite today.

568
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,140
It's okay.

569
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,140
I think Mr. Xue is a good person.

570
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,140
If I can get married to Miss San before the spring comes,

571
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,140
it'll be a happy wedding.

572
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,140
I've seen Mr. Xue.

573
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,140
Why are you here?

574
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:08,140
I'm here to take care of Mr. Xue.

575
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,140
I'm here to accompany you.

576
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,140
Mr. Xue, we've already made a deal.

577
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,140
Why did you say that?

578
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,140
I'm not sure.

579
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,140
There are still many doubts.

580
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,140
I heard that the Court of Judicial Review

581
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,140
is still investigating Mr. Xue.

582
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,140
That's why I'm here.

583
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,140
Mr. Xue, how are you?

584
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,140
I haven't heard about it.

585
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,140
Who's investigating me?

586
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,140
Mr. Xue, please forgive me.

587
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,140
This is the military department of the foreign army.

588
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,140
We're in a hurry.

589
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,140
Not only is the whole house a mess,

590
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,140
but also a group of people.

591
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,140
Even his relatives and mother

592
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:46,140
were caught and killed.

593
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,140
Now, the life of a small family

594
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:51,140
is all about whether Mr. Xue is innocent or not.

595
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,140
I'm really worried about him.

596
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:56,140
Mr. Zhuang, since you have the right to visit,

597
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,140
we won't bother you anymore.

598
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,140
Let's go back first.

599
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,140
Mother, what are you afraid of?

600
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,140
Miss San is a despicable and impulsive person.

601
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,140
She's the heroine of the whole capital.

602
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,140
The Zhuang family must be innocent.

603
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,140
What nonsense are you talking about?

604
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,140
Hurry up and leave.

605
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,140
I'm sorry.

606
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,140
Mr. Zhuang.

607
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,140
I'm with Miss San.

608
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,140
Let's go.

609
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,140
I'm with Miss San.

610
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,140
Please don't bother others.

611
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,140
Mr. Zhuang.

612
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,140
Mr. Zhuang, you are...

613
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,140
Sorry.

614
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,140
I've troubled the guest of the Yue family.

615
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,140
I'll take my leave now.

616
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,140
Mr. Zhuang,

617
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,140
why did you investigate me in the Dali Temple?

618
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,140
I'm innocent.

619
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,140
Sir.

620
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,140
What is it?

621
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:53,140
Mr. Xue is talking nonsense in the Dali Temple.

622
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,140
He said he's going to the Dali Temple to get married today

623
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,140
and get Miss San's consent.

624
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,140
He'll get married on time.

625
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,140
Just give him some advice.

626
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,140
But he's not afraid of

627
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,140
making a fuss about it.

628
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,140
He said that Miss San

629
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,140
gave him his engagement letter.

630
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,140
I can't take it anymore.

631
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,140
Get up.

632
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,140
I'm so worried.

633
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,140
Mr. Zhuang, please.

634
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,140
Please let my ungrateful son go.

635
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,140
It's all my fault.

636
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,140
I've already treated him well.

637
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,140
If you don't get married,

638
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,140
I'll take him away again.

639
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,140
I'll be innocent.

640
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,140
Yes.

641
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,140
Get up.

642
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,140
Go and talk to Han Yan.

643
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,140
Where's Mr. Zhuang?

644
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,140
Mr. Zhuang.

645
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,140
Mr. Zhuang, please.

646
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,140
Han Yan.

647
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,140
Father.

648
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,140
This is...

649
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,140
Miss San.

650
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,140
I've offended you today.

651
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,140
Please spare him.

652
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,140
I'm so sorry.

653
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:50,140
I'm not a good person.

654
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,140
I'm so sorry.

655
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,140
I'm sorry.

656
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,140
Please forgive me.

657
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:59,140
Please spare him.

658
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,140
Please.

659
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,140
Please.

660
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,140
Please.

661
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,140
You have to ask

662
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,140
about Fu Shaoqing.

663
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,140
Fu Yunxi?

664
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,140
Yes.

665
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,140
Miss.

666
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,140
My husband asked for a meeting.

667
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,140
He said he wanted to give you a life.

668
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,140
Please don't be afraid.

669
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,140
Mr. Xue is here today.

670
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,140
He's ruined your life.

671
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,140
This is not my thing.

672
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,140
I was wrong.

673
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,140
I'll take my leave.

674
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,140
Stop.

675
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,140
Fu Yunxi.

676
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,140
What do you mean?

677
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,140
You're so anxious to marry him.

678
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,140
So what?

679
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,140
If so,

680
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:45,140
I'll help you choose a man today.

681
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,140
The son of the Wolf's Sect,

682
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,140
Zuo Ying Shou.

683
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,140
He's a small man.

684
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,140
He's a man of his own.

685
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,140
Don't mention him.

686
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,140
He's timid and timid.

687
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,140
He's weak and incompetent.

688
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,140
He's the son of Fu Shaoqing.

689
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,140
Mr. Cao.

690
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,140
He's a man of his own.

691
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,140
He's a man of his own.

692
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:19,140
These men are really good to you.

693
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,140
And these.

694
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,140
The son of the Crown Prince, Peng Guanyu.

695
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,140
He's a man of his own.

696
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,140
He's not a man of his own.

697
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,140
He's a man of his own.

698
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,140
He's a man of his own.

699
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,140
He's a man of his own.

700
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,140
He's a man of his own.

701
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,140
He's a man of his own.

702
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,140
He's a man of his own.

703
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,140
He's a man of his own.

704
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:51,140
The son of the Wolf's Sect, Qiu Ming.

705
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,140
He's a man of his own.

706
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:56,140
But he's not good at making jokes.

707
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:59,140
He's just a man of his own.

708
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,140
He's a man of his own.

709
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:05,140
What do you think about him?

710
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:13,140
I hope you can keep your word.

711
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,140
Goodbye.

712
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,140
My lord.

713
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,140
What's wrong?

714
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,140
Miss San went to the temple today

715
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,140
to pray for mother.

716
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,140
She sent a gift to the Zhuang family.

717
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,140
She even bought a car and a house.

718
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:37,140
She knows that Miss San went to the temple with her.

719
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,140
She heard that he was born in Han,

720
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,140
but he's a man of his own.

721
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,140
He's a man of his own.

722
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,140
He's a man of his own.

723
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,140
My lord.

724
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:52,140
I have a good idea.

725
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,140
Go ahead.

726
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,140
Okay.

727
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,140
I'll go to the Black Gold and the Horse's side

728
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,140
to get the money.

729
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,140
I'll go to the temple

730
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,140
to see the hell-benton.

731
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,140
When I and my brother

732
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,140
went to Miss San's house,

733
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,140
he was so angry.

734
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,140
He was so angry.

735
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,140
He saved her.

736
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,140
How is it?

737
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,140
I'm not that bored

738
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,140
when I'm with my child.

739
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,140
What's going on?

740
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,140
Miss San, I'm sorry.

741
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,140
The car broke down in the south.

742
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,140
What should we do?

743
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,140
Why didn't you check it before you left?

744
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,140
This...

745
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,140
I've seen Miss Zhuang in He Wen's house.

746
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,140
This is...

747
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,140
Miss He saw the smile.

748
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,140
If Miss Zhuang doesn't mind,

749
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,140
I'll take the car back to the temple.

750
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:51,140
The people of Huangshan and the wild land.

751
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,140
You two are lucky.

752
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:56,140
What are you laughing at?

753
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,140
You're still a hero.

754
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,140
You're not that good at math.

755
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,140
You keep your woman.

756
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,140
Get out of here.

757
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,140
I'm a man of my own.

758
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,140
If you dare to act like a coward,

759
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,140
the government will not let you go.

760
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,140
We're black-winged and we're doing a street business.

761
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,140
We've never been afraid of the government.

762
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,140
Get out of here.

763
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,140
Miss Zhuang, run.

764
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,140
Miss Zhuang, run.

765
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,140
Can you hear me?

766
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,140
Miss Zhuang.

767
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,140
Don't panic, Mr. He.

768
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,140
Are you going to rob or rob?

769
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,140
I'm going to rob.

770
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,140
Go on.

771
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,140
If you don't do anything,

772
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,140
how will you be a master?

773
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,140
What master?

774
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,140
You're here.

775
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,140
Why are you still here?

776
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,140
You haven't finished the show yet.

777
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,140
Is this the end of the show?

778
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,140
Miss Zhuang.

779
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,140
Go.

780
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,140
Go.

781
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,140
Go.

782
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,140
Go.

783
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,140
Where did you get the yellow-and-white blue?

784
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,140
It's not over yet.

785
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,140
I'll kill you if you don't do anything.

786
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,140
Miss Zhuang.

787
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,140
Master.

788
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,140
If it's not him,

789
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,140
we'll go back first.

790
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,140
Go.

791
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,140
Yes.

792
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,140
Let's go.

793
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,140
Master.

794
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,140
What else?

795
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,140
What else?

796
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,140
Miss Zhuang sent a box of powder

797
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,140
to Miss Zhuang.

798
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,140
She said it was for you.

799
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,140
Come here.

800
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,140
How do you feel

801
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,140
when Fu Yunxi is in this mood?

802
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,140
What do you think, mother?

803
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,140
She's kind to you.

804
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,140
If you really have feelings,

805
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,140
you should express your feelings.

806
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,140
Master.

807
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,140
Miss San.

808
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,140
Go to the front hall and have a look.

809
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,140
What's wrong?

810
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,140
He Wenshen is here again.

811
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,140
She seems to be here to propose.

812
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,140
Master has discussed with her

813
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,140
for a long time.

814
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,140
I'm sorry.

815
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,140
I'm sorry.

816
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,140
I'm sorry.

817
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,140
I'm sorry.

818
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,140
I'm sorry.

819
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,140
I'm sorry.

820
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,140
I'm sorry.

821
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,140
I've been talking to her for a long time.

822
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,140
It's not a good idea to ask for a favor.

823
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,140
I just think

824
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,140
Master Zhuang has made another choice.

825
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,140
Master He is a man of the past.

826
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,140
He has a good future.

827
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,140
It's hard to get along with

828
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,140
our Zhuang family.

829
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,140
We're close to each other.

830
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,140
How can there be

831
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,140
a better choice

832
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,140
than you?

833
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,140
Miss Zhuang.

834
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,140
I've seen Master He.

835
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,140
You don't have to be polite.

836
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,140
You two

837
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,140
have a engagement.

838
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,140
After the engagement,

839
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:05,140
you can get married in a few days.

840
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,140
The engagement is fixed?

841
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,140
Han Yan.

842
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,140
Master Zhuang made the decision.

843
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,140
We made a engagement.

844
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,140
Father.

845
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,140
I...

846
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,140
Master He is a man of the past.

847
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,140
But he's a man of the past.

848
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,140
In the future,

849
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,140
even if you can't get the investment,

850
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:27,140
you'll have a great chance.

851
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,140
I'm afraid that

852
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,140
you'll have to do something.

853
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,140
It's my daughter's marriage.

854
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:34,140
Father made the engagement.

855
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,140
Father's mother's order.

856
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:39,140
I've thought about it for you.

857
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,140
Master Yue.

858
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,140
Master.

859
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:02,140
What brings you here?

860
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,140
I heard that

861
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,140
Master Yue wants to marry

862
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,140
Master He.

863
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,140
But there's something else.

864
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,140
He's going to get married.

865
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,140
Please come and have a drink with me.

866
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,140
Greetings, Master.

867
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,140
Master He and Master He

868
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,140
are indeed a man of the past.

869
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,140
They're a perfect match.

870
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,140
Thank you, Master.

871
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:24,140
But how can a single woman

872
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,140
marry two women?

873
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,140
Master Yue,

874
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,140
you're the one who called me.

875
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,140
Master,

876
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,140
what's the meaning of this?

877
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:33,140
Master Yue,

878
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,140
do you still remember

879
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,140
what this means?

880
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,140
Twenty years ago,

881
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:42,140
we two had a good relationship.

882
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,140
We decided to get married

883
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,140
because we wanted to have a good marriage.

884
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,140
I'm afraid that

885
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,140
the daughter of the Zhuang family

886
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,140
is the third lady, Zhuang Hanye.

887
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,140
Master.

888
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,140
It's not like that.

889
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,140
You and I...

890
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,140
What are you doing?

891
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:05,140
You have to be more careful.

892
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,140
I'm in charge of the marriage.

893
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,140
You can't do anything about it.

894
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,140
Please go back to the company.

895
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,140
Master Zhuang,

896
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,140
what's going on?

897
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,140
Is this a real marriage?

898
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,140
Master He,

899
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,140
I've been in charge of the marriage

900
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:19,140
since I was a child.

901
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,140
This is Cheng Xin.

902
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,140
The daughter of the Zhuang family has the right to get married.

903
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:28,140
Master Zhuang,

904
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:30,140
if you can get rid of

905
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,140
Master Fu's marriage,

906
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,140
I can settle this marriage.

907
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,140
Master Zhuang,

908
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,140
I'm not a virtuous person,

909
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,140
but I'm a good person.

910
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,140
I have a good family.

911
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,140
I have a hard life.

912
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,140
After the marriage,

913
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,140
Miss Zhuang is talented and talented.

914
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,140
She is like a famous actress.

915
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:03,140
I've been in love with her before.

916
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,140
I believe that

917
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,140
with Miss Zhuang's knowledge,

918
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:07,140
we can definitely be separated.

919
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,140
Who is the choice of family?

920
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,140
If you are willing to get married to me,

921
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:13,140
I will definitely

922
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,140
take the lead in the village.

923
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,140
I will also treat you as a godess

924
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:19,140
and be as good as a soldier and a good person.

925
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:27,140
The godess is the only one in the world.

926
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,140
The Han family is a mortal family.

927
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,140
I'm afraid that

928
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:32,140
they are not good at selling.

929
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,140
Don't be angry, Master He.

930
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,140
We are...

931
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,140
No need.

932
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,140
I was born in the Han family,

933
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,140
but I didn't know you were so good at it.

934
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,140
Miss Zhuang is so good at it.

935
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,140
I'm leaving now.

936
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,140
I'm leaving now.

937
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:56,140
Master He, please stay.

938
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:58,140
Please listen to me.

939
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,140
Master He.

940
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,140
Master He.

941
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,140
Miss Zhuang,

942
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,140
since you are so good at it,

943
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,140
I'll take my leave now.

944
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,140
Fu Yunxi.

945
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,140
Fu Yunxi.

946
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,140
You should give me an explanation.

947
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,140
You did all this?

948
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,140
What's the meaning of it?

949
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,140
Zhuang Hanyan.

950
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,140
What I'm trying to do

951
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,140
is always you.

952
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,140
Trying to do what?

953
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,140
I've already found out

954
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:34,140
that you are not the one

955
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,140
who married the son of Xiang Fu.

956
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,140
You have the right to be the one

957
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,140
who is the best candidate

958
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,140
for the throne.

959
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,140
You can't be the one

960
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:43,140
who is the best candidate for the throne.

961
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,140
You are so greedy.

962
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,140
Since you don't want to

963
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,140
marry a girl,

964
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:49,140
you should be more considerate.

965
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,140
You should just take marriage as a deal.

966
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:55,140
With this money,

967
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,140
the power,

968
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,140
and the status,

969
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,140
you should keep your life

970
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,140
as a family

971
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:02,140
and as a family.

972
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:04,140
Then,

973
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,140
I'll make a deal with you today.

974
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,140
What deal?

975
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:11,140
I can give you all the money

976
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,140
you want.

977
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:15,140
How?

978
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:17,140
You are my wife.

979
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:19,140
I'll be your model for a year.

980
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,140
I'll help you

981
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,140
become the first daughter of the capital.

982
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:23,140
Are you willing to do that?

983
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:31,140
Why

984
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,140
is it me?

985
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:13,140
Who is the woman who did this?

986
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:17,140
The night is dark, the night is silent.

987
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:20,140
There is no light.

988
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:25,140
She has walked into this battlefield.

989
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:29,140
She is not easy to separate.

990
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:33,140
Love and hate,

991
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:36,140
don't be so stubborn.

992
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:39,140
Who is the family?

993
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,140
Who is the real one?

994
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:43,140
We need to be different.

995
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:47,140
We need to be strong and strong.

996
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:52,140
We can't be young and naive.

997
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:55,140
We can't be so stubborn.

998
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:59,140
Who can be so stubborn?

999
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,140
I'm willing to live a life of justice.

1000
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,140
I can't give up my life.

1001
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,140
I can't give up my life.

1002
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,140
I can't give up my life.

1003
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:10,140
I can't give up my life.

1004
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,140
I can't give up my life.

1005
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:14,140
I can't give up my life.

1006
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,140
I can't give up my life.

1007
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,140
I can't give up my life.

1008
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,140
I can't give up my life.

1009
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:22,140
I can't give up my life.

1010
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:24,140
I can't give up my life.

1011
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,140
I can't give up my life.

1012
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:28,140
I can't give up my life.

1013
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,140
I can't give up my life.

1014
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:32,140
I can't give up my life.

1015
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:34,140
I can't give up my life.

1016
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,140
I can't give up my life.

1017
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:43,140
There's always no reason for pain.

1018
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:47,140
Life though so cold and blood institutions here

1019
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,140
It's terrible to come to see each other like this.

1020
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:54,140
With all the love and love I don't get

1021
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:58,140
old, I don't need to fail.
