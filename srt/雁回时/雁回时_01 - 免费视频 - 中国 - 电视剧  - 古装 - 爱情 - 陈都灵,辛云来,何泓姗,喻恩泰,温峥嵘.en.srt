00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,830
(I'm Zhuang Hanyan.)

5
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,240
(On the night I was born,)

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,440
(my grandfather suddenly died.)

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,760
(The Taoist master said)

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,920
(I was the barefoot ghost)

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,600
(and would bring disaster to my family.)

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:32,920
(So, that night,)

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,030
(I was sent to Danzhou,)

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,000
(a thousand miles away.)

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,460
(My father's schoolmate fostered me.)

14
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,000
(They said I was born in the Capital,)

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,520
(my father was a Junior Compiler
of Hanlin Academy,)

16
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,600
(and my mother
was a famous noble lady there.)

17
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,790
(But I've never seen them.)

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,630
Drink it up.

19
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,600
(I grew up in the countryside)

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,040
(and never had a real home.)

21
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,280
(On my seventeenth birthday...)

22
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,480
Where is the money?

23
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,120
What do you want?

24
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,590
Where do you keep our valuables?

25
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,710
Give them to me!

26
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,680
There's no money.

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,200
You've squandered all the money.

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,480
What valuables do we still have?

29
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,870
Sell me if you dare!

30
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,120
Who would want a woman like you?

31
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,070
Sell her, then. She's worth a lot.

32
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,040
We've been raising her for 17 years

33
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,920
without profiting.

34
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,680
Sell her to the brothel

35
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,280
and you'll get money for the wine!

36
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,870
Stop running! Stop!

37
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,510
Come back, good girl.

38
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,350
Let me go.

39
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,560
Stop running. Stop!

40
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:36,580

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,120
Miss, are you cold?

47
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,040
Miss?

48
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,950
Lingzhi, come back.

49
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,030
Lingzhi.

50
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,480
- Stay away from her.
- Who's she?

51
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,760
Miss,

52
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,390
what happened to you?

53
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,870
Why did you collapse here?

54
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,510
I am

55
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,070
Zhuang Hanyan.

56
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,270
Zhuang Hanyan?

57
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,860
(Nanny Sun)
Why is she also a Zhuang?

58
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,120
Miss Hanyan?

59
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,480
She's Miss Hanyan.

60
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,800
Miss Hanyan from Danzhou.

61
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,880
Somebody.

62
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,190
She's here.

63
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,460
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

64
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,520
Master!

65
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,870
Ma'am!

66
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,630
She's back!

67
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,620
=Episode 1=

68
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,250
(Seclusion)
I heard Miss Hanyan was back.

69
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,110
Where is she now?

70
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,310
She's in the minor chamber.

71
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,430
The murder case of foster parents

72
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,830
has been reported to us.

73
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,270
How did you escape?

74
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,870
I'll never forget that day.

75
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,630
Some bandits broke in with blades.

76
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,510
My foster parents

77
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,070
shielded me from their blades

78
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,510
and held them back.

79
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,070
So, I barely survived.

80
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,390
They died horribly

81
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,720
just to save my life.

82
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,240
There are countless households in town.

83
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,680
Even officers like us take time

84
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,830
to find a specific household.

85
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,070
You just came here.

86
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,390
How did you know

87
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,720
where Zhuang Residence was?

88
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,000
It's not hard

89
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,870
to ask around.

90
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,880
Miss.

91
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,120
Thank you.

92
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,270
What do those bandits look like?

93
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,270
What did they wear?

94
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,350
Tell me

95
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,390
some details.

96
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,880
There were seven or eight of them.

97
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,240
They babbled something
I couldn't understand.

98
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,990
They didn't have

99
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,880
special facial features.

100
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,310
But they were in dark blue robes.

101
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,830
They had strange tattoos, too.

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,920
A few days ago, you saw them in panic.

103
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,310
But now, you remember it quite vividly.

104
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,950
My foster parents don't have a child.

105
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,680
They treat me as their real daughter.

106
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,160
I have to keep in mind

107
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,950
what those murderers look like.

108
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,560
If one day they are arrested,

109
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,710
I'll be able to identify them.

110
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,720
Miss Hanyan,

111
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,440
are you hiding anything?

112
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,270
I may not know much
but I've told you everything.

113
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,880
I don't dare to deceive you.

114
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,000
Please do your best

115
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,240
to arrest the bandits early

116
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,910
and do justice

117
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,270
to my foster parents.

118
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,240
Miss Hanyan, if you hide anything,

119
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,710
I'm afraid it'll be exposed soon.

120
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,480
I'll take my leave.

121
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,190
See you, Mr. Fu.

122
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,470
What did you call him?

123
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,200
Miss, you don't know yet.

124
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,920
He is Vice Minister Fu Yunxi

125
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,630
of the Judicial Review.

126
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,920
Before you were born,

127
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,990
you had been engaged to him.

128
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,860
(Fu Yunxi, Vice Minister
of the Judicial Review)

129
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,710
So, he's Fu Yunxi.

130
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,080
He and I were engaged before birth,

131
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,680
but we aren't married.

132
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,230
Why did you know him already?

133
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,150
You lived in Danzhou for years,

134
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,350
so you didn't know that.

135
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,550
A few years ago,

136
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,350
(Shuhong, Maid)
your big sister married him.

137
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,710
But she...

138
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,200
She what?

139
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,830
It's quite complicated.

140
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,470
Rest and get well soon.

141
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,470
You'll know everything one day.

142
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,980
In this case,

143
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,780
now,

144
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,100
he's my brother-in-law.

145
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,180
Miss.

146
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,940
Miss?

147
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:56,980
Nothing.

148
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,340
Don't worry, Miss.

149
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,340
Mr. Fu is really resourceful.

150
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,300
He'll catch the murderers

151
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,060
of the case in Danzhou very soon.

152
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,940
How is he resourceful?

153
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,540
Mr. Fu is a famous officer

154
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,940
in the Court of Judicial Review.

155
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,580
He's solved many big cases.

156
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,940
Now, he's even handling

157
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,300
the Zuohang Gang case

158
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,740
that shocked the whole capital.

159
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,020
Zuohang Gang?

160
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:33,020
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

161
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,740
My Lord.

162
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,260
Did he confess?

163
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:37,840
No.

164
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,350
(Mu Feng, Reviewer)
He's too stubborn.

165
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,620
We'll go see him.

166
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,380
Fu Yunxi, a treacherous guy like you

167
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,740
stirs up trouble in the Capital!

168
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,540
It's nearly the end of this year.

169
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,620
But you keep the court in turmoil

170
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,980
where everybody feels insecure!

171
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,340
I curse you, brute!

172
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,860
What crime have I committed?

173
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,980
Why did you search my house?

174
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,740
Do the same old thing.

175
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,220
Your father and I are old friends.

176
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,340
How dare you?

177
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,580
Fu Yunxi, you're a brute!

178
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,070
Can you recognize the names

179
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,660
(Huang Lingyun, Consultant)
on this list?

180
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,100
Don't try to scare me!

181
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,700
(Huang Lingyun, Consultant)
For decades,

182
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,940
Pei Dafu had the monopoly and supremacy.

183
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,580
He even founded
the Zuohang Gang in town.

184
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,020
He took a lot of disciples,
got rid of his opponents,

185
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,180
and even tried to rebel.

186
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,060
He killed countless innocent people.

187
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,700
Eunuch Pei killed himself in jail.

188
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,820
Don't think remnants like you

189
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,460
can get away with this.

190
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,700
Pei Dafu embezzled money for years.

191
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,660
His private property
is said to be enormous.

192
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,220
But upon investigating his house,

193
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,660
I found him penniless.

194
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,020
He seemed to be incorruptible.

195
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,260
Where is his private property?

196
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,660
How do I know?

197
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,580
Mr. Huang,

198
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,940
if you help me find his property,

199
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,820
I may help you escape

200
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,740
and stay alive.

201
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,860
You volunteered

202
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,540
to handle the Zuohang Gang case

203
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,700
and killed so many people.

204
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,700
So, you want to keep Pei's property.

205
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,900
Careful with your words.

206
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,700
You colluded with Pei Dafu
and did dirty things.

207
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,700
You should have been utterly tortured.

208
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,740
But today, I did it quick.

209
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,220
Rest in peace.

210
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,020
(I talked to Fu Yunxi briefly.)

211
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,060
(But I feel like)

212
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,420
(he's a complicated man.)

213
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,860
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)

214
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,140
(At this moment,)

215
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,820
(I'm back home in the Capital.)

216
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,140
(But I'm quite uneasy.)

217
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,020
(I don't know if I can)

218
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,500
(have a place here.)

219
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,300
Ms. Zhou, you don't have to rush off.

220
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,580
You know nothing.

221
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,700
Miss Hanyan is the only lineal daughter.

222
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,700
She can't be neglected.

223
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,580
(Zhou Ruyin, Concubine)
But Mr. Yuchi

224
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,820
is your son.

225
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,300
Vice Minister Han will change his mind.

226
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,780
Master is handling that.

227
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,860
A woman like me
can't get a word in edgeways.

228
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,420
Why are you walking so slowly today?

229
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,340
Catch up.

230
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,780
Ms. Zhou, be careful
with the slippery ground.

231
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,740
Hanyan.

232
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,700
How careless the servants are!

233
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,700
It's so cold here.

234
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,740
Ms. Zhou.

235
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,860
Madam, be careful.

236
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,780
Ms. Zhou.

237
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,700
Look.

238
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,980
I'm quite silly.

239
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,380
The first time I saw you,

240
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,940
I made a fool of myself.

241
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,420
I'm not Madam.

242
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,980
I'm Zhou Ruyin,

243
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,820
your father's concubine.

244
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,140
Miss Hanyan, you can call me Ms. Zhou.

245
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,940
I heard you caught a cold.

246
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,380
Don't catch a chill again.

247
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,280
Come on.

248
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,540
Put it on.

249
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,820
You must not catch a chill.

250
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,060
It'll make you warm.

251
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,460
Let's get in and talk.

252
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,420
Ms. Zhou,

253
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,300
I think

254
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,980
I'm just back here

255
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,420
and I should pay respects to my elders.

256
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,980
Can you take me to see them?

257
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,380
Yes, of course.

258
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,860
It's so sweet of you.

259
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,340
Let's go. Come on.

260
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,940
We didn't mean to ignore you.

261
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,500
But everything's in a mess today.

262
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,460
At noon, your brother
and Vice Minister Han's daughter

263
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,580
would get engaged.

264
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,220
Mr. Han has greater power.

265
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,540
The marriage would be more formidable.

266
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,940
Just now, Mr. Han was upset.

267
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,900
Your father is trying hard

268
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,460
to calm him down.

269
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,380
Is it because of me?

270
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,380
Who said that?

271
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,580
I know.

272
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,340
People in town say
I'm the barefoot ghost.

273
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,500
I caused Grandfather's death
when I was born.

274
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,420
My foster parents also died for me.

275
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,700
So...

276
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,620
Don't say that.

277
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,980
The other day,

278
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,260
officers of the Judicial Review

279
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,420
told us about the murder case.

280
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,620
We thought

281
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,700
you were also kidnapped.

282
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,260
Thank goodness,

283
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,820
you managed to escape.

284
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,980
Sorry for the trouble.

285
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,020
Don't say that anymore.

286
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,340
We're going to Yongshou Chamber

287
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,700
where your grandmother lives.

288
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,620
Come on.

289
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,540
(Yongshou Chamber)

290
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,620
It's almost done, right?

291
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,580
This is Safflower Drink
from Physician Wu

292
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,730
of Cisheng Pharmacy.

293
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,380
(Ms. Wei, Hanyan's grandmother)

294
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,300
This is Siwu Decoction from Physician Xu

295
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,220
of Imperial Hospital.

296
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,980
Put more sugar in it tomorrow.

297
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,640
It's really hard to swallow.

298
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,580
Ma'am, you have a nosebleed.

299
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,370
Hurry. Get me the Longevity Pill.

300
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,270
Ma'am, you can't eat more.

301
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,540
You know nothing.

302
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,970
I'm too old.

303
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,320
If I lose vital energy, I'll die.

304
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,270
Go fetch it.

305
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,580
Ma'am, Ms. Zhou is here to see you

306
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,980
with Miss Hanyan.

307
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,260
What's she doing here?

308
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,980
I won't see her. Send her away.

309
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,020
Or she may curse me to death, too.

310
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,620
Tell her I'm sick.

311
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,940
No need.

312
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,460
Not until her father accepts her.

313
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,260
It's stopped snowing. Fold the umbrella.

314
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,700
Come this way.

315
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,060
Why is there a smell of medicine?

316
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,540
Is Grandmother unwell?

317
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,620
Don't worry, Miss Hanyan.

318
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,220
Your grandmother likes the regimen.

319
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,240
Every day,

320
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,700
she takes a dozen kinds
of decoction for mental fitness.

321
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,180
She's healthy and strong.

322
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,780
Glad to know that.

323
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,300
Nanny Sun,

324
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,740
Miss Hanyan is here
to greet her grandmother.

325
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,020
It's bad timing.

326
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,140
She caught a cold today

327
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,740
and didn't feel very well.

328
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,700
Just now, she fell asleep.

329
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,540
How about you come another time?

330
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,100
Miss Hanyan.

331
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,020
Hope Grandmother will get well soon.

332
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,500
I'll come another day.

333
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,220
All right.

334
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,220
(Jianjia Chamber)

335
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,780
So, this is where my mother lives?

336
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,140
Yes.

337
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,780
Jianjia Chamber is where Madam dwells.

338
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,340
Miss Jilan,

339
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,700
Miss Hanyan is here to see Madam.

340
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,660
Nanny Chen.

341
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,580
Anybody in?

342
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,020
Miss Hanyan is back from Danzhou.

343
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,060
She's here to see Madam.

344
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,260
Why is the door locked?

345
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,780
Madam loves to be quiet

346
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,140
and doesn't want to be disturbed.

347
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,460
Hope you'll understand, Miss Hanyan.

348
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,340
Nanny Chen, Miss Hanyan is here.

349
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,220
Nanny Chen, all these years,

350
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,000
I didn't take care of Mother.

351
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,700
Today, I'm back home.

352
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,020
I'm here to see Mother. Please...

353
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,100
Madam is resting.

354
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,660
- She won't see you.
- Someone,

355
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,610
get Miss Yushan back.

356
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,290
Mom. Mom, save me!

357
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,180
- Yushan.
- Miss.

358
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,820
- Let me go back!
- You're grounded.

359
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,220
- Yushan.
- Don't make a scene.

360
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,540
Mom, take care of my horse!

361
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,340
Don't let anybody mistreat it!

362
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,700
Hanyan, it's been an absolute uproar.

363
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,420
Madam must be tired.

364
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,660
Who was shouting in there?

365
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,220
Your second sister Yushan.

366
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,260
The horse she's been raising

367
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,980
scared Madam.

368
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,340
Madam then grounded her
in Jianjia Chamber

369
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,380
where she could reflect.

370
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,860
What she just said makes no sense.

371
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,820
Madam is doing this for her own good.

372
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,280
You can't always

373
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,340
live in the minor chamber.

374
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,300
You can move in with me.

375
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,740
What do you say?

376
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,620
I don't want to disturb you.

377
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,420
You won't.

378
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,780
(Jianjia Chamber)

379
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,700
Miss Hanyan?

380
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,700
Come this way.

381
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:01,620
(Jianjia Chamber)

382
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,260
Miss,

383
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,820
have some pastries.

384
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,430
I hear mung bean cakes are often served.

385
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,370
It's something for us servants.

386
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,140
Miss, try the Cyan Delicacy.

387
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,020
It's made of fresh bamboo juice and flour.

388
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,220
It has a refreshing taste.

389
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,020
Do you not like it?

390
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,060
You're Shuhong?

391
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,580
Yes.

392
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,860
I used to serve in the forecourt.

393
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,460
When Master heard you were back,

394
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,340
he asked me to take care of you.

395
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,620
Miss Hanyan grew up in Danzhou.

396
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,380
But she's the only lineal daughter.

397
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,300
So, she must have the best things

398
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,020
in all aspects of life.

399
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,660
We mustn't treat her unfairly or coldly.

400
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,860
But our chamber

401
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,060
doesn't usually have a lot.

402
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,020
So, your salaries for this month

403
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,020
will have to be delayed.

404
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,540
Please understand.

405
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,540
Ms. Zhou, nobody likes Miss Hanyan.

406
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,460
Why did you get her back

407
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,380
in our chamber?

408
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,220
Lang, don't be presumptuous.

409
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,500
Am I wrong?

410
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,300
Ms. Zhou, look at her.

411
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,780
For the sake of your kindness,

412
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,940
she's going too far.

413
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,100
Come on.

414
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,860
You're my maids.

415
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,020
But we're all women.

416
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,420
Life is hard for women.

417
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,020
Let's not be harsh to each other.

418
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,860
Lang, restrain yourself.

419
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,220
Don't say stuff like that.

420
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,140
Remember?

421
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,620
Yes.

422
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:10,780
Ms. Zhou, bad news.

423
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,900
Mr. Yuchi made a scene there.

424
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,100
What happened?

425
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,580
Mr. Han gave Mr. Yuchi a hard time.

426
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,880
And Mr. Yuchi drank some wine.

427
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,260
So, he cursed Mr. Han.

428
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,220
Mr. Han left angrily.

429
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,940
Master is going to his home to apologize.

430
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,580
Oh, what a son.

431
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,780
Let's go have a look.

432
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:39,100
I heard something. What happened?

433
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,060
Because of you, Miss Hanyan,

434
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,460
there's too much trouble

435
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,260
in this residence today.

436
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,820
Sorry for the trouble, sisters.

437
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,220
Don't say that.

438
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,780
You're the master while we're maids.

439
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,660
Don't call us sisters.

440
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,540
Also, it's not Danzhou.

441
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,340
If it gets out...

442
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,260
Shuhong,

443
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,700
according to family rules,

444
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,020
how will a servant be punished
for her indiscretion?

445
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,260
Miss Hanyan,

446
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,820
she should be slapped

447
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,380
for her indiscretion.

448
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,500
What?

449
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,900
Want to slap me?

450
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,140
Mom.

451
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,980
Mom.

452
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,980
(Zhuang Yuchi, the fourth kid)

453
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,980
Mr. Yuchi,

454
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,900
Ms. Zhou went out for you just now.

455
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,780
This is Miss Hanyan.

456
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,980
So, you're the barefoot ghost.

457
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:40,420
I...

458
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,340
Mr. Yuchi, she's a noble lady.

459
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,660
Now, she lives in our chamber.

460
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,940
Your room is the biggest.

461
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,260
It's hers, now.

462
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,420
Get out of here!

463
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,540
You ruined my engagement,
disgraced my family,

464
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,980
and took away my room!

465
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,260
Who allowed that?

466
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,220
You're Father's only lineal daughter

467
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,380
and I'm Father's only son!

468
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,980
Get out! Get out of my family!

469
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,380
You know what?

470
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,260
So many people in the Capital

471
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,260
say you caused your grandfather's death

472
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,860
and your foster parents died for you.

473
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,140
Then, you came back here.

474
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,620
Vice Minister Han thinks you're a jinx.

475
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,020
Look at our servants.

476
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,260
They don't dare to come in
unless they're brave enough.

477
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,380
Because of you,
Father had to bow for peace.

478
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,100
Nobody can live a good life here.

479
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,220
Tell me.

480
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,100
Who in this family can tolerate you?

481
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:52,980
Say something!

482
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,100
It's my fault.

483
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,020
You lost the girl
who's too good for you.

484
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,780
Miss.

485
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,860
You ruined my engagement and future.

486
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,100
And you even mocked me.

487
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,820
You think I don't dare to hit you?

488
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,100
Hitting me won't satisfy you.

489
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,260
You think I don't dare?

490
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,620
Even if

491
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,380
you killed me tonight,

492
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,260
Mr. Han still wouldn't accept you

493
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,140
as his son-in-law who'd live with him.

494
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,100
It won't happen, Yuchi.

495
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,780
How dare you?

496
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,700
I'll kill you, ghost!

497
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,500
- Mr. Yuchi.
- Let me go!

498
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,050
Get out of this family!

499
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,100
- Calm down.
- Let me go!

500
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,540
- Stop him!
- I won't let you go!

501
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,460
Mr. Yuchi.

502
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,180
- Let me go!
- Stop him!

503
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,700
What are you doing?

504
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,660
Mom.

505
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,220
It's all my fault

506
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,340
to have spoiled Yuchi.

507
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,980
When Master is back from Mr. Han's home,

508
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,500
I'll tell him honestly.

509
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,100
Master will punish him.

510
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,740
Ms. Zhou, how long have you been here?

511
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,740
For quite a lot of years.

512
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,660
Master

513
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,220
had married me

514
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,460
before he married your mother.

515
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,420
So, you should know very well

516
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,940
about the whole family.

517
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,660
What do you mean?

518
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,340
All these things you did today

519
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,020
makes me wonder if you're new here.

520
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,060
I failed to take good care of you.

521
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,620
Sorry for what you suffered.

522
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,540
My maid told me

523
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,940
Mr. Fu married my eldest sister.

524
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,500
Yes.

525
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,260
Her name is Yuqin.

526
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,940
She's my daughter.

527
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,380
She's been dead for many years.

528
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,060
How did she pass away?

529
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,980
What's gone is gone.

530
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,460
Let's not bring it up.

531
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,300
Master doesn't allow us
to talk about her.

532
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,700
Miss Hanyan, get some rest.

533
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,020
If you want to talk,

534
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,740
we'll talk another time.

535
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,300
I'll leave you alone.

536
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,540
See you, Ms. Zhou.

537
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,900
Miss, the decoction is ready.

538
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,820
Please drink it

539
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,980
while it's warm.

540
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,340
Go get a food box

541
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,540
and pack the decoction.

542
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,700
Yes.

543
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,460
Miss Hanyan.

544
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,940
Why is she here again?

545
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,260
Earlier today, I heard
Grandmother caught a cold.

546
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,220
I made some decoction

547
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,140
and brought it to her.

548
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,940
Ma'am... She's asleep.

549
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,340
Give it to me.

550
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,780
Thank you, Miss Hanyan.

551
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,860
I saw the candles in the hall.

552
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,460
So, I thought Grandmother was still up.

553
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,900
Who's that?

554
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,140
Somebody!

555
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,500
Assassin! Catch him!

556
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,980
Somebody!

557
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,180
Grandmother. Help, Grandmother.

558
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,460
What's happening?

559
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,660
Grandmother, run.

560
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,580
Catch the assassin!

561
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,820
Intruder!

562
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,740
Come on.

563
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:13,620
Ma'am.

564
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,540
Don't try to run away.

565
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:15,820
- Ma'am.
- Hurry.

566
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,680
He's over there.

567
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,540
Somebody!

568
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,380
Go get a physician!

569
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,660
Ma'am has fainted!

570
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,140
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

571
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,580
(Seclusion)

572
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,420
Yunxi, you must be busy.

573
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,420
What are you doing here so late?

574
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,820
The murder case in Danzhou
was bothering me.

575
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,860
So, I came to see Miss Hanyan.

576
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,300
Unexpectedly, she was assassinated.

577
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,420
Thanks for your concern, Mr. Fu.

578
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,860
Do you think

579
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,100
Zhuang Yuchi sent that assassin

580
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,100
to kill you?

581
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,500
Yunxi, there must be
some misunderstanding.

582
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,140
This is really fishy.

583
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,620
Yuchi hates me for ruining his marriage.

584
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,100
But we're related by blood.

585
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,940
He wouldn't be that cruel.

586
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,420
You're just back here.

587
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,420
How do you know he wouldn't?

588
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,580
I'm just guessing.

589
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,660
Let go.

590
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,980
I said, let go!

591
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,100
Yuchi.

592
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,660
She's the barefoot ghost.

593
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,700
The assassin aimed at her.

594
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,260
It's none of my business.

595
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,180
Yuchi.

596
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,780
What? Want to interrogate me?

597
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,260
What crime did I commit?

598
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,980
During the dispute
between Miss Hanyan and Zhuang Yuchi,

599
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,580
did he say

600
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,020
he would kill Miss Hanyan?

601
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,940
If you lie,

602
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,100
you'll be punished, too.

603
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,860
I did say that.

604
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,420
So what?

605
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,420
Yunxi, a young man's angry words

606
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,780
can't be taken seriously.

607
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,940
Mom.

608
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,940
Shut up.

609
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,300
Then why would a young man

610
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,060
want to kill his sister?

611
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,860
Tell me

612
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,820
how they quarreled.

613
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,620
Mr. Yuchi cursed Miss Hanyan,

614
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,220
pushed her into the icy pool,

615
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,940
and threatened to hit her.

616
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,380
Miss Hanyan said,
"Hitting me won't satisfy you."

617
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,260
Then Mr. Yuchi claimed

618
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,660
that he would kill her.

619
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,420
That's right.

620
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,940
I was wrong, too.

621
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,700
I shouldn't have annoyed Yuchi.

622
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,060
Did that assassin

623
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,100
only try to hurt Miss Hanyan?

624
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,500
Indeed.

625
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,940
Ms. Zhou, this is fishy.

626
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,860
But Yuchi is actually suspicious.

627
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,540
I have to take him back

628
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,500
for an interrogation.

629
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,060
Fu Yunxi, why can you arrest me?

630
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,140
Yunxi, please wait.

631
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,580
Nobody is in charge now.

632
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,300
I sent a servant to get Master back.

633
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,380
Don't do anything
before he's back, all right?

634
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,660
Who said nobody was in charge?

635
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,020
(Ruan Xiwen, Hanyan's mother)

636
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,300
(Nanny Chen)
Zhuang Hanyan broke a family rule

637
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,780
(Jilan, Maid)
and caused trouble.

638
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,140
Take her to the ancestral hall

639
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,740
and flog her 30 times.

640
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,140
(I've never thought)

641
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,100
(I would meet Mother for the first time)

642
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,780
(under such circumstances.)

643
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,500
(Harmonious Family)
(I had thought)

644
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,420
(she would support and protect me.)

645
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,540
(Sadly...)

646
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,180
Start.

647
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,260
Mother,

648
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,820
what rule did I break?

649
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,540
Even if I have to die,

650
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,020
I must know the reason.

651
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,180
Miss Hanyan,

652
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,420
this is a family business.

653
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,220
Whatever the truth is,

654
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,500
Master and Madam will judge.

655
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,140
Why did you report it
to the Court of Judicial Review?

656
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,140
Are your seniors too muddle-headed

657
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,060
to tell right from wrong?

658
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,740
Can nobody do you justice?

659
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,220
Or do you want everybody in the Capital

660
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,460
to laugh at your family?

661
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,740
Be perceptive, Mother.

662
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,260
That's not what I mean.

663
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,660
I didn't get Mr. Fu here.

664
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,780
Flog her!

665
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,060
(Harmonious Family)

666
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,180
Mother, it's my fault.

667
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,260
I beg you.

668
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,340
Mother.

669
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,780
Wait, wait!

670
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,780
Stop it!

671
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,620
Wait.

672
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,500
Stop it. Stop.

673
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,380
Madam, please rethink it.

674
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,900
Miss Hanyan came back home
after all this trouble.

675
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,260
She used to be weak

676
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,580
and caught a cold.

677
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,660
She can't stand the flogging.

678
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,940
The two of you

679
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,820
look like sweet mother and daughter.

680
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:21,940
I dare not.

681
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,060
Miss Hanyan is your daughter.

682
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,180
Even if she's wrong,

683
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,060
please don't punish her

684
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,340
until she gets better.

685
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,420
Ms. Zhou, do you know
what you're doing wrong?

686
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,260
I...

687
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,860
Madam is in charge.

688
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,900
I shouldn't have interrupted.

689
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,580
A knowing action makes you more guilty.

690
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,500
Do you understand?

691
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,140
I was wrong.

692
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,700
You did the right thing, Madam.

693
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,620
It's my fault.

694
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,980
You did the right thing.

695
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,620
I was wrong.

696
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,940
I'm sorry.

697
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,940
Mom!

698
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,980
Stop it, Mom!

699
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,020
Mom.

700
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,660
Stop slapping yourself.

701
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,580
Yushan.

702
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,740
Instead of reflecting
in Jianjia Chamber,

703
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,380
what are you doing here?

704
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,700
Madam,

705
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,820
what wrong did my mom do?

706
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,150
(Zhuang Yushan, the second kid)
Why did you humiliate her?

707
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,100
Say no more. Go back.

708
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,620
I'm not going back.

709
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,340
You've grounded me for so long

710
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,620
and won't release me.

711
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,500
You just dislike the two of us

712
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,780
and try to crack the whip!

713
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,180
Yushan.

714
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,740
Madam was merciful enough

715
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,580
when she didn't

716
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,940
sell your horse.

717
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,340
Instead of correcting yourself,

718
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,020
you're being brusque with her.

719
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,220
Miss Yushan,

720
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,220
you deserve this.

721
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,860
Who allowed you to stop?

722
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,980
Why?

723
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,780
What's going on here?

724
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,260
Why are you flogging her?

725
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,820
Grandmother.

726
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,060
Grandmother.

727
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,660
Nanny Chen slapped us for no reason.

728
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,300
Look. My mom's face is swollen.

729
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,580
Why did you get me here?

730
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,380
I can't interfere.

731
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,420
Ma'am,

732
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,420
Ms. Zhou and Miss Yushan
contradicted Madam.

733
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,260
That's why they were punished.

734
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,900
This is family trouble.

735
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,620
I'm taking care of it.

736
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,740
Do you have a problem, Mother?

737
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,380
No, no.

738
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,740
I just hope you won't go too far.

739
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,540
Don't get anyone killed.

740
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,500
- Ma'am.
- Grandmother.

741
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,020
I'm fine.

742
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,180
Just now, I freaked out.

743
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,020
I'm still dizzy now.

744
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,860
Get me back for some rest.

745
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,420
Grandmother.

746
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,060
Let's go and see if my son is back.

747
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,500
It's all your fault.

748
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,100
You're the barefoot ghost!

749
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,580
When you're back, you cause trouble.

750
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,260
Why did you come back?

751
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,740
Yushan, are you insane?

752
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,020
Don't be ridiculous.

753
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,060
Zhou Ruyin,

754
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,820
look at your daughter.

755
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,420
Before I'm dead,

756
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,980
she wants to take my place.

757
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,500
I'm sorry, Madam.

758
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,180
It's all my fault.

759
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,980
Miss Hanyan,

760
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,940
if you're greedy
for wealth or glory in the Capital,

761
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,380
take a good look around.

762
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,300
See if you can bear the life

763
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,740
in this big family.

764
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,100
It's not that I want wealth or glory.

765
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,980
Zhuang Yushan is presumptuous.

766
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,300
But she's right about one thing.

767
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,100
You shouldn't have come back.

768
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,180
Mother.

769
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,020
Nanny Chen,

770
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,100
I don't have this daughter.

771
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,300
Since we've punished her,

772
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,140
expel her now.

773
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,300
She must not come back again.

774
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,940
What are you waiting for?

775
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,020
Drag her out!

776
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,300
Mother.

777
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,300
Mother, I...

778
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,100
Mother!

779
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,140
