00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:41,220
=The Glory=

2
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,190
Hanyan.

3
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,560
Good girl.

4
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,520
Child.

5
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,430
Child, you're awake.

6
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,960
You're finally awake.

7
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,550
Slowly, slowly.

8
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,110
Father.

9
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,400
Hanyan.

10
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,760
Grandmother.

11
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,120
Where am I?

12
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,240
Child, it's okay now.

13
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,920
It's all over now.

14
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,270
Thanks to our ancestors' grace.

15
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,590
Thanks to you, my good child,

16
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,750
our family survived.

17
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,680
You've been unconscious
with a high fever for days.

18
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,920
You scared us all.

19
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,360
Where is Mother?

20
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,960
Your mother is fine.

21
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,400
She discovered the secret passage
in the house

22
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,150
but didn't trust me.

23
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,470
She thought I was Pei's adopted son

24
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,480
and caused this trouble.

25
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,710
Luckily, Mr. Yan saw through everything
at the last moment

26
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,180
and stopped the Supervision
from executing before reporting.

27
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,740
That's how I cleared my name.

28
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,060
Given that your mother,
though reckless in her actions,

29
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,580
didn't make any major mistakes,

30
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,660
she was given a slight reprimand

31
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,340
and wasn't sentenced.

32
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,420
The Judicial Review
has changed the verdict.

33
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,780
What about Mr. Yuwen?

34
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,340
I have old grievances with Mr. Yuwen,

35
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,500
but they're in the past.

36
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,140
We'll sort them out in the future.

37
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,380
After all, there's plenty of time.

38
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,020
You just focus on recuperating.

39
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,660
Your health is the top priority now.

40
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,820
Now, Zhuang Hanyan,
as the lineal daughter,

41
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,800
has quelled the internal strife
at the guild hall

42
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,820
and carried a corpse to save her family
on the execution ground.

43
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,460
This is well-known in the Capital.

44
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,060
Everyone says that daughters
should be like you.

45
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,540
Not only that.

46
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,580
Some people say

47
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,380
that wives should be like you.

48
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,340
Yes.

49
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,540
What are you doing?

50
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,900
I want to see Mother.

51
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,420
You silly girl.

52
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,290
Slow down.

53
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,580
Madam.

54
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,020
Eat something.

55
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,700
It's been heated several times.

56
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,740
Madam.

57
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,580
Let her go.

58
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,860
I don't want to see her.

59
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,060
Miss Hanyan,

60
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,300
you should go back and rest.

61
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,180
The madam also needs to rest.

62
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,060
Mother.

63
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,820
You've had your way.

64
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,900
Why do you keep pestering me?

65
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,340
You crippled my legs

66
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,780
and ruined my plans.

67
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,140
You're doomed to harm me

68
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,140
and ruin my life.

69
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,780
Get lost.

70
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,340
Even if you hate me,

71
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,660
I will never regret it.

72
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,180
Get lost!

73
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,740
Get lost!

74
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,700
Miss Hanyan.

75
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,980
Miss Hanyan, hurry and leave.

76
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,420
(Flying Swan on Snow)
Miss Hanyan.

77
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,380
Just leave.

78
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,860
Miss Hanyan.

79
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,260
Don't fixate on this.

80
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,780
What exactly do you want?

81
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,020
I just want her to tell me the truth.

82
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,060
Come back. Come back.

83
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,660
What are you doing? Let me go.

84
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,620
Miss Hanyan.

85
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,620
As you two have reached this point,

86
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,780
I really can't bear it.

87
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,100
Since the madam refuses to tell you,

88
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,180
I'll take the liberty

89
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,420
and tell you the truth

90
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,540
that you want to know.

91
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,500
Years ago,

92
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,620
when your mother married your father,

93
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,780
they had several years

94
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,260
of peaceful life together.

95
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,260
=Episode 14=

96
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,060
(Peace and Leisure)

97
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,340
(17 years ago)
My wife's belly is pointed.

98
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,900
They say it'll be a boy.

99
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,100
Physician, what do you think?

100
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,700
The pulse is steady,
and the fetal heartbeat is strong.

101
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,820
Perhaps it's time to congratulate you

102
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,460
on having a son.

103
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,300
So, it really is a boy.

104
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,500
That's wonderful.

105
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,980
Our family will have an heir.

106
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,220
Mothers and daughters are born close.

107
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,060
I hope it's a daughter.

108
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,140
Oh, no. Something's wrong.

109
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,660
The old master has fainted.

110
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,580
(Yongshou Chamber)

111
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,460
Your father's illness is serious.

112
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,580
Physician, please try
everything you can.

113
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,820
Your father has always been healthy.

114
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,500
How could he suddenly fall ill?

115
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,300
Could it be something supernatural?

116
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,940
Go and find out

117
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,880
who the most famous Taoist master
in the Capital is now.

118
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,020
Yes, Ms. Zhou.

119
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,220
May I ask if there have been
any strangers

120
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,840
(Seclusion, Zhuang Residence)
in the house in the past half year?

121
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,920
Such as new servants

122
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,540
or babies?

123
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,660
My wife is about to give birth.

124
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,860
The house is filled with dark energy.

125
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,140
The unborn little master

126
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,500
might've been possessed
by a barefoot ghost.

127
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,220
By then, the little master
and his father's lives

128
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,900
will be at risk.

129
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,380
How can we break this curse?

130
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,980
When the madam gives birth,

131
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,500
the barefoot ghost will arrive.

132
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,420
You must strike the baby's feet
with peach wood

133
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,460
to drive the evil spirit away.

134
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,260
If so, my son will die.

135
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,260
This won't do.

136
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,660
Is there no other way

137
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,980
to save my father's life?

138
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,260
Harder.

139
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,300
Harder.

140
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,100
One more basin of water.

141
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,540
How is this so coincidental?

142
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,420
It has to be a boy.

143
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,780
Harder.

144
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Madam, harder.

145
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,220
Only a lineal son can bring

146
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,820
- some hope.
- Harder.

147
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,240
The evil spirit is hard to deal with.

148
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,820
Only the method I told you

149
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,980
can break it.

150
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,660
Master, please decide.

151
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,620
Madam,

152
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,420
these silly physicians

153
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,340
are wrong.

154
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,980
It's a daughter.

155
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,020
A daughter is good.

156
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,560
You were born in the cold winter,

157
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,980
so we'll name you Hanyan,

158
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,260
hoping that you won't fear the cold

159
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,500
and that you'll have a proud spirit,

160
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,580
flying high in the sky.

161
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,500
Nanny Chen, what's wrong?

162
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,140
Madam,

163
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,820
you nearly had a dystocia just now,

164
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,860
so I didn't dare tell you.

165
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,860
There's a Taoist priest

166
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,820
in Yongshou Chamber.

167
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,500
The madam has given birth to a daughter.

168
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,700
It's a daughter?

169
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,660
Yes.

170
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,580
A daughter?

171
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,140
Are you sure?

172
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,300
Is it really not a son?

173
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,500
Absolutely not.

174
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,260
The old master

175
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,940
has gone to the heavens.

176
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,060
Everyone, please mourn.

177
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,260
Master...

178
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,220
- Master...
- Father...

179
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,380
Master...

180
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,340
- Master...
- Father...

181
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,940
The evil spirit is cruel.

182
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,140
Killing the old master
is just the beginning.

183
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,460
If we don't remove this barefoot ghost,

184
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,860
the house will be in danger,

185
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,620
and the madam

186
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,860
and her daughter just born

187
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,220
will also be at risk.

188
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,860
This...

189
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,740
Where is that barking Taoist priest?

190
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,900
Let me kill him.

191
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,260
Madam, Madam!

192
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,420
Madam!

193
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,380
You've just given birth.

194
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,820
Please don't act impulsively.

195
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,100
Madam,

196
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,300
someone must've secretly resented you

197
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,660
and set up such a deadly trap early on.

198
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,540
Zhou Ruyin.

199
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,980
Nanny Chen, hurry.

200
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,540
Move aside.

201
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,900
Madam, the doors have been locked tight.

202
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,180
The master is waiting for you
in Jianjia Chamber.

203
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,700
Mother.

204
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,700
Mother.

205
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,140
Mother, please.

206
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,220
Please save my poor child.

207
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,020
She's your granddaughter.

208
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,740
- Please plead for her.
- Bodhisattva, help us.

209
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,420
- Mother, please.
- Bodhisattva, help us.

210
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,480
- Open the door, Mother.
- Bodhisattva, help us.

211
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,220
- Please save her.
- Bodhisattva, help us.

212
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,180
I'm willing to be vegetarian for life

213
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,460
and transcribe
and chant sutras every day

214
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,900
to pray for you.

215
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,100
Please save her.

216
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,740
Mother, open the door.

217
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,860
I beg you.

218
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,340
(Gongtong Chamber)

219
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,340
Zhou Ruyin.

220
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,060
Zhou Ruyin, I beg you.

221
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,180
I beg you to save my child.

222
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,220
Zhou Ruyin.

223
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,580
Zhou Ruyin, open the door.

224
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,980
I beg you to save my child.

225
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,180
From now on,

226
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,020
I will serve you for the rest of my life

227
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,220
as your servant

228
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,380
without complaint.

229
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,220
Zhou Ruyin, open the door.

230
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,860
You like my jewelry box, right?

231
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,820
You can take it.

232
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,940
You can take

233
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,000
whatever you want

234
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,700
from me.

235
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,730
I just want my child to live, okay?

236
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,440
- The child is innocent.
- Don't be afraid.

237
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,540
- You're also a mother.
- Don't be afraid.

238
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,740
Can't you save

239
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,260
an infant?

240
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,300
Zhou Ruyin.

241
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,860
I'll kowtow to you.

242
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,940
Zhou Ruyin, I'll kowtow to you.

243
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,180
Zhou Ruyin.

244
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,740
Zhou Ruyin,

245
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,340
please save my child.

246
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,300
Madam!

247
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,980
Barefoot ghost, show yourself.

248
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,060
Zhuang Shiyang,

249
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,420
for the sake of our marriage,

250
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,500
let me and my daughter have a way out.

251
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,460
I swear I will leave with her,

252
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,260
never to set foot in the house again.

253
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,220
Xiwen,

254
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,180
the Taoist master is driving away evil.

255
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,140
He's doing this
to save the child's life.

256
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,940
Hand her over.

257
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,100
She has just been born.

258
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,260
Have you considered the consequences

259
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,060
of using that peach wood stick on her?

260
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,420
She's also your daughter.

261
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,540
I beg you.

262
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,300
I know she is our daughter.

263
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,580
I would never harm her.

264
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,780
Please trust me.

265
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,340
You filthy Taoist.

266
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,740
On what grounds do you say
my daughter is a barefoot ghost?

267
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,020
Tell me.

268
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,940
You mortals can't see

269
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,960
the evil black energy

270
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,580
swirling around Jianjia Chamber,

271
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,100
but I can see it clearly.

272
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,740
But I heard

273
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,020
that when you arrived,

274
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,340
you said the evil spirit
was a young master.

275
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,900
It doesn't matter
if it's a boy or a girl.

276
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,460
You couldn't even tell the gender

277
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,100
through the belly,

278
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,660
and now you dare to swindle us,

279
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,980
saying you can tell it's a ghost?

280
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,740
What a joke.

281
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,700
Mr. Zhuang,

282
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,060
your wife has lost her sanity
because of the barefoot ghost.

283
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,060
I must offend her now.

284
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,940
Be careful.

285
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,460
Don't harm my wife and daughter.

286
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,420
Listen up.

287
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,700
Someone here is indeed possessed
by an evil spirit,

288
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,260
but it's not this little girl.

289
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,260
It's me,

290
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,780
Ruan Xiwen.

291
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,020
The evil energy in Jianjia Chamber
is from me.

292
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,580
I am the one who killed the old master.

293
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,980
Everything happened because of me.

294
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,940
This evil spirit forces me,
tortures me, harms me,

295
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,300
wants to take my daughter's life,

296
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,980
wants to take my body,

297
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,940
and wants to turn me
into an evil spirit.

298
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,420
Xiwen,

299
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,060
in the future,

300
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,780
we will have more kids.

301
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,420
I will compensate you doubly.

302
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,540
Today,

303
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,300
please help us through this crisis.

304
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,100
Your biggest calamity

305
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,620
is me, Ruan Xiwen.

306
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,260
This evil spirit is hiding in my body.

307
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,660
It's making my head spin.

308
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,100
It's making me lose all sanity.

309
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,860
Filthy Taoist,

310
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,380
if you truly can exorcise demons,

311
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,700
then act quickly.

312
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,660
Xiwen!

313
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,860
Mr. Zhuang, we can't delay any longer.

314
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,380
Do it!

315
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,780

♪I seem to see you in my dreams♪

378
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,220
Why did you come back?

379
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,900
I've been in this endless hell,

380
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,660
dragging my broken body,

381
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,340
tormenting myself for years.

382
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,140
Why did you come back
and repeat the same mistakes?

383
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,300
Why, Hanyan?

384
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,940
It's all Zhou Ruyin's fault.

385
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,180
She's just a saber.

386
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,300
The true wielder of the saber

387
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,420
is the real criminal.

388
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,780
Are you referring

389
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,460
to Father?

390
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,740
My maiden family was ruined overnight

391
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,740
precisely when I was about

392
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,340
to marry Yuwen Chang'an.

393
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,220
You were framed as a barefoot ghost

394
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,940
precisely when your grandfather
fell ill.

395
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,740
Do you think these events
are coincidences?

396
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,380
What I did before was for you,

397
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,980
for me, and for my maiden family,
which was annihilated.

398
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,980
I wanted Zhuang Shiyang
to pay with his life.

399
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,500
I hid my hatred

400
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,420
and lurked here for years

401
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,380
waiting for Pei Dafu's death

402
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,140
so he'd lose his support.

403
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,740
Even if he was most skilled at escaping,

404
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,260
if I exposed his crimes
in front of everyone

405
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,580
at the Yinan Guild Hall,

406
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,660
I could've taken him down
once and for all.

407
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,820
He is

408
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,500
behind Grandfather's death

409
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,660
and the Ruan family's calamity?

410
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,420
He...

411
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,460
He would never admit it,

412
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,740
but it was all his scheming.

413
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,740
Even if all these disasters

414
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,740
were secretly orchestrated by Father,

415
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,980
it is not worth

416
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,020
sacrificing your life

417
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,500
and dying with an evil man.

418
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,820
You and I have endured

419
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,580
the pain of separation

420
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,260
and being mutilated.

421
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,620
From now on,

422
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,820
we must live well, right?

423
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,060
Hanyan, I can't do it.

424
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,740
In this life, I have no other hopes

425
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,700
except for this single obsession

426
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,140
that has kept me alive until now.

427
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,300
Do you understand?

428
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,140
I may never have another chance.

429
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,220
Never again.

430
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,860
I understand.

431
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,020
I understand.

432
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,100
Mother,

433
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,900
I don't want you to let go
of your hatred,

434
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,700
but if you live this life
only for hatred

435
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,220
and that evil man,

436
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,340
isn't that also a kind
of foolish self-torment?

437
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,620
Please promise me.

438
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,660
Abandon the desire for death.

439

(Court of Judicial Review)
Miss Zhuang Hanyan,

464
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,540
the body you took
to the execution ground

465
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,180
is indeed that of Wu Youzhi,
Duke Shunping.

466
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,820
This man has been castrated,

467
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,580
there is a secret passage
in his old house,

468
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,220
and he also came from Yinan.

469
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,540
Currently,

470
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,420
he is the prime suspect

471
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,740
of Pei's adopted son.

472
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,340
I believe

473
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,260
the Judicial Review will be fair

474
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,700
and restore my father's innocence.

475
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,100
Relax.

476
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,140
Yuwen Chang'an handled
the adopted son's case hastily,

477
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,420
and it infuriated the Palace.

478
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,980
Now, the Emperor has sent the case

479
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,100
back to the Judicial Review
for a thorough investigation.

480
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,260
Your father has regained his innocence.

481
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:11,940
However, though Wu Youzhi

482
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,600
is a suspect,

483
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,940
he is still an imperial relative,

484
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,120
and he can't die without a reason.

485
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,860
I've invited you here today
for questions.

486
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,060
Wu Youzhi has been missing
for some time.

487
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,420
Where did his body

488
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,340
come from?

489
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,580
When the coroner examined the body,

490
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,700
they found marks

491
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,540
of Judicial Review torture instruments.

492
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,140
Mr. Fu also admitted

493
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,380
that when the case was investigated,

494
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,340
Wu Youzhi was brought
to Judicial Review for torture.

495
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,060
When I was looking for Wu Youzhi,

496
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,790
I was once abducted by a villain

497
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,380
and locked in a house
on the outskirts of the Capital.

498
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,380
The villain intended to silence me,

499
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,500
so he buried me alive with a corpse.

500
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,100
Later, I miraculously escaped

501
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,380
and accidentally discovered
that the corpse

502
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,660
was that of Wu Youzhi.

503
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,300
Who was the villain?

504
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,100
I was so frightened at the time

505
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,300
that I couldn't see his face.

506
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,780
I know the way.

507
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,500
Mr. Fu, no need to escort me.

508
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,460
I'm just afraid
that if a villain comes again,

509
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,100
Miss Hanyan,

510
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,260
not every time can you escape by luck.

511
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,140
Now, we both hold

512
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,700
each other's secrets.

513
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,460
I only hope that, in the future,

514
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,060
we can live in peace,

515
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,780
or else,

516
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,820
I might one day recall

517
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,980
the face of the murderer
who killed Duke Shunping.

518
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,620
In that case,

519
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,700
I owe you one

520
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,180
for keeping this secret.

521
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,980
I know your methods.

522
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,780
Just don't go against me again,

523
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,420
and I'll keep quiet.

524
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,100
Father, why are you here?

525
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,500
I'm here to take you home for dinner.

526
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,640
Mr. Fu, would you like to come?

527
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,500
Mr. Zhuang, congrats on escaping
another calamity.

528
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,540
The adopted son case
is still unresolved.

529

The Judicial Review is busy.

530
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,460
I'm afraid I have no time to visit.

531
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,020
Then I'll leave you to it.

532
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,500
Mr. Fu, I hope you can soon expose

533
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,180
this villainous adopted son of Pei Dafu,

534
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,840
or the Capital will never have peace.

535
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,620
I will.

536
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,840

what exactly is the story
behind the adopted son

547
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,510
you mentioned in prison?

548
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,080
Adopted son?

549
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,060
When did I ever mention an adopted son?

550
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,300
You said

551
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,860
you had a reason.

552
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,860
You have no power or influence,

553
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,140

with the Pei faction
to protect our family.

555
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,620
Ancestors above,

556
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,260
our family has always been innocent.

557
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,540
How could I have any dealings
with the Pei faction?

558
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,380
You can't speak nonsense.

00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,780
If you have a reason,

561
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,980
you can tell me openly.

562
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,540
I'll find a way

563
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,980
to help you with your troubles.

564
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,140
Hanyan,

565
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,500
offer your incense to your grandfather

566
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,060
and tell your grandfather

567
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,660
you've grown up.

568
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,580
You are

569
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,980
the most accomplished child
of our family.

570
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,900
(Spirit Tablet of Zhuang Hanliang)

571
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,180
Father, you're right.

572
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,100
The future of our family

573
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,700
is the most important.

574
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,500
Since you

575
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,180
recognize my ability,

576
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,420
please let me take charge
of the household

577
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,980
to relieve you of your burdens.

578
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,780
You've been in Danzhou for many years

579
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,420
and have not undergone
the hair pinning ceremony,

580
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,300
which is against the rituals.

581
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,540
Then please, Father,

582
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,380
hold the hair pinning ceremony for me,

583
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,700
and then let me take charge.

584
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,000
Recently, the Hanlin Academy
has had a major task to handle.

585
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:00,980
I'm afraid

586
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,940
I may not be able to spare a moment.

587
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,460
What major task?

588
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,500
A Western scholar

589
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,380
has come across the seas

590
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,660
to exchange knowledge with us

591
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,340
so we can learn from each other.

592
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,060
The Hanlin Academy is in charge of this,

593
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,980
and I've been appointed
to attend to him.

594
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,900
Together with my colleagues,

595
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,380
I will compile

596
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,340
this scholar's lifetime of learning

597
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,660
into the Comprehensive Encyclopedia.

598
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,540
As for the hair pinning ceremony,

599
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,260
- I think...
- Since you're busy,

600
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,540
let Mother

601
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,780
handle the ceremony.

602
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,340
Good.

603
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,780
Very good.

604
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,500
I'll leave it to your mother.

605
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,140
Thank you, Father.

This auspicious day is chosen
to invite guests

613
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,500
for her hair pinning ceremony.

614
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,580
First, bow.

615
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,020
Second, wear hairpins.

616
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,060
Third, wear a robe.

617
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,700
The hair pinning ceremony is complete.

618
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,380
Today, I will

619
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:07,020
let you take charge of the family.

620
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,500
I hope that you will follow
the right path,

621
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,820
be kind and virtuous,
and live a peaceful life.

622
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,300
Though dull, I'll remember this.

623
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,820
Madam,

624
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,420
someone from the Palace has come.

625
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,180
They say they bring
a congratulatory gift

626
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,980
from Noble Consort Miao for Miss Hanyan.

627
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,460
Even the Palace knows

628
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,740
about Miss Zhuang Hanyan?

629
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,340
You didn't know this?

630
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,540
Years ago, there were two beauties
in the Capital,

631
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,380
both from distinguished families.

632
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,140
One became the favored
Noble Consort Miao,

633
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,260
while the other became the madam
of the Zhuang family.

634
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,460
They were inseparable like sisters.

635
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,060
It was a well-known story back then.

636
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,420
Mother, you're friends

637
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,660
with a Noble Consort?

638
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,900
Just old friends.

639
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,180
She's in that complicated Palace,

640
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,300
and I've been hidden
in the inner chambers.

641
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,140
We haven't met in a long time.

642
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,700
Xiwen.

643
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,020
Miss Hanyan, congratulations
on your hair pinning.

644
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,300
Thank you, Mr. Yuwen.

645
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,700
I heard

646
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,420
that you were suspended by His Majesty.

647
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,460
I thought

648
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,380
that if you could handle
the Pei faction case,

649
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,420
you'd surely be promoted,

650
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,660
but in the end, I dragged you down.

651
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,340
I've grown tired of the ups

652
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,140
and downs of officialdom.

653
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,660
Taking this opportunity

654
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,180
to leave this place
of strife seems best.

655
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,940
But in the Capital,

656
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,180
there is still someone
I can't let go of.

657
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,820
Mr. Yuwen, are you planning
to leave the Capital?

658
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,660
That's indeed my plan.

659
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,140
Xiwen,

660
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,020
could you help me decide?

661
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,140
This is serious.

662
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,020
How could I make the decision for you?

663
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,500
If you've made up your mind,

664
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:28,060
I'll wish you peace and success
in the future.

665
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,820
Thank you for all your help these years.

666
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,340
Xiwen,

667
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,420
don't you understand my feelings?

668
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,380
I've wasted half my life.

669
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,100
It's too late now.

670
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,220
So what?

671
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,340
You still have a chance to choose.

672
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,300
Mr. Yuwen,

673
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,780
please behave yourself.

674
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,620
I'm sorry.

675
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,900
I must take my leave now.

676
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,260
Mother, are you truly unwilling

677
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,940
to give yourself another chance?

678
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,700
Don't mention this again.

679
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:54,220
(Spirit Tablet of Zhuang Hanliang)

680
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,140
Mr. Fu, why bring me here?

681
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,100
What do you want?

682
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,100
The residence is lively today.

683
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,730
Only the ancestral hall is still quiet.

684
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,500
What do you want to discuss?

685
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,940
Have you and your father

686
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,100
talked again about the adopted son case?

687
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,500
He only said

688
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,980
that the words in prison

689
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,540
were to save the family.

690
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,300
Do you believe that?

691
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,980
I only know

692
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,500
that your mind is full of schemes,

693
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,900
and you often put people's families
in jeopardy.

694
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,460
I can no longer trust you.

695
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,140
When you were unconscious,

696
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:45,220
Zhuang Shiyang was questioned
by the Judicial Review.

697
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,660
He also said it was to save the family.

698
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,700
This is called
the Soul-Settling Incense.

699
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,020
It's rare among common people.

700
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,020
Ordinary families would never use it

701
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,540
to honor their ancestors.

702
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,180
Miss Hanyan, do you know why?

703
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,460
Because it's specifically used

704
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,340
to suppress vengeful spirits.

705
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,900
Light it in front of the spirit tablet,

706
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,900
and it prevents those who died unjustly

707
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,940
from reincarnating or causing trouble.

708
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,660
Mr. Zhuang has been

709
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,900
using it these years to suppress

710
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,820
(Spirit Tablet of Zhuang Hanliang)
your grandfather's spirit.

711
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,760
You were framed as a barefoot ghost

712
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,180
precisely when your grandfather
fell ill.

713
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,820
Do you think these events
are coincidences?

714
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,340
These

715
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,300
are just your speculations.

716
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,900
You're not a fool.

717
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,180
You must have noticed

718
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,260
that Zhuang Shiyang
is definitely not as weak

719
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,780
and simple as he seems.

720
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,020
But you're afraid.

721
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,760
You're afraid to uncover the truth.

722
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,860
If Zhuang Shiyang is Pei's adopted son,

723
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,020
the whole family will be implicated,

724
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,220
and everyone will have to die again,

725
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,180
including

726
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,300
the one you care about most.

727
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,900
But have you thought about it?

728
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,900
The adopted son case
is still unresolved.

729
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,420
After this incident,

730
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,500
the Palace will send more people

731
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,460
to investigate quickly and thoroughly.

732
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,940
If I were you,

733
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,220
I wouldn't avoid it;

734
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,820
I would take the initiative

735
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,940
and find the evidence faster
than the Judicial Review,

736
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,420
the Supervision, and the Palace.

737
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,380
Only then can you

738
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,860
be prepared for the consequences.

739
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,900
What do you mean

740
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,140
by telling me this?

741
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,380
We should cooperate.

742
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,660
What do you mean?

743
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,400
Because of Wu Youzhi's case,

744
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,120
I've been suspended

745
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,140
If you and I work together
to uncover evidence

746
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,740
and send Zhuang Shiyang to prison,

747
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,820
I can earn merits
and restore my position,

748
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,060
and you can take your revenge

749
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,660
without implicating your family.

750
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,940
I know

751
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,460
that my father is somewhat strange,

752
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,980
but do you truly believe
he's the adopted son?

753
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:24,080
Zhuang Shiyang bought
Wu Youzhi's villa three years ago.

754
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,340
Wu Youzhi was a Pei faction member

755
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,500
from Yinan.

756
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,540
Could all of this be a coincidence?

757
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:33,700
Or what?

758
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,880
Though both your father
and grandfather are officials,

759
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,620
you're not a family of great wealth.

760
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,260
Three years ago,
Zhuang Shiyang spent a lot

761
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,980
on this luxurious residence.

762
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,740
He must have had plans from the start.

763
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,340
If the secret passage

764
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,700
is ever exposed in the future,

765
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,700
everything can be blamed on Wu Youzhi.

766
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:50,980
Even

767
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,580
when they recruited that foolish Duke

768
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,980
into the Zuohang Gang,

769
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,620
they must have intended to use him

770
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:59,340
as a shield and a scapegoat
for the adopted son.

771
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,220
Do you really think

772
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,620
my father

773
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,420
could have such a cunning plan?

774
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,420
To be taken as an adopted son
by Pei Dafu,

775
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,180
he's certainly no ordinary person.

776
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,740
I'm just a woman
from the inner chambers.

777
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,940
Why must you involve me?

778
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,860
You saw through the plans
I've laid out for so long.

779
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,140
You're no ordinary woman
from the inner chambers.

780
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,580
Besides, you're the lineal daughter

781
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,540
favored by Zhuang Shiyang now,

782
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,700
so you're my first choice.

783
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,140
He is still my father.

784
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,300
Do you think

785
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,060
I would agree to your proposal?

786
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,340
That will depend on how you decide.

787
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,140
I can say no more.

Miss, why have you hidden here?

Ms. Zhou is looking for you,

794

saying she'll give you
the household keys.

and the ledgers.

If there's anything you need help with,

801
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,820
just let me know.

802
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,660
I won't be polite, then.

803
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,260
I was just about
to ask you for Nanny Tao.

804
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,020
I've heard Nanny Tao
is loyal and capable.

805
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,860
I've always noticed that.

806
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,660
Ms. Zhou, are you willing
to part with her?

807
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,900
Ms. Zhou,

808
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,180
save me.

809
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,620
If I fall into Miss Hanyan's hands,

810
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,820
how will I survive?

811
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,780
Ms. Zhou, save me.

Miss Hanyan choosing you

813
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,100
is your blessing.

814
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,980
We are both servants.

815
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,100
Now that Miss Hanyan is in charge,

816
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,460
what Miss Hanyan says goes.

817
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,180
Nanny Tao, you must be joking.

818
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,140
I won't sell you off.

819
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:07,860

820
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,740
what's your plan for me?

821
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,660
How about you go to Jianjia Chamber

822
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,540

823
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:21,180

826

Save me.

827
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,540
Ms. Zhou, save me.

828
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,980
Thank you, Ms. Zhou.

829

830
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,820

Miss Hanyan.

832
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,140
Is there anything else?

833
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,820
Yuchi is young and inexperienced.

834
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,060
After this incident,

835
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,540
he won't be presumptuous anymore.

836
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:06,060
From now on, I will teach him properly.

837
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:08,860
Now, in this vast residence,

838
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,900
you're in charge of everything.

839
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:13,750
I hope you will show magnanimity.

840

You need not worry.

844
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:22,540
Yes, yes.

845
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,340
I shouldn't have said that.

846
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,340
This is a rare wild ginseng.

847
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,860
Go send it to Yuzhu Manor.

850
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,020
Yes, I will go right now.

851
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,340
You fool.

852
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,820
If you want to go, go yourself.

853
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,180
I can't be bothered to please her.

854
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:49,540
Come on.

Can't you understand?

to support me,

858
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,140
I'm not afraid of her.

We can't defeat her now.

862
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,580
We have to lie low for now

863
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,100
and wait for the right moment.

864
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,060
Yes.

865

866
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,980
but Father was never
that old eunuch's adopted son.

867
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,940
Shut up.

868
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,420
Both of you remember:

869
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,300
Never bring up
the adopted son matter again,

870
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,420
especially

871
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,180
not in front of your father.

872
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:32,020

877
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,700
is not without reason.

how she's been running wild over us.

880
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,140
Just endure it.

881
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,700
Right now, she's above us.

882
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:06,980
Why bother fighting a losing battle?

in the Capital

884

to deal with her.
